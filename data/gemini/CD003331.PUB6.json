    "output": "Can rehabilitation programs that include exercise help adults with heart failure?\n\nKey messages\n- For adults with heart failure, exercise-based rehabilitation programs (programs to help people recover) probably reduce how often people go to the hospital. These programs may also importantly improve their quality of life (a measure of well-being). We found no evidence that these programs lowered the risk of dying within 1 year. The review did not report on unwanted or harmful effects.\n- People benefited similarly whether the program was in a hospital or at home. The benefits were also similar for exercise-only programs and for programs that were part of a more complete plan.\n- Future studies should include more older people, women, and people with a type of heart failure where the heart is too stiff to fill properly (HFpEF). So far, studies have not included many people from these groups.\n\nWhat is heart failure and how can exercise help?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood around the body as well as it should. This can leave people feeling tired and short of breath. It can reduce their quality of life and increase their risk of going to the hospital or dying. Exercise-based cardiac (heart) rehabilitation is a program of physical activity to help people with heart conditions improve their health.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation affects adults with heart failure. We looked at how it affects the risk of dying, how often people go to the hospital, and their quality of life.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared exercise programs to no exercise for adults with heart failure. We combined the findings from the studies to see the effects on death, hospital stays, and quality of life. We also rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 60 studies with 8728 adults with heart failure. The studies followed people for a median (the middle value) of 6 months. Most people in the studies had a type of heart failure where the heart muscle is weak (HFrEF). Researchers also grouped them as having moderate symptoms using a standard scale (New York Heart Association classes II and III). We noted that the studies did not include many women, older people, or people with the type of heart failure where the heart is stiff (HFpEF). The studies tested exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs. We compared these to a control group (a group used for comparison) that did not exercise and received usual care (the standard care a provider gives).\n\nMain results\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably lowers the risk that they will go to the hospital for any reason. It also probably leads to an important improvement in their quality of life. For every 100 people who get usual care without a formal exercise program, about 24 go to the hospital within a year. This number probably falls to about 16 for every 100 people who take part in exercise rehabilitation. The rehabilitation may not change the risk of dying from any cause within 12 months.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe are only moderately (medium) confident in the evidence. This is because the studies did not include all the kinds of people we were interested in. Also, for some outcomes, we do not have enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nEvidence currency statement\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021."
