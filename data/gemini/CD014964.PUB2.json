    "output": "Ultrasound guidance for anaesthesia in the back in adults\n\nKey messages\n- For adults receiving anaesthesia in the back (a procedure called neuraxial anaesthesia), using ultrasound to guide the needle reduces the number of attempts needed and the time the procedure takes.\n- Ultrasound guidance probably increases the chance of success on the first try.\n- We need more research to understand the effects of ultrasound guidance on patient satisfaction, pain during the procedure, and other unwanted effects (harmful effects of a treatment).\n\nWhat is neuraxial anaesthesia?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief, such as an epidural during childbirth or a spinal block for surgery. It involves injecting medicine into the space around the spinal cord. To do this, doctors traditionally feel for bones in the back to guide the needle. These points on the body are called 'anatomical landmarks'.\n\nThis can be difficult because the exact location of the spinal cord space varies from person to person. Unsuccessful attempts can mean more needle pokes for the patient. This can lead to discomfort and complications (harmful effects). Using an ultrasound machine (which uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of the body) may help doctors guide the needle more accurately and improve success rates.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ultrasound to guide the needle for neuraxial anaesthesia is more effective and safer than using anatomical landmarks in adults. We were interested in whether ultrasound guidance could:\n- increase the chance of success on the first try;\n- reduce the number of attempts needed;\n- shorten the procedure time; and\n- improve patient satisfaction.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using ultrasound to guide anaesthetic (pain-preventing medicine) injections in the back versus using physical touch to find the right spot. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies with a total of 6823 adult participants. The studies took place in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania.\n- 32 studies focused on pregnant patients or those giving birth (obstetric populations) who were having an epidural for labour or a caesarean section (a surgical operation to deliver a baby).\n- The other studies involved people having surgery with neuraxial anaesthesia.\n\nCompared to using anatomical landmarks, we found that using ultrasound to guide the needle for anaesthesia in the back in adults:\n- reduces the number of attempts needed to place the needle and reduces the time the procedure takes.\n- probably increases the chance of the needle being placed successfully on the first try.\n- may make little to no difference to how satisfied people are with the procedure or to the chances of the procedure failing for technical reasons.\n\nWe are very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound guidance on pain during the procedure or on other unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate. This is because the studies were done in different types of people, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results for some outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023."
