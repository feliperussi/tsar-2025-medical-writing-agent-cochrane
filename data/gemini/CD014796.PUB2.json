    "output": "What are the views of patients, healthcare providers, and health planners on general health checks?\n\nKey messages\n- Patients, healthcare providers, and health planners mostly feel positive about general health checks. These are appointments using several tests to check the health of people without symptoms. Patients felt the checks helped them live healthier and reassured them. But some did not go because they were afraid of bad results or worried about time and cost.\n- To make health checks work well, providers said they needed skilled staff, enough time, and resources. Patients and providers agreed that clear information about the checks and good explanations of the results were essential.\n- It is still not clear why health planners start these health checks. Because the checks are popular, future studies should look at how to improve them and what else could be offered, rather than just if they should be stopped.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat are general health checks and why do they cause disagreement?\nGeneral health checks are for adults who do not have any symptoms (signs of illness). They use tests to check a person's overall health and find possible health problems early. The goal is to stop future illness and reduce deaths from preventable diseases. But a past Cochrane Review (a high-quality summary of medical research) found these checks have little or no effect on preventing death or serious problems like heart disease. This raises the question of why these checks are still so common.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand the views and experiences of different groups involved with general health checks. These groups included people who get health checks (clients), providers who deliver them, and health planners who organize and fund them. We wanted to find the factors that affect how health checks are planned, delivered, and used.\n\nMethods\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies on the views and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and health planners with general health checks. We combined the findings from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 146 studies, and we selected 36 for our analysis (a close look at the results). Most studies were from high-income countries in Europe. Nearly a third were from middle-income countries in Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The studies explored the views of clients, healthcare providers, and managers. The health checks had to include screening (checking for disease in people without symptoms) for at least 2 diseases or risk factors (anything that increases the chance of getting a disease).\n\nWhat influences people's decision to get a health check?\nPeople's beliefs about illness, risk (chance), and prevention (action to lower the chance of getting a disease) influence their decision to go to a health check. For those who go, the checks probably help them make healthy life changes and reassure them about their health. Encouragement from a provider also probably helps. But people are less likely to go if they are afraid of bad news or prefer to see a doctor only when they feel sick. Practical issues like time, trouble getting an appointment, and cost also likely stop people from going.\n\nWhat makes a good health check?\nIt is important to people that providers giving the checks are skilled and understand their culture. People getting checks may want many tests, while providers may think it is better to fit the checks to each person's own health risks. For providers, problems like lack of time, not enough staff, and limited resources likely make it hard to give good health checks.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. This is because the studies included different types of people, and there were not enough studies for us to be certain about all of the results.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nWe searched for evidence up to August 2022."
