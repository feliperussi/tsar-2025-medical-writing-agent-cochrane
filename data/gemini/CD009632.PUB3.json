    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of adding a breast ultrasound to a mammogram for breast cancer screening in women at average risk?\n\nKey messages\n- For women with an average risk of breast cancer, adding a breast ultrasound to a mammogram helps find more cancers. But, combining the tests also means more women are wrongly told they might have cancer. This is called a false-positive result. It can lead to women having a small piece of breast tissue removed for testing when it is not needed (an unnecessary biopsy).\n- We do not know if finding these extra cancers by adding an ultrasound saves lives. Future studies need to look at the long-term effects on health.\n\nWhy combine mammograms with ultrasound for breast cancer screening?\nScreening for breast cancer helps find the disease early, when it is easier to treat. Doctors most often use a mammogram, which is a special X-ray of the breast, to screen for cancer. Sometimes, a mammogram might miss a cancer. This is called a 'false-negative' result. Some experts believe that adding an ultrasound scan, which uses sound waves to create pictures, could help find more cancers.\n\nBut, other experts worry that combining the tests could also lead to more 'false alarms'. This is a 'false-positive' result, where a test suggests cancer is present when it is not. This can cause worry and lead to tests that are not needed, like a biopsy. A biopsy is when a small sample of tissue is removed for testing.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to learn about the good and bad effects of using a mammogram and an ultrasound together for breast cancer screening, compared to using a mammogram by itself. We focused on women who have an average risk of breast cancer.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared screening with a mammogram and an ultrasound together against screening with a mammogram alone for women with average risk. We then put the results together and used a standard way to rate how sure we are about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that included a total of 209,207 women. The studies followed the women for 1 to 3 years. The women in the studies were between 40 and 75 years old and had an average risk for breast cancer. In the studies, between 48% and 100% of the women had dense breasts. Dense breasts have more supportive tissue than fat, which can make it harder to see cancer on a mammogram.\n\nNone of the studies checked if combining the screening tests lowered the number of deaths from breast cancer or any other cause.\n\nMain results\nAdding an ultrasound to a mammogram finds more breast cancers.\n- For every 1000 women who are screened, combining the tests finds 2 more breast cancers than using a mammogram alone.\n- It also lowers the number of cancers found between regular screenings.\n- It probably lowers the number of women found with cancer that has spread to their lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small glands that are part of the body's immune system.\n\nBut, adding an ultrasound also leads to more false alarms and biopsies.\n- For every 1000 women who do not have cancer, 37 more will get a false-positive result.\n- For every 1000 women who are screened, 27 more will have a biopsy.\n\nFor women with dense breasts, adding an ultrasound finds more breast cancers. For women with non-dense breasts, adding an ultrasound may make little to no difference in the number of cancers found.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have some confidence in the evidence. We are not highly confident because the studies did not report if adding an ultrasound to screening saved more lives. Also, in some studies, the researchers did not assign people to the screening groups by chance. This means that differences between the groups could be because the people in them were different, not because of the screening tests they had.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to May 2021."
