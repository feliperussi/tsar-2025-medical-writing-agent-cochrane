    "output": "Is personalized nutrition (diet advice based on personal information like genes or lifestyle) better than standard advice for helping children and teenagers with obesity?\n\n**Key messages**\n- It is uncertain whether personalized diet advice (diet plans based on personal information like genes or lifestyle) is better than standard advice for helping children and teenagers with obesity. This is because there was not enough good-quality evidence from the 2 small studies that were found. The studies did not report on any unwanted effects.\n- Larger and better-designed studies are needed to find out if this type of personalized advice works. Future research should also measure effects on mental and emotional well-being, in addition to physical health.\n\n**What is precision nutrition for managing obesity in children and adolescents?**\nObesity, which is having an unhealthy amount of body fat, is a significant health concern in children and adolescents. Standard dietary advice often takes a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, where the same recommendations are given to everyone. Precision nutrition is a newer, more personalized approach. It aims to create tailored diet plans by considering factors that make each person different. These factors can include a person's genetics, lifestyle, health status, and even the types of bacteria living in their gut (gut microbiome). The goal is to find the most effective dietary advice for each individual.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to find out if these personalized, precision nutrition-based plans are better than standard 'one-size-fits-all' advice for managing obesity in children and adolescents up to 19 years old. We were interested in the effects on weight and overall well-being.\n\n**What did we do?**\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly put into 1 of 2 or more treatment groups) that compared personalized nutrition advice against general advice for children and adolescents with obesity. We compared and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nThe review included 2 small studies with a total of 105 children and adolescents with overweight (weighing more than is healthy for one’s height) or obesity. For children and adolescents with these conditions, we do not know if nutrition advice tailored to the individual (precision nutrition) has an effect on body weight or body mass index (BMI), a measure that relates body weight to height, when compared with general 'one-size-fits-all' advice.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024."
