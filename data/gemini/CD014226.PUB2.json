    "output": "Is fenestrated endovascular repair (a stent-graft with openings for other arteries) a better treatment than open surgery or no surgery for complex bulges in the main artery in the abdomen (abdominal aortic aneurysms)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found no reliable studies comparing a special stent-graft with openings for other arteries (fenestrated endovascular repair) with open surgery or no surgery for treating complex bulges in the main artery in the abdomen.\n- Because of the lack of studies, the benefits and potential harms of this procedure are unknown.\n- We need high-quality studies to find out which treatment is best for this condition.\n\nWhat is a complex abdominal aortic aneurysm?\nThe aorta is the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulge in the part of the aorta that runs through the abdomen. This bulge is called a 'complex' AAA when it is very close to the arteries that supply blood to the kidneys. This location can make it more difficult to repair. The best way to treat these complex AAAs is not known. One option is a procedure called fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR). This procedure uses a special tube (a stent-graft) with small, custom-made openings to repair the aneurysm. The openings help keep blood flowing to the kidneys.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and harms of FEVAR with traditional open surgery or no surgery (conservative management) for people with complex AAAs.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared FEVAR with open surgical repair or no surgery. We planned to combine and summarize the results. We also planned to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked for studies where people were randomly assigned to a treatment group (randomised controlled trials). We compared FEVAR with either open surgical repair or conservative (non-operative) management in adults with complex AAAs. We found no studies to include in this review.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. There are no studies, so we cannot be certain about the results for our outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
