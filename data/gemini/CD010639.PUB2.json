    "output": "Can changing shift work schedules improve sleep and reduce sleepiness in shift workers?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Limiting work shifts to a maximum of 16 hours may help shift workers get more sleep and feel less sleepy. For other types of schedule changes, such as the direction of shift rotation or how quickly the schedule changes, we are very uncertain about their effects on sleep or sleepiness.\n- We need more high-quality studies to understand the best ways to schedule shifts to improve sleep and reduce sleepiness for workers. The evidence for most changes is very limited.\n\n**What is shift work?**\nMany people work in shifts outside of typical daytime hours. This is known as shift work. Working in shifts can disrupt a person's sleep, leading to not getting enough good-quality sleep. When workers are tired and less alert, it can increase the chance of health and safety problems at work. Changing work schedules is one possible way to improve this.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to find out what effects different types of shift schedules have on the sleep of shift workers. We were interested in how schedule changes affected sleep quality, sleep duration (how long people sleep), and sleepiness (how tired people feel).\n\n**What did we do?**\nWe searched for studies that looked at how changing shift work schedules affected workers' sleep. We then combined and summarized the findings from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 11 studies with a total of 2125 shift workers. The studies looked at several types of changes to shift schedules.\n\nRegarding shift rotation, changing from a backward to a forward rotation may lower sleepiness during shifts. However, it may have little to no effect on sleep quality or how long workers sleep. Faster shift rotations may make little to no difference to sleep quality. They may also lower how long workers sleep and decrease sleepiness, but we are very uncertain about these findings.\n\nRegarding shift duration, limiting shifts to 16 hours may increase how long workers sleep. It also probably lowers sleepiness slightly. Other changes, like using shorter versus longer shifts or making the work schedule more or less compressed, may have little to no effect on sleep or sleepiness. We are very uncertain about these findings.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because in the studies we found, people were not assigned to the different schedule groups by chance. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between the people rather than the schedule changes. Also, the studies were very small and looked at different types of schedule changes, so there is not enough evidence to be certain about the findings.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\nThis review includes evidence published up to April 2022."
