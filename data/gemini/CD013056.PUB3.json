    "output": "Are antibiotics or antiseptic ear drops better for treating a long-term middle ear infection with discharge (chronic suppurative otitis media)?\n\nKey messages\n- When treating a long-term middle ear infection, one type of antibiotic ear drop (quinolone antibiotics) is likely better at stopping ear discharge within 2 weeks than one type of antiseptic ear drop (boric acid, a mild antiseptic).\n- For other types of antibiotics and antiseptics, we are not sure which is more effective. Side effects of the treatments were not well reported in the studies.\n- More high-quality research is needed to find out the benefits and harms of these treatments. Future studies should also measure how treatment affects people's quality of life (how they feel and function day to day).\n\nWhat is a long-term middle ear infection?\nA long-term middle ear infection with discharge (chronic suppurative otitis media) is when the middle ear is infected for a long time. This happens through a hole in the eardrum. The main symptoms are ear discharge ('runny ear') that does not go away and losing some hearing.\n\nGerms (tiny living things) cause the infection. Treatments try to kill the germs or stop them from growing. These treatments include antibiotics and antiseptics. Antibiotics can be put directly into the ear as drops or taken by mouth or injection to affect the whole body. Antiseptics are liquids that stop germs from growing and are always put directly into the ear.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and harms of using antibiotics versus antiseptics to treat people with a long-term middle ear infection with discharge.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared antibiotics with antiseptics for people with this condition. We then summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 15 studies with a total of 2371 people, including adults and children. The studies compared different types of antibiotics against various antiseptics put directly into the ear. These antiseptics included acetic acid (an acid found in vinegar), boric acid, and povidone-iodine (a common antiseptic liquid).\n\nThe studies followed people for at least 1 week. None of the studies reported on health-related quality of life.\n\nMain results\n- Quinolone antibiotics versus boric acid: Using antibiotic ear drops (quinolones) probably helps clear up ear discharge more than using boric acid ear drops (a mild antiseptic). For every 4 people treated with these antibiotic drops instead of boric acid, 1 extra person's ear discharge will likely clear up within 2 weeks. These antibiotic drops may also cause less ear pain and may slightly improve hearing compared to boric acid.\n\n- Other antibiotics and antiseptics: For other comparisons, we do not know if one works better than the other to stop ear discharge. For example, acetic acid may stop discharge better than one type of antibiotic (aminoglycosides), but may make little to no difference to hearing compared to another (quinolones). It is unclear if there are differences in side effects like ear pain or hearing problems for most of these treatments because the evidence was not clear enough.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not very confident in the evidence. This is because there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results, and the studies we found were very small. The studies also did not report on everything we wanted to know.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2022."
