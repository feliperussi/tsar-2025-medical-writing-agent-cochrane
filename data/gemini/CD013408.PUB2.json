    "output": "Are specialized care programs better than usual care for adults with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat)?\n\nKey messages\n- For adults with an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation), specialized care programs likely reduce the risk of death from any cause and reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems compared to the care a provider would normally give (usual care).\n- These programs may make little to no difference to the risk of stroke (a loss of blood flow to the brain) or major bleeding.\n- While specialized care programs reduce hospital stays for heart-related reasons, they probably do not reduce the total number of hospital stays for any reason.\n- We need more research to compare different types of specialized care programs, including those that use mobile health technology (apps and other digital tools). Future studies should be large enough to provide more certain results.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation?\nAtrial fibrillation is a common heart condition that causes an irregular heart rhythm. Because managing it can be complex, healthcare providers are looking for the best ways to deliver care. In this review, we looked at different ways to organize care, such as services that a team of healthcare professionals from different specialties (multidisciplinary care) leads or services that use technology like health apps.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if these organized ways to provide care are more effective than the standard care people usually receive (usual care).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways to organize clinical services for people with atrial fibrillation against usual care. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies with 8205 adults diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. The studies took place in China, the Netherlands, and Australia, and the people in them were, on average, between 60 and 73 years old. The studies examined organized clinical services, such as nurse-led multidisciplinary teams or programs that used mobile health (mHealth) to manage the condition, and compared them to usual care.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nCompared to usual care, organized clinical services for people with atrial fibrillation:\n- probably greatly reduce death from any cause. For every 37 people who receive organized care for 6 years, we may prevent 1 death.\n- reduce hospital stays for heart-related causes. For every 28 people who receive organized care for 6 years, we may prevent 1 hospital stay.\n- probably make little to no difference to hospital stays for any cause.\n- may make little to no difference to death from heart-related causes.\n- may make little to no difference to harmful effects of the disease (complications) like stroke or major bleeding events in the brain.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Also, we did not find enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023."
