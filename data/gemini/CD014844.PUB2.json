    "output": "Can antibiotics help prevent infection for women who have a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the womb (uterine evacuation) after a miscarriage?\n\nKey messages\n\n- Giving antibiotics before a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the womb after a miscarriage may reduce the risk of infection.\n- These preventative antibiotics probably have little to no effect on the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea. We are uncertain about other possible harms, like allergic reactions.\n- Our confidence in these results is limited because of weaknesses in the studies we found. We need more high-quality research on this topic.\n\nWhat is the issue?\n\nWhen a woman has a miscarriage (an unexpected loss of pregnancy before the 20th week), she may need a procedure to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from her womb (uterus). A key risk of this procedure is developing an infection. Doctors know that women who already have an infection need treatment with antibiotics (drugs that treat infections caused by bacteria). However, it is not clear if women *without* signs of infection should be given antibiotics before the procedure to prevent one from starting. This preventative use of medicine is called 'prophylaxis'.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if giving preventative antibiotics to women having a procedure for miscarriage reduces their risk of infection. We also wanted to know if this treatment caused any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared preventative antibiotics with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment in women having a procedure for a miscarriage. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 6 studies that included a total of 4371 women having a procedure to manage a miscarriage. The women in the studies did not have any signs of an existing infection. The studies compared giving preventative antibiotics with giving a placebo or no treatment.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n\nFor women having a procedure after a miscarriage, giving antibiotics beforehand reduces the risk of infection of the womb. The antibiotics probably make little to no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea. We are very uncertain if antibiotics affect the risk of allergy, the need for more antibiotic treatment, or the need to be admitted to hospital.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\n\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. Some studies had weaknesses in their methods, such as women not taking the antibiotics as instructed (an issue known as non-compliance). Also, not all studies provided information on all the outcomes we were interested in. The studies were also different from each other, and there were not enough of them for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis evidence is up to date to October 2023."
