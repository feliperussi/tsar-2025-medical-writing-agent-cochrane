    "output": "What can be done to reduce physical restraints for older people in long-term care?\n\nKey messages\n- Making changes to a care home's policies (rules) and culture probably reduces how often physical restraints (like belts or bedrails) are used, especially belts. These changes do not seem to affect how often people fall or get injured from falls.\n- We are uncertain if simpler methods, like staff education alone or giving information about a resident's risk (chance) of falling, reduce the use of physical restraints. This is because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\n- All the studies in this review took place in long-term care homes. Future research is needed to see what works to reduce physical restraint use for older people who get care in their own homes.\n\nWhy is it important to reduce the use of physical restraints?\nPhysical restraints are things like belts or bedrails used to stop a person from moving freely. They are often used for older people in long-term care, such as nursing homes. Even though they are common, evidence shows physical restraints are often not effective (how well a treatment works) or safe. Because of this, experts recommend avoiding their use as much as possible.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nIn this Cochrane Review, we wanted to find out how different programmes, or interventions (actions to improve health), prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that tested different ways to prevent or reduce using physical restraints for older people in long-term care. We then compared and summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies with 19,003 older people in long-term care homes. The average age was 85 years, and all studies included people with dementia (a condition where a person loses the ability to think and remember). The studies looked at 3 types of interventions to reduce physical restraint use. We found no studies that looked at this for older people getting care in their own homes.\n\nFor older people in long-term care homes, changes in how care homes are run to bring in a 'least-restraint' policy probably lead to fewer residents being physically restrained. These changes also probably largely reduce the number of residents restrained with a belt. These changes probably do not change the number of residents who are given medications that affect their mental state. They may also not change the number of falls or injuries from falls.\n\nIt is unclear if simple staff education programmes change how many residents are physically restrained. Also, giving staff information about a resident's risk of falling may make little to no difference.\n\nWhat are the problems with the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate to low. This is because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, not all studies provided data (information from research) on all the outcomes we were interested in. Some studies were very small and their results were different from each other. Finally, the evidence does not cover all the people we were interested in, as we found no studies about people getting care at home.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022."
