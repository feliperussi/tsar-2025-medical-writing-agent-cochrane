    "output": "Can taking colchicine (an anti-inflammatory medicine) prevent heart attacks and strokes in people who have not had them before?\n\nKey messages\n- We are very uncertain if taking colchicine, an anti-inflammatory medicine, helps to prevent heart attacks and strokes in people who have not had them before.\n- Colchicine may increase the risk of diarrhoea.\n- The evidence is unclear because the available studies were small and had problems with their methods. Also, many studies included people with specific health conditions, so the findings may not apply to everyone. We need larger, well-designed studies to be sure.\n\nWhat is this review about?\nDiseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular diseases) are a major cause of death worldwide. A common cause is the build-up of fatty deposits in the walls of arteries (the large blood vessels that carry blood from the heart). This build-up can lead to serious events like heart attacks and strokes. Long-term swelling and redness in the body (inflammation) can make this build-up worse.\n\nColchicine is an inexpensive medicine that reduces inflammation. Researchers are interested in whether it could be used for 'primary prevention'. This means stopping heart and blood vessel disease from developing in people who do not already have it.\n\nWe wanted to find out if taking colchicine is a safe and effective way to prevent events like heart attacks and strokes in people who have not had them before. We looked at both the benefits and any unwanted effects (harms).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared colchicine with a placebo (a dummy treatment), other medicines, or the usual care people receive. The people in the studies did not already have heart disease. We then compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 15 studies, known as randomised controlled trials, with a total of 1721 people. In these studies, people were assigned to treatment groups by chance, which helps ensure the results are fair. The studies monitored people for 4 to 728 weeks.\n\nThe studies included adults without existing heart or blood vessel disease, but many focused on people with liver disease. The studies compared taking colchicine by mouth against a placebo, other medicines that change the immune system, or the care people would normally receive.\n\nWe did not find any studies that looked at specific conditions such as:\n- extra fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion);\n- narrowed arteries in the limbs (peripheral artery disease);\n- the heart not pumping blood well (heart failure);\n- or sudden chest pain (unstable angina).\n\nOverall, the evidence about the effects of colchicine for preventing heart attacks or strokes in people who have not had them before is very uncertain. The studies had major limitations, which means we cannot be sure about the results.\n\nColchicine compared to a placebo (a dummy pill)\nWe are very uncertain about the effects of colchicine. It may reduce death from any cause and may have little to no effect on the risk of heart attack or stroke. However, it may increase the risk of diarrhoea. For every 10 people who took colchicine, it is possible that 1 extra person had diarrhoea compared to those who took a placebo. We do not know if colchicine affects the number of deaths from heart-related causes.\n\nColchicine compared to usual care or no treatment\nWe do not know if colchicine has an effect on death from any cause when compared to usual care. It may increase the risk of diarrhoea, but we are very uncertain about this result. For every 18 people who took colchicine, it is possible that 1 extra person had diarrhoea.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. The studies were very small and there were not enough of them to be certain about the results. Not all studies provided information on everything we were interested in. Also, the evidence focused on specific groups of people, so the results may not apply to the general population.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023."
