    "output": "For babies who are fed formula, what are the effects of different amounts of protein on their growth and health?\n\nKey messages\n- We are unsure if feeding babies formula with higher or lower amounts of protein affects their growth. This is due to a lack of strong evidence. We don't know if it changes whether a baby becomes underweight (weighing less than is healthy) or overweight (weighing more than is healthy).\n- There may be little or no difference in the chance of unwanted effects like diarrhea (frequent, watery bowel movements) or vomiting.\n- We need more and better studies to understand the long-term effects of different protein levels in infant formula.\n\nWhy is the amount of protein in infant formula important?\nMany babies are fed infant formula to help them grow. These formulas contain different amounts of nutrients, including protein (molecules needed for the body to function). Some formulas have higher protein to help babies gain weight more quickly. However, we are not sure about the balance of benefits (helpful effects) and harms (unwanted effects) of these high-protein formulas compared to lower-protein ones.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the effects of different protein levels in formula for healthy babies born at full term (between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy). We looked for research that compared the benefits and harms of feeding babies formula with higher protein versus lower protein.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared infant formulas with different protein levels for healthy, full-term babies. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 11 studies with 1885 healthy, full-term infants. The studies took place in high-income countries and followed the babies for up to 11 years. 7 studies compared high-protein formula with standard-protein formula. 4 studies compared standard-protein formula with low-protein formula.\n\nWhen comparing high-protein formula to standard-protein formula, we are very uncertain if it has any effect on growth problems in the first year, such as being underweight. We are also very uncertain if it affects the chances of a child becoming overweight or obese (having an unhealthy amount of body fat) later on.\n\nUsing a high-protein formula may make little to no difference to the chance of side effects. These can include diarrhea, vomiting, or milk hypersensitivity (an exaggerated immune system response to milk).\n\nSimilarly, when comparing standard-protein formula to low-protein formula, we are very uncertain if it affects a baby's growth in the first year. It may also make little to no difference to the chance of side effects.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. There were not enough studies to be certain about the results. The available studies were very small and were done in different ways.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to October 2022."
