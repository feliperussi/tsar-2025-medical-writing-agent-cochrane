    "output": "Lying face-down after surgery for a detached retina\n\nKey messages\n\n- After surgery for a detached retina (when the eye's light-sensitive layer pulls away), lying face-down may help the eye heal properly.\n- This position may lower the chance of the retina healing in the wrong place, developing folds, or of people seeing double. However, it may increase pressure inside the eye.\n- We need more, high-quality studies to be sure about the benefits and harms of this position.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is a detached retina?\nA detached retina is a serious problem where the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye pulls away. If it affects the macula (the part of the eye for sharp, central vision), it is an emergency that can cause severe vision loss.\n\nSurgery is a common treatment. A surgeon may perform a vitrectomy, where they place a gas bubble in the eye. The bubble holds the retina in place as it heals. Sometimes, the retina heals in the wrong position (retinal displacement). This can cause distorted or double vision. To prevent this, surgeons may tell patients to lie face-down after the operation.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if lying face-down after surgery is better than other positions. We looked at whether this position reduces the risk of the retina healing in the wrong place.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that randomly assigned people to lie face-down or in another position after surgery. We then compared and combined the results from these studies.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies with 368 people (369 eyes). The studies followed people for up to 6 months.\n\nLying face-down after surgery may work better than other positions. It may lower the risk of:\n- the retina healing in the wrong position;\n- folds forming on the retina; and\n- seeing double.\n\nHowever, lying face-down may increase the risk of high pressure inside the eye.\n\nThe position may have little to no effect on sharpness of vision, distorted vision, or quality of life. We are very uncertain about these findings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there were only a few small studies. We need more research to be certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is current to November 2022."
