    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of drug treatments for myotonia (a condition that causes muscle stiffness)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with non-dystrophic myotonia (a type of muscle stiffness), the drugs mexiletine and lamotrigine likely lessen stiffness and may improve their quality of life (how they feel and manage daily life). For people with myotonic dystrophy, another type of myotonia, the evidence for benefit is less clear. Both drugs can cause unwanted effects, like stomach problems, tiredness, and headaches.\n- For several other drugs studied for myotonia, we could not be certain if they were helpful or harmful because there was not enough good evidence.\n- Future research should look into why some people do not get better with treatment and test other new drugs. Researchers also need better ways to design studies for rare diseases to give clearer answers for patients.\n\nWhat is myotonia?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing after they have been used (for example, after making a fist). This can cause symptoms like stiffness, cramps, pain, and fatigue (an extreme sense of tiredness). These symptoms can make daily life hard. Myotonia is the main symptom of a group of genetic (to do with genes) conditions. The 2 main types are myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonia. Myotonic dystrophy also causes other problems in the body, like muscle weakness and irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias). Non-dystrophic myotonia mainly causes muscle stiffness. Different medicines are sometimes used to help lessen these muscle problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to look at the evidence from clinical trials (research studies with patients) to find out how well different medicines work for treating myotonia symptoms in people with these muscle conditions. We also wanted to know if these medicines cause any unwanted side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are assigned to different treatments by chance. The studies we looked for tested drug treatments for myotonia against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another drug. We compared and combined the findings and judged how certain we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 randomized controlled trials with a total of 392 people. Of these people, 219 had myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 had non-dystrophic myotonia. The studies looked at several drug treatments, including mexiletine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, imipramine, and taurine, and compared them against a placebo.\n\nMain findings\nOur main findings were for 2 drugs: mexiletine and lamotrigine.\n\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy:\n- Mexiletine probably lessens the time it takes for hand grip muscles to relax compared to a placebo. However, it may make little to no difference to their quality of life (how they feel day to day).\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia:\n- Mexiletine probably lessens muscle stiffness and improves hand grip strength. It may also improve their quality of life. However, it probably makes little to no difference in the time it takes for eye or hand muscles to relax.\n- Lamotrigine probably improves quality of life and may improve the time it takes for hand and eyelid muscles to relax.\n\nUnwanted effects:\n- Both mexiletine and lamotrigine may cause more unwanted effects than a placebo. These can include stomach problems, tiredness, headache, or a rash (a change in the skin's color or texture).\n\nFor the other drugs we studied, we are not sure if they affect myotonia.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe are only moderately sure of our findings. This is because most of the studies were very small. In some of the older studies, it is also possible that people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous version. The evidence is up to date to March 2023."
