    "output": "Can using a device to blow air through the nose (autoinflation) help clear 'glue ear' (fluid in the middle ear) in children?\n\nKey messages\n\nUsing a device to blow air through the nose (autoinflation) may slightly improve glue ear symptoms and a child's overall enjoyment of life (quality of life) in the short term. However, we are uncertain if it helps hearing return to normal, and it may cause ear pain.\nWe have little confidence in these results because the evidence is of low quality and only looked at what happens in the short term. We need better studies that follow children for longer to understand how this treatment truly helps or harms them.\n\nWhat is glue ear?\n\nGlue ear (the medical term is otitis media with effusion) is a common condition in young children. It happens when the middle ear fills with fluid. This fluid can make a child lose some hearing. If the problem does not go away, it can sometimes affect how a child behaves or how their speech develops.\nOne way to treat this is with autoinflation. The child uses a special device, like a nasal balloon, to blow air through their nose. This creates pressure that can help open the small tube connecting the middle ear to the back of the nose (the Eustachian tube). Opening this tube may help the fluid drain away.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if autoinflation works well for children with glue ear. We looked to see if it improved hearing and quality of life. We also looked for possible harms, such as ear pain, when we compared it to providing no treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared what happened when children used autoinflation versus when they had no treatment. We then compared and summarized the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 11 studies with a total of 1036 children with glue ear. Most children were between 3 and 11 years old. The studies took place in Europe and North America. All studies compared what happened when children used various autoinflation devices versus when they had no treatment. In most studies, children used the treatment for 2 to 12 weeks. The studies measured the results shortly after the treatment finished.\nThe evidence is not strong, so we are not certain how autoinflation affects children with glue ear. The treatment may improve a child's quality of life related to their ear problems. It may also slightly reduce the number of children who still have glue ear after 3 months. For every 12 children who use autoinflation, 1 extra child may no longer have fluid in their ear. However, we do not know if autoinflation helps hearing return to normal, or if it increases the risk of ear pain.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. There were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies we found were very small.\n\nEvidence currency statement\n\nThis evidence is up to date to January 2023."
