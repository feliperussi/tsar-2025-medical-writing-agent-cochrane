    "output": "For people having a type of weight-loss surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), does closing internal gaps prevent the bowel from getting trapped (internal hernia)?\n\n- For people having a type of weight-loss surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), closing internal gaps created during the operation may lower (reduce) the risk of the bowel getting trapped. This is a serious harmful effect (complication) called an internal hernia.\n- Closing these gaps appears to make little to no difference to the risk of other complications or death shortly after the operation (surgery).\n- Our confidence in these results is limited because we found only a small number of studies. We need more well-designed research to be certain about the benefits and harms of this procedure.\n\n**What is an internal hernia after weight-loss surgery?**\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a common type of weight-loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This procedure creates internal gaps in the tissue that holds the intestines in place. A serious harmful effect (complication) can happen if the intestine slips through one of these gaps. This causes a painful and dangerous blockage known as an internal hernia. To stop this from happening (prevent it), some surgeons stitch these gaps closed during the operation. However, closing the gaps might increase the risk of other problems, such as kinking and blocking the small intestine. It is not clear if the benefits of closing these gaps outweigh the possible harms.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of closing these internal gaps compared with not closing them. This was for people having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. We wanted to know if closing the gaps is better at preventing internal hernias. We also wanted to know if it is linked with any other harmful effects (complications).\n\n**What did we do?**\nWe searched for studies that compared closing internal gaps with not closing them during stomach (gastric) bypass surgery. We combined the results from these studies. We then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nOur review included 3 studies with 3010 people. The studies included people with obesity (a body mass index, or BMI, of 35 kg/m² or more). They were having a type of weight-loss surgery using small cuts and a camera (laparoscopic surgery) or a surgeon-controlled robot (robotic surgery). The studies compared closing the surgical gaps with not closing them. They followed people for up to 10 years. We did not have enough information to look at (assess) pain after the operation (postoperative pain).\n\n**Main results**\nClosing the gaps in the gut lining (mesenteric defects) during weight-loss surgery may greatly lower (reduce) the risk of an internal hernia. An internal hernia is a serious complication where the bowel gets blocked. Closing these gaps may make little to no difference to the total number of complications that happen in the month after surgery. The evidence was very uncertain, so we do not know if closing the gaps affects the number of deaths, complications during the operation, or how long people stay in the hospital.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**Currency of the evidence**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.\n"
