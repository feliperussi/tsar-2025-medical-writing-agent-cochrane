    "output": "How accurate are tests that measure blood pressure in the toe (toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure) for diagnosing poor circulation in the legs (peripheral arterial disease)?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain how accurate tests that measure blood pressure in the toe are for diagnosing poor circulation in the legs (a condition known as peripheral arterial disease). The tests studied were the toe-brachial index (a comparison of blood pressure in the toe and the arm) and toe systolic blood pressure (the pressure in the arteries of the toe when the heart beats).\n- Future well-conducted studies are needed to find out with greater certainty how well these tests work for identifying people with poor circulation in their legs.\n\nWHAT IS PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE?\nPeripheral arterial disease, or PAD, is a common condition where the arteries that supply blood to the lower legs become narrow. This reduces blood flow and can lead to serious problems. These include pain when walking, non-healing wounds, and in severe cases, the need for amputation (the surgical removal of a limb). Because PAD also increases the chance (risk) of heart attack and stroke, it is important to diagnose it accurately and early. This allows people to receive the right treatment to prevent harmful effects (complications).\n\nHOW CAN PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE BE DIAGNOSED?\nDoctors can use simple, non-invasive tests to check for PAD. 'Non-invasive' means the tests do not break the skin. Two such tests are the toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and the toe-brachial index (TBI). TSBP measures the blood pressure (the force of blood on artery walls) in the big toe. TBI compares the blood pressure in the toe to the pressure in the arm. These tests are often used in clinics to help decide if someone has PAD.\n\nWHAT DID WE WANT TO FIND OUT?\nWe wanted to find out how accurate the TSBP and TBI tests are for diagnosing PAD in people who have a significant probability of developing the condition (people at risk). We also wanted to compare the 2 tests to see if one was more accurate than the other.\n\nWHAT DID WE DO?\nWe searched for studies that measured the accuracy of TBI and TSBP for diagnosing PAD. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWHAT DID WE FIND?\nOur review included 18 studies. The studies on TBI involved 1927 people (2550 limbs), and the studies on TSBP involved 701 people (701 limbs). 13 of the studies looked at TBI only, 1 looked at TSBP only, and 4 looked at both tests.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis (the process of identifying a disease), most studies used an accurate, existing test known as a reference standard. 13 studies used colour duplex ultrasound (a test using sound waves to create pictures of blood vessels). The other studies used different imaging methods (processes that make pictures of areas inside the body). These included computed tomography angiography (a procedure using X-rays and a dye to see blood vessels) and angiography (a procedure to X-ray blood vessels).\n\nDue to a lack of high-quality research, it is unclear how accurate TBI and TSBP are for identifying PAD. The evidence to support their use is limited, and their overall performance in diagnosing the disease remains uncertain.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE\nWe are not confident in the evidence. This is because not all of the studies provided information (data) about everything we were interested in. There are also not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHOW UP TO DATE IS THIS EVIDENCE?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024."
