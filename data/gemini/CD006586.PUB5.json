    "output": "Can birth control pills with a lab-made hormone (drospirenone) help with premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?\n\nKey messages\n- For women with severe PMS, birth control pills with the lab-made hormone drospirenone may improve symptoms by a small to moderate amount. But, they may also cause more unwanted effects, like breast pain, feeling sick, and bleeding between periods, when compared to a dummy pill (a pill with no active medicine).\n- We are not certain about the results. It is unclear if these pills work well for more than 3 months, help women with milder PMS, or are better than other birth control pills.\n\nWhat is premenstrual syndrome?\nBefore their monthly period, many women have a mix of physical and emotional symptoms. This is called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). If the symptoms are very bad and affect daily life, it is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Some birth control pills (combined oral contraceptives) can help with these symptoms. They have two hormones: oestrogen and a progestin (a lab-made version of the hormone progesterone). We looked at a pill with a progestin called drospirenone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if birth control pills with drospirenone are a safe and good way to treat PMS. We looked at studies that compared these pills to a placebo (a 'dummy' pill) to see if they lessened symptoms or caused unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared birth control pills with drospirenone to a placebo or to other birth control pills for treating PMS. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 5 studies (randomised controlled trials) with 858 women in total. In these studies, people are put into treatment groups by chance. Most women in the studies had PMDD, a severe type of PMS. The studies compared birth control pills with drospirenone to a placebo. We did not find any studies that compared these pills to other types of birth control pills.\n\nCompared to a placebo, birth control pills with drospirenone may lessen overall PMS symptoms. They may also reduce how much symptoms affect work, social life, and relationships. People taking these pills may be more likely to respond to the treatment. For instance, if 36 out of 100 people respond to a placebo, we would expect between 39 and 58 out of 100 to respond to the birth control pill.\n\nBut, these pills may cause more unwanted effects. They likely lead to more breast pain, and may cause more nausea (feeling sick), bleeding between periods, and menstrual problems. If 28 out of 100 people taking a placebo have unwanted effects, we would expect between 40 and 54 out of 100 people taking the birth control pill to have them. This means more people may stop the treatment. If 3 out of 100 people stop taking a placebo due to unwanted effects, we would expect between 6 and 16 out of 100 to stop taking the birth control pill.\n\nWe do not know if these pills affect mood, nervousness, headache, weakness, or pain. We also do not know if they work for more than 3 months, help women with milder symptoms, or are better than other birth control pills.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. The studies did not always report on all the outcomes we were interested in. Also, the people in the studies were different from each other. Finally, there were not enough studies for us to be certain of the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to June 2022."
