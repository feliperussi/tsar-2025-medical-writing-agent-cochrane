    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Education programmes probably help people with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes to lower their blood sugar levels (measured as HbA1c). They may also help lower cholesterol and improve people's knowledge and confidence in managing their condition.\n– We do not know if these programmes affect the risk of serious health problems like death or kidney failure because there was not enough information to be certain.\n– The studies we found were small. More and larger studies are needed to better understand the long-term effects of education programmes on the health of people with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes.\n\n**What are chronic kidney disease and diabetes?**\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work as well as they should. Diabetes is a condition where the amount of sugar in the blood is too high. Many people have both conditions at the same time, which can lead to serious health problems.\n\nManaging both CKD and diabetes is complicated. It often involves taking multiple medicines, following a strict diet, and monitoring blood sugar levels. Because it is so complex, people can find it hard to stick to their treatment plans.\n\n**Why are education programmes important?**\n\nEducation programmes aim to help people understand their health conditions better. They provide information and support to help people manage their treatments, diet, and lifestyle. This can include advice from nurses, pharmacists, or other healthcare professionals.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of education programmes for adults with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared education programmes with usual care. In these studies, people were randomly put into groups to receive either an education programme or the usual care they would normally get from their doctor. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 8 studies that included 840 people with both CKD and diabetes. The studies lasted for up to 18 months.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n**Education programmes compared to usual care**\n– **Blood sugar:** Education programmes probably lower blood sugar levels (HbA1c) over about one year.\n– **Cholesterol:** The programmes may lower total cholesterol and 'bad' cholesterol (LDL).\n– **Knowledge and confidence:** People who took part in an education programme may have better knowledge about diabetes. They may also feel more confident in their ability to manage their health.\n– **Behaviour:** The programmes may help people improve their diet and blood sugar monitoring habits in the short term, but we are not sure if these changes last.\n– **Serious health problems:** We do not know if education programmes have an effect on the risk of death, very low blood sugar, or kidney failure. The studies did not provide enough information to be certain about these outcomes.\n– **Kidney function:** The studies did not report on how the programmes affected kidney function over time.\n\n**Education programmes plus team-based care compared to usual care**\nOne study looked at adding an education programme to care from a coordinated team of health professionals. This approach may make little or no difference to blood sugar levels, kidney failure, or blood pressure compared to usual care. This study did not report on other important outcomes like quality of life or unwanted effects.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. This is mainly because most of the studies were small, which makes the results less certain. In some studies, there were also concerns about how they were conducted. For example, people may have known which group they were in, which could have affected the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to July 2024."
