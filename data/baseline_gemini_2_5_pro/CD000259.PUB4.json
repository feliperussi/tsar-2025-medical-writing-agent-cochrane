    "output": "What are the effects of audit and feedback on the work of healthcare professionals?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Checking the performance of healthcare professionals and giving them feedback (a process called audit and feedback) probably leads to small but important improvements in the care they provide. The studies did not report on any unwanted effects.\n\n– Audit and feedback seems to work better when it is designed in specific ways. For example, when it gives data about an individual's performance (not a team's), compares their work to top performers, and includes a clear plan for how to improve.\n\n– More research is needed to confirm which ways of giving audit and feedback are best and to find new ways to make it more effective.\n\n**What is audit and feedback?**\n\nAudit and feedback is a way to help healthcare professionals improve the care they give to patients. It involves two steps:\n\n1.  **Audit:** This means checking how well a healthcare professional or team is performing in certain areas of their work. For example, checking if they are prescribing the right medicines.\n2.  **Feedback:** This means sharing the results of the audit with the professional or team. The goal is to show them where they are doing well and where they could improve.\n\nThis process is widely used in healthcare, but it is not always clear how well it works or what the best way to do it is.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if audit and feedback helps healthcare professionals improve their work. We also wanted to see if certain ways of doing audit and feedback work better than others.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared healthcare professionals who received audit and feedback with those who did not. The studies we looked for were randomised trials. In these studies, people are assigned to different groups by chance, which helps to make the comparison fair.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of these studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence based on how the studies were designed and carried out.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 292 studies. Most of the studies involved doctors, and the most common areas of work they looked at were prescribing medicines and ordering medical tests. In most studies, audit and feedback was used alongside other strategies to improve care, such as education for the professionals.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n– Audit and feedback probably leads to a small but important improvement in the work of healthcare professionals.\n\n– The way audit and feedback is delivered seems to matter. It may work better when:\n    – the feedback is about an individual's performance, not a whole team's;\n    – it compares a person's performance to top performers or a set standard;\n    – a respected colleague helps to deliver the feedback;\n    – the feedback is given in different ways, such as in writing and in person;\n    – it includes support and a clear action plan for how to improve.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate. This is because many of the studies we found had weaknesses in how they were designed or carried out, which means their results might not be completely reliable. Also, the effects of audit and feedback varied a lot from one study to another.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2020."
