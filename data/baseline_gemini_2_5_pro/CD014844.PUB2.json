    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of giving antibiotics to prevent infection after a procedure for miscarriage?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– For women without signs of infection, giving a single dose of antibiotics before a procedure to manage a miscarriage causes a large reduction in the risk of developing an infection in the womb (uterus).\n\n– The antibiotics probably make little to no difference to the risk of side effects like vomiting or diarrhoea, but may slightly increase the risk of an allergic reaction.\n\n– While the evidence from all studies was mixed, the findings from the largest and best-conducted studies were clear. Future research should continue to monitor the side effects of giving antibiotics.\n\n**What is a miscarriage and how is it managed?**\n\nA miscarriage, also called an early pregnancy loss, is when a pregnancy ends on its own before 24 weeks.\n\nSometimes after a miscarriage, some pregnancy tissue is left behind in the womb (uterus). When this happens, a procedure may be needed to remove the tissue. This is often called a uterine evacuation. Like any medical procedure, there is a small risk of getting an infection afterwards.\n\n**Why did we do this review?**\n\nIf a woman already has an infection, she will be given antibiotics (medicines that fight bacterial infections). However, it is not clear if antibiotics should be given to all women having a procedure for miscarriage to *prevent* an infection from starting.\n\nWe wanted to find out if giving antibiotics as a routine preventative measure is better than giving a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment for women having a procedure for a miscarriage. We were interested in the effects on infection rates and any unwanted side effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared giving preventative antibiotics with giving a placebo or no treatment to women having a procedure for miscarriage. We only included studies where women did not have any signs of infection before the procedure.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 6 studies that included a total of 4371 women having a procedure for a miscarriage. The studies compared giving preventative antibiotics with giving a placebo or no treatment.\n\n**Infection in the womb**\nWhen we looked at the three largest and best-conducted studies (which included 3737 of the 4371 women), we found that giving preventative antibiotics causes a large reduction in the risk of developing an infection in the womb.\n\n**Side effects of antibiotics**\nThe evidence on side effects came from one large study.\n– Antibiotics probably make little to no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea.\n– Antibiotics may increase the risk of having an allergic reaction. No serious allergic reactions were reported in the study.\n\n**Other effects**\nIt is unclear if giving preventative antibiotics reduces the need for more antibiotic treatment later, or if it reduces the number of women who need to be admitted to hospital for an infection. We are very uncertain about these results.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the results from all six studies combined is low. This is because some of the studies were not well-conducted. For example, in some studies, many women did not return for check-ups, and some did not take the antibiotics as instructed.\n\nHowever, we are confident in the results from the three largest, best-conducted studies, which showed that antibiotics reduce the risk of infection. We need more information to be certain about the risk of side effects.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023."
