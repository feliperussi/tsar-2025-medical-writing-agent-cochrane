    "output": "Does personalizing the dose of fertility medicine for IVF improve the chance of having a baby?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Using special tests to personalize the dose of fertility medicine for women having in vitro fertilisation (IVF) may slightly increase the chance of having a baby and may reduce the risk of a complication called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), where the ovaries swell and become painful. However, we are not very confident in this evidence.\n\n– For specific groups of women predicted to have a low, normal, or high response to the medicine, it is unclear if changing the dose has any effect on the chance of having a baby or the risk of OHSS.\n\n– Because the studies used many different ways to personalize the dose, it is difficult to be certain about the results. Future research should aim to find out which methods work best and for which women.\n\n**What is IVF and why is the dose of fertility medicine important?**\n\nIn vitro fertilisation, or IVF, is a treatment that can help people have a baby. During IVF, a woman takes daily injections of a medicine called a gonadotropin. This medicine helps her ovaries produce several eggs at once, instead of the usual one per month.\n\nGetting the dose of this medicine right is important. If the dose is too low, the ovaries may not produce enough eggs, and the treatment cycle might be cancelled. If the dose is too high, the ovaries can overreact. This can lead to a painful and sometimes dangerous condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nDoctors can use tests to predict how a woman’s ovaries might respond to fertility medicine. These are called ovarian reserve tests. They measure things like certain hormone levels in the blood or the number of small follicles (sacs that contain eggs) in the ovaries.\n\nWe wanted to find out if using these tests to choose a personalized dose of fertility medicine for each woman works better than giving everyone a standard dose. We wanted to know if it improves the chance of having a baby and reduces the risk of OHSS.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of choosing the dose of fertility medicine for women having IVF. We looked for studies that randomly assigned women to receive either a personalized dose based on ovarian reserve tests or a standard dose. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 26 studies that included a total of 8520 women. This review adds 6 new studies to our previous review. The studies were conducted in different countries and used many different methods to personalize the dose of medicine.\n\nOur main findings came from comparing a personalized dose with a standard dose.\n\n**Chance of having a baby**\nUsing ovarian reserve tests to guide the dose may slightly increase the chance of having a baby. For example, if 25 out of 100 women have a baby with a standard dose, between 25 and 31 out of 100 women might have a baby with a personalized dose.\n\n**Risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)**\nUsing ovarian reserve tests to guide the dose may reduce the risk of moderate or severe OHSS. For example, if 5 out of 100 women develop this complication with a standard dose, between 2 and 5 out of 100 women might develop it with a personalized dose.\n\nWhen we looked only at women predicted to have a low, normal, or high response, we did not find enough good-quality evidence to know if changing the dose for these specific groups made any difference.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies often included small numbers of women, which makes the results less certain. Also, the studies used many different methods to personalize the dose, which made it difficult to combine their results and draw firm conclusions. In some studies, it is possible that people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023."
