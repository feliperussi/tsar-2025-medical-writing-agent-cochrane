    "output": "How accurate are toe pressure tests for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (blocked arteries in the legs)?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– We do not know how accurate toe pressure tests are for finding peripheral arterial disease (a condition where the arteries in the legs become narrow). This is because the available studies were not well-designed or reported.\n\n– Because the evidence is very limited, the true benefits and risks of using these tests in clinical practice are uncertain.\n\n– Better studies are needed to find out how well these tests work. Future research should be carefully designed and clearly reported to give us more certain answers.\n\n**What is peripheral arterial disease?**\n\nPeripheral arterial disease, or PAD, is a common condition that affects the blood vessels, usually in the legs. It happens when the arteries that carry blood to the legs become narrow due to a build-up of fatty deposits. This reduces blood flow.\n\nPAD can cause problems like pain when walking, pain even when resting, sores that do not heal, and in serious cases, can lead to amputation (removal of a limb). People with PAD also have a higher risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\n**Why is it important to diagnose peripheral arterial disease accurately?**\n\nFinding PAD early is important. It allows doctors to recommend lifestyle changes or start treatments to prevent the disease from getting worse and to lower the risk of serious complications.\n\nTo diagnose PAD, doctors can use simple, non-invasive tests that can be done at the bedside. These tests measure the blood pressure in the toes.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out how accurate two types of toe pressure tests are for diagnosing PAD. The tests are called:\n– toe-brachial index (TBI)\n– toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP)\n\nWe wanted to know how well these tests could correctly identify people who have PAD and people who do not have PAD.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared the results of toe pressure tests with the results of more detailed imaging scans. Imaging scans, like ultrasound or angiography, are the most accurate way to diagnose PAD.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results from the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence based on how the studies were done.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 18 studies that looked at these tests. The studies included 1927 people who had the TBI test and 701 people who had the TSBP test.\n\nThe main finding of our review is that the evidence is very limited. Most of the studies we found were small and had weaknesses in how they were designed and carried out.\n\nBecause of these issues, we do not know how accurately the TBI or TSBP tests can identify people who have peripheral arterial disease. We also do not know how well these tests can correctly rule out the disease in people who do not have it.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence. The studies we found were not always conducted or reported well. For example, many studies did not clearly explain how they chose the people to include. It was also often unclear if the person doing the toe pressure test knew the results of the more detailed imaging scan beforehand, which could have affected the results.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the accuracy of TBI or TSBP for diagnosing PAD.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024."
