    "output": "For women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is maturing eggs in the lab better than standard fertility treatment for having a baby?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– For women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a fertility technique that matures eggs in the lab (in vitro maturation, or IVM) greatly reduces the risk of a painful side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). However, IVM also increases the risk of miscarriage compared to standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF).\n– We do not know if IVM changes the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF because the evidence is not strong enough.\n– More high-quality studies are needed to be certain about the benefits and risks of IVM for women with PCOS, especially its effect on the chance of a live birth.\n\n**What is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and how does it affect fertility?**\n\nPCOS is a common health condition that affects how a woman's ovaries work. It can cause irregular periods and make it difficult for a woman to get pregnant. Many women with PCOS who want to have a baby need help from fertility treatments.\n\n**How are fertility problems in women with PCOS treated?**\n\nA common fertility treatment is in vitro fertilisation (IVF). During IVF, a woman takes medicines to help many of her eggs mature inside her ovaries. The mature eggs are then collected and mixed with sperm in a lab to create embryos. An embryo is then placed back into the woman's womb to grow.\n\nFor women with PCOS, the medicines used in IVF can sometimes cause the ovaries to overreact. This can lead to a painful and sometimes dangerous condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\n**What is in vitro maturation (IVM)?**\n\nIVM is a different approach. Instead of using high doses of medicines to mature eggs inside the body, doctors collect the eggs when they are still immature. The eggs are then matured in a lab before being mixed with sperm. Because it uses fewer medicines, IVM may lower the risk of OHSS.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if IVM is better or worse than standard IVF for women with PCOS. We were interested in the effects on:\n\n– having a baby (live birth)\n– miscarriage\n– OHSS\n– other unwanted effects\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared IVM with standard IVF in women with PCOS. The studies had to be randomized controlled trials, where people are randomly put into different treatment groups. This type of study provides the most reliable evidence.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 4 studies, but our main findings are based on the 2 most reliable studies. These 2 studies included 739 women with PCOS who were having fertility treatment.\n\nOur main findings are:\n\n– **Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS):** IVM causes a large reduction in the risk of moderate or severe OHSS. If about 4 out of 100 women get OHSS with standard IVF, fewer than 3 out of 100 would get it with IVM.\n\n– **Miscarriage:** IVM increases the risk of miscarriage. If about 20 out of 100 pregnancies end in miscarriage with standard IVF, between 20 and 40 out of 100 would end in miscarriage with IVM.\n\n– **Live birth:** We do not know if IVM has an effect on the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF. The evidence was not strong enough to be certain.\n\n– **Babies born too early (preterm birth):** IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of a baby being born too early.\n\n– **Birth defects:** We are uncertain about the effect of IVM on the risk of birth defects.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for some important outcomes. For the key question of whether IVM improves the chance of having a baby, the results from the two main studies were very different from each other. This makes it difficult to be sure about the overall effect. More studies are needed to give us a clearer answer.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023."
