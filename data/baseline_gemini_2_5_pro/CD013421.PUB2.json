    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of using special glues or gels (sealants) to stop bleeding during blood vessel surgery?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Compared to standard methods like applying pressure, using a sealant may help stop bleeding faster at the site where blood vessels are joined. However, we are very uncertain if sealants reduce the chance that the first attempt to stop bleeding will fail.\n\n– Sealants may make little to no difference to the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total time of the operation, or the risk of bleeding after surgery. The studies did not report on unwanted effects, deaths from bleeding, or people's quality of life.\n\n– We have little confidence in these findings because the studies were not well designed. More and better-quality research is needed to understand the true benefits and harms of using sealants in blood vessel surgery.\n\n**What happens during blood vessel surgery?**\n\nDuring surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery), surgeons often need to connect blood vessels to each other or to a man-made tube called a graft. This connection point is called an anastomosis.\n\nSometimes, these connection points can bleed from the small holes made by the needle and thread used to stitch them together. Stopping this bleeding is very important for the person's safety.\n\n**How can bleeding be stopped?**\n\nSurgeons have several ways to stop bleeding. Standard methods include applying pressure with a finger or a sponge. Another option is to use special products called sealants. These are like medical glues or gels that the surgeon applies directly to the bleeding area to help seal it.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if using sealants to stop bleeding at connection sites is better or worse than using standard methods for people having blood vessel surgery.\n\nWe were interested in:\n– how long it took to stop the bleeding\n– whether the first attempt to stop bleeding worked\n– the amount of blood lost\n– any unwanted or harmful effects\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with standard care (like applying pressure or using special sponges) to stop bleeding during blood vessel surgery. The people in the studies were assigned to a treatment group at random. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 24 studies that included a total of 2376 people having blood vessel surgery. The studies compared different types of sealants to standard care.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n**Time to stop bleeding:** Using a sealant may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding compared to standard care.\n\n**Failure to stop bleeding:** We do not know if using a sealant reduces the chance that the first attempt to stop bleeding will fail. We are very uncertain about this result.\n\n**Other outcomes:** Sealants may make little to no difference to:\n– the amount of blood lost during the operation\n– the total length of the operation\n– bleeding in the 30 days after the operation\n– the need for another operation to manage bleeding\n\nNo studies reported on deaths caused by bleeding or on people's quality of life after surgery.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because all the studies had weaknesses in how they were conducted, which could have affected their results. For example, it is possible that the surgical teams knew which treatment people were getting. Also, some of the studies were very small, and the results from different studies were not always consistent. It is also possible that studies with negative results were not published, which would make sealants seem more effective than they really are.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
