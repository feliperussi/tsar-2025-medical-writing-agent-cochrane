    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of 'hospital at home' care compared to staying in the hospital?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– For certain older people who need hospital care, receiving treatment at home ('hospital at home') probably leads to similar health results compared to being in the hospital. It probably makes little or no difference to the risk of dying or needing to go back to the hospital.\n\n– Hospital at home care probably reduces the chance that an older person will need to move into a residential care home. It may also improve how satisfied people are with their care and probably costs less for the health service.\n\n– We need more research to understand how hospital at home care affects family members or other caregivers who support the person being treated.\n\n**What is 'hospital at home' care?**\n\nSometimes, people are unwell enough to need to be admitted to a hospital. 'Hospital at home' is an alternative where doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers provide the same kind of active treatment, but in the person's own home. This type of care is for conditions that would otherwise require a hospital stay and only lasts for a limited time.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if hospital at home care is a better option than staying in the hospital. We looked at the effects on people's health, their satisfaction with the care they received, and the costs for the health service.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared hospital at home care with regular inpatient hospital care for people aged 18 and over. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 20 studies that included a total of 3100 people. The studies included older people with a range of sudden medical problems, as well as people with specific conditions like lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or those recovering from a stroke.\n\nFor older people who were unwell, we found that hospital at home care compared to hospital inpatient care:\n\n– probably makes little or no difference to the number of deaths within six months.\n– probably makes little or no difference to how many people need to go back to the hospital after their treatment ends.\n– probably reduces the chance of needing to move into a residential care home within six months.\n– probably results in little to no difference in how people rate their own health.\n– may improve how satisfied people are with the care they receive.\n– probably reduces costs for the health service.\n\nVery few studies looked at how hospital at home care affects caregivers, so we do not know much about its impact on them.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate for most findings. This is because in some studies, it is possible that people were aware of which type of care they were getting, which could have influenced their responses. Also, some studies did not report on all the outcomes that we were interested in. For the finding on patient satisfaction, our confidence is low.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022."
