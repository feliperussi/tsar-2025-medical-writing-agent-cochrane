    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of the medicine favipiravir for people with COVID-19?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– We do not know if favipiravir is a helpful treatment for people with COVID-19. The available evidence is very uncertain about whether it reduces deaths, prevents the need for a breathing machine, or helps people get better faster.\n\n– Favipiravir may increase the number of people who experience unwanted effects from treatment. However, it may make little to no difference to the number of people who experience serious unwanted effects.\n\n– Because of the high level of uncertainty, more good-quality research is needed to understand if favipiravir has any benefits for people with COVID-19.\n\n**What is COVID-19?**\n\nCOVID-19 is an illness caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. It can cause symptoms that range from mild, like a cough and fever, to very severe, like breathing problems that require hospital care. Since it first appeared in 2019, researchers have been working to find safe and effective medicines to treat it.\n\nOne of the medicines that was suggested as a possible treatment is favipiravir. It is an antiviral medicine, which means it is designed to stop viruses from multiplying in the body.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if favipiravir is a useful treatment for people with COVID-19.\n\nWe were interested in how favipiravir compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment), standard hospital care, or other antiviral medicines. We looked at its effects on:\n– how many people died;\n– how many people needed a machine to help them breathe (a ventilator);\n– how long it took for people's symptoms to get better;\n– whether people treated outside of hospital needed to be admitted;\n– unwanted or harmful effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared favipiravir with a placebo, standard care, or other antiviral medicines for people with COVID-19. The studies had to be randomized controlled trials, where people are put into treatment groups by chance. This type of study usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as how the studies were done and how many people they included.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 25 studies that included 5750 adults with COVID-19. Most of the people in the studies were under 60 years old and were in the hospital with mild to moderate illness. The studies took place in countries all over the world, including the UK, the USA, Brazil, and India.\n\nMost studies compared favipiravir to a placebo or standard care. The treatment usually lasted for 5 to 14 days.\n\n**Main results**\n\nWe are very uncertain about the effects of favipiravir on people with COVID-19.\n\n– We do not know if favipiravir has an effect on the number of people who die from any cause.\n– We do not know if favipiravir has an effect on the number of people who need a machine to help them breathe.\n– We do not know if favipiravir has an effect on how long it takes for people to get better.\n– For people treated outside of the hospital, favipiravir may make little to no difference to their chances of needing to be admitted to hospital.\n– Favipiravir may make little to no difference to the number of people whose illness gets worse and who need oxygen therapy.\n\n**Unwanted effects**\n\n– Favipiravir may increase the number of people who experience unwanted effects.\n– However, favipiravir may make little to no difference to the number of people who experience serious unwanted effects.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence. This is because many of the studies were small, and we had concerns about how some of them were carried out. This means we cannot be sure about the results, and future research could lead to very different conclusions.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023."
