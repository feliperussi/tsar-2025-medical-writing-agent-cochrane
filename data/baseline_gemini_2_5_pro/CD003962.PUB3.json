    "output": "What are the effects of treatments that do not suppress the immune system for IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease)?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– For people with IgA nephropathy, certain blood pressure medicines (called RAS inhibitors) probably reduce the amount of protein in the urine, which is a sign of kidney damage. However, we are less certain about their effect on preventing kidney failure. These medicines may have little to no difference in unwanted effects compared to a dummy treatment (placebo).\n\n– Removing the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may help reduce protein and blood in the urine for some people, but this has only been studied in Japanese people with IgA nephropathy. It is unclear if this would help people of other ethnicities.\n\n– We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know if other treatments that do not suppress the immune system, such as blood thinners, fish oil, or traditional Chinese medicines, are helpful. More and better studies are needed to understand the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments.\n\n**What is IgA nephropathy?**\n\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a long-term condition where the body's immune system harms the tiny filters in the kidneys. This damage can cause blood and protein to leak into the urine. For some people, this damage gets worse over time and can lead to kidney failure, which means the kidneys stop working properly.\n\n**How is IgA nephropathy treated?**\n\nSome treatments for IgAN work by suppressing the immune system to stop it from attacking the kidneys. However, these medicines can have serious unwanted effects. This review looks at other treatments that do not suppress the immune system. These include medicines to control blood pressure, surgery to remove the tonsils, and other therapies like fish oil supplements.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of treatments that do not suppress the immune system for adults and children with IgA nephropathy.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared these treatments to a dummy treatment, no treatment, or standard care. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 80 studies that included 4856 people with IgA nephropathy. The most studied treatments were medicines for high blood pressure.\n\n**Blood pressure medicines (RAS inhibitors)**\nThese medicines probably reduce the amount of protein in the urine compared to a dummy treatment or standard care. This suggests they may help protect the kidneys. However, the evidence was less clear about whether they prevent kidney failure in the long term. There may be little to no difference in unwanted effects when comparing these medicines to a dummy treatment.\n\n**Removing the tonsils (tonsillectomy)**\nFor Japanese people with IgA nephropathy, removing the tonsils in addition to standard care may help symptoms of protein and blood in the urine go away. It may also reduce the chance of these symptoms coming back. Because these studies were only done in Japanese people, we do not know if these findings apply to people from other backgrounds.\n\n**Other treatments**\nWe found some evidence on other treatments, including blood thinners (medicines that prevent blood clots), fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines. However, the evidence was not strong enough to be certain if they provide any benefit for kidney function compared to standard care.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence. This is because many of the studies were small and did not last long enough to measure important outcomes like kidney failure. Also, many studies were not well designed or reported, which could affect the reliability of their results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023."
