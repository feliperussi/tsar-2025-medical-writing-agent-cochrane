    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of the medicine infliximab for keeping Crohn's disease in remission?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Compared to a dummy treatment (placebo), infliximab probably helps to prevent the symptoms of Crohn's disease from returning. Adding infliximab to another type of medicine (a purine analogue) also probably helps prevent symptoms from returning. We do not know if infliximab causes unwanted side effects because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n– Compared to a 'biosimilar' medicine (a medicine that is very similar to an original biologic medicine), infliximab may make little to no difference in preventing symptoms from returning. However, infliximab may be slightly less effective at stopping symptoms from getting worse over time.\n\n– We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know how infliximab compares to other medicines for Crohn's disease. Future studies should compare infliximab with other common treatments and include more people to provide more certain results.\n\n**What is Crohn's disease?**\n\nCrohn's disease is a long-term condition where parts of the digestive system become swollen and sore (inflamed). This can cause symptoms like stomach pain, diarrhea, and tiredness.\n\nPeople with Crohn's disease often have times when their symptoms are better or gone completely. This is called 'remission'. They can also have times when their symptoms get worse, which is called a 'flare-up' or 'relapse'. The goal of treatment is to keep people in remission for as long as possible.\n\n**What is infliximab?**\n\nInfliximab is a type of medicine called a 'biologic'. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes inflammation. It is given to people to help keep their Crohn's disease in remission.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out how well infliximab works to keep Crohn's disease in remission. We also wanted to know if it caused any unwanted or harmful effects. We were interested in comparing infliximab to:\n\n– a dummy treatment (placebo);\n– other medicines used for Crohn's disease.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with a placebo or other medicines in adults with Crohn's disease. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 9 studies that included 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies took place in countries around the world. The people in the studies were between 18 and 69 years old and had different levels of disease activity. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies.\n\n**Main results**\n\n*Infliximab compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment)*\nInfliximab probably prevents symptoms from returning (clinical relapse) compared to a placebo. We do not know if infliximab has an effect on unwanted side effects because we are very uncertain about the results.\n\n*Infliximab combined with another medicine (purine analogue) compared to the other medicine alone*\nAdding infliximab to a purine analogue probably prevents symptoms from returning compared to using the purine analogue by itself. We do not know if this combination affects the risk of unwanted side effects because we are very uncertain about the results.\n\n*Infliximab compared to a biosimilar medicine*\nA biosimilar is a medicine that is designed to be very similar to an existing biologic medicine. Infliximab may make little to no difference in preventing symptoms from returning compared to a biosimilar version. However, infliximab may be slightly less effective at stopping symptoms from getting worse over time.\n\n*Other comparisons*\nWe did not find enough evidence to draw any conclusions about how infliximab compares to other medicines, such as adalimumab.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in much of the evidence. This is because some studies were not conducted well, and it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, many of the studies were very small and did not include enough people for us to be certain about the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021."
