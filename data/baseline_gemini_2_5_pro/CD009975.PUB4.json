    "output": "Videolaryngoscopy (using a camera) versus direct laryngoscopy for inserting a breathing tube in newborn babies: which is better?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Using a videolaryngoscope (a tool with a camera) to insert a breathing tube may increase the chance of success on the first try and may mean fewer attempts are needed compared to using a standard direct laryngoscope. It also probably reduces the risk of minor injury to the baby's airway.\n\n– Using a videolaryngoscope may make little to no difference to how long the procedure takes. We are very uncertain if it affects the baby's oxygen levels or heart rate during the procedure because there was not enough good evidence.\n\n– More and better-quality studies are needed to be more certain about the benefits and safety of using videolaryngoscopy in newborns.\n\n**What is a breathing tube and why is it important for newborns?**\n\nSome newborn babies have trouble breathing on their own, either in the delivery room or in a neonatal intensive care unit. To help them, doctors may need to place a breathing tube into their windpipe. This procedure is called endotracheal intubation.\n\nGetting the tube in place quickly and safely is very important. Delays or problems during the procedure can be harmful to the baby.\n\n**How is a breathing tube inserted?**\n\nDoctors use a special tool called a laryngoscope to see inside the baby's throat and guide the breathing tube into the windpipe.\n\nThere are two main ways to do this:\n\n– **Direct laryngoscopy:** This is the standard method. The doctor looks directly down the laryngoscope to see the baby's vocal cords and the opening to the windpipe.\n\n– **Videolaryngoscopy:** This method uses a laryngoscope with a tiny camera on the tip. The camera sends a picture to a video screen, giving the doctor a magnified view. This may make it easier to see where to place the tube.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if using a videolaryngoscope is better and safer than using a direct laryngoscope for inserting breathing tubes in newborn babies (from birth to 28 days old).\n\nWe were interested in:\n– success on the first attempt;\n– the total number of attempts needed;\n– how long the procedure took;\n– any unwanted effects, such as injury to the airway, low oxygen levels, or a slow heart rate.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy for inserting breathing tubes in newborns. The people in the studies had to be assigned to their treatment group at random. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 8 studies that included 759 attempts to insert a breathing tube in newborn babies. The studies took place in hospitals in different countries. They used several different types of videolaryngoscopes.\n\nCompared with direct laryngoscopy, we found that videolaryngoscopy:\n\n– may increase the success of inserting the tube on the first attempt;\n\n– may reduce the number of attempts needed to place the tube;\n\n– probably reduces minor injuries to the baby's airway, such as scrapes or bleeding;\n\n– may make little to no difference to the time it takes to insert the tube.\n\nIt is unclear if videolaryngoscopy has an effect on the baby's oxygen levels or heart rate during the procedure because the evidence was very uncertain. The studies did not report on any other unwanted effects.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in much of the evidence. This is because, in some studies, it is possible that the doctors knew which method was being used, which could have affected the results. Also, some of the studies were small. Therefore, our results may change when more research is published.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022."
