    "output": "Home-based or centre-based cardiac rehabilitation: which is more effective for people with heart disease?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– For people with certain heart conditions, doing a cardiac rehabilitation programme at home seems to be as effective as doing one at a centre (like a hospital). We found that both types of programmes had similar effects on the number of deaths, a person's ability to exercise, and their quality of life.\n\n– People were just as likely to complete a home-based programme as a centre-based one, and the costs for both were similar. This suggests that home-based programmes, which are often supported by healthcare staff through phone calls or digital tools, are a good alternative.\n\n– We need more research to know if the benefits of these programmes last for longer than one year. We also need to find out if home-based programmes are helpful and safe for people with other types of heart conditions.\n\n**What is cardiac rehabilitation?**\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death around the world. After a heart attack, heart surgery, or for people with a long-term condition like heart failure, doctors often recommend cardiac rehabilitation. This is a programme of exercise, education, and support designed to help people recover, improve their health, and reduce their risk of future heart problems.\n\n**Why compare home-based and centre-based programmes?**\n\nTraditionally, people attend cardiac rehabilitation at a hospital or a community centre. These are called centre-based programmes. However, travelling to a centre can be difficult for some people. To make it easier for more people to take part, home-based programmes have been developed. These programmes allow people to do their rehabilitation at home, often with support from healthcare staff over the phone or using digital technology (like websites or apps). This became especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic when it was harder to access hospitals.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if home-based cardiac rehabilitation is as good as centre-based rehabilitation for people with heart disease. We compared the two types of programmes to see their effects on:\n– death\n– ability to exercise\n– quality of life\n– risk factors for heart disease (like blood pressure and cholesterol)\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based cardiac rehabilitation with centre-based programmes for adults with heart disease. The studies we included were a specific type where people were randomly put into one of the two groups. This method helps to ensure a fair comparison. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 24 studies that included a total of 3046 people with heart disease. The people in the studies had experienced a heart attack, had surgery to improve blood flow to the heart, or had heart failure. Most studies were short, and only three followed people for more than one year.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n– **Death:** Home-based programmes may make little to no difference to the number of deaths up to 12 months compared with centre-based programmes.\n\n– **Ability to exercise:** Home-based programmes may make little to no difference to people's ability to exercise up to 12 months. For the few studies that looked beyond 12 months, there was probably little to no difference between the groups.\n\n– **Quality of life:** We found that home-based and centre-based programmes had similar effects on people's quality of life.\n\n– **Completing the programme:** People were just as likely to complete home-based programmes as centre-based ones.\n\n– **Cost:** The costs for both types of programmes were similar.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in most of the evidence. This is because many of the studies did not clearly explain how they were conducted, which makes it difficult to know if the results are reliable. Also, most studies only followed people for a short time, so we know less about the long-term effects of these programmes.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022."
