    "output": "Which type of surgery is better for closing large holes in the back of the eye (macular holes)?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Compared with standard surgery, a newer surgical method called the 'inverted flap' technique probably increases the chance of a large macular hole closing. This method may also lead to better vision three months or more after the surgery.\n\n– We do not have enough information about unwanted or harmful effects from either type of surgery.\n\n– More and better-quality studies are needed to be more certain about which surgical method is best for improving vision and closing large macular holes.\n\n**What is a large macular hole?**\n\nThe retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. The central part of the retina is called the macula, and it is responsible for sharp, detailed central vision, which we use for reading and seeing faces.\n\nA macular hole is a small break in the macula. This can cause blurred and distorted central vision. When the hole is larger than a certain size (about 400 micrometres, which is less than half a millimetre), it is called a 'large' macular hole.\n\n**How are macular holes treated?**\n\nLarge macular holes are usually treated with an operation called a vitrectomy. During this surgery, the surgeon removes the jelly-like substance (the vitreous) that fills the eye.\n\nThe surgeon then removes a very thin layer from the surface of the retina around the hole. This is called 'internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling'. This standard method helps the hole to close.\n\nA newer method is the 'inverted ILM flap' technique. Instead of completely removing the thin layer, the surgeon leaves a small piece of it attached and uses it to cover the hole.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if the inverted flap surgery is better than the standard peeling surgery for treating people with large macular holes.\n\nWe were interested in how these two methods compared for:\n– improving vision\n– successfully closing the macular hole\n– any unwanted or harmful effects\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared the inverted flap surgery with the standard peeling surgery in people with large macular holes. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 4 studies that included 275 people (285 eyes) with large macular holes. Most people in the studies were women, and their average age was between 59 and 66 years. The studies took place in India, Poland, and Mexico. They followed people for between 3 and 12 months after their surgery.\n\n**Main results**\n\nCompared to the standard peeling surgery, the inverted flap surgery:\n– probably increases the chance that the macular hole will close.\n– may improve vision when measured three months or more after the surgery.\n– it is unclear if it improves vision one month after surgery.\n\nOnly one study reported on unwanted effects. It found that none of the 38 people in the study had a detached retina (where the retina pulls away from the back of the eye) after surgery. We do not have enough information to know about other possible harms.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate for some findings and low for others. This is because the studies we found were small. Also, it is possible that the people who measured the results knew which type of surgery each person had received. This could have influenced the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022."
