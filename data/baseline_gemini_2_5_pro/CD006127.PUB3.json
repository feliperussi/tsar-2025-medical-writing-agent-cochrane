    "output": "Does controlling blood pressure help prevent or slow eye problems caused by diabetes (diabetic retinopathy)?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– For people with diabetes, trying to control blood pressure more tightly probably helps prevent eye problems (called diabetic retinopathy) from starting. However, it may not stop existing eye problems from getting worse. Tighter blood pressure control may also increase the risk of having blood pressure that is too low (hypotension).\n\n– The benefit of tighter blood pressure control for preventing eye problems seems to be greatest for people who have type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\n– More research is needed to understand if controlling blood pressure helps people with diabetes who do not have high blood pressure, and to see if it can prevent serious vision loss.\n\n**What is diabetic retinopathy?**\n\nDiabetic retinopathy is a common problem for people with diabetes. It happens when high blood sugar levels damage the small blood vessels in the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. Over time, this damage can lead to poor vision and even blindness.\n\n**Can controlling blood pressure help?**\n\nWe know that controlling blood sugar is very important to protect the eyes. Doctors also think that controlling blood pressure could help prevent or slow down diabetic retinopathy. However, different studies have reported different results, so it has not been clear how much it helps.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if treatments to control blood pressure help to:\n– prevent diabetic retinopathy from starting;\n– slow down diabetic retinopathy if it has already started;\n– protect vision.\n\nWe also wanted to know if these treatments had any unwanted effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of controlling blood pressure in people with diabetes. The studies compared more intense blood pressure control with less intense control, or with no special treatment. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 29 studies that included a total of 27,185 people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The studies took place in many countries around the world and lasted from less than one year to nine years. Some studies were funded by medicine companies.\n\n**Main results**\n\n– **Starting of eye problems:** More intense blood pressure control probably reduces the chances of developing diabetic retinopathy over five years. This benefit was seen most clearly in people with type 2 diabetes who already had high blood pressure.\n\n– **Worsening of existing eye problems:** More intense blood pressure control probably makes little to no difference to the worsening of existing diabetic retinopathy over five years.\n\n– **Serious vision loss:** We do not know if tighter blood pressure control has an effect on serious vision loss because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n– **Unwanted effects:** Tighter blood pressure control probably makes little to no difference to the risk of death. However, it may increase the risk of having blood pressure that is too low (hypotension), which can cause dizziness or fainting.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate for some findings and low for others. This is because the results from the different studies were not always consistent. Also, for some important outcomes, like serious vision loss, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021."
