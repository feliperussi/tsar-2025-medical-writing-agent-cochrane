    "output": "What types of support can help reduce stress in healthcare workers?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Support programs for individual healthcare workers may help reduce stress for up to one year. These programs include those that help people focus on their experience of stress (for example, through mindfulness) and those that help them focus away from stress (for example, through relaxation or exercise).\n– A combination of different types of support may also help reduce stress in the short term. We do not know if programs that focus on changing work-related factors for an individual help to reduce stress, because there was not enough evidence.\n– We have little confidence in the evidence. Future studies need to be better designed and include more people to give us more certain results. More research is also needed on support that helps healthcare workers manage work-related risks.\n\n**What is work-related stress in healthcare?**\n\nWorking in healthcare can be very demanding. Healthcare workers may experience stress when the demands of their job do not match their skills or the support they receive at work. This can lead to stress, burnout (a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion), and health problems. It can also affect the quality of care they provide to patients.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if support programs aimed at individual healthcare workers can help reduce their stress. We looked at four types of support:\n\n– programs that help people focus on their experience of stress (for example, by changing their thoughts or feelings about it);\n– programs that help people focus away from stress (for example, through relaxation or exercise);\n– programs that help people change work-related factors (for example, by improving their time management skills);\n– programs that used a combination of these approaches.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared these support programs with no support, being on a waiting list for support, or another type of support program. The studies we included were randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are randomly put into different groups to receive either a type of support or no support. This is the best way to test if a treatment works.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 117 studies that included a total of 11,119 healthcare workers.\n\n**Support that focuses on the experience of stress**\nThis type of support may reduce stress for up to one year after the program ends. We do not know if it has an effect on stress in the long term (more than one year) because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**Support that focuses away from the experience of stress**\nThis type of support may also reduce stress for up to one year after the program ends. No studies looked at the effects for longer than one year.\n\n**Support that focuses on changing work-related factors**\nWe do not know if this type of support has an effect on stress at any time point. The evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**A combination of support types**\nUsing a combination of different support programs may reduce stress for up to three months. It may make little to no difference to stress between three months and one year. We do not know if a combination of programs has an effect on stress in the long term because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nThe studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of the support programs.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. In many studies, the healthcare workers knew which support program they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Also, many of the studies were small and did not use the best methods to form the treatment groups. This means we cannot be certain about the findings.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022."
