    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of oestrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse in women after menopause?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– We do not know if oestrogen therapy helps with symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse in women after menopause because there is not enough good-quality evidence.\n\n– No studies looked at whether oestrogen therapy used on its own is better than no treatment or other common treatments for pelvic organ prolapse. Some studies looked at oestrogen used together with other treatments (vaginal pessaries or surgery), but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n– More and better research is needed to understand if oestrogen therapy is a helpful treatment for pelvic organ prolapse, either by itself or with other treatments.\n\n**What is pelvic organ prolapse?**\n\nPelvic organ prolapse is a condition where one or more of the organs in the pelvis, such as the womb (uterus), bladder, or bowel, slip down from their normal position and bulge into the vagina. It can happen when the muscles and tissues that support these organs become weak.\n\nThis condition is common, affecting about half of all women over 50 who have had at least one child. It can cause uncomfortable symptoms, such as a feeling of pressure or a bulge in the vagina, problems with bladder or bowel control, and discomfort during sex.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nOestrogen is a hormone that decreases in women after menopause (when a woman's periods stop). This can affect the strength of the tissues in the pelvis. We wanted to find out if giving oestrogen therapy to women after menopause could help improve symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse and if it caused any unwanted effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared oestrogen therapy (either alone or with other treatments) against no treatment, a dummy treatment (placebo), or other treatments for pelvic organ prolapse. The studies had to include women who were postmenopausal.\n\nWe planned to compare and summarize the results of the studies, but there was not enough information to do this properly.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 14 studies that included a total of 1002 women. However, these studies did not give us a clear answer.\n\nWe found no studies that looked at the effects of oestrogen therapy used on its own.\n\nAll the studies we found looked at oestrogen therapy combined with another treatment.\n– Three studies compared using oestrogen cream or tablets with a vaginal pessary (a device placed in the vagina to support the pelvic organs) versus using a pessary alone.\n– Eleven studies compared using oestrogen before and after surgery for prolapse versus having surgery alone.\n\nBecause of the lack of evidence, we do not know if oestrogen therapy improves symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse.\n\nWhen used with other treatments, oestrogen may have some small benefits, but we are very uncertain about these findings.\n– For women using a vaginal pessary, adding oestrogen therapy may lead to fewer vaginal problems like irritation or dryness.\n– For women having surgery, using oestrogen therapy may reduce the number of urinary tract infections after the operation.\n\nWe did not find enough information about other unwanted effects.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence we found. This is because the studies were generally small and had problems in how they were designed.\n\nIn some studies, women and their doctors may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. The studies were also very different from each other, which made it hard to compare them. Finally, some studies did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nBecause of these limitations, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the benefits or risks of oestrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
