    "output": "Can changing shift work schedules improve sleep and reduce sleepiness for workers?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Limiting work shifts to a maximum of 16 hours probably reduces sleepiness during shifts and may increase how long workers sleep when they are off-shift.\n– For other types of schedule changes, such as changing the direction or speed of shift rotation, the effects on sleep and sleepiness are very uncertain. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of the schedule changes.\n– We need more and better-quality studies to be certain about the best ways to schedule shifts to improve sleep and reduce sleepiness for workers.\n\n**What is the problem with shift work?**\n\nMany jobs require people to work in shifts, including nights and weekends. This is common in healthcare, transport, and manufacturing. Working in shifts can disrupt the body's natural sleep patterns. This can lead to not getting enough sleep, which can make workers feel tired and less alert. This is a risk to their health and can also lead to accidents at work.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if changing shift work schedules could help workers. Specifically, we wanted to know if certain schedules could improve sleep quality, increase the amount of sleep people get, and reduce sleepiness during work shifts.\n\nWe looked at different types of changes, including:\n– the direction of shift rotation (for example, moving from morning to evening to night shifts, which is called 'forward rotation')\n– the speed of rotation (how quickly shifts change)\n– the length of shifts\n– the amount of time off between shifts\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different types of shift schedules for workers. We compared and summarized the results of these studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence, based on how the studies were done and how many people were in them.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 11 studies that included a total of 2125 shift workers. The studies looked at several different ways of changing shift schedules.\n\n**Limiting shift length to 16 hours**\nTwo studies compared workweeks where shifts were limited to a maximum of 16 hours with workweeks that had no limits on shift length. We found that limiting shifts to 16 hours probably reduces sleepiness during work. This change may also increase the amount of sleep workers get when they are off-shift.\n\n**Direction of shift rotation (forward versus backward)**\nThree studies looked at changing from a 'backward' rotation (night to evening to morning) to a 'forward' rotation (morning to evening to night). Forward rotation may reduce sleepiness during shifts, but we are very uncertain about this finding. It is unclear if forward rotation has any effect on sleep quality or the amount of sleep workers get.\n\n**Speed of shift rotation (faster versus slower)**\nThree studies compared faster shift rotations (changing shifts every 2 to 4 days) with slower rotations. Faster rotation may reduce sleepiness, but again, we are very uncertain about this. Faster rotation may make little to no difference to sleep quality. It is unclear if faster rotation affects how long people sleep.\n\n**Other schedule changes**\nStudies that looked at other changes, such as using shorter shifts (8 to 10 hours) or changing how compressed the workweek was, did not provide clear answers. It is unclear if these changes have any effect on sleep or sleepiness.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in most of the evidence we found. This is because many of the studies were small. Also, some studies were not designed in a way that people were randomly placed into different schedule groups. This means that any differences found between the groups could be due to differences between the people rather than the schedules themselves. The studies also used many different ways to measure sleep, which made it difficult to compare their results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022."
