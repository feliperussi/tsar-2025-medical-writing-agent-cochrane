    "output": "Can physical exercise help people with chronic venous insufficiency (a problem with blood flow in the leg veins)?\n\nKey messages\n\n– We do not know if physical exercise programmes help or harm people with chronic venous insufficiency. This is because there is not enough good-quality evidence. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of exercise.\n\n– More and better research is needed to understand if exercise is a useful treatment. Future studies should be larger and use similar ways of measuring the effects of exercise.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency?\n\nChronic venous insufficiency is a long-term condition where the veins in the legs have trouble sending blood back up to the heart. This can cause symptoms like pain, swelling, heavy-feeling legs, and skin changes. If the condition gets worse, it can lead to painful sores on the legs called venous leg ulcers.\n\nTreatments aim to reduce these symptoms and improve blood flow. One possible treatment is physical exercise, which might help by strengthening the muscles that support the veins in the legs.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if physical exercise programmes are better than no exercise for people with chronic venous insufficiency who do not have leg ulcers.\n\nWe were interested in the effects of exercise on:\n\n– symptoms of the condition\n– blood flow in the legs\n– quality of life\n– whether it prevented leg ulcers from forming\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared a physical exercise programme with no structured exercise for people with chronic venous insufficiency. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 5 studies that included a total of 146 people. The exercise programmes were different in each study, including things like walking, leg strengthening, and ankle movements. The studies were generally small.\n\nBecause the evidence was very limited and of poor quality, we do not know if exercise has any effect on:\n\n– the signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency\n– blood flow in the leg veins\n– a person's quality of life\n– exercise ability, muscle strength, or ankle movement\n\nNone of the studies looked at whether exercise could help prevent leg ulcers from developing. The studies also did not report on any unwanted effects of exercise.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence. Our confidence is low because the studies were very small, and there were problems with how some of them were conducted. For example, in some studies, it is possible that people knew which treatment group they were in, which could have affected the results. Because of these limitations, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the benefits and harms of exercise for this condition.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022."
