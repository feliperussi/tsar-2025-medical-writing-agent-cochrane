    "output": "Does lying face-down after surgery for a detached retina help with recovery?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– After surgery for a detached retina, we do not know if lying face-down helps recovery. It is unclear if this position reduces problems like the retina shifting, vision distortion, or double vision. It is also unclear if it increases the risk of other problems, such as high pressure in the eye.\n\n– Lying face-down after surgery may make little to no difference to how clearly people can see or to their overall quality of life, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n\n– More and better research is needed to understand the true benefits and risks of lying face-down after this type of eye surgery. Future studies should also look at things that are important to patients, like comfort.\n\n**What is a detached retina?**\n\nThe retina is a thin layer of tissue at the back of your eye that senses light and sends signals to your brain, allowing you to see. The macula is the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision.\n\nSometimes, the retina can pull away from the back of the eye. This is called a retinal detachment. If the macula is involved, it can cause serious vision loss and is considered an eye emergency.\n\n**How is a detached retina treated?**\n\nA common treatment is a type of surgery called a vitrectomy. During this surgery, an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) reattaches the retina. A gas bubble is often placed inside the eye to hold the retina in place while it heals.\n\nTo help the gas bubble press on the correct part of the retina, doctors sometimes ask people to keep their head in a certain position after surgery, often face-down. However, staying in this position can be difficult and uncomfortable.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if lying face-down after surgery for a detached retina is better than other positions (such as lying face-up or on your side) or having no specific position. We were interested in whether it helped prevent the retina from shifting and improved vision.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies where people were randomly put into groups to either lie face-down or use a different position after surgery. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 3 studies that included 369 eyes from 368 people who had surgery for a detached retina. Most of the people in the studies were men.\n\nOur main findings are:\n\n– **Shifting of the retina:** We do not know if lying face-down after surgery reduces the risk of the retina shifting out of place compared with another position.\n\n– **Clear vision:** It is unclear if the position people lie in affects how clearly they can see a few months after surgery.\n\n– **Unwanted effects:** We are uncertain about the effect of lying face-down on unwanted effects. It is unclear if this position reduces the risk of problems like folds forming on the retina or double vision. It is also unclear if it increases the risk of high pressure inside the eye, which can be harmful.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it comes from only a few small studies. Because the studies were small, we cannot be certain about the results. This means that future research could lead to very different conclusions.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022."
