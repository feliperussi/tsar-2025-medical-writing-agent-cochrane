    "output": "What are the effects of decision aids for people making health treatment or screening decisions?\n\nKey messages\n\n– Using patient decision aids probably helps more people make health choices that match what is most important to them. Decision aids also increase people's knowledge about their options, help them better understand the risks, and make them feel more involved in the decision-making process.\n\n– Patient decision aids do not seem to cause people to regret their choices later. Using a decision aid before a medical appointment does not change how long the appointment lasts. Using one during an appointment may make it slightly longer.\n\n– More research is needed to understand if using decision aids helps people stick to their chosen treatment and how they affect healthcare costs.\n\nWhat are health decisions and why can they be difficult?\n\nPeople often have to make difficult decisions about their health. This could be choosing a treatment for a condition or deciding whether to have a screening test to check for a disease. Making these choices can be hard because there are often several options, each with its own benefits and harms. It is important that people make a choice that is right for them, based on what matters most to them personally.\n\nWhat are patient decision aids?\n\nPatient decision aids are tools designed to help people make these choices. They can be booklets, videos, or websites. They explain the decision that needs to be made and give clear, evidence-based information about the different options. They also help people think through what is important to them (their personal values) so they can make a choice that feels right.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if using patient decision aids helps people make better health decisions compared to the usual care they get from their doctor. We looked at how decision aids affected:\n– whether people's choices matched their personal values;\n– people's knowledge and understanding of their options;\n– how confident and involved people felt in making the decision;\n– any unwanted effects, like regretting the decision later.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared patient decision aids with usual care. In these studies, people were placed into groups by chance to receive either a decision aid or usual care. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 209 studies that included 107,698 people. The studies covered 71 different health decisions. The most common decisions were about treatments for heart conditions, screening for cancer (such as for the bowel, prostate, or breast), cancer treatments, and joint replacement surgery.\n\nCompared to usual care, we found that patient decision aids:\n\n– probably cause a large increase in the number of people making choices that match their personal values;\n– increase people's knowledge about their options and their health condition;\n– cause a large increase in people's ability to accurately understand the possible benefits and harms (risks) of their options;\n– reduce people's feelings of being uninformed and their uncertainty about what is important to them;\n– reduce the number of people who take a passive role, instead helping them to be more active in making the decision with their doctor.\n\nWe also found that decision aids make little to no difference to whether people regret their decision later.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are confident in most of our findings. However, our confidence is reduced for some results because many studies did not clearly report how they were conducted. For example, it was often unclear if people in the studies knew which group they were in (receiving the decision aid or usual care), which could have affected the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022."
