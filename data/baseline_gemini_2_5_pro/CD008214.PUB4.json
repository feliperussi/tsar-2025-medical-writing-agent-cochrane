    "output": "Does an injection in the eye before surgery help people with vision problems from diabetes?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– For people with severe eye problems caused by diabetes, getting an injection of a medicine called anti-VEGF before or during eye surgery probably reduces bleeding in the eye after the operation and may improve vision.\n– The injection also reduces the risk of the surgeon accidentally making a hole in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) during the operation.\n– Future studies should agree on the most important results to measure, such as quality of life, to better understand the true benefits and risks for patients.\n\n**What is severe diabetic eye disease?**\n\nDiabetes can damage the small blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. When this happens, the eye can grow new, weak blood vessels. This stage of the disease is called proliferative diabetic retinopathy.\n\nThese new blood vessels can bleed into the jelly-like substance that fills the eye (the vitreous). They can also create scar tissue that pulls on the retina, causing it to detach. Both of these problems can lead to severe vision loss.\n\n**How are these problems treated?**\n\nWhen bleeding or retinal detachment happens, a type of eye surgery called a vitrectomy may be needed. During a vitrectomy, a surgeon removes the blood-filled vitreous and any scar tissue. However, this surgery has risks, including more bleeding during or after the operation, or the creation of holes in the retina. These problems can limit vision and may require more surgery.\n\nMedicines called anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs) can be injected into the eye. These medicines are designed to shrink the abnormal blood vessels. Giving an anti-VEGF injection before surgery might make the operation safer and more effective.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during a vitrectomy helps improve results for people with severe diabetic eye disease. We were interested in the effects on vision, bleeding after surgery, and the need for more operations.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared the results of people who had a vitrectomy for diabetic eye disease. The studies had to compare a group of people who received an anti-VEGF injection with a group who had the surgery alone. In these studies, people were placed into treatment groups at random. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 28 studies that included a total of 1914 eyes. The studies took place in many different countries around the world. They included people with severe complications of diabetic eye disease, such as bleeding that would not clear on its own or a detached retina.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n– **Vision:** People who received an anti-VEGF injection may have slightly better vision six months after surgery compared to those who had surgery alone.\n\n– **Bleeding after surgery:** Anti-VEGF injections probably reduce the risk of bleeding in the eye within the first four weeks after surgery. The injections also reduce the risk of bleeding that happens more than four weeks after surgery.\n\n– **Retinal holes during surgery:** Anti-VEGF injections reduce the risk of the surgeon accidentally making a hole in the retina during the operation.\n\n– **Need for more surgery:** We are uncertain if the injections reduce the need for more surgery to fix bleeding or a detached retina. The evidence on this was not clear.\n\n– **Silicone oil:** Sometimes surgeons use silicone oil to hold the retina in place. We do not know if anti-VEGF injections reduce the need for this.\n\nNo studies reported on how the treatment affected people's quality of life.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate. This is because in many studies, it is possible that the people taking part and the doctors knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Also, for some outcomes, the results were based on only a few studies or a small number of people, which makes us less certain about them.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022."
