    "output": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (a treatment that uses magnetic fields to stimulate the brain) helpful for people with schizophrenia?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– We do not know if magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is better, worse, or the same as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. The only available study suggests MST may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT, but we are very uncertain about this finding.\n\n– Because there is not enough evidence, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the benefits and risks of MST for people with schizophrenia.\n\n– More and better-quality studies are needed to understand if MST is a helpful and safe treatment for this condition.\n\n**What is schizophrenia?**\n\nSchizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that can affect how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. The main treatment is usually medicines called antipsychotics. However, these medicines do not work well for about 1 in 5 people with schizophrenia, so other treatments are needed.\n\n**What is magnetic seizure therapy?**\n\nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer type of treatment that is being studied. It uses magnetic fields to gently stimulate specific parts of the brain. It is sometimes compared to another treatment called electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which uses electrical currents to stimulate the brain.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if MST is a helpful and safe treatment for people with schizophrenia. We were interested in its effects on:\n\n– the symptoms of schizophrenia\n– memory and thinking skills\n– any unwanted or harmful effects\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared MST to other treatments, such as ECT, for people with schizophrenia. We compared and summarized the results of the studies we found and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found only one study that met our requirements. The study included 79 adults who were in the hospital for an acute (sudden and short-term) episode of schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared people who received MST alongside their usual care with people who received ECT alongside their usual care.\n\n**Main results**\n\nBecause the evidence comes from only one small study with some problems in how it was done, we are very uncertain about the results.\n\n– **Symptoms of schizophrenia:** We do not know if MST has an effect on the overall symptoms of schizophrenia when compared to ECT.\n\n– **Memory and thinking:** The study suggested that MST may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT. However, we are very uncertain about this result.\n\n– **Leaving the study early:** It is unclear if there is any difference between MST and ECT in the number of people who stopped treatment early because it was not working or because of unwanted effects.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it comes from only one small study. There were also some problems with how this study was carried out. For example, the study was stopped earlier than planned, and it may not have reported all of its results. This means we cannot be sure about the findings.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022."
