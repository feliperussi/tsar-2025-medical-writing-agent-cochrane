    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of antibiotics compared to antiseptics for long-term middle ear infections with discharge?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Antibiotic ear drops called quinolones probably stop ear discharge better than antiseptic ear drops containing boric acid. For other types of antibiotics and antiseptics, it is unclear which works best because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\n– Unwanted effects of the treatments, such as ear pain or irritation, were not well reported in the studies, so we know very little about the potential harms.\n– More and better-quality research is needed to help us understand which treatments are best for this condition. Future studies should also carefully record any unwanted effects.\n\n**What is a long-term middle ear infection?**\n\nA long-term, or chronic, middle ear infection is an infection that does not go away. It happens when there is a hole in the eardrum that doesn't heal. This can cause a sticky or smelly fluid to leak from the ear, which is called discharge. This condition can also lead to hearing loss. It is sometimes called chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).\n\n**How are these infections treated?**\n\nDoctors often treat this condition with medicines to kill the germs causing the infection. These can be antibiotics or antiseptics (substances that stop or slow down the growth of germs). They can be given as ear drops put directly into the ear (topical treatment) or as medicines taken by mouth or by injection (systemic treatment).\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if antibiotics are better or worse than antiseptics for treating long-term middle ear infections. We were interested in which treatment was better at stopping the ear discharge and if they caused any unwanted effects, like ear pain or irritation.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared antibiotics with antiseptics for people with long-term middle ear infections. The people in the studies were placed into treatment groups at random. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 15 studies that included 2371 people. The studies compared different types of antibiotic ear drops with different types of antiseptic ear drops, including acetic acid, boric acid, and povidone-iodine. No studies looked at how the treatments affected people's quality of life.\n\nOur main findings are:\n\n**Antibiotic ear drops (quinolones) compared with antiseptic ear drops (boric acid)**\n– Quinolone antibiotics probably stop ear discharge better than boric acid. This means that if 4 people use these antibiotic ear drops instead of boric acid, one extra person is likely to have their ear discharge stop within two weeks.\n– Quinolones may also cause less ear pain and may slightly improve hearing more than boric acid.\n\n**Antibiotic ear drops (aminoglycosides) compared with antiseptic ear drops (acetic acid)**\n– Acetic acid may stop ear discharge better than aminoglycoside antibiotics. We do not know if there is a difference in ear pain between these treatments because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**Other comparisons**\nFor other comparisons between different antibiotics and antiseptics, we are very uncertain about their effects. This is because there were not enough studies, or the studies were too small to be sure of the results.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. For the comparison between quinolone antibiotics and boric acid, our confidence is moderate. For most other comparisons, we have little or very little confidence in the results. This is because many of the studies were small and were not conducted in the best way. This means we cannot be certain about their findings.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2022."
