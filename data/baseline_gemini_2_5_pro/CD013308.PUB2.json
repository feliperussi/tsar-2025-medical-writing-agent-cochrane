    "output": "What are the best ways to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to stop smoking?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Using two forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) at the same time (a nicotine patch plus a fast-acting form like gum or a lozenge) increases a person's chance of successfully quitting smoking compared to using just one form.\n\n– Using a higher-dose nicotine patch or starting NRT before the planned quit day may also increase the chances of quitting. Unwanted effects were not well reported in the studies, but overall, serious side effects seemed to be rare.\n\n– We need more and better studies to understand the unwanted effects of different types of NRT. Future studies should make sure to collect and report this information clearly.\n\n**What is nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)?**\n\nMost people who smoke want to stop, but many find it difficult because nicotine is addictive. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a medicine that gives people nicotine without them needing to smoke. This helps to reduce cravings and feelings of withdrawal that people experience when they stop smoking.\n\nNRT is available in different forms, such as skin patches, chewing gum, nasal and oral sprays, inhalators, and lozenges. We know that using NRT helps people to stop smoking, but it is not clear which ways of using it work best.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if some ways of using NRT are better than others for helping people to quit smoking for 6 months or longer. We looked at:\n\n– using two forms of NRT versus one;\n– using different doses of NRT;\n– using NRT for different lengths of time;\n– starting NRT before the quit day versus on the quit day;\n– using different types of fast-acting NRT.\n\nWe also wanted to know about any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of using NRT for people who wanted to stop smoking. The people in the studies were chosen for different treatment groups at random. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 68 studies that included 43,327 people who smoked. The studies were carried out in many countries around the world, mostly with adults who wanted to quit smoking.\n\n**Main results**\n\nOur review found that people have a better chance of quitting smoking if they use two forms of NRT instead of one. Using a nicotine patch combined with a fast-acting form, like gum or a lozenge, increases the chances of quitting.\n\nWe also found that:\n\n– Using a higher-dose nicotine patch (for example, a 21 milligram patch) probably increases the chances of quitting compared to a lower-dose patch (a 14 milligram patch).\n\n– Starting to use NRT a few weeks before the quit day probably increases the chances of quitting compared to starting on the quit day itself.\n\n– Using a fast-acting NRT (like gum or a lozenge) makes little to no difference to quit rates compared to using a nicotine patch.\n\n– We are uncertain if the length of time people use NRT affects their chances of quitting, because there was not enough evidence.\n\n**Unwanted effects**\n\nThe studies did not provide much information about unwanted effects. Overall, serious unwanted effects seemed to be rare. In a few studies, more people stopped using their treatment because of side effects when using a higher-dose patch compared to a standard-dose patch, or when using a nasal spray compared to a patch.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate to low for some of our findings. This is because some studies were not conducted well, which could have affected the results. For some questions, the evidence came from only a few studies, which makes the results less certain.\n\nMost importantly, the studies did not provide good information about unwanted or harmful effects. This means we know very little about the safety of different ways of using NRT.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022."
