    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) for treating pain from endometriosis?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment), gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) may reduce pain caused by endometriosis. However, they may also cause more side effects, such as hot flushes.\n– When compared to another medicine called danazol, we are uncertain if GnRHas are better or worse for relieving pain. GnRHas taken alone may also cause a slight loss of bone strength.\n– The evidence we found is not very strong, which means we cannot be certain about these results. More and better-quality studies are needed to give clearer answers for women with endometriosis.\n\n**What is endometriosis?**\n\nEndometriosis is a long-term condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb starts to grow in other places, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes. It is a common condition that affects women of childbearing age. Endometriosis can cause painful periods, pain in the lower tummy or back, pain during or after sex, and can sometimes lead to difficulties getting pregnant.\n\n**How are GnRH analogues used to treat endometriosis?**\n\nGonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) are a type of hormone medicine used to treat the pain from endometriosis. They work by lowering the levels of certain hormones in the body, which can shrink the endometriosis tissue and reduce pain. However, a known side effect of GnRHas is that they can reduce bone strength (also called bone mineral density).\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out how well GnRHas work to relieve pain from endometriosis compared to other treatments, a placebo, or no treatment. We also wanted to understand their side effects, especially their effect on bone strength.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared GnRHas with other hormonal treatments, a placebo, or no treatment for women with endometriosis. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 72 studies that included a total of 7355 women with endometriosis.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n**GnRHas compared with a placebo (a dummy treatment)**\nWe found one study that compared GnRHas to a placebo. The evidence suggests that GnRHas may reduce different types of pain caused by endometriosis, including general pelvic pain, painful periods, and pain during sex. However, women taking GnRHas may be more likely to have hot flushes.\n\n**GnRHas compared with another medicine called danazol**\nWe are uncertain if GnRHas are better or worse than danazol for relieving pain after three months of treatment. After six months, GnRHas may slightly reduce some types of pelvic pain compared to danazol, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\n**GnRHas and bone strength**\nOne study compared women taking GnRHas alone with women taking GnRHas along with other medicines that help protect bones. The results suggest that taking GnRHas alone may lead to a slight decrease in bone strength after 12 months. However, we are very uncertain about this finding.\n\n**Other comparisons**\nWe did not find any studies that compared GnRHas with no treatment or with standard pain relief medicines.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because many of the studies did not clearly report how they were conducted, which makes it hard to judge if their results are reliable. Also, many of the studies were small, so we cannot be certain about the findings for pain relief and side effects.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2022."
