    "output": "After a kidney transplant, is it better to remove the urinary catheter early or late?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– We do not know if removing a urinary catheter early (before 5 days) or late (at 5 days or later) after a kidney transplant makes any difference to the risk of developing a urinary tract infection (a UTI) or other bladder problems. This is because there was not enough good-quality evidence to compare the two approaches.\n\n– The studies we found did not provide enough information about unwanted or harmful effects.\n\n– Better and larger studies are needed to understand the best time to remove a urinary catheter after a kidney transplant. This will help patients and doctors make more informed decisions.\n\n**What is a kidney transplant?**\n\nFor people with very serious, long-term kidney disease, a kidney transplant is the best treatment. During the surgery, doctors place a new kidney in the body. They also put a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into the bladder.\n\nThis catheter drains urine from the bladder, which helps the area where the new kidney is connected to the bladder to heal properly.\n\n**Why is the timing of catheter removal important?**\n\nWhile the catheter helps with healing, it can also create problems. It provides a path for bacteria to get into the bladder, which can cause a urinary tract infection (UTI). The longer the catheter stays in, the higher the risk of getting an infection.\n\nHowever, removing the catheter too soon could cause other problems, like leaks where the new kidney is attached. Doctors do not agree on the best time to remove the catheter.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if removing the urinary catheter early (in less than 5 days) is better or worse than removing it late (in 5 days or more) for people who have had a kidney transplant.\n\nWe were interested in how the timing of removal affected:\n– UTIs that cause symptoms (like pain when urinating)\n– bacteria in the urine without any symptoms\n– other serious bladder problems that need treatment\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared removing a urinary catheter before 5 days with removing it at 5 days or later in people who had a kidney transplant. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 2 studies that included a total of 197 people. One study was a full report, but the other was just a brief summary from a conference, so it had very little information. The studies did not follow people for very long, with none being followed for more than one month.\n\nBased on the limited evidence, we found that:\n\n– We do not know if removing the catheter early or late makes any difference to the number of people who have bacteria in their urine without symptoms.\n\n– The studies did not provide enough information for us to know about the effects on UTIs with symptoms or other serious bladder problems.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence. This is because the two studies we found were small and had problems in how they were designed and carried out. Also, one of the studies was only a brief summary, which meant we did not have much information about it. Because of these issues, we cannot draw firm conclusions.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023."
