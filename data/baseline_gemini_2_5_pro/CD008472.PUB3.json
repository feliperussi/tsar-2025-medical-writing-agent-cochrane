    "output": "Can temporarily blocking blood flow in a limb reduce the risks of major blood vessel surgery?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For people having major surgery on their blood vessels, a technique of temporarily blocking blood flow in a limb before the operation (called remote ischaemic preconditioning) probably makes little to no difference in the risk of serious problems like death, heart attack, kidney problems, or stroke after surgery.\n\n- The technique also probably does not affect how long people stay in the hospital or how long the surgery takes.\n\n- More and better studies are needed to be certain about the effects of this technique. Future studies should focus on outcomes that are most important to patients.\n\nWhat is major blood vessel surgery and why can it be risky?\n\nMajor blood vessel surgery, also called vascular surgery, is used to treat serious problems with the body's network of arteries and veins. These operations are often complex and, like any major surgery, come with risks of serious complications. These can include heart attacks, strokes, or kidney damage. Researchers are always looking for ways to make these surgeries safer for patients.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning?\n\nOne idea to protect the body during surgery is called remote ischaemic preconditioning. This is a simple technique done just before the main operation. A cuff, similar to a blood pressure cuff, is placed on an arm or leg. It is inflated to stop the blood flow for a few minutes and then deflated to let the blood flow again. This cycle is repeated a few times.\n\nThe theory is that these short periods of blocked blood flow can trigger the body's natural protective responses. This might help prepare important organs like the heart and kidneys for the stress of the surgery.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if using remote ischaemic preconditioning before major blood vessel surgery helps to reduce the risk of death or serious health problems compared to not using the technique.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared people who received remote ischaemic preconditioning before surgery with people who did not. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 14 studies that included a total of 1295 people having major blood vessel surgery. The people in the studies were between 64 and 76 years old on average, and most (84%) were men. The studies took place between 2003 and 2019.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n- **Death after surgery:** Remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little to no difference to the risk of dying around the time of surgery.\n\n- **Heart attack, kidney problems, and stroke:** The technique probably makes little to no difference to the risk of having a heart attack, developing kidney problems, or having a stroke.\n\n- **Limb loss:** The technique may make little to no difference to the risk of losing a limb after surgery, but we are less certain about this finding.\n\n- **Hospital stay and surgery time:** Remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little to no difference to how long people stay in the hospital or how long the surgery takes.\n\nThe studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of the technique itself.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate for most findings. This is because some of the studies were small, and their results were not always consistent with each other. It is also possible that we could not find all the studies that have been done on this topic, especially if they showed no benefit. This means we cannot be completely certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022."
