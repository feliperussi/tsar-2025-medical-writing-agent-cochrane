    "output": "For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), what are the benefits and risks of maintenance therapy after initial treatment?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), maintenance therapy with certain medicines probably helps to keep the cancer from getting worse for longer. However, these treatments probably do not help people live longer and may cause more serious unwanted effects than observation alone.\n\n– We are very uncertain about the effects of one type of maintenance therapy (alemtuzumab) because there was not enough information. We found no studies on newer maintenance therapies.\n\n– More research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and risks of maintenance therapies. Future studies should include newer medicines and look at how treatment affects people's quality of life.\n\n**What is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?**\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia, or CLL, is a slow-growing cancer of the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of leukaemia in adults. While initial treatments can put the cancer into remission (a period where the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or gone), CLL cannot be cured and often comes back over time.\n\n**What is maintenance therapy?**\n\nAfter a person finishes their initial treatment for CLL, they might be offered maintenance therapy. This is an ongoing, lower-dose treatment. The goal is to keep the cancer in remission for as long as possible and delay the time until it gets worse. Options after initial treatment include either watching and waiting (observation) or starting a maintenance therapy medicine. However, it is not clear how helpful or harmful these maintenance therapies are.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and risks of maintenance therapy for people with CLL who have completed their initial treatment. We were interested in how maintenance therapy affected:\n– how long people lived;\n– how long it took for the cancer to get worse;\n– people's quality of life;\n– serious unwanted effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different maintenance therapies against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or observation. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 11 studies that included 2393 people with CLL. The studies looked at three main types of maintenance therapy:\n– medicines called anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab or ofatumumab);\n– a medicine called an immunomodulatory drug (lenalidomide);\n– a medicine called an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody (alemtuzumab).\n\nThe studies lasted from about 1 year to over 6 years.\n\n**Main results**\n\n**Anti-CD20 medicines (rituximab or ofatumumab) versus observation**\nCompared to observation, these medicines:\n– probably make little to no difference to how long people live;\n– probably keep the cancer from getting worse for longer;\n– may increase serious unwanted effects;\n– may make little to no difference to people's quality of life.\n\n**Immunomodulatory medicine (lenalidomide) versus placebo or observation**\nCompared to placebo or observation, lenalidomide:\n– probably makes little to no difference to how long people live;\n– probably causes a large delay in the cancer getting worse;\n– may increase serious unwanted effects;\n– probably increases all unwanted effects slightly.\nNo studies looked at how this medicine affected quality of life.\n\n**Anti-CD52 medicine (alemtuzumab) versus observation**\nWe are very uncertain about the effects of alemtuzumab. Only one very small study looked at this medicine. It is unclear if this treatment has an effect on how long it takes for the cancer to get worse. The study did not report on how long people lived, quality of life, or unwanted effects.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. For some findings, our confidence is only moderate, while for others it is low or very low. This is because some studies did not clearly describe how they were conducted, and some of the results are based on only a few small studies. This means we cannot be certain about the results. We also found no studies that looked at newer types of maintenance therapies that are now available.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022."
