    "output": "Does closing internal gaps during weight-loss surgery prevent future problems?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For people having a type of weight-loss surgery called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sewing internal gaps closed during the operation may reduce the risk of a serious future complication called an internal hernia.\n- Closing these gaps may make little to no difference to the risk of other complications or death shortly after surgery. However, it may lead to a slightly longer hospital stay, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- We need more and better studies to be more confident about the true benefits and risks of closing these gaps during surgery.\n\nWhat is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery?\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a common type of weight-loss surgery. During this operation, surgeons make the stomach smaller and change the path of the small intestine. This helps people feel full with less food and absorb fewer calories.\n\nWhy is preventing an internal hernia important?\n\nThe changes made during gastric bypass surgery can create small gaps inside the abdomen. Sometimes, a part of the intestine can slip through one of these gaps and get trapped. This is called an internal hernia. It can cause severe pain and block the intestine, which is a medical emergency that requires another operation.\n\nSurgeons have wondered if sewing these gaps closed during the original weight-loss surgery could prevent internal hernias from happening later. However, they were also concerned that closing the gaps might cause other problems, like kinking the intestine.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if closing these internal gaps during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is better than leaving them open. We looked at the effects on:\n- preventing internal hernias that cause a blockage;\n- the risk of other problems happening during or soon after surgery;\n- the length of time people stay in the hospital.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared closing the gaps with not closing them in people having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 3 studies that included a total of 3010 people. The studies compared sewing the gaps closed with non-absorbable stitches to leaving the gaps open.\n\nOur main findings were:\n\n- **Internal hernia:** Closing the gaps may reduce the risk of developing an internal hernia that needs another operation.\n- **Complications and death after surgery:** Closing the gaps may make little to no difference to the risk of having other complications in the 30 days after surgery. We do not know if closing the gaps affects the risk of death in the 30 days after surgery because we are very uncertain about the results.\n- **Complications during surgery:** We do not know if closing the gaps affects the risk of complications during the operation because we are very uncertain about the results.\n- **Length of hospital stay:** People whose gaps were closed may have a slightly longer hospital stay, but we are very uncertain about this finding.\n- **Pain after surgery:** The studies did not provide enough information for us to assess long-term pain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. Our findings are based on only a small number of studies. This means we cannot be certain about the results, and future research could change our conclusions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024."
