    "output": "What are people's views and experiences of general health checks?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– General health checks are popular with the public, healthcare providers, and policymakers. People often feel the checks motivate them to live healthier lives and provide reassurance, even though other research shows these checks have little to no effect on preventing death or serious illness.\n– People's decisions to have a health check are influenced by their personal beliefs about health, trust in their healthcare provider, and practical issues like time and cost. For health checks to be successful, people felt it was vital that providers were skilled and understood their cultural background.\n– Because many people value health checks, simply stopping them may not be the best approach. Future discussions should explore what people find useful about these checks and consider offering different ways to meet those needs.\n\n**What are general health checks?**\n\nGeneral health checks are a set of tests offered to people who do not have any symptoms of illness. The goal is to check a person's overall health and find potential health problems early. These checks are a common part of healthcare in many countries and can be offered through national programs or private companies.\n\n**Why did we do this review?**\n\nA previous Cochrane review from 2019 looked at studies measuring the effectiveness of general health checks. It found that these checks have little or no effect on preventing death, cancer, or heart and blood vessel diseases.\n\nDespite this, health checks remain very popular. We wanted to understand why. In this review, we looked at studies that explored the opinions and experiences of different groups of people involved with health checks. These groups included:\n– the public (clients)\n– healthcare providers (like doctors and nurses)\n– healthcare managers and policymakers (people who plan and fund health services)\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that used methods like interviews and focus groups to understand people's views on general health checks. We found 146 relevant studies and selected 36 of them for a detailed analysis. We combined their findings and rated our confidence in the results.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nThe 36 studies we analyzed were conducted in various settings, including local health clinics, workplaces, and community centers. Most studies were from high-income countries in Europe, but about a third were from middle-income countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. The studies included the views of the public, healthcare providers, and health system managers.\n\n**People's reasons for having a health check**\nWe are confident that people's personal beliefs about disease and prevention played a big part in whether they decided to have a health check.\n\nThe checks probably motivated many people to make healthier lifestyle choices, like improving their diet or exercising more. They also probably gave people reassurance about their health. However, some people were less likely to attend, probably because they feared getting bad news or preferred to see a doctor only when they felt sick. Practical issues like not having enough time or worrying about the cost of follow-up treatment also probably stopped some people from attending.\n\n**What makes a good health check?**\nWe are confident that both the public and healthcare providers felt it was very important for the person doing the check to be skilled and to understand their cultural background.\n\nHealthcare providers reported several challenges that probably made it difficult to offer health checks. These included not having enough time, staff, or money. People who had the checks said that having their results explained clearly was a key part of the process, but we have little confidence in this finding.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the findings varies. We are highly confident in some findings, for example, that people's personal beliefs about health are important in their decision to get a check-up. However, we have low confidence in the findings about the wider reasons why health systems decide to offer general health checks. The evidence comes from studies exploring people's views, not from studies that measure the effects of the checks.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022."
