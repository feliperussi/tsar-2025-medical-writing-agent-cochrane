    "output": "Can education support services help children and teenagers with long-term health conditions with their schooling?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– We do not know if education support services help children and teenagers with long-term health conditions to stay engaged with school or improve their academic results. This is because there is not enough good-quality evidence. No studies reported on any unwanted effects of these services.\n\n– Education support services may slightly improve the mental health (measured as self-esteem) of children and teenagers with long-term health conditions.\n\n– More and better-quality research is needed to understand if these support services are helpful, who they help most, and what types of support work best.\n\n**What are long-term health conditions and how do they affect schooling?**\n\nLong-term health conditions, also called chronic conditions, are illnesses that last for a long time and are rarely cured completely. These conditions can make it hard for children and teenagers to go to school regularly.\n\nMissing school can affect a young person's learning, friendships, and general well-being. Education support services aim to help children stay connected to school and their learning when their health condition causes them to be absent.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if education support services help children and teenagers with long-term health conditions to:\n– stay engaged with school;\n– and improve their academic results.\n\nWe also wanted to know about the effects on mental health, quality of life, and returning to school.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that looked at education support services for children and teenagers (aged 4 to 18) with long-term health conditions. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 4 studies with a total of 359 children and teenagers. All the studies focused on specific conditions. Three studies included children with cancer, and one study included children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which is a condition that affects behaviour.\n\n**Main results**\n\nWe are very uncertain if education support services have an effect on school engagement. It is also unclear if these services have an effect on academic achievement, as the studies found conflicting results.\n\nWe do not know if these services help children return to school after being away for a long time.\n\nHowever, education support services may slightly improve mental health, which was measured as self-esteem in the studies.\n\nNo studies measured or reported on quality of life or any unwanted effects of the support services.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence. This is because there were problems with how the studies were designed and carried out. Also, we only found a few small studies, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results.\n\nThe evidence only covered children with cancer or ADHD, so the findings may not apply to children with other long-term health conditions.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2021."
