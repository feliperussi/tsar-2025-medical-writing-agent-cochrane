    "output": "What are the benefits and risks of using digital health tools to manage obesity in children and adolescents?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– When used with standard care (like advice on diet and exercise), digital health tools may slightly reduce body fat in children and adolescents in the short term. We do not know if these tools have any unwanted or harmful effects because the studies did not report on them.\n\n– It is unclear if using digital health tools alone, without standard care, has any effect on body fat or other health measures.\n\n– More and better research is needed to understand the long-term effects of digital health tools. Future studies should include more children, last longer, and check for any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\n**What is childhood obesity?**\n\nObesity in children and teenagers is a serious health problem around the world. It means having too much body fat, which can increase the risk of developing long-term health conditions like heart disease and diabetes later in life. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents were living with overweight or obesity.\n\n**What are digital health tools?**\n\nDigital health tools use technology to help people manage their health. For managing obesity, these tools can include:\n– websites with health information;\n– mobile phone or tablet apps to track food or activity;\n– special video games that require physical movement (sometimes called 'exergaming');\n– wearable devices that monitor activity, like smartwatches; and\n– health advice given over video calls (telehealth).\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if using digital health tools helps children and adolescents with obesity. We looked at two situations:\n1. When digital tools are used together with standard care (like seeing a doctor or dietitian).\n2. When digital tools are used on their own.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. In these types of studies, people are put into different treatment groups by chance. This helps make sure the groups are similar and the results are reliable.\n\nThe studies we looked for compared digital health tools against standard care for managing obesity in children and adolescents. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 15 studies that included a total of 911 children and adolescents. Most of the people in the studies were between 10 and 19 years old. The studies took place in several different countries, but most were in the USA. Some studies were short (less than 6 months), while others were longer. The digital tools in the studies focused on diet, physical activity, or both.\n\nWe split the studies into two groups for our main findings.\n\n**Digital tools combined with standard care**\nEight studies compared using a digital tool alongside standard care versus using standard care alone. We found that using digital tools with standard care probably reduces body fat slightly. The effect on other health measures, like body weight or physical activity levels, is unclear. None of the studies reported on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\n**Digital tools used alone**\nSeven studies compared using a digital tool on its own versus standard care. It is unclear if using digital tools alone has any effect on body fat or other health measures. None of these studies reported on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. This is because we found only a small number of studies, and these studies did not include many children or adolescents. Also, most studies were short, so we do not know about the long-term effects of using these digital tools.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025."
