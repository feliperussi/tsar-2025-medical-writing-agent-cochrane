    "output": "What helps to reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in care homes?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Programmes that aim to change the culture of a care home to use fewer physical restraints probably reduce how often residents are restrained, especially with belts. These programmes may have little to no effect on the number of falls. No unwanted harmful effects were reported.\n– We are uncertain if simply educating staff about restraints helps to reduce their use. Providing staff with information about a person's risk of falling may make little to no difference to how often restraints are used.\n– All the studies we found were in care homes. More research is needed to find out how to reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who receive care in their own homes.\n\n**What are physical restraints?**\n\nPhysical restraints are things used to limit a person's movement. For older people in long-term care, this often includes bedrails to stop them from getting out of bed, or belts used to keep them in a chair. They are often used with the aim of preventing falls and keeping people safe.\n\n**Why is reducing the use of physical restraints important?**\n\nAlthough they are meant to protect people, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are often not effective and can be unsafe. They can cause injuries, reduce a person's independence, and cause distress. For these reasons, experts recommend that their use should be avoided as much as possible.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out what approaches work best to prevent or reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who need long-term care, either in a care home or in their own home. This review updates our previous review from 2011.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that tested different ways to reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care. We compared and summarized the results of these studies. We also assessed how confident we could be in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 11 studies that included 19,003 older people. The average age was about 85 years. All the studies took place in long-term care homes, and all of them included people with dementia. We found no studies about people receiving care in their own homes.\n\nThe studies looked at three main types of approaches:\n\n1.  **Organisational programmes** that aimed to create a \"least-restraint\" policy in the care home. These programmes included several parts, such as educating staff, training special staff members to lead the change, and changing the care home's rules and culture.\n2.  **Simple educational programmes** that aimed to increase staff knowledge and change their attitudes about using restraints.\n3.  A programme that **gave staff information** about each resident's risk of falling.\n\n**Main results**\n\n*   **Organisational programmes to create a \"least-restraint\" policy**\n    – probably reduce the number of residents who are restrained.\n    – probably cause a large reduction in the use of belts to restrain people.\n    – may make little to no difference to the number of falls or injuries from falls.\n    – probably make little to no difference to the number of calming medicines (called psychotropic medications) that are prescribed.\n    – make little to no difference to a person's quality of life.\n    – One study reported on unwanted harmful effects and found that none occurred.\n\n*   **Simple educational programmes for staff**\n    – We are uncertain if simply educating staff reduces the use of physical restraints because the results from the studies were inconsistent.\n    – These programmes may make little to no difference to the number of falls, injuries from falls, or feelings of agitation.\n    – None of the studies reported on any serious unwanted effects.\n\n*   **Programmes providing information on fall risk**\n    – One study looked at this approach. It found that providing staff with information about a person's risk of falling may make little to no difference to how often restraints are used or how many falls happen. The study did not report on unwanted effects.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate for some findings and low or very low for others. This is because there were some problems with how the studies were carried out. For example, in some studies, it was not clear how people were assigned to different groups, which could affect the results. Also, the results from studies testing simple educational programmes were inconsistent, which makes it hard to draw clear conclusions.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022."
