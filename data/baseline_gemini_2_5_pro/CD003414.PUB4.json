    "output": "Which method is best for preparing the womb for frozen embryo transfer?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– We do not know if one method of preparing the womb for frozen embryo transfer is better than another for increasing the chance of a live birth or reducing the risk of miscarriage. The evidence we found was not strong enough to show a clear difference between the methods.\n\n– The main methods compared were: following a woman's natural monthly cycle, using hormone medicines to prepare the womb lining, and using medicines to cause an egg to be released (ovulation). None of these methods showed a clear benefit over the others.\n\n– Because the evidence is not very certain, more and larger studies are needed. Future research could help people and their doctors decide which method of preparing the womb is the most effective and safest.\n\n**What is frozen embryo transfer?**\n\nMany people who have difficulty getting pregnant use in vitro fertilisation (IVF). During IVF, eggs are collected from a woman's ovaries and mixed with sperm in a lab to create embryos. Sometimes, more embryos are created than can be transferred to the womb at one time. These extra embryos can be frozen and stored for later use.\n\nTransferring a thawed frozen embryo into the womb is called a frozen embryo transfer (FET). Using frozen embryos can increase the total chance of pregnancy from one cycle of egg collection and is often less expensive than starting a new IVF cycle.\n\n**How is the womb prepared for frozen embryo transfer?**\n\nFor an embryo to attach to the womb and grow, the lining of the womb must be ready. There are several ways doctors can prepare the womb lining for a frozen embryo transfer:\n\n– **Natural cycle:** The transfer is timed to match the woman's natural monthly cycle, when the womb lining thickens on its own. Sometimes, an injection of a hormone called HCG is used to help time the transfer precisely.\n\n– **Hormone therapy (HT):** The woman takes hormone medicines, usually oestrogen and progesterone, to build up the womb lining. Sometimes, another medicine is given first to stop the body's own hormones from interfering.\n\n– **Ovulation induction:** The woman takes medicines to stimulate her ovaries to release an egg, which helps prepare the womb lining naturally.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out which method of preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer works best. We were most interested in which method leads to the highest number of live births and the lowest number of miscarriages.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of preparing the womb for frozen embryo transfer. The studies we looked for were randomized controlled trials, where people are placed into different treatment groups by chance. This type of study provides the most reliable evidence. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 32 studies that included 6352 women having frozen embryo transfers.\n\nThe evidence from these studies was not strong enough to show whether one method was better than another.\n\n– **Natural cycle compared to hormone therapy:** We are uncertain if there is any difference in the rate of live births or miscarriages between using a natural cycle and using hormone therapy.\n\n– **Natural cycle compared to hormone therapy with extra medicines:** Using a natural cycle probably makes little to no difference to the chance of a live birth compared to using hormone therapy with an extra medicine to suppress the body's own hormones.\n\n– **Different types of natural cycles:** We are uncertain if adding a hormone injection (HCG) to a natural cycle makes any difference to the chance of a live birth.\n\nOverall, for all the different methods we compared, we could not find clear evidence that one was better or safer than any other.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is low to very low. This is because many of the studies were small and did not have enough pregnancies or miscarriages for us to be certain about the results. Also, some studies did not provide information on all the outcomes we were interested in, and we had some concerns about how the studies were carried out. Because of these limitations, we cannot be sure about the findings.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022."
