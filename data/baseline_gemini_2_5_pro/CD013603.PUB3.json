    "output": "What does research show about healthcare workers' experiences when different health services are joined together?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Research that looks at healthcare workers' views on joining up different primary health services is very diverse. Studies have been done in many different countries and have looked at various health conditions and a wide range of healthcare staff.\n\n– Because the research is so varied, it is difficult to draw single, clear conclusions about healthcare workers' experiences or how their views affect the success of these programs.\n\n– This review provides a map of the existing research. Future studies can use this map to ask more specific questions about how to best support healthcare workers when joining up health services.\n\n**What is primary healthcare?**\n\nPrimary healthcare is usually the first care a person receives for a health issue. It includes services from family doctors, local clinics, and community health workers. It is the main point of contact most people have with the health system.\n\n**What does it mean to 'join up' or 'integrate' health services?**\n\nSometimes, different health services are provided separately. For example, a person might have to go to one clinic for a diabetes check-up and another for mental health support. 'Integrated care' means joining these services together. This helps people get more of the care they need in one place or in a more coordinated way. Joining up services is seen as a way to improve healthcare around the world.\n\n**Why are healthcare workers' views important?**\n\nHealthcare workers are the people who provide this joined-up care. Their experiences, challenges, and opinions can have a big impact on whether these changes are successful. Understanding their views can help planners create better health services for everyone.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to create a map of all the research that has explored healthcare workers' experiences and perceptions of integrated primary healthcare. We wanted to understand what kind of research has been done, where it has been done, and what topics it has covered.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that used methods like interviews and group discussions to understand the views of healthcare workers. We then organized and described these studies to see what the overall research landscape looks like.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 184 studies from 37 different countries around the world. Most of these studies were published in the last 12 years.\n\nOur main finding was that the research on this topic is extremely varied. The studies looked at:\n– Different health areas where services were joined up, such as mental health, HIV care, and services for mothers and children.\n– A wide range of healthcare workers, including managers, doctors, nurses, and community health workers.\n– Different ways of joining up services. Some services were fully combined, while others were just linked to work more closely together.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe main purpose of this review was to map out the research, and our key finding is that the studies are very diverse. This diversity is also a limitation. Because the studies are so different from each other, we cannot combine their results to make general conclusions about healthcare workers' experiences. This review describes what research exists, but it cannot tell us what works best.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020."
