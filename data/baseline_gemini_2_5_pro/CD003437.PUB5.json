    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of treatments for depression after a stroke?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Medicines and talking therapies may help reduce depression after a stroke, but we are very uncertain about this. Medicines may cause unwanted effects on the nervous system (like dizziness) and the stomach.\n\n– Adding a type of brain stimulation to medicine may also help reduce depression. However, using brain stimulation on its own may have little to no effect.\n\n– We need more and better-quality research to be sure about the benefits and harms of these treatments for people with depression after a stroke.\n\n**What is depression after a stroke?**\n\nA stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. Many people who have a stroke experience depression afterwards. Feeling depressed can make it much harder for a person to recover from their stroke.\n\n**How is depression after a stroke treated?**\n\nThere are several types of treatment available. These include:\n– medicines\n– talking therapies (where people talk with a trained professional to help with their thoughts and feelings)\n– non-invasive brain stimulation (a treatment that uses gentle electrical currents or magnetic fields to stimulate certain areas of the brain from outside the head)\n\nThese treatments can be used on their own or together.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of these different treatments for people with depression after a stroke. We looked at studies where treatments were used alone or in combination.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared these treatments with a dummy treatment (placebo), a sham (fake) stimulation, or usual care. We compared and summarized the results of these studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 65 studies that included 5831 people with depression after a stroke. The studies looked at medicines, talking therapies, and brain stimulation, either alone or combined.\n\n**Medicines**\nIt is unclear if medicines have an effect on reducing depression compared to a dummy treatment. It is also unclear if they cause unwanted effects, but some studies reported problems with the nervous system (like dizziness) and the stomach.\n\n**Non-invasive brain stimulation**\nThis treatment may have little to no effect on depression compared to a sham stimulation, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n\n**Talking therapies**\nIt is unclear if talking therapies have an effect on reducing depression compared to usual care.\n\n**Combined treatments**\nAdding non-invasive brain stimulation to medicine may reduce depression compared to taking medicine alone. We did not find enough information about other treatment combinations to draw any conclusions.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence from these studies. This is because many of the studies were small and had weaknesses in how they were carried out. Because of these limitations, we cannot be certain about the results. The findings could change when more research is done.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022."
