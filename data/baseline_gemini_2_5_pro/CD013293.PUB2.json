    "output": "What is the best way to treat blocked blood vessel access for people on kidney dialysis?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– It is unclear which treatment is best for unblocking blood vessel access for people on kidney dialysis. We do not know for sure about the benefits or unwanted effects of the different treatments because there is not enough good-quality evidence.\n\n– One type of procedure to remove blood clots (surgical thrombectomy) may keep the access open for 30 days longer than another type (mechanical thrombectomy), but we are very uncertain about this finding.\n\n– More and better research is needed. Future studies should compare the different treatments and look at results that are important to people on dialysis, such as how well the treatments work and if they cause any problems.\n\n**What is blood vessel access for kidney dialysis?**\n\nPeople whose kidneys have stopped working properly may need a treatment called haemodialysis. This is a way of cleaning the blood using a machine.\n\nTo connect a person to a dialysis machine, a surgeon often creates a special connection point between an artery and a vein, usually in the arm. This is called an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG). Having this 'dialysis access' makes it easier and safer to get the large amount of blood flow needed for dialysis.\n\n**What is the problem?**\n\nSometimes, this dialysis access can get blocked by a blood clot. When this happens, the person cannot have their dialysis treatment. They may need to have a temporary tube (called a catheter) put into a large vein in their neck or chest. This can lead to a higher risk of infections and other serious problems.\n\nThere are several ways to treat a blocked dialysis access, including:\n– procedures to remove the clot (called thrombectomy)\n– medicines to dissolve the clot (called thrombolysis)\n– other surgery to fix the blockage\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out which treatments are best and safest for unblocking clotted dialysis access in people on haemodialysis. We wanted to know which treatments were best at keeping the access open and working, and what unwanted effects they might have.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for blocked dialysis access. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 14 studies that included a total of 1176 people. The studies compared different types of clot removal, clot-dissolving medicines, and surgical procedures.\n\nOverall, we did not find enough evidence to be sure if any one treatment was better than another.\n\nFor most of the results we looked at, including how often a treatment failed or caused major or minor problems, the evidence was very uncertain. This means we do not know which treatment works best or is safest. Many important outcomes, like how the blockage affected a person's ability to have successful dialysis, were not reported in the studies.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence. Our confidence is low because most of the studies were not well designed and included only a small number of people. This makes it difficult to be certain about the results. Future research is very likely to change our conclusions.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024."
