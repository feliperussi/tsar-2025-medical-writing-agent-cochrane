    "output": "Is nasal high flow therapy a good first treatment for premature babies with breathing problems?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n– Compared with another type of breathing support called CPAP, nasal high flow therapy probably leads to more treatment failures (meaning babies need to be switched to a different support). However, it probably does not increase the need for a breathing machine. It also probably reduces nose injuries and a type of collapsed lung (pneumothorax). It may make little to no difference to the risk of death or long-term lung problems.\n\n– Compared with a different breathing support called NIPPV, nasal high flow therapy probably reduces nose injuries. It probably makes little difference to treatment failure or the need for a breathing machine. We are very uncertain about its effect on death or long-term lung problems when compared to NIPPV.\n\n– Most of the evidence is for babies born at 28 weeks of pregnancy or later. More research is needed to understand if nasal high flow therapy is helpful and safe for very premature babies (born before 28 weeks).\n\n**What are breathing problems in premature babies?**\n\nBabies who are born too early (premature) often have lungs that are not fully developed. This can cause breathing problems, a condition known as respiratory distress syndrome. These babies often need help to breathe. This help is called respiratory support. The goal is to help them breathe without using a breathing machine, which involves putting a tube down their windpipe (mechanical ventilation).\n\n**What are the different types of breathing support?**\n\nThere are several ways to give breathing support without a breathing machine. These are called non-invasive methods because they do not involve putting a tube down the windpipe.\n\n– **Nasal high flow (nHF) therapy** gives warm, moist air with extra oxygen through small, soft tubes that sit just inside the baby's nose.\n\n– **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** uses gentle, constant air pressure through a mask or tubes in the nose to keep the baby's airways open.\n\n– **Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)** gives breaths of air at a set rate through a mask or tubes in the nose.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if using nasal high flow therapy as the first breathing support for premature babies is better or worse than other non-invasive methods. We were interested in its effects on:\n\n– death or developing a long-term lung condition called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD);\n– treatment failure (when the baby needs to be switched to another type of support);\n– the need for a breathing machine;\n– and any unwanted effects, like injury to the nose or a collapsed lung.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared nasal high flow therapy with other types of non-invasive breathing support in premature babies. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe found 13 studies that included 2540 premature babies. Most studies compared nasal high flow therapy with CPAP. A few studies compared it with NIPPV. Very few babies in the studies were born extremely early (before 28 weeks of pregnancy).\n\n**Nasal high flow compared with CPAP**\n\nCompared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy:\n– probably increases the number of treatment failures.\n– probably makes little to no difference to the number of babies who need a breathing machine.\n– probably reduces injuries to the baby's nose.\n– probably reduces the risk of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).\n– may make little to no difference to the risk of death or long-term lung problems (BPD).\n\n**Nasal high flow compared with NIPPV**\n\nCompared to NIPPV, nasal high flow therapy:\n– probably reduces injuries to the baby's nose.\n– probably makes little to no difference to treatment failure or the need for a breathing machine.\n– We are very uncertain if it makes any difference to the risk of death or long-term lung problems.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate for some findings but low or very low for others. This is because some studies were not conducted well, which could affect the results. Also, some studies were too small for us to be certain about the effects.\n\nA major limitation is that very few extremely premature babies (born before 28 weeks) were included in the studies. Therefore, our findings mainly apply to babies born at 28 weeks or later.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022."
