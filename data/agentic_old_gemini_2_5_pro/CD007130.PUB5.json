    "output": "For people with heart problems, is a recovery program (cardiac rehabilitation) at home as good as a program at a hospital or clinic?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with heart problems, recovery programs at home appear to be as good as programs at a hospital. We found little to no difference between the two approaches in the number of deaths, a person's ability to exercise, or their quality of life (their overall enjoyment of life).\n- People were just as likely to complete home-based programs as they were to complete center-based programs. The costs for both types of programs were similar.\n- The studies we reviewed were mostly short-term. We need more research to see if the effects of home-based and center-based programs are still similar over a longer period and for people with other types of heart conditions.\n\nWhat is cardiac rehabilitation?\nDiseases that affect the heart or blood vessels (cardiovascular disease) are the most common cause of death around the world. After a heart problem, like a heart attack or surgery (an operation to repair a part of the body), doctors often offer people a program to restore their health (rehabilitation). These programs, which are related to the heart (cardiac), aim to improve health and prevent future illness.\n\nIn the past, people attended these programs at a hospital or community center. To make it easier for people to join, researchers created home-based programs. These are sometimes supported by technology like phones or the internet (telehealth).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how home-based cardiac rehabilitation compares with supervised, center-based programs. We looked at how they affected:\n- death (mortality) and illness (morbidity);\n- a person's ability to exercise;\n- their health-related quality of life (a measure of a person's well-being and ability to do daily activities);\n- risk factors for heart disease that can be changed.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials, where researchers randomly assign people to treatment groups. These studies compared home-based cardiac rehabilitation with programs run in a hospital or community center. We compared and combined the results from these studies and then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 24 studies with 3046 people. The people in the studies had experienced a sudden blockage of blood to the heart (acute myocardial infarction), a procedure to restore blood flow to the heart (revascularisation), or a condition where the heart can't pump enough blood (heart failure).\n\nThe studies compared home-based programs with supervised center-based programs. Most studies were short and usually followed people for up to 12 months. Only 3 studies reported results beyond this period.\n\nWe found that home-based programs supported by healthcare staff may make little to no difference to the number of people who die in the year after the program compared to center-based programs. They also may make little to no difference to a person's ability to exercise. Beyond one year, home-based programs probably make little to no difference to exercise ability. There may also be little to no difference between the two program types in how they affect people's quality of life or how likely people are to complete the program.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. This is because people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, which could have created flaws in the study design (bias). Also, not all studies provided data for all the results (outcomes) we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022."
