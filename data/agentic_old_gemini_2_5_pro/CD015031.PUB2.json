    "output": "For treating a large hole in the back of the eye (macular hole), is one type of surgery (the 'flap' technique) better than another (the 'peeling' technique)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For people with a large hole in the back of the eye (macular hole), a surgical technique that creates a flap of tissue to cover the hole (the 'flap' technique) may improve vision more than the standard 'peeling' technique, when measured 3 months or more after surgery. The 'flap' technique also probably increases the chances of the hole closing. We did not find clear evidence about unwanted effects for either type of surgery.\n- The evidence comes from a small number of studies. We need larger, better-designed studies to be more certain about the benefits and potential harms of the 'flap' technique compared to the 'peeling' technique.\n\nWhat is a large macular hole and how is it treated?\n\nThe macula is the small, central part of the retina (the light-sensitive layer of nerve tissue at the back of the eye). It is responsible for the sharp, detailed vision we need for reading and recognizing faces. A macular hole (a small break in the macula) can cause blurred and distorted central vision. When these holes are large, they can be difficult to repair. The standard treatment is a type of eye surgery called a pars plana vitrectomy (a procedure where the gel-like substance inside the eye is removed so the surgeon can repair the retina). This surgery involves peeling away a very thin layer of tissue, called the internal limiting membrane or ILM (a delicate layer on the surface of the retina), to encourage the hole to close. However, this technique is not always successful for large holes. A newer technique involves using the ILM to create a small flap that is tucked into the hole to help it heal.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how the newer 'inverted ILM flap' technique compares with the standard 'ILM peeling' technique for treating people with large macular holes. We wanted to know which technique was more effective (how well a treatment works) for closing the macular hole and improving vision. We also looked at the safety of the treatments.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned randomly to 2 or more treatment groups). These studies compared 2 surgical techniques for repairing large holes in the retina. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nOur review included 4 studies with a total of 275 participants (285 eyes) who had a large macular hole. The studies were conducted in India, Poland, and Mexico. Most participants were women and older adults. The studies compared 2 surgical techniques: one using an 'inverted flap' and the other using standard 'peeling'.\n\nThe inverted flap technique probably increases the chance of the hole closing compared to the standard peeling technique. In terms of vision after surgery (a procedure to repair a part of the body), the inverted flap technique may improve vision at 3 months or more. It is unclear if it has an effect on vision at 1 month.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, not all studies provided data (information collected from people in a study) about all the outcomes we were interested in. The evidence is also based on a few small studies, so we cannot be certain about the findings.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\n\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022."
