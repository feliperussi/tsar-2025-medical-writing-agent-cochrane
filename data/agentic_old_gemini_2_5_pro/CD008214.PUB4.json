    "output": "Does adding an injected eye medicine (anti-VEGF drug) to eye surgery (vitrectomy) improve sight and reduce problems for people with severe diabetic eye disease?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people with severe eye problems from diabetes, adding an injected eye medicine to eye surgery (vitrectomy) may improve sight. It also lowers the risk of certain problems, such as bleeding in the eye after the operation and tears in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) during the operation. The review found few unwanted effects from this treatment.\n- We need more research to know if this treatment helps people avoid more surgery. Future studies should also check how the treatment affects a person's quality of life related to their vision (how a person's daily life is affected by their sight), as the studies in this review did not look at this.\n\nWHAT IS SEVERE DIABETIC EYE DISEASE?\nSevere diabetic eye disease, or proliferative diabetic retinopathy, is a serious condition that can affect people with diabetes. It causes new, weak blood vessels to grow on the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye). These vessels can bleed or create scar tissue that pulls on the retina. This can lead to a severe loss of sight or blindness.\n\nHOW ARE COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETIC EYE DISEASE TREATED?\nWhen these problems become severe, people may need a type of eye surgery called vitrectomy. In this operation, a surgeon removes the vitreous (the clear jelly inside the eye) to treat retina problems. However, this surgery can cause its own complications, like bleeding inside the eye, tears in the retina, or the retina pulling away from its normal position. These issues can limit sight, slow healing, and require more surgery. To try and lower these risks, doctors sometimes inject a medicine called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) into the eye before surgery. Anti-VEGF drugs can shrink these unusual blood vessels. This may make them easier to remove and lessen bleeding during and after the operation.\n\nWHAT DID WE WANT TO FIND OUT?\nWe wanted to find out if using anti-VEGF medicines before or during vitrectomy surgery helps people with complications from severe diabetic eye disease. We were interested in whether this treatment improves sight and reduces complications, such as bleeding in the eye or the need for more surgery.\n\nWHAT DID WE DO?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving an anti-VEGF drug before or during eye surgery with surgery alone for complications of diabetic eye disease. We then combined and summarized the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWHAT DID WE FIND?\nWe found 28 studies with a total of 1914 eyes from people with complications of severe diabetic eye disease. The studies compared giving anti-VEGF injections before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) with vitrectomy alone.\n\nFor people having eye surgery for complications of diabetic eye disease, an anti-VEGF injection given before or during the operation:\n\n- greatly reduces bleeding in the eye more than 4 weeks after surgery and tears of the retina during the operation. For example, without the injection, about 23 out of 100 people had late bleeding, compared to about 10 out of 100 people who received the injection.\n- probably greatly reduces bleeding in the eye within 4 weeks of surgery. Without the injection, about 31 out of 100 people had early bleeding, compared to about 12 out of 100 people who received the injection.\n- may improve sight 6 months after surgery.\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain about whether the injection affects the need for silicone oil during surgery. Silicone oil is a substance put into the eye to hold the retina in place. It is also uncertain if the treatment affects the need for more surgery for bleeding or a detached retina.\n\nWHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for two main reasons. First, people in the studies may have known which treatment they received, which could have affected the results. Second, there were not enough studies to be certain about all the findings.\n\nHOW UP TO DATE IS THIS EVIDENCE?\nThis evidence is up to date to June 2022."
