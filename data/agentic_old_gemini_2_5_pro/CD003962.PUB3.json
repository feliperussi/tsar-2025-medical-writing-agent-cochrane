    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of treatments that do not suppress the immune system for people with IgA nephropathy (a type of kidney disease)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with IgA nephropathy, certain blood pressure medicines seem to be the most helpful treatment that does not suppress the immune system. These medicines, a group called RAS inhibitors, probably reduce proteinuria (too much protein in the urine), which is a sign of kidney damage.\n- The risk of unwanted effects from RAS inhibitors may be no different from taking no treatment. Removing the tonsils (a surgery called a tonsillectomy) may help reduce protein and blood in the urine for some people, but this has only been studied in Japanese people.\n- The studies in this review were small and did not last long enough for us to be certain about long-term effects on important outcomes like kidney failure (when the kidneys stop working). We need larger and longer studies.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and how is it treated?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common disease that damages the kidneys. For many people, the damage gets worse slowly over many years and can lead to kidney failure. One way to treat IgAN is with treatments that do not suppress the body's immune system. These treatments aim to lower blood pressure and reduce proteinuria. Examples include blood pressure medicines, anticoagulants (blood thinners), dietary changes, surgery to remove the tonsils, and herbal medicines. Because the disease progresses slowly, it is difficult to study these treatments, and it is unclear which are most helpful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of different treatments that do not suppress the immune system for adults and children with IgA nephropathy.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called clinical trials to find the benefits and harms of these treatments. We collected and combined the results from the studies we found. We then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 80 studies with 4856 adults and children. All participants had IgA nephropathy confirmed by a biopsy (where a small piece of kidney tissue is examined). The studies looked at many treatments, including medicines to lower blood pressure (mainly a type called RAS inhibitors), surgery to remove the tonsils, blood thinners, fish oil, traditional Chinese medicines, and antimalarials (drugs for malaria that can also reduce inflammation). The studies compared these treatments against a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or standard care. Most studies were small and too short to show long-term benefits.\n\nMain results\nMedicines that lower blood pressure (specifically RAS inhibitors) appear to be the most helpful treatment. Compared with a placebo or no treatment, RAS inhibitors probably reduce the amount of protein in the urine. However, they may make little to no difference to major outcomes like kidney failure. The risk of unwanted effects seems to be similar to taking no treatment. For some people, removing their tonsils in addition to standard care may lead to remission (the disappearance of protein and blood in the urine). However, these findings are only from studies in Japanese people. It is not clear if they apply to people of other ethnicities. For other treatments like blood thinners, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines, the evidence did not show a clear benefit compared to standard care. We are uncertain if antimalarial therapy affects protein in the urine, and we are very uncertain about its unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. There were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies we found were very small. In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Finally, some findings were based on specific groups of people, so the results may not apply to everyone.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023."
