    "output": "What are the benefits and harms of different types of nerve blocks (shots to numb an area) for pain after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- From the evidence we have, different types of nerve blocks (shots to numb an area) seem to work just as well for pain after breast cancer surgery. The studies we looked at did not report any serious unwanted effects from the nerve blocks.\n- The studies were small, so we need more research to be more sure about these results. More research could also help us learn about rare unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is this review about?\nPain after breast cancer surgery is a common and major issue. Good pain control is key for a good recovery. One way to manage this pain is with 'regional pain relief'. This is a shot of numbing medicine to block pain in the area of the surgery. There are many types of these shots, called nerve blocks. These methods are used a lot, but they have risks (chances of harm), and we do not know which one is best.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare different types of regional pain relief for women having breast cancer surgery. We looked at the evidence to see which types worked better to ease pain (the benefits) and if they caused any unwanted effects (the harms).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into treatment groups by chance. We looked for trials that compared different types of regional pain relief for women having breast cancer surgery. We then put together the results from these studies and rated how sure we were of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 39 randomised controlled trials with a total of 2348 women. In 35 studies, the surgery was a modified radical mastectomy (surgery to remove the breast tissue and some nearby lymph nodes). The studies were in Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the USA, and Thailand. All surgeries were done in a hospital under general anaesthesia (medicine that puts you to sleep during surgery).\n\nThe trials compared different types of regional pain relief:\n- paravertebral block (a shot of numbing medicine near the spine)\n- erector spinae plane block (a shot into a muscle group in the back)\n- pectoral nerve block (a shot near the chest muscles)\n- serratus anterior plane block (a shot into the side of the chest wall)\n\nThe study reports did not say who paid for the studies.\n\nWhen we compared the different nerve blocks, we found that they seem to work just as well to ease pain after breast cancer surgery.\n\n- For pain at rest: pectoral nerve block, erector spinae plane block, and serratus anterior plane block make little to no difference in pain levels compared to paravertebral block. This was true a few hours after surgery and one day later.\n- For pain when moving: soon after surgery, pectoral nerve block may reduce pain a little bit compared to paravertebral block. Other nerve blocks may make little to no difference.\n- Harms from the procedure: we found no reports of harms, like nerve damage or infection, for any of the methods. But, we are not sure about these results because harms were not well-studied.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies were very small, and there were not enough of them to be sure about the results. Also, the studies gave the treatments in different ways.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to June 2023."
