    "output": "For premature babies on a feeding tube, is it better to re-feed or discard gastric residuals (undigested milk left in the stomach)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- For premature babies who receive milk through a feeding tube, the available evidence suggests that putting undigested milk back into the stomach may make little to no difference compared with throwing it away. This applies to important health outcomes such as the time for the baby to regain its birth weight, the risk of developing a serious gut problem called necrotising enterocolitis (a disease where tissues in the intestine become inflamed and can start to die), or survival before leaving the hospital.\n- Because these findings come from only 1 small study, we do not have enough reliable evidence to be certain about the effects. Researchers need to conduct larger, well-designed studies to better understand the benefits and potential harms of this practice for premature babies.\n\n**What is the feeding issue for preterm babies?**\nPreterm babies (babies born early) are often too small or unwell to feed from a bottle or breast. Instead, they receive milk through a tube that goes into their stomach. Before giving a new feed, nurses often check to see how much milk is left in the baby's stomach from the last feed. Nurses call this leftover milk a 'gastric residual' (undigested milk left in the stomach).\n\nHealth workers disagree about what to do with these residuals. Some believe putting the milk back ('re-feeding') is helpful because it contains nutrients and substances that aid digestion (the process of breaking down food). Others worry that re-feeding might cause the baby to be sick (vomiting) or lead to serious problems like necrotising enterocolitis.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of re-feeding gastric residuals compared with discarding them in preterm infants. We were interested in the effects on babies' growth, how well they tolerated their feeds, and their risk of developing serious health problems.\n\n**What did we do?**\nWe searched for research studies that compared re-feeding versus discarding stomach contents in preterm infants. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 1 study that included 72 preterm infants. The study compared re-feeding stomach contents with throwing them away.\n\nThe evidence suggests that re-feeding may make little to no difference to several important health outcomes. These include:\n- the time it takes for infants to regain their birth weight;\n- the risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis;\n- the number of deaths before leaving the hospital;\n- the time it takes to get them fully on milk feeds;\n- the number of days they need intravenous feeding (nutrition given directly into the bloodstream);\n- their growth in the hospital.\n\nWe do not know if re-feeding affects how often nurses need to stop feeds. These findings come from 1 small study, and we need more research to be more certain about the effects.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The findings come from only 1 very small study. Also, people in the study may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\nThis review includes evidence up to February 2022."
