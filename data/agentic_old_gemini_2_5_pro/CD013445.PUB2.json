    "output": "Comparing two types of surgery for kidney stones in adults: surgery through the back versus surgery through the urinary tract\n\nKey messages\n- For adults with kidney stones, surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy, or PCNL) may be better at clearing stones. It may also lower the need for a second operation compared to surgery where a surgeon passes a thin tube through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery, or RIRS). However, surgery through the back may lead to a longer hospital stay. There is probably little to no difference in major unwanted problems (complications) between the two surgeries.\n- The evidence for most findings is not strong because of large weaknesses in the studies we found. Future research should be better designed. It should also look at how these treatments affect a person's quality of life (the overall enjoyment of life) and whether they lead to unplanned medical visits. No studies reported on these important outcomes.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they treated?\nKidney stones are hard deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause severe pain, block the flow of urine (obstruction), and lead to infections (when germs invade and grow in the body). When stones are too large to pass on their own, a person may need surgery. We compared two types of surgery for removing kidney stones in adults.\n- In percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), a surgeon makes a small cut in the back. They then insert a tube directly into the kidney to break up and remove the stone.\n- In retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), a surgeon passes a thin, flexible telescope through the body's natural urinary passages to the kidney. The surgeon then uses a laser to break up the stone and removes the pieces.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how PCNL and RIRS compare for treating kidney stones in adults. We looked at which surgery was better at completely removing the stones, which had a lower risk of serious problems (complications), and which was less likely to require more treatments.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, researchers randomly put people into different treatment groups to compare them. We compared the two surgeries for treating kidney stones in adults. We then combined the results (findings) from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 trials with 4571 adults who had renal (kidney) stones. The average stone size ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. The studies compared PCNL with RIRS. Most studies did not report who paid for their research. We found no studies that reported on unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhen we compared PCNL to RIRS, we found that PCNL:\n- may raise the number of people who are free of stones. For every 1000 people who have RIRS, about 770 become stone-free. PCNL may lead to about 100 more people becoming stone-free for every 1000 people treated.\n- probably makes little to no difference to the number of major problems.\n- may greatly lower the need for more procedures. For every 1000 people who have RIRS, about 222 need another procedure. PCNL may lead to about 153 fewer people needing another procedure for every 1000 people treated.\n- may make the hospital stay longer.\n- may make little to no difference to the risk of the ureter (the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder) becoming narrowed or injured.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies did not provide data (information) about everything we were interested in. Also, the studies included different types of people and used different ways of doing the surgeries.\n\nEvidence currency\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023."
