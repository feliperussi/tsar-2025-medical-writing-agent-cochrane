    "output": "Can digital tools (like apps or websites) help children and teens manage obesity?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- When used with usual care (the standard treatment for a condition), digital tools may slightly lower body fat in children and teens with obesity. It is unclear if these tools affect other health measures, and the studies did not report on any side effects.\n- It is unclear if using digital tools on their own helps children and teens manage obesity.\n- Because the studies were small and short, it is hard to know the long-term benefits of these digital tools. Future studies should look at long-term effects and be sure to report any side effects.\n\nWHAT IS CHILDHOOD OBESITY AND HOW CAN DIGITAL TOOLS HELP?\nChildhood obesity (having an unhealthy amount of body fat) is a major health problem for many children and teens around the world. It can raise their chance of getting other diseases later in life. To manage obesity, doctors and nurses often suggest changes to diet and exercise. Experts are now using digital tools to support these efforts. These tools can include websites, mobile phone apps, text messages, and active video games.\n\nWHAT DID WE WANT TO FIND OUT?\nWe wanted to find out if these digital tools work well and are safe for managing obesity in children and teens. We looked at whether using digital tools with usual care was better than usual care alone. We also looked at whether using digital tools on their own was better than usual care.\n\nWHAT DID WE DO?\nWe looked for studies that used digital tools to manage obesity in children and teens. The studies compared using these tools (either alone or with usual care) against usual care alone. We then put the results together and rated our trust in the evidence.\n\nWHAT DID WE FIND?\nWe found 15 studies with a total of 911 children and teens. The studies took place in several countries, including the USA (5 studies), Sweden (3 studies), and 1 each in Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland, and Thailand.\n\nAll studies included teens aged 10 to 19, and 5 of these also included younger children (0 to 9 years). The studies were short: 9 were shorter than 6 months and 6 were 6 months or longer. 8 studies included both diet and exercise parts, 4 focused only on exercise, and 3 focused only on diet.\n\nFor children and teens, using digital tools with usual care may slightly lower body fat. It is unclear if this mix affects other key health results. It is also unclear if using digital tools on their own has any effect. We found no information about any side effects from the tools.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE\nOur trust in the evidence is medium. This is because there were not enough studies to be sure about the results, and the studies were very small.\n\nEVIDENCE CURRENCY\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025."
