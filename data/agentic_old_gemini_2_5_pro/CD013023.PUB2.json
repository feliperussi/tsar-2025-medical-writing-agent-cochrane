    "output": "What are the best dressings and devices to stop problems with peripheral arterial catheters (thin tubes put into an artery)?\n\nKey messages\n\nBecause there is no good evidence, we do not know which dressings or devices are best to stop problems with peripheral arterial catheters (thin tubes put into an artery for blood sampling and keeping track of blood pressure). We found no clear change between the compared dressings and devices in stopping catheters from failing or causing bad effects, such as serious infections that happen when germs travel along a catheter and enter the blood.\n\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small and had flaws in their design. We need larger, well-designed studies to find out which dressings and devices work best.\n\nWhat is the issue?\n\nPeople in hospital, mainly in intensive care or during surgery, sometimes have a thin tube called a peripheral arterial catheter put into an artery, often in the wrist. Doctors use these catheters to take blood samples and to keep track of blood pressure all the time. But, these catheters can sometimes stop working, be pulled out by accident (dislodged), or lead to infections (when germs invade and grow in the body). When a catheter fails, it needs to be replaced, which can be painful or unpleasant for the person. Special dressings and devices are used to hold the catheter in place and keep the area clean to stop these problems. We wanted to find out how well different dressings and devices work at stopping peripheral arterial catheters from failing or causing other problems for people in hospital.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies where people are put into different treatment groups by chance (randomized controlled trials). These studies compared different dressings and devices for holding arterial catheters. We then put together the findings from the studies and rated how much we trust the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 5 studies with a total of 1228 people in hospital who needed peripheral arterial catheters. The studies compared different types of dressings and devices. These included: standard plastic-like dressings with medical glue; plastic-like dressings with an extra sticky border; sticky devices that hold catheters without stitches; and all-in-one dressings with a built-in part to hold it in place.\n\nThere is not enough evidence to know if any type of dressing or device is better than another for stopping problems with arterial catheters. We found that the different dressings and devices may make little to no change to the chance of catheter failure, serious blood infections, the catheter being pulled out by accident, or becoming blocked. We are not sure about these findings because the studies were small and had flaws.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are not sure about the evidence because the studies were very small and did not have many cases of the problems we were looking for. It is also possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. This can create flaws in how a study is done (bias).\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023."
