    "output": "How well do eye movement tests (the HINTS test) find a serious cause (like a stroke) in people with sudden, severe dizziness?\n\nKey messages\n- When done by trained health workers, a series of eye movement tests (the HINTS test) may accurately find a serious cause (like a stroke) in people with sudden, severe dizziness. However, the evidence for this is not strong.\n- The review found no reports of any harms from the tests.\n- We need more and better studies to be sure how well the test works, especially when used by different health workers in different places.\n\nWhat is this review about?\nPeople often see a doctor because they feel dizzy. A certain type of dizziness is called acute vestibular syndrome (AVS). 'Acute' means it happens suddenly and for a short time. A 'syndrome' is a group of symptoms that happen together. AVS can cause sudden and severe vertigo (a spinning feeling), nausea (a feeling of sickness in the stomach), and being unsteady. AVS can be caused by a problem in the inner ear (a 'peripheral' cause) or a more serious problem in the brain, such as a stroke (a 'central' cause). It is very important for doctors to quickly find the cause, as the treatments and health results are very different.\n\nWhat is the HINTS test?\nTo help find the cause of AVS, health workers can use a 3-part test called HINTS. The test involves:\n- quickly turning the person's head to see how their eyes react;\n- checking for nystagmus (eye movements that a person cannot control); and\n- checking if the person's eyes are aligned with each other.\nAn expanded version, called HINTS Plus, also includes a hearing test.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus tests work to correctly find a central cause of AVS. We also looked at whether using video to help with the test made a difference.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus tests worked to find a central cause of AVS. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 16 studies with a total of 2024 people who had AVS. The average age of the people in the studies was 60 years. The studies looked at the HINTS and HINTS Plus tests, both with and without video help. Most studies (13 out of 16) took place in the emergency room. Neurologists (doctors who specialize in the nervous system) did the tests in half of the studies.\n\nOur main findings are:\n- When done by a trained health worker, the HINTS test may work very well to find a central cause for AVS.\n- Adding a hearing test (HINTS Plus) may also work very well.\n- It is not clear how well the HINTS test works when helped by video.\n- When helped by video, the HINTS Plus test probably finds most people who have a central cause for their symptoms. However, it may often be wrong when it suggests a central cause is present when it is not.\n\nOverall, the evidence was not strong. There was not enough information to know how well the tests work when used by different types of health workers or in different places.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because there were problems with how some studies were done, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022."
