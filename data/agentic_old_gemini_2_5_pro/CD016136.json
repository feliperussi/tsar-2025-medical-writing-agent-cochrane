    "output": "Is iron given into a vein (intravenously) better than iron tablets for treating anaemia (low iron in the blood) during pregnancy?\n\nKey messages\n- Compared with iron tablets, giving iron directly into a vein (intravenously) during pregnancy likely helps to raise iron levels in the blood and lowers the chance of having anaemia (low iron). It likely makes little to no difference to the risk of heavy bleeding after birth or the need for a blood transfusion. The evidence about other unwanted effects was not clear enough to draw firm conclusions.\n- We found very little good information about some key effects, like severe anaemia (very low iron) after birth and other serious unwanted effects. Future studies need to be better designed to collect and report this information in the same way. This will help pregnant people and their doctors make better choices.\n\nWhat is iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnancy and how is it treated?\nAnaemia is a condition where the blood has lower-than-normal levels of haemoglobin. Haemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen around the body. When a lack of iron causes anaemia, it is called iron-deficiency anaemia. This is a common problem for women during pregnancy.\n\nThe usual treatment is to take iron tablets by mouth (oral iron). However, another option is to give iron directly into a vein (intravenous iron). Intravenous iron may raise iron levels more quickly than tablets. But it was not clear if this leads to better health outcomes for pregnant women, such as reducing heavy bleeding after birth or the need for a blood transfusion. It was also unclear how the safety of the two treatments compared.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare intravenous iron with oral iron for treating iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnant women. We wanted to know which treatment was better at raising women's iron levels and lowering the number of women who were anaemic, both before and after birth. We also looked at whether the type of iron treatment affected the risk of serious problems, such as heavy bleeding after birth or needing a blood transfusion. Finally, we checked if it caused any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials. In these studies, people are randomly put into different treatment groups. The studies we looked for compared giving iron into a vein with giving it by mouth for pregnant women with anaemia. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies with 3939 pregnant women with iron deficiency anaemia. The studies were mostly from India and Africa. They compared giving iron directly into a vein (intravenous iron) with iron taken by mouth (oral iron). No trials reported on how satisfied or well women felt.\n\nCompared to oral iron, intravenous iron probably slightly raises blood levels of haemoglobin and lowers the number of women with anaemia before birth. After birth, intravenous iron may also slightly raise blood levels, but we are very uncertain if it affects severe anaemia.\n\nIntravenous iron probably makes little to no difference to needing a blood transfusion. It may also make little to no difference to the risk of heavy bleeding after birth. We are very uncertain about how it affects the risk of death for the mother.\n\nThere was probably little to no difference between the treatments in the overall risk of unwanted effects. There may be little to no difference in the risk of serious unwanted effects. However, the types of unwanted effects can be different for each treatment.\n\nWhat were the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have only moderate confidence in the evidence for several reasons. Not all studies provided data on the things we were interested in. There were not enough studies to be certain about some results. Also, the studies included different groups of people and used different ways of giving the iron treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024."
