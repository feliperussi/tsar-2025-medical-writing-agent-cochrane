    "output": "What are the best treatments for blood clots in the access sites (fistulas or grafts) used for kidney dialysis?\n\nKey messages\n- We do not know which treatment is best for blood clots in the access sites used for kidney dialysis because of a lack of good-quality evidence. We found no clear evidence that any single treatment was better than another at keeping the access site working or at reducing unwanted effects (adverse events).\n- A working access site is very important for people on kidney dialysis. We need more and better-designed studies to find the most effective (how well a treatment works) and safest ways to treat these blood clots.\n\nWhat is this review about?\nWhat is a blocked dialysis access point and why is it a problem?\nPeople with kidney failure often need a treatment called haemodialysis (a procedure to clean their blood when the kidneys cannot). For this, doctors create a special access point. They do this either by joining an artery to a vein (an arteriovenous fistula or AVF) or by using a soft tube to connect them (an arteriovenous graft or AVG).\n\nSometimes, a blood clot can form and block this access point (a process called thrombosis). When this happens, patients must use a temporary catheter (a flexible tube to withdraw fluids) for their dialysis. This increases their chance (risk) of infections and other problems, often leading to hospital stays.\n\nThere are several ways to treat a blocked access point. These include surgery (an operation to repair a part of the body), procedures to physically remove the clot (thrombectomy), or using medicines to dissolve it (thrombolysis).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well the different treatments work and how safe they are for unblocking fistulas and grafts in people receiving haemodialysis.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for clotted access sites in people on dialysis. We combined the findings (results) from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 14 studies with a total of 1176 people who were receiving haemodialysis and had a blocked fistula or graft. The studies looked at 3 types of treatments (interventions) to clear the blockage:\n- thrombectomy (clot removal with a device);\n- thrombolysis (clot-dissolving drugs); and\n- surgical procedures.\n\nWe found that it is unclear if any specific treatment is better than another for preventing failure, keeping the access open (patency), or for its technical success and safety. Surgery to clear a blockage may improve the chances of the access staying open after 1 month compared to using a mechanical device, but we are very uncertain about this finding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. This is because the studies were small and there were not enough of them to be certain about the findings. It is also possible that flaws in the study designs (how the studies were set up) could have affected the results (a source of bias).\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024."
