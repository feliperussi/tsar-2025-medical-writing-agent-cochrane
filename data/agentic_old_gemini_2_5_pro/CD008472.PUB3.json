    "output": "For people having major blood vessel surgery, does temporarily restricting blood flow in a limb (remote ischaemic preconditioning) reduce harm?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having major blood vessel surgery, the evidence suggests that temporarily restricting blood flow in a limb before the operation (a technique called remote ischaemic preconditioning) probably makes little to no difference in reducing serious harms like death, heart attack, kidney problems, or stroke.\n- The technique also likely does not change how long people stay in the hospital or how long the surgery takes.\n- We need larger and better-designed studies to be more certain about the effects of this technique and to focus on outcomes that matter most to patients (known as patient-centred outcomes).\n\nBackground\n\nWhy is major blood vessel surgery risky?\nEven though medical care has improved, major surgery on blood vessels (arteries and veins) still carries a risk of serious problems or death. During these operations, the flow of blood to parts of the body can be temporarily reduced, which can damage vital organs.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning?\nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique that may help protect the body during surgery. It involves temporarily and repeatedly stopping the blood flow to a limb (like an arm or leg) using a cuff, similar to a blood pressure cuff. This is done before the main operation. The theory is that these short periods of reduced blood flow can trigger the body's own defences. This may help protect important organs from damage during the surgery.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using RIPC for people having major blood vessel surgery. We compared people who received RIPC before their surgery with those who did not. We wanted to see if RIPC affected their risk of death, heart attack, kidney damage, stroke, or other problems.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials. These are studies where people are randomly put into different treatment groups. We looked for trials that compared RIPC with no preconditioning in people having major blood vessel surgery. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 14 studies with a total of 1295 people. The people in the studies were having major surgery on their blood vessels, including minimally invasive procedures done inside the vessels (endovascular surgery). Their ages ranged from 64.5 to 76 years, and 84% were male.\n\nWe found that RIPC probably makes little to no difference to the risk of:\n- death around the time of surgery;\n- heart attack;\n- kidney problems;\n- stroke;\n- limb loss.\n\nIt also likely does not change how long people stay in the hospital or how long the operation takes.\n\nWhat limits the evidence?\nWe are only moderately confident in the evidence for a few reasons. First, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results. Second, the studies used different ways to apply the technique. Finally, studies with positive or interesting findings may have been more likely to be published than studies with negative results. This is known as publication bias, and it can mislead people about a treatment's benefits.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022."
