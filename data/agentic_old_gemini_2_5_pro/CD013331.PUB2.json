    "output": "Can using a TENS machine help relieve period pain?\n\nKey messages\n- Using a TENS machine, which sends mild electrical currents to the skin, may help reduce period pain compared with a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment).\n- We are not certain about any unwanted effects because the studies did not provide enough information.\n- Our confidence in these results is limited. The studies had design flaws, and more, better-designed studies are needed to confirm if TENS is truly helpful for period pain.\n\nBackground\n\nWhat is period pain and what is TENS?\nPeriod pain, also known as primary dysmenorrhoea, is a common problem for many women. It is pain that is not caused by another medical condition. One treatment that does not use medication is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). A TENS machine is a small device that sends mild electrical currents through sticky pads (electrodes) placed on the skin over the painful area. These currents are thought to work by blocking pain signals to the brain and helping the body release its own natural painkillers.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well TENS works and how safe it is for treating period pain. We compared it with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, and other common treatments.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared TENS against a dummy treatment, no treatment, or other treatments for period pain. We compared and summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies, which were all randomized controlled trials (studies where people are assigned to treatment groups by chance). These studies involved a total of 585 women with period pain, aged between 12 and 49.\n\nThe studies compared TENS (either high-frequency or low-frequency) with a placebo, no treatment, or other treatments. These other treatments included acupressure (applying pressure to specific points on the body), acetaminophen (a drug that reduces pain and fever), interferential current therapy (another type of electrical therapy), and NSAIDs (a class of pain-relieving drugs like ibuprofen).\n\nWe mainly found that:\n- TENS (either high- or low-frequency) may reduce pain compared with a placebo or no treatment.\n- High-frequency TENS may make little to no difference to pain compared with low-frequency TENS.\n- We are uncertain if TENS is more or less effective than other treatments like acupressure, acetaminophen, or interferential current therapy.\n- High-frequency TENS may make little to no difference in the chance of having unwanted effects compared with NSAIDs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. In some studies, it was possible for people to know which treatment they were getting, which can cause bias (flaws in a study that can lead to unfair results). Additionally, many of the studies were very small and did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in, such as whether people needed extra painkillers or how TENS affects daily life.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates a previous version. The evidence is up to date to April 2024."
