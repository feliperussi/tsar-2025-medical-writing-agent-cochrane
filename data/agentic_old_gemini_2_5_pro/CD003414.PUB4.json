    "output": "What is the best method for preparing the womb lining before a frozen embryo transfer?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain which method is best for preparing the womb lining before a frozen embryo transfer (placing a thawed embryo into the womb).\n- The review could not determine if preparing the womb in a natural monthly cycle, or using hormone treatments, affects the chances of a live birth or miscarriage (the unexpected loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks).\n- The available studies were not large or detailed enough to provide a reliable answer. Future, larger studies are needed to properly compare these different methods and find out which is safest and most effective for women undergoing frozen embryo transfer.\n\nPreparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer\nFor many people undergoing fertility treatment (treatment to help people have a baby), embryos are frozen for later use. An embryo is the earliest stage of a baby's development. The process of thawing a frozen embryo and placing it into a woman's womb is called a frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). For an FET to be successful, the lining of the womb (the endometrium) must be ready for the embryo to attach.\n\nThere are several different ways to prepare the womb lining. These include:\n- the 'natural cycle', which tracks a woman's natural monthly cycle without using many drugs;\n- 'hormone therapy', which uses hormones (chemicals that send messages in the body) like oestrogen and progesterone to prepare the lining; and\n- 'ovulation induction', which uses drugs to cause ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).\nSometimes, hormone therapy is combined with other drugs that temporarily suppress the woman's own hormones.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how these different methods for preparing the womb lining compare with each other. We wanted to know which method is most effective at leading to a live birth and which is safest.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different methods for preparing the womb for frozen embryo transfer. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat we found\nWe found 32 randomised controlled trials with a total of 6352 women. Randomised controlled trials are a type of study where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups to compare them. The studies compared various methods for preparing the womb lining, including natural cycles, cycles using hormone therapy, and modified natural cycles using an HCG trigger (an injection of a hormone that causes an egg to be released) to induce ovulation.\n\nFor women undergoing frozen-thawed embryo transfer, it is unclear if one method of preparing the womb lining is better than another for increasing the chance of a live birth.\n\nWhen comparing a natural cycle with hormone therapy that also suppresses a woman's own hormones (using a drug called a GnRHa), the natural cycle probably makes little to no difference to the number of live births. Similarly, using hormone therapy alone probably makes little to no difference to the number of live births compared with using hormone therapy with GnRHa suppression.\n\nFor other comparisons, such as a natural cycle versus hormone therapy alone, the evidence is very uncertain. This means we do not know if these different methods affect the number of live births or miscarriages. Overall, we cannot be certain if any single treatment plan (regimen) is more effective or safer than another.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and the evidence is based on few cases of the events we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022."
