    "output": "Can support from community health workers improve mental health and well-being in low- and middle-income countries?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- In countries with fewer resources, community health workers may help improve mental health. They may help lower the signs of common problems like depression, anxiety, and distress for both adults and children. We found little information about unwanted or harmful effects.\n- We had some concerns about how the studies were done. This makes us less sure about the results. We need better studies in the future to understand the long-term effects.\n\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO FIND NEW WAYS TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH IN COUNTRIES WITH FEWER RESOURCES?\nMental health problems can affect anyone. But getting help is not always easy, especially in countries with fewer resources. These places often do not have enough trained mental health experts. Because of this, many people who need support do not get it. One way to help is to train local community health workers to give basic mental health support. This is called 'task-shifting' (moving tasks from highly trained workers to others to make healthcare easier to get). This support can be for:\n- everyone, to help them feel well (universal prevention);\n- groups at higher risk of developing problems (selective prevention); or\n- people already showing early signs of a mental health problem (indicated prevention).\n\nWHAT DID WE WANT TO FIND OUT?\nWe wanted to learn if mental health support from community workers helps in low- and middle-income countries. We checked if this support helped people feel well and stopped mental health problems in adults and children. We also wanted to know how it affected healthcare costs.\n\nWHAT DID WE DO?\nWe searched for studies in low- and middle-income countries. The studies compared mental health support from community workers against the usual care people get or no treatment. We then combined the results and rated how sure we were about the evidence.\n\nWHAT DID WE FIND?\nWe found 113 studies with 32,992 people in them. The studies included adults (83 studies) and children (30 studies). The support aimed to help people feel well and stop problems from starting. It was compared against usual care.\n\nFor adults, compared to usual care:\n- For everyone, the support:\n  - probably slightly lowers signs of anxiety.\n  - may slightly lower signs of distress or stress after a very bad event (post-traumatic stress).\n- For adults at higher risk, the support:\n  - probably lowers signs of depression.\n- For adults with early signs of a problem, the support:\n  - may lower unwanted or harmful effects.\n  - probably slightly lowers difficulties with daily tasks.\n\nFor children, compared to usual care:\n- For everyone, the support:\n  - may slightly improve quality of life (how a person feels and functions day to day).\n  - may lower unwanted or harmful effects.\n  - may slightly lower signs of depression and anxiety.\n- For children at higher risk, the support:\n  - probably slightly lowers signs of distress or stress after a very bad event.\n- For children with early signs of a problem, the support:\n  - may slightly lower difficulties with daily tasks.\n  - may slightly lower signs of depression.\n\nWHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE?\nWe are only moderately sure of the evidence. This is because of problems with how some studies were designed. These problems could lead to unfair results (bias). For example, some people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. This might have changed how they acted. Also, some studies did not give us all the information we wanted. The studies also used different types of people and different kinds of support.\n\nHOW UP TO DATE IS THIS EVIDENCE?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021."
