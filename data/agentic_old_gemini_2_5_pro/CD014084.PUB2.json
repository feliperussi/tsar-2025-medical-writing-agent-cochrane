    "output": "Is sinus surgery helpful for nasal polyps (growths in the nose) in people with cystic fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of strong evidence, we are uncertain if sinus surgery is helpful for nasal polyps (growths in the nose) in people with cystic fibrosis.\n- The single small study we found did not provide clear information on benefits, such as improved symptoms, or on unwanted effects. It did report one case of bleeding during surgery that was corrected.\n- Larger and better-designed studies are needed to properly assess the effects of sinus surgery for people with cystic fibrosis. Future research should follow people for at least a year to see how symptoms change and if polyps return (come back).\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and how does it affect the nose and sinuses?\nCystic fibrosis is an inherited disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body. This can affect many organs, including the lungs and the sinuses (the small, air-filled spaces behind the cheekbones and forehead). The build-up of mucus in the sinuses can lead to long-lasting swelling and irritation (chronic rhinosinusitis) and the growth of soft, non-cancerous lumps called nasal polyps. These problems can block the nose, make breathing difficult, and lead to infections. Treatments can include medicines, such as nasal sprays, or a procedure called endoscopic sinus surgery. This surgery aims to open up the sinuses to help the medicines work better.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if sinus surgery, either by itself or combined with medical treatments, is better than medical treatments alone for people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. We were interested in the effects on both nose-related symptoms and lung function (how well the lungs work). We also wanted to know if surgery affected how often people were hospitalized, needed antibiotics (medicines to treat infections), or had periods when their lung symptoms got worse (exacerbations).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared the effects of sinus surgery combined with medical treatment versus medical treatment alone in people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study with 28 people aged 19 to 28 years with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps. The study compared nasal irrigation (washing out the nose with a fluid) combined with surgery against nasal irrigation alone.\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain. This means we do not know if adding sinus surgery to medical treatment (like nasal rinses) helps. We are uncertain whether this surgery improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacteria in the nose, or affects the need for antibiotics, the number of lung flare-ups, or overall lung function.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because we found only one small study. This makes it difficult to be certain about the results.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022."
