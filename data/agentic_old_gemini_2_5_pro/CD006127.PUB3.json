    "output": "Can lowering blood pressure prevent or slow eye damage caused by diabetes (diabetic retinopathy)?\n\nKey messages\n- Intensively controlling blood pressure may help prevent eye damage from diabetes (diabetic retinopathy), especially for people with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.\n- However, this treatment does not seem to slow the worsening of existing eye damage. It may also cause episodes of low blood pressure.\n- We need more research to know if this treatment can prevent serious vision loss or help people with diabetes who do not have high blood pressure.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy?\nPeople with diabetes can develop eye problems. A common problem is diabetic retinopathy, which is damage to the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye). This damage can cause poor vision and even blindness. We know that controlling blood sugar helps prevent or slow this eye damage. Some people also believe that controlling blood pressure is important, but studies have shown different results.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to review evidence from clinical trials. We aimed to see if blood pressure treatments in people with diabetes help prevent or slow diabetic retinopathy. We also looked at effects on vision, unwanted side effects, quality of life, and costs.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared different blood pressure control treatments in people with diabetes. We then combined the results from these studies. We used a rating system to judge our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 29 studies with 27,185 people. The people in the studies had either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with or without high blood pressure. The studies took place across the world and lasted from less than 1 year to 9 years.\n\nThe studies compared different ways to control blood pressure, such as:\n- more intense versus less intense control;\n- blood pressure control versus usual care or a placebo (a dummy treatment); or\n- one type of blood pressure medicine against another or a placebo.\n\nFor people with diabetes, more intensive blood pressure control probably slightly lowers the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy over 5 years. This is particularly true for those with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\nHowever, for people who already have diabetic retinopathy, this treatment probably makes little to no difference in slowing its worsening over 5 years. It may also make little to no difference in preventing more advanced eye disease. We do not know if this treatment affects vision loss.\n\nRegarding unwanted effects, intensive blood pressure control probably makes little to no difference to the risk of death. However, it may cause a large increase in episodes of low blood pressure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies included different types of people and used different treatments. There were not enough studies for us to be certain about all the results. Also, the evidence does not cover all the people or treatments we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to September 2021."
