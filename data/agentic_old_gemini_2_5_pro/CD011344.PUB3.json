    "output": "Which way of giving an epidural is better for pain relief during labor: a continuous drip or automatic injections?\n\nKey messages\n- For women in labor, giving an epidural with regular, automatic injections may prevent 'breakthrough pain' (a sudden increase in pain that needs extra help from a specialist doctor) better than a continuous drip. This method may also make mothers happier with their pain relief.\n- The evidence suggests that the delivery method likely makes no difference to the chances of needing a caesarean delivery (surgery to deliver a baby) or an instrumental delivery (birth with help from forceps or a vacuum cup).\n- We need larger studies to be more certain about how these two methods affect the need for a caesarean or instrumental delivery.\n\nBackground\nWhat is an epidural?\nAn epidural is a common way doctors relieve pain during labour. A doctor places a small tube in the woman's back to deliver numbing medicine into the space around the spinal cord. Doctors can deliver this medicine in two main ways:\n- A continuous, slow drip (known as a 'basal infusion').\n- A pump that automatically gives doses at set times (known as an 'automated mandatory bolus').\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which epidural method is better for women in labour. We compared automatic injections with a continuous drip. We wanted to see which one was better at preventing 'breakthrough pain'. We also wanted to know if the delivery method affected:\n- the chances of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery;\n- the amount of pain medicine used;\n- the length of labour; and\n- how satisfied women were.\n\nWhat we did\nWe searched for studies that compared giving epidural pain relief as automatic injections versus a continuous drip. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat we found\nWe found 18 studies that included a total of 4590 women. The studies included healthy women who were at or near their due date. In 13 studies, the women had not given birth before. The other 5 studies included a mix of women who had and had not given birth before. All studies left out women with early (preterm) or complicated pregnancies.\n\nMain results\nCompared with a continuous drip, using automatic injections for epidural pain relief probably reduces the need for a specialist doctor to step in to manage pain. It also probably reduces the amount of numbing medicine women use.\n- For every 1000 women who have a continuous drip, about 202 need extra help for pain.\n- With automatic injections, that number drops by about 59 women.\nThis method may also improve how satisfied mothers are with their pain relief.\n\nHow the doctor gives the medicine probably makes little to no difference to:\n- the number of caesarean deliveries;\n- the number of instrumental deliveries;\n- the length of labour; or\n- the baby's health immediately after birth.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are fairly sure of the evidence. Our confidence is limited because the people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, the studies used different ways of giving the treatments, and we do not have enough studies to be certain about all the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to December 2022."
