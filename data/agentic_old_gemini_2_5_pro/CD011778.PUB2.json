    "output": "**Title:** Does adding light therapy (which uses light to kill germs) to deep cleaning work for gum disease and problems with dental implants?\n\n**Key messages**\n- We cannot be sure if adding light therapy to deep cleaning benefits people with gum disease (periodontitis, a serious infection that damages the tissue and bone supporting teeth). We lack good-quality evidence. The therapy appears safe, as most studies reported no unwanted effects.\n- Larger, better-designed studies are needed to find out if this light therapy truly helps with gum disease. We also need to research if it works for problems around dental implants, as we found almost no information on this.\n\n**What are periodontitis and peri-implant diseases?**\nPeriodontitis is a serious form of gum disease. If not treated, it can damage the tissues and bone that support teeth, sometimes leading to tooth loss. A similar condition, called peri-implant disease, can happen around dental implants. The standard way to treat these conditions is with a deep cleaning procedure (known as scaling and root planing) that removes the harmful film of bacteria from below the gum line. Sometimes, doctors use an additional therapy called antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. This therapy involves applying a light-sensitive liquid to the area and then using a special light to activate it, which kills the bacteria.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to find out if adding this light therapy to standard deep cleaning is more effective than deep cleaning alone for treating adults with periodontitis or peri-implant diseases.\n\n**What did we do?**\nWe searched for studies that compared standard deep cleaning combined with light therapy against the same cleaning method used alone or with a pretend light therapy (a placebo). We combined what these studies found and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe included 50 studies with 1407 adults who had periodontitis. The studies were generally small, with 10 to 88 people in each. We assessed the outcomes 6 months after the therapy was given.\n\nFor people with gum disease, we are very uncertain if adding this special light-activated therapy to standard deep cleaning improves gum health. This applies whether people are being actively treated or are in the ongoing maintenance phase. Any way the therapy might improve things may be too small to be important. Adding the light therapy probably makes little to no difference to the number of unwanted side effects.\n\nWe found no evidence about the effects of using this light therapy for people with diseases around dental implants.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nWe are not confident in the evidence for several reasons. People in the studies may have known which therapy they were getting, which could have influenced what they reported. Also, the studies delivered the therapy in different ways, and they were very small.\n\n**Currency of the evidence**\nThis evidence is up to date to February 2024."
