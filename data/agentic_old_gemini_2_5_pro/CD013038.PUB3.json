    "output": "For premature babies (babies born early) who are fed through a tube, does letting them smell and taste milk help them learn to feed by mouth sooner?\n\nKey messages\n- For premature babies fed through a tube, the available evidence suggests that letting them smell and taste milk has little to no effect on how quickly they learn to feed fully by mouth. The studies did not find any clear harmful effects from this practice.\n- The evidence is not strong because the included studies were small and had limitations. We need larger, well-designed studies to be certain about the effects of this practice on feeding skills, safety, and growth in premature babies.\n\nWhy do babies born early have trouble feeding?\nBabies born too early (premature) are often not developed enough to feed from a breast or bottle. This is because they cannot yet co-ordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing all at the same time. To get the nutrition (food) they need to grow, they are fed milk through a small tube that goes through their nose or mouth directly into their stomach.\n\nHowever, this means they miss out on the smell and taste of milk. Smelling and tasting milk can help prepare the body for digestion (the process of breaking down food). Giving babies the smell and taste of milk while they are being tube-fed is a simple, low-cost practice that might help them get used to feeding and move on to feeding fully by mouth sooner.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if letting premature babies smell or taste milk (breastmilk or formula) while they were being tube-fed could help them learn to feed fully by mouth more quickly. We also wanted to know if this approach had any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving premature babies the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding with not doing so. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies with 1277 premature babies. The studies looked at what happened when babies were given the smell or taste of milk during tube feeding compared to when they were not.\n\nFor premature babies fed through a tube:\n- Providing the smell and taste of milk probably makes little to no difference to the chance of a serious infection.\n- This practice may make little to no difference to the length of time babies need nutrition given through a vein (a method of feeding that bypasses the digestive system).\n- This practice may make little to no difference to the chance of a serious gut problem (where the tissue in the intestine becomes inflamed and can start to die).\n- This practice may have little to no effect on the time it takes for babies to be fully fed by mouth, but we are very uncertain about these findings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small. Also, in some studies, the people taking part were not placed into treatment groups by chance, which can affect the reliability of the results. It is also possible that the people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023."
