    "output": "Can programs that encourage healthy eating and physical activity help prevent obesity in children?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Programs that encourage physical activity in children, either by itself or combined with healthy eating, may lead to small reductions in measures of body fatness for up to 15 months, but these effects may not last.\n- Programs that focus only on healthy eating appear to have little to no effect.\n- There was limited information on serious unwanted effects from any of the programs.\n- Future studies should look at the effects of these programs over longer periods. More research is also needed to find out if programs work for children in settings outside of school, such as at home or in the community, and for children living with disabilities.\n\n**Why is preventing obesity in children important?**\nObesity (having an unhealthy amount of body fat) in children is a serious public health issue worldwide. It can have a big impact on a child's health and well-being. Programs aimed at preventing obesity try to encourage changes in behavior, such as promoting healthy eating and increasing activity levels (which includes physical activity, reducing sitting time, and improving sleep). These programs help children balance the energy (calories) they get from food with the energy they use up. However, it is not clear which approaches work best.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to find out how well different programs work to prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11. We looked at the effects of programs that focused on:\n- diet (what a person eats and drinks);\n- activity; or\n- a combination of both diet and activity.\n\nWe wanted to see what effect these programs had on measures of body weight, such as body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. We also wanted to know if they caused any serious unwanted effects.\n\n**What did we do?**\nWe searched for studies that compared programs to prevent obesity in children with no program or usual care. We then combined and summarized the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nOur review included 172 studies with 189,707 children aged 5 to 11. The programs used diet, physical activity, or both. Most programs lasted for less than 9 months. Most studies (146) were in high-income countries, and schools were the most common setting (111 studies). We found little evidence for children with disabilities (a physical or mental condition that limits a person's movements, senses, or activities), as they were excluded from most studies. We also found little evidence for programs delivered in home or community settings.\n\n**Main results**\nFor children aged 5 to 11, here is what the evidence says about different ways to prevent obesity when compared to no program.\n\n**Diet-only programs:** These programs probably make little to no difference to children's weight scores. We do not know if these programs have an effect on serious unwanted effects because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**Activity-only programs:** These programs probably slightly reduce children's weight scores for up to 15 months. However, they may make little to no difference in the short or long term. These programs may also make little to no difference to the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n\n**Combined diet and activity programs:** These programs probably slightly reduce children's weight scores for up to 15 months, and may slightly reduce them in the short term. However, they may make little to no difference in the long term. These combined programs may also make little to no difference to the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the programs. The evidence also does not cover all of the children we were interested in, such as those with disabilities or from settings outside of school. There were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results for serious unwanted effects.\n\n**How up-to-date is this evidence?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to February 2023."
