    "output": "How does being present when health workers try to save a loved one's life (resuscitation) affect family members?\n\nKey messages\n- We did not find enough good evidence to be certain how family members are affected by being present during resuscitation. We are not sure if being there affects a relative's long-term mental well-being. This includes their risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental health condition caused by a very upsetting event.\n- We need larger, better studies to understand the good and bad effects for everyone involved: family members, patients, and health workers.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is family presence during resuscitation?\nWhen a person's heart or breathing stops, health workers take emergency actions to try to save their life. This is called resuscitation. Usually, family members wait in another room. But some patients want their relatives nearby during urgent medical care, and relatives may want to be there. This is called 'family presence during resuscitation'. It is a difficult situation that affects the patient, their family, and the health workers. It is important to understand the good and bad effects for everyone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what happens when family members can choose to be present during a resuscitation. We were most interested in the effects on the family members' mental health. For example, did being present change their risk of developing symptoms of PTSD? PTSD can cause lasting emotional pain after a shocking event. We also wanted to know how it affected if the patient survived and recovered, the medical care given, and how stressed the health workers were.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe looked for studies that compared offering family members the choice to be present during a resuscitation with not offering them the choice. We then put together the results from the studies and checked how certain we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that included a total of 595 people. One study checked in with people for 1 year. The studies were in France and the UK, and took place before people got to a hospital and in emergency rooms. The people in the studies were relatives of patients having a resuscitation. They were 19 to 78 years old, and 56% to 64% were women. The studies compared offering relatives the choice to watch the resuscitation with the usual practice of not having family in the room.\n\nWe do not know if offering family members the choice to be present affects their later mental health, such as post-traumatic stress, anxiety (feelings of fear or dread), or grief (the normal response to a major loss). We also do not know if having family present changes how long the resuscitation took or how stressed the health workers were. This is because there is not enough evidence, and the evidence we have is of very low certainty.\n\nHow certain is the evidence?\nWe are not certain about the evidence. This is because people in the studies may have known which treatment they received. Also, there are not enough studies to be sure about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2022."
