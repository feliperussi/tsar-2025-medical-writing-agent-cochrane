    "output": "Is a videolaryngoscope (a device with a camera) better than a standard laryngoscope for helping place a breathing tube in newborn babies?\n\nKey messages\n- Using a videolaryngoscope may increase the chance of successfully placing a breathing tube on the first try for newborn babies. It may also reduce the total number of tries needed.\n- Using a videolaryngoscope also likely leads to fewer minor airway injuries during the procedure.\n- We are uncertain if using a videolaryngoscope makes the procedure faster or affects the risk of a slow heartbeat (bradycardia) or low oxygen levels, as the evidence was not strong.\n- We need larger, better-designed studies to be more certain about the good and bad effects of using videolaryngoscopes in newborns because the current evidence is not high quality.\n\nWhat is placing a breathing tube in newborns?\nSome newborn babies (up to 28 days old) have trouble breathing and need urgent help to get enough oxygen. This often involves a procedure where a doctor inserts a breathing tube into the baby's windpipe (this is called tracheal intubation). The standard way to do this is called direct laryngoscopy. The doctor looks directly down the baby's throat with a lighted tool to guide the tube. A newer method, videolaryngoscopy, uses a device with a small camera that shows the throat on a screen. This may help the doctor see the airway more clearly and place the tube more easily.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a videolaryngoscope works better and is safer than direct laryngoscopy for placing breathing tubes in newborns. We compared the 2 methods to see which one:\n- was more successful on the first try;\n- needed fewer tries overall; and\n- was faster.\nWe also looked at the safety of each procedure, such as the risk of airway injury.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using a videolaryngoscope with the standard method (direct laryngoscopy) for inserting a breathing tube in newborn babies. We compared and summarized their findings and rated our confidence in the evidence. We based our rating on factors like study methods and the number of babies in the studies.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that included a total of 759 breathing tube procedures in newborn babies. The studies compared using a videolaryngoscope with direct laryngoscopy.\n\nMain findings\nCompared to direct laryngoscopy, using a videolaryngoscope:\n- may increase the success of placing the tube on the first try and may reduce the number of tries needed. For every 7 babies who have the procedure, 1 extra baby may have the tube placed successfully on the first try.\n- probably slightly reduces airway injury (trauma) during the procedure. For every 25 babies who have the procedure, 1 case of airway injury is probably prevented.\n- may make little to no difference to the time it takes to place the tube.\n\nWe do not know if videolaryngoscopy affects episodes of low oxygen levels (desaturation) or slow heartbeat (bradycardia) during the procedure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, which could lead to a flaw in the study design (bias). Also, the studies were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022."
