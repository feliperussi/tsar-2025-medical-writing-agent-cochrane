    "output": "Title: How well do combined birth control pills work for period cramps, and are they safe?\n\nKey messages\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills (a pill taken by mouth that contains two hormones: estrogen and progestin) reduce period pain for people with primary dysmenorrhoea (painful menstrual cramps not caused by another pelvic disease; pelvic means the area below the belly that includes the womb and ovaries). They also raise the chance of unwanted effects (side effects), especially irregular bleeding (spotting or unexpected bleeding). Headaches and feeling sick (nausea) may also be more common.\n- Taking the pill continuously (continuous use: taking active hormone pills without the usual monthly break) may reduce pain more than the standard regimen (standard regimen: about 21 days of active pills followed by a break or inactive pills). Differences between pill types or hormone doses seem small. We do not have enough evidence to say whether the pill is better than NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pain relievers such as ibuprofen).\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea (period pain)?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea means painful menstrual cramps that happen with periods and are not caused by another condition in the pelvis. It is common. It can disrupt school, work, and social life.\n\nWhat are combined oral contraceptive pills, and why might they help?\nCombined oral contraceptive pills (also called the pill or OCP) are taken by mouth and contain estrogen and progestin (hormones). They prevent pregnancy and often make periods lighter and more regular. Lighter, more regular bleeding can reduce cramps and pain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well combined pills reduce pain from primary dysmenorrhoea and what side effects they cause. We compared the pill with placebo (dummy pills that contain no active medicine), with no treatment, with NSAIDs (pain relievers like ibuprofen), and with different ways of taking the pill (for example continuous use versus the standard regimen).\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for randomized trials (studies where people are assigned at random to different groups). We combined results for pain, side effects, and day-to-day impacts such as need for extra pain medicine or time off work or school. We rated how certain the evidence is using GRADE (a system that tells how confident we can be in the results).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 21 randomized trials with 3,723 women who had primary dysmenorrhoea. Trials compared the pill with placebo or no treatment, different pill schedules or doses (including continuous use), and NSAIDs. Trials were small and did not report long-term outcomes.\n- Compared with placebo or no treatment, the pill reduces menstrual pain. For example, if 28% of people improve with placebo or no treatment, about 37% to 60% may improve with the pill.\n- The pill probably increases overall side effects and clearly increases irregular bleeding (spotting or unexpected bleeding). It probably increases headaches and nausea (feeling sick).\n- The pill may slightly reduce the need for extra pain medicine and may slightly reduce days off work.\n- The pill may increase serious adverse events (major harms that can be life-threatening or need hospital care), but the evidence on serious harms is uncertain.\n- Continuous use may reduce pain more than the standard regimen. The standard regimen may lead to more irregular bleeding than continuous use.\n- We do not know whether the pill is more effective than NSAIDs for pain.\n\nHow sure are the results?\nWe are moderately confident in some findings. We are less sure about rare or long-term harms. Many trials were small, they used different methods, and few followed people long enough.\n\nWhat does this mean for people?\nThe pill can help with painful periods. It often causes irregular bleeding and likely increases headaches and nausea. People and clinicians should weigh the benefits against the side effects. We need larger, longer studies to clarify rare harms and long-term effects, to compare continuous versus standard schedules, to compare different pill types and doses, and to compare the pill with NSAIDs. Future studies should measure outcomes that matter to people, such as ability to attend work or school and need for extra pain relief.\n\nCurrency: Evidence up to March 2023."
