    "output": "Title: Is magnetic seizure therapy (MST — a treatment that uses strong magnetic pulses to safely trigger a brief, controlled seizure while the person is under anesthesia) as effective and safe as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT — a treatment that uses a small electrical current to trigger a brief, controlled seizure while the person is under anesthesia) for people with schizophrenia (a group of severe mental disorders with problems like hearing or seeing things that are not there, strong false beliefs, and trouble thinking or behaving normally)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found only 1 small randomized study (79 people) that compared MST with ECT, both added to standard care (the usual treatment such as antipsychotic medicines and routine clinical support). The trial lasted 4 weeks.\n- MST and ECT seemed to help symptoms to a similar degree, and MST may cause fewer memory and thinking problems (cognitive side effects). We are very uncertain because the study was small, short, and had design problems (bias: flaws in study design or conduct that can skew results).\n- We need larger, well‑designed trials that follow people for longer and report outcomes that matter to patients and families, such as symptoms, daily functioning, quality of life, thinking and memory, and unwanted or harmful effects (adverse effects).\n\nWhat is schizophrenia and why is it important?\nSchizophrenia is a long‑term mental health condition (a group of severe mental disorders that affect how a person thinks, feels, and behaves). People may hear voices, have delusions (strong beliefs others do not share), and struggle with daily activities. Schizophrenia can be disabling and usually needs ongoing care.\n\nHow is schizophrenia usually treated?\nDoctors usually prescribe antipsychotics (medicines that reduce symptoms like hallucinations and delusions). About 1 in 5 people do not get enough benefit from these medicines. When symptoms stay severe, doctors may consider brain stimulation treatments (non‑invasive brain stimulation: techniques that change brain activity from outside the head without surgery).\n\nWhat are MST and ECT?\n- MST (magnetic seizure therapy) uses strong magnetic pulses to trigger a brief, controlled seizure (sudden, uncontrolled body movements and changes in behavior due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain) while the person is under general anaesthesia (asleep and pain‑free). Researchers hope it can reset brain circuits and reduce symptoms.\n- ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) uses a small electrical current to cause a similar brief, controlled seizure under anaesthesia. ECT is a well‑established treatment for severe mental disorders.\n\nWhat did this review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well MST works for people with schizophrenia and whether people can accept it and stay on it (tolerability: how much people can accept unwanted effects so they keep taking the treatment). We also looked for unwanted or harmful effects (adverse effects). We searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to different treatments to reduce bias) that compared MST with ECT or other care. We focused on overall symptoms, day‑to‑day functioning, thinking and memory (global cognitive function: overall thinking ability across memory, attention, and reasoning), and whether people stopped treatment early.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 1 randomized trial with 79 adults who had acute schizophrenia (acute: symptoms that begin and worsen quickly). The trial lasted 4 weeks. It compared MST plus standard care with ECT plus standard care.\n- MST may make little or no difference to overall symptoms and global state (an overall judgment of a person’s mental health and functioning) compared with ECT. We are very uncertain about effects on delayed memory deficit (difficulty remembering information after a delay) and on global cognitive function.\n- About the same number of people stopped treatment early in both groups.\n- The trial did not report where it was done or who funded it. Not all outcomes were reported. Lack of blinding (patients or staff may have known which treatment they received) and selective reporting (only some results being reported) raise concerns about bias.\n\nHow sure are we?\nWe are very uncertain. The evidence comes from a single, small, short trial. Design issues and limited reporting make the results unreliable.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and families?\n- MST might work similarly to ECT and might cause fewer memory and thinking problems. But we cannot be confident in this result.\n- We need larger, well‑designed trials that run longer and measure outcomes people care about, including adverse effects. Trials should reduce bias (flaws that favor one result) by using blinding (keeping patients and staff unaware of which treatment was given) where possible and by reporting all planned results.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to March 2022."
