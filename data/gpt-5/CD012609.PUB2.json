    "output": "How well and how safely does infliximab (a medicine that blocks inflammation) keep Crohn’s disease under control after it has improved with medicine?\n\nKey messages\n- Infliximab (a biologic: a medicine made from living cells that targets parts of the immune system) probably helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission (a period when symptoms are controlled) better than placebo (a ‘dummy’ treatment that looks the same but has no active medicine). In people already in remission, adding infliximab to purine analogues (immune‑suppressing tablets such as azathioprine or 6‑mercaptopurine) probably prevents clinical relapse (the return of symptoms) better than purine analogues alone.\n- When we compared infliximab with a biosimilar (a medicine highly similar to an approved biologic), they seemed similar for preventing clinical relapse. There were signals that infliximab might lead to more loss of clinical response (when a treatment that worked stops working) and more people stopping treatment because of side effects (unwanted effects), but the evidence was limited and uncertain.\n- We need more large, well‑designed trials that compare infliximab with other active treatments, follow people longer, and report the benefits and harms that matter to patients. Studies should say who was included (for example, whether people had used biologics before) so results are easier to apply.\n\nIntroduction / Aims\nWhat is Crohn’s disease and why is keeping it quiet important?\nCrohn’s disease is a long‑term inflammatory bowel condition (an abnormal condition that affects the digestive tract). It can cause belly pain, diarrhea, tiredness, weight loss, and sometimes fevers. The illness often comes and goes. Remission (a period when symptoms are controlled) can be followed by relapse (the return of symptoms). Relapses can lower quality of life and may lead to complications, hospital stays, or surgery. We aim to keep the disease quiet for as long as possible with maintenance therapy (ongoing treatment given after remission to prevent flare‑ups).\n\nWhat treatments are used, and where does infliximab fit in?\nDoctors use medicines that reduce inflammation and change immune activity. Steroids calm a flare quickly but are not good for long‑term use. Purine analogues (also called thiopurines; immune‑suppressing tablets such as azathioprine and 6‑mercaptopurine) help prevent future flares. Biologics (medicines made from living cells that target parts of the immune system) are newer options. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody (a lab‑made protein that binds a specific target) that blocks tumor necrosis factor‑alpha or TNF‑alpha (a protein made by immune cells that promotes inflammation). Some people get infliximab alone. Others get it with a purine analogue. Biosimilars are highly similar versions of a biologic and are expected to work the same way.\n\nWhat did the review want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether infliximab helps keep adults with Crohn’s disease in remission, whether it prevents loss of clinical response (when a treatment stops working), whether it prevents endoscopic relapse (return of inflammation seen with a flexible camera test called endoscopy), and whether it causes unwanted effects. We compared infliximab with placebo (a dummy treatment), with purine analogues, and with biosimilars.\n\nMethods\nWe searched medical databases and trial registries for trials in adults with Crohn’s disease. We included randomized trials (studies where people were randomly put into groups) that compared infliximab with placebo, purine analogues, biosimilars, or other medicines for keeping remission. We pooled study results and rated how confident we are in the evidence using GRADE (a system for rating how sure we are about results).\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 randomized trials including 1,257 adults with Crohn’s disease. Studies ran from 1999 to 2022. Participants were 18 to 69 years old. Some trials enrolled people in remission; others enrolled people with mixed disease activity. Most trials allowed other medicines alongside the study treatment. Funding came from pharmaceutical companies, public sources, or both.\n\nMain results\n- Compared with placebo, infliximab probably reduces clinical relapse (return of symptoms). We are uncertain whether infliximab changes the chance of loss of clinical response (when the medicine stops working), stopping treatment because of side effects, or serious unwanted effects.\n- Adding infliximab to purine analogues probably leads to a large reduction in clinical relapse and probably reduces endoscopic relapse (return of inflammation seen on a bowel camera). It is unclear whether serious unwanted effects change with this combination.\n- Compared with a biosimilar, infliximab may make little to no difference to clinical relapse. Infliximab may increase loss of clinical response, and differences in stopping treatment or unwanted effects are uncertain. We found little evidence about whether giving a biosimilar under the skin (subcutaneous: under the skin) versus into a vein (intravenous: into a vein) changes outcomes. We also had limited data comparing infliximab with adalimumab (another biologic).\n\nLimitations\nWe have moderate confidence in the evidence. Some trials may not have kept people unaware of their treatment (risk of bias: flaws in study design that can favor one result). Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted. There are too few trials for some comparisons, so results are uncertain.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023."
