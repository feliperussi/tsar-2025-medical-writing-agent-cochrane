    "output": "Title: Which treatments work best to clear a blood clot in a dialysis access (a fistula or graft used to reach your blood during dialysis)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found too little good-quality evidence to say which treatment works best or is safest for clearing a blood clot (thrombosis: the formation or presence of a blood clot inside a blood vessel) in a dialysis access called an arteriovenous fistula (AVF: a surgically created connection between an artery and a vein, usually in the arm) or an arteriovenous graft (AVG: a soft synthetic tube placed under the skin to connect an artery to a vein).\n- Studies compared surgery (an operation to repair or revise the access), thrombectomy (surgery to remove a blood clot), thrombolysis (breaking up the clot using drugs delivered through a tube into the clot), and mechanical thrombectomy (a device that physically removes the clot without clot-dissolving drugs). Short-term patency (patency: condition of being open and usable, often checked at 30 days) may be better with surgery than with mechanical thrombectomy, but this result is uncertain. Harms (unwanted events that cause harm) were rarely reported, so safety differences are unclear.\n- The trials were small, often had methods that can bias results (flaws that favour one conclusion), and they rarely reported outcomes that matter most to patients, such as the ability to use the access for dialysis (dialysis: cleaning the blood when the kidneys cannot), need for a temporary catheter (catheter: a flexible tube; temporary catheter: a short-term tube placed in a large vein), infections, or quality of life.\n\nWhat is dialysis access and why does it matter?\nPeople with kidney failure often need haemodialysis (a treatment where a machine filters wastes and extra fluid from the blood). To do haemodialysis, people need a reliable way to reach the bloodstream called dialysis access (AV access: a fistula or graft that connects an artery to a vein for dialysis). The best long-term types are an AVF and an AVG. If a fistula or graft stops working, people often need a temporary catheter. Catheters raise the chance of infections and central venous occlusion (a blockage of a major vein in the chest or neck).\n\nWhat happens when a fistula or graft becomes blocked?\nA common problem is thrombosis (clotting). Thrombosis blocks the access so blood cannot flow. It often follows stenosis (narrowing of a blood vessel), sometimes at the anastomosis (the surgical join between blood vessels). When this happens, dialysis cannot happen until the access is opened again. Urgent treatment is needed.\n\nHow are clots in dialysis access treated?\nThere are two main approaches. Thrombectomy removes the clot with tools or by surgery. Thrombolysis breaks up the clot using drugs, often given through a catheter into the clot. Both can be done by endovascular techniques (minimally invasive treatment done inside blood vessels using thin tubes and X-ray guidance) or by open surgery. Re-anastomosis (making a new surgical join) may be done during surgery. A key measure of success is patency, often checked at 30 days. Primary patency (primary patency: the time the access stays open without extra procedures) is one common outcome.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know which ways of clearing clots in fistulas or grafts work best and are safest for people on haemodialysis. We looked for randomized trials (patients are assigned by chance to different treatments) and quasi-randomized trials (assignment by a non-random method, such as birth date) that directly compared surgery, thrombectomy, and thrombolysis.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched research databases and trial registers for trials in people on haemodialysis whose AVF or AVG had become blocked. We combined study results where possible and rated how confident we are in those results using standard methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 randomized or quasi-randomized trials that included 1,176 people whose AVFs or AVGs had become blocked after use. Trials compared surgery, mechanical thrombectomy (device removal), and thrombolysis (drug dissolution). Trials usually reported short-term patency at about 30 days. Many trials were small, sometimes had industry involvement (funding by companies), and often did not clearly report where the trial took place or how long people were followed. Important outcomes such as death, the ability to dialyse through the access, access dysfunction (problems that stop effective dialysis), need for a temporary catheter, infections, and patient-reported outcomes were rarely reported. Overall, we are unsure if any treatment improves short-term patency, reduces repeat blockage, or changes harms. Surgery may give better short-term patency than mechanical thrombectomy, but we are very uncertain. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence because the trials were small and often used methods that can bias results. People in trials may have known which treatment they received. Trials rarely reported outcomes patients care about. The evidence does not cover all patients, treatments, or outcomes we wanted.\n\nWhat should future research do?\nFuture trials should be larger and well designed. They should directly compare surgery, thrombectomy, and thrombolysis. Trials should follow people longer and report outcomes important to patients and clinicians, including access staying open and usable (primary patency), ability to deliver dialysis through the access, time to the next clot, need for more procedures, harms, infections, use of temporary catheters, and quality of life. Trials should report results separately for fistulas and grafts and consider where the clot started.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to the searches run in January 2024."
