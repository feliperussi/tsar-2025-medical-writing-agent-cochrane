    "output": "Title: Does giving sugar water (sucrose) help reduce pain from heel pricks (a small blood test from the heel) in newborn babies?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving sugar water (sucrose; table sugar made of glucose and fructose) before a heel prick (heel lance; a quick prick on the baby’s heel to collect a few drops of blood for testing) probably reduces signs of pain in the first minute compared with plain water, placebo (an inactive substance given like the real treatment), or no treatment. This conclusion comes from 55 randomized controlled trials (RCTs; studies that randomly assign treatments) with 6,273 newborns (neonates; babies usually in the first 28 days of life).\n- Sucrose seems about as helpful as glucose (a type of sugar and main energy source), expressed breast milk (breast milk that has been pumped or hand-expressed), or skin-to-skin care (placing the baby bare on a parent’s bare chest). We do not have enough good evidence to say if sucrose is better than breastfeeding (feeding at the breast) or using a pacifier (non-nutritive sucking; letting a baby suck without milk). Only minor short-term unwanted events (adverse events; unwanted events that cause harm) were reported.\n- Most studies measured pain with standard newborn pain tools (for example, PIPP, NIPS, DAN, NFCS) only up to 60 seconds after the prick. We do not know how long any benefit lasts or if sucrose helps when lances are repeated.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We asked whether giving a small amount of oral sucrose (on the tongue or cheek) reduces pain from a heel lance in term neonates (born at or after 37 weeks) and preterm neonates (born before 37 weeks). We also asked whether sucrose is better or worse than other comfort methods and whether combining methods adds benefit or causes harm.\n\nWhat did we do?\n- We searched medical databases and trial registries (public lists of clinical studies) for RCTs. We included trials that compared sucrose with no treatment, water, placebo, glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, pacifiers (non-nutritive sucking), skin-to-skin care, facilitated tucking (gently holding a baby’s arms and legs close), music, laser acupuncture (using a low-level laser rather than a needle), or combinations (for example, sucrose plus a pacifier). We focused on pain scores recorded soon after the lance using PIPP (Premature Infant Pain Profile), PIPP-R (revised), NIPS (Neonatal Infant Pain Scale), DAN, NFCS, and similar tools.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- Sucrose probably reduces pain in the first minute after a single heel lance compared with no treatment, water, or placebo. We judge this as moderate-certainty evidence (GRADE; a system that rates how confident we can be in the evidence).\n- We found little or no difference between sucrose and glucose (low-certainty evidence). Sucrose may make little or no difference compared with expressed breast milk and appears similar to skin-to-skin care, but these comparisons are low or very low certainty.\n- We do not have enough high-quality evidence to say if sucrose is better than breastfeeding or a pacifier (non-nutritive sucking). Results for repeated heel lances were uncertain.\n- Across trials that recorded unwanted events, only minor, self-limited events were reported and none required treatment.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?\n- If no other comfort method is available, giving a small amount of sucrose shortly before a heel prick is a simple option that probably reduces immediate pain. When family-centred methods such as breastfeeding or skin-to-skin care are available, sucrose is not clearly better and may not add clear benefit. We should be cautious about routinely combining methods because the added value is unclear.\n\nHow sure are we?\n- Certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate for sucrose versus control in the first minute to low or very low for most other comparisons. This means future well-designed trials may change these findings. Many studies measured only short-term pain and did not report long-term effects.\n\nWhat should future studies do?\n- Future trials should be larger and better designed. They should directly compare sucrose with breastfeeding, skin-to-skin care, and pacifiers. They should test dosing (how much and when to give), report unwanted events clearly, and follow babies over time to look for long-term effects on health and development.\n\nWords we use (brief definitions)\n- heel lance: a quick prick on a baby’s heel to collect blood.  \n- neonate: a newborn baby, usually in the first 28 days of life.  \n- term neonate: born at or after 37 weeks of pregnancy.  \n- preterm neonate: born before 37 weeks of pregnancy.  \n- sucrose: table sugar made of glucose and fructose.  \n- glucose: a type of sugar and the main energy source for the body.  \n- breastfeeding: feeding at the breast.  \n- expressed breast milk: breast milk that has been pumped or hand-expressed and saved to feed the baby later.  \n- non-nutritive sucking (NNS): letting a baby suck on a pacifier or clean finger without getting milk.  \n- pacifier (dummy): a device used for non-nutritive sucking.  \n- skin-to-skin care (kangaroo care): placing the baby bare on a parent’s bare chest to keep warm and calm.  \n- facilitated tucking: gently holding a baby’s arms and legs close to their body to help them feel contained and calm.  \n- laser acupuncture: using a low-level laser beam instead of an acupuncture needle to stimulate an acupuncture point.  \n- randomized controlled trial (RCT): a study where participants are randomly assigned to different treatments to compare them fairly.  \n- trial registry: a public database where clinical studies are listed.  \n- placebo: an inactive substance or intervention given the same way as the real treatment.  \n- adverse events: unwanted events that cause harm.  \n- PIPP, PIPP-R, NIPS, DAN, NFCS, COMFORTneo, BPSN: tools that score newborn pain using facial and body signs, crying, and sometimes heart rate and oxygen.  \n- mean difference (MD): the average difference in results between two groups.  \n- confidence interval (CI): a range of numbers that likely contains the true effect.  \n- heterogeneity / I2: how much study results disagree beyond chance.  \n- GRADE: a system that rates our confidence in the overall evidence.  \n- data: information collected in studies.\n\nCurrency\n- The evidence is up to date to February 2022."
