    "output": "Are surgical glues (sealants — glue-like materials applied during surgery to seal tissues and help stop bleeding) better than standard methods at stopping bleeding where blood vessels are joined (anastomosis — the surgically created connection between blood vessels or between a vessel and a graft) during blood vessel surgery (vascular surgery — surgery on the body's blood vessels)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found that adding sealants to usual methods (such as manual compression — pressing firmly by hand) may stop bleeding faster (hemostasis — the process of stopping bleeding) and may lower the chance that stopping the bleeding fails (hemostatic failure — when an attempt to stop bleeding does not work). The evidence is uncertain because the studies have problems (bias — flaws in the way a study is designed, done, or analyzed).\n- We found no clear differences for total blood loss in surgery, operating time (the total length of the operation), bleeding after surgery (postoperative — after surgery), or needing another operation (unplanned return to the operating room — needing another unexpected surgery soon after the first) to treat bleeding.\n- Future studies should be larger and better designed. They should report harms, deaths, and quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day). They should report longer-term results and consider cost-effectiveness.\n\nIntroduction and aims\nWhat is vascular surgery and what is an anastomosis?\n- Vascular surgery treats diseases of the arteries and veins (blood vessels). An anastomosis is the surgical join of two vessel ends or of a vessel to a graft (a man-made tube used to replace or bypass a damaged blood vessel). The stitch holes at the join can ooze or bleed. Stopping this bleeding is called hemostasis (the process of stopping bleeding).\n\nWhy does bleeding at the join matter and how is it usually controlled?\n- Bleeding at the anastomosis can make the operation longer, increase blood loss, and sometimes lead to more procedures. Surgeons usually try simple methods first, such as manual compression (pressing on the site by hand), extra stitches, or reversing anticoagulation (giving treatments that counter blood-thinning medicines). They also use absorbable hemostats like oxidized cellulose (an absorbable mesh or pad) or gelatin sponge (an absorbable spongy material). When these do not work, surgeons may add a hemostatic adjunct (an add-on treatment used alongside standard methods).\n\nWhat are surgical sealants for blood vessel joins?\n- Sealants are glue-like materials placed on the bleeding area to seal stitch holes and support clotting. Types include fibrin sealants (made from fibrin — a protein involved in forming blood clots) and synthetic sealants (man-made materials). Sealants are an adjunct (an add-on) to standard care. They can add cost or cause adverse events (unwanted events that cause harm).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We wanted to know if adding a sealant to usual care helps stop bleeding at the anastomosis. We looked at time to hemostasis, failures to stop bleeding, blood loss in surgery, operating time, bleeding after surgery, unplanned return to the operating room, deaths from bleeding, quality of life, and adverse events.\n\nMethods\n- We searched medical databases (large collections of published research) and trial registries (organized lists of planned and running research studies) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs — studies that randomly assign participants to treatments). We included trials that compared sealants plus usual care with usual care alone for anastomotic bleeding. We combined results where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence (how sure we are that the results are correct).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We included 24 RCTs with 2,376 people having vascular surgery with an anastomosis. Surgeons used fibrin or synthetic sealants and compared them with usual methods such as oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, or manual compression. Outcomes were measured during surgery and up to 30 days after.\n- Sealants may reduce the time needed to stop bleeding. It is unclear if they reduce failures to stop bleeding. Sealants may make little or no difference to total blood loss during surgery, operating time, bleeding after surgery, or needing another operation to treat bleeding. No trial reported deaths from bleeding or quality of life.\n\nLimitations\n- We are not confident in these results. Many studies were small and often lacked key details. It is possible that staff or patients knew which treatment was given, causing performance bias (systematic differences in care or behavior) or detection bias (systematic differences in how outcomes were measured). Results may be inconsistent or imprecise and could overestimate benefits.\n\nCurrency\n- The evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nWhat this means\n- Sealants might help stop bleeding faster, but the evidence is uncertain. We need larger, well-designed trials that report harms, deaths, and quality of life and look at longer-term and cost outcomes."
