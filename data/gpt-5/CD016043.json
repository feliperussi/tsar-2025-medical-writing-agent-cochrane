    "output": "Title: What are the different ways to provide eye tests and glasses in communities and primary care (basic health clinics)?\n\nKey messages\n- We mapped the main ways communities and basic health clinics deliver eye tests and provide glasses for blurry vision that spectacles (eyeglasses made to your prescription to focus light and clear vision) can fix. Approaches included school-based programs (health services provided within schools so students can be screened where they learn), pharmacy-based services (services offered at community pharmacies), outreach (health workers travel to people or set up temporary clinics), vision centres (local eye clinics that offer basic eye exams, refraction, and glasses), services in general health centres (primary care: health services that meet basic health needs over time), and mixed models that combine centre-based care with door-to-door delivery (health workers visiting homes). Most reports described how services were organized rather than how well they worked. We found too little good-quality evidence to say which approach works best, and reports did not describe harmful effects.\n- Use of these approaches varied by setting and region. In community settings (places in the community outside hospitals, such as schools, pharmacies, or community centers), school-based and outreach models were most often reported. In basic health clinics, vision-centre models were common. Many reports came from the WHO African Region (the group of African countries served by the World Health Organization), many came from the Region of the Americas (WHO region covering North, Central, and South America and the Caribbean), and very few came from the Eastern Mediterranean Region (parts of the Middle East, North Africa, and nearby countries).\n- What should happen next: Because this was a scoping review (a study that maps existing research and shows gaps) and most sources did not evaluate results, we need better studies that compare models. Studies should measure outcomes that matter to people and services, such as accurate testing, timely access to the right glasses, unwanted effects (for example, wrong prescriptions or eye strain), costs, and whether services are acceptable (people can and want to use them) and equitable (people can get care regardless of income, gender, disability, or where they live).\n\nIntroduction / Aims\nWhat are refractive errors and why do they matter?\n- Refractive errors are common vision problems where the eye does not focus light correctly, causing blurred vision. Examples are myopia (short-sightedness), hyperopia (long-sightedness), astigmatism (irregular focus), and presbyopia (age-related trouble seeing up close). Many people can get much better vision quickly and safely with spectacles (eyeglasses). Lack of access to testing and glasses can harm learning, work, safety, and quality of life. The World Health Organization (a part of the United Nations that deals with major health issues and sets global health standards) aims to raise effective coverage (how many people who need a service actually get it at enough quality to get the intended health benefit) of refractive error by 40 percentage points by 2030.\n\nWhat are refractive services and optical services, and where are they provided?\n- Refractive services test vision and find the lens prescription a person needs. Optical services make, fit, and supply glasses or contact lenses. These services can be offered in community care settings (places outside hospitals such as schools, pharmacies, or mobile outreach), in primary care clinics (basic health centres that provide general health services), or in dedicated vision centres (local clinics focused on eye exams and glasses). Strengthening these local services can improve access and make care fairer.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We wanted to identify the delivery models for refractive and optical care in community and primary care. We also wanted to see how people evaluated these models: study types and outcomes. Observational studies (research that watches what happens without assigning treatments) and interventional studies (research that gives a specific treatment or program to some people to see its effects) were of interest. We searched databases and grey literature (reports and materials published outside academic journals) and organizational websites from 2002 to 2022.\n\nMethods\n- We screened and extracted data from 175 studies, 146 company reports, and 81 records from organization websites. We summarized delivery models and how they were evaluated and noted strengths and gaps.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\n- We found many descriptions of delivery models but few formal evaluations. In community settings, school-based and outreach models were most common. Pharmacy-based models were also reported. In primary care settings, vision-centre models were most often described, along with general health-centre models and mixed models that combined centre-based care with door-to-door delivery (health workers visiting homes). By region, school-based and outreach models were mainly reported in the WHO African Region, outreach was common in the Region of the Americas, and very few reports came from the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The evidence included observational and interventional studies, reviews, and organizational reports. Many records did not report participant numbers or study length. Because few studies formally compared models, we do not know which models improve testing and correction of refractive error.\n\nLimitations\n- We are not confident in the evidence. Most studies did not randomly assign people to models, so differences might come from who joined each model rather than the models themselves. Studies used different methods and covered different groups. The evidence did not include all the people, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes we wanted.\n\nCurrency\n- The evidence is up to date to November 2022.\n\nFunding and support\n- The review was supported by the WHO Vision and Eye Care Programme (a WHO program that helps countries prevent vision loss and improve access to eye care) and the ATscale Global Partnership (a global initiative to expand access to assistive devices such as glasses)."
