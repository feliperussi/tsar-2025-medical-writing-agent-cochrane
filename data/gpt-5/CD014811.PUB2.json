    "output": "Title: Is giving water medicines (diuretics) through a slow drip into a vein (continuous infusion: putting fluid into a blood vessel over a prolonged time) better than giving them as quick injections (bolus: a large amount given all at once) for adults with acute heart failure (acute heart failure: a sudden start or sudden worsening of heart failure symptoms that often needs urgent hospital care)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found too little good-quality evidence to show that continuous infusion of loop diuretics (loop diuretics: strong “water pills” that help the kidneys remove extra salt and water quickly; examples include furosemide) is better than bolus dosing (bolus: single larger doses given at set times) for adults in hospital with acute heart failure (acute heart failure: sudden worsening when the heart cannot pump blood well).\n- Results for death (deaths from any cause), length of hospital stay (number of days in hospital), and readmission (being admitted again after discharge) looked similar for the two methods. Any extra fluid or weight loss with continuous infusion was small and uncertain. Sudden kidney problems (acute kidney injury: a sudden drop in how well the kidneys work) seemed similar.\n- Harms such as hearing damage from a drug (ototoxicity: damage to the inner ear causing hearing loss or ringing), low blood pressure (hypotension: abnormally low blood pressure), or abnormal blood salt levels (electrolyte problems: imbalance of substances like sodium or potassium) were not reported consistently. We cannot tell if these differ.\n\nWhat is acute heart failure and why is it a problem?\nAcute heart failure (acute heart failure: a sudden start or worsening of heart failure symptoms) happens when the heart cannot pump blood well. This causes fluid to build up in the lungs and body (congestion: fluid buildup in the lungs and body). People can become very short of breath, swollen, and tired. Many need urgent hospital care.\n\nHow is excess fluid treated in hospital?\nDoctors usually give loop diuretics (loop diuretics: strong “water pills” that make the kidneys pass more urine) into a vein (intravenous: into or within a vein) so they work faster. They give them as continuous infusion (continuous infusion: a slow steady drip into a vein) or as bolus injections (bolus: a large amount given all at once). The way of giving the medicine might change how fast fluid comes off, how people feel, and the chance of harms such as hypotension (low blood pressure) or acute kidney injury (sudden kidney problems).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether continuous infusion works better or is safer than bolus dosing for adults in hospital with more severe symptoms (NYHA class III–IV: a scale in which class III limits activity and class IV causes symptoms even at rest). We looked at fluid loss (for example, change in body weight), deaths (deaths from any cause), length of hospital stay, readmission (return to hospital after discharge), and harms such as acute kidney injury.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched medical databases and trial registries for randomized studies that compared IV (IV: into or within a vein) loop diuretics given as continuous infusion versus bolus. We combined results for key outcomes and rated how certain the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 7 randomized studies from 32 hospitals in 7 countries. Together they included 681 adults in hospital with acute heart failure and fluid overload (fluid overload: having too much fluid in the body). Trials that added other strong treatments (for example inotropes: medicines that change how strongly the heart squeezes) or dialysis (dialysis: a machine that cleans the blood when the kidneys fail) were excluded to keep the comparison focused.\n\n- Overall, we did not find clear evidence that one method is better.\n- Continuous infusion may cause a small extra weight loss, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- Continuous infusion probably makes little or no difference to death, readmission, or acute kidney injury (evidence certainty: low).\n- It is unclear whether continuous infusion changes length of hospital stay (evidence certainty: very low).\n\nHow sure are we?\nWe have low confidence in most results. The studies were few and small. They used different doses and measured outcomes in different ways. Some studies had design or reporting problems. People in trials may have known which treatment they got, which can bias results.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nBased on current evidence, both methods seem similar. Doctors can consider usual practice, patient preference, and available resources. Important outcomes for patients—such as heart-related deaths, symptoms, and quality of life—were rarely measured.\n\nWhat research is needed?\nWe need larger, well-designed trials that directly compare the two methods with clear dosing plans. Trials should follow people longer and measure outcomes that matter to patients (relief of breathlessness, reduction in swelling, quality of life), survival, kidney function, a full range of harms (including ototoxicity, hypotension, and electrolyte problems), results after discharge, and costs.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024."
