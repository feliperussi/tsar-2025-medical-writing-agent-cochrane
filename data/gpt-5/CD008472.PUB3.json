    "output": "Title:\nDoes briefly stopping blood flow to an arm or leg before planned major blood vessel surgery (remote ischaemic preconditioning — a technique where brief, controlled interruptions of blood flow, usually to an arm or leg, are used before a procedure to help protect other organs) reduce deaths and complications?\n\nKey messages:\n- In people having planned major blood vessel (vascular — relating to the body's blood vessels) surgery, briefly stopping blood flow to a limb before the operation (remote ischaemic preconditioning, RIPC) does not clearly reduce deaths or major problems around the time of surgery (perioperative — around the time of surgery). Major problems include heart attack (myocardial infarction — an interruption in the blood supply to the heart), kidney problems (renal impairment — related to the kidneys), stroke (damage to blood vessels in the brain), or loss of a limb (amputation). Trials did not clearly report harms from the cuff procedure itself. The evidence suggests little or no difference, but it is not strong enough to rule out small benefits or harms.\n- The studies did not show clear effects on how long people stayed in hospital or on how long the operation and anaesthetic (a medicine that prevents people feeling pain) lasted. These findings mainly apply to older adults having planned (elective — scheduled, non-emergency) operations on large blood vessels.\n- We need larger, well-designed studies that focus on outcomes that matter to patients (survival; heart, brain, and kidney problems; recovery and quality of life), that clearly report any harms from the cuff procedure, and that follow people for longer after surgery.\n\nIntroduction and aims\n\nWhat are major vascular and endovascular operations, and why can they be risky?\n- Vascular (relating to blood vessels) surgery treats the body's arteries and veins. Endovascular (procedures done inside blood vessels using thin tubes and instruments) surgery uses small tubes inside the vessels instead of open surgery. These operations repair aneurysms (ballooning of an artery) or improve blood flow in blocked arteries. Even when planned, they can cause serious problems around the time of surgery (perioperative). These problems include heart attack (myocardial infarction), stroke, kidney damage (renal impairment), loss of a limb (amputation), longer hospital stays, and sometimes death.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC)?\n- Ischaemia (a shortage of blood and oxygen reaching part of the body) can damage tissue if it lasts too long. RIPC uses short, controlled periods of reduced blood flow to a limb (often by inflating a blood pressure cuff) before surgery. The idea is that these brief episodes trigger the body’s protective responses. This may help tissues cope better with later, longer reduced blood flow during surgery. RIPC is low cost and easy to do.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We wanted to know whether RIPC before planned major vascular or endovascular surgery helps patients compared with no RIPC. We looked for effects on death around surgery (perioperative mortality — the number of deaths around the surgery), heart attack (myocardial infarction), kidney problems (renal impairment), stroke, loss of a limb (amputation), length of hospital stay, and time in the operating room or under anaesthesia. We also looked for any harms from RIPC.\n\nMethods\n- We searched medical databases and trial registries (organized lists of research information) up to April 2022 for studies that compared RIPC with no RIPC before planned major vascular or endovascular surgery. We combined results where possible and rated how certain the evidence is.\n\nResults\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs — studies where people are randomly assigned to treatments) that included 1,295 adults having elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. The trials ran from 2003 to 2019. Participants were mostly older adults (average ages 64.5 to 76 years) and mostly men (84%).\n- The trials compared RIPC (briefly stopping blood flow to a limb) with no RIPC. They measured death during or soon after surgery, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, losing a limb (amputation), hospital stay length, and time in theatre or under anaesthesia.\n- Overall, RIPC probably makes little to no difference to death during or soon after surgery. It probably makes little to no difference to heart attack, kidney problems, and stroke around the time of surgery. It may make little to no difference to losing a limb. It probably makes little to no difference to how long people stay in hospital or how long the operation and anaesthetic take. The certainty of the evidence was moderate for most outcomes and low for limb loss.\n\nLimitations\n- We are moderately confident in the evidence. The evidence is limited by few events, differences between studies (for example, different RIPC methods and different types of patients), and the risk that the available trials may overestimate benefits (bias — flaws in a study that favour one conclusion). Many trials did not report harms from the cuff procedure clearly.\n\nCurrency\n- This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022."
