    "output": "How effective and safe is favipiravir (an antiviral medicine) for treating COVID-19?\n\nKey messages\n- We found insufficient good-quality evidence that favipiravir helps people with COVID-19 (an infectious disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2). It may not reduce death or the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (a breathing tube and machine). It may increase non-serious unwanted effects (adverse events).\n- Most trials enrolled hospitalized adults with mild to moderate illness and compared favipiravir with placebo (a dummy treatment) or usual care (standard of care). Trials varied in who joined and in the dose in mg (milligrams) and duration. This variation lowers our confidence.\n- We need larger, well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs; studies that randomly assign people to treatments) in different care settings and severities. Trials should measure patient-important outcomes (survival, need for breathing support, recovery speed) and track short- and long-term harms.\n\nWhat is COVID-19 and how is it usually treated?\nCOVID-19 is the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Symptoms range from mild (cough, fever) to severe disease that affects the lungs and other organs. Many people recover at home with rest, fluids, and supportive treatment (care that eases symptoms and helps the body, such as oxygen, fluids, and fever control). People who are sicker may need hospital care, including oxygen therapy (giving extra oxygen through a mask or tubes) or invasive mechanical ventilation (a breathing tube put into the windpipe and a ventilator that helps or replaces breathing).\n\nWhat is favipiravir and why might it help?\nFavipiravir is an antiviral drug (a medicine that treats virus infections) taken by mouth. It was developed for influenza (flu). It may stop certain viruses from copying their genetic material. Because it can target viruses, researchers tested favipiravir in RCTs for COVID-19. Its benefit for COVID-19 remains uncertain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether favipiravir, compared with no antiviral, placebo (an inactive dummy treatment), usual care (standard of care; the normal treatment), or other antiviral drugs, helps people with COVID-19. We looked for effects on recovery, getting worse (progression), the need for hospital admission (if ambulatory; able to walk), the need for oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (mortality rate). We also looked for harms, including serious adverse events (side effects that cause death, are life‑threatening, or need hospital care) and any adverse events.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with acute (sudden) COVID-19. We combined results using standard Cochrane methods and judged the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach (a system that rates how much we trust the results).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We included 25 RCTs with 5,750 adults from 13 countries. Most people were under 60 and in hospital with mild to moderate disease.\n- Favipiravir was usually started with a higher dose on day 1 and then given twice daily for 5–14 days in many trials.\n- Favipiravir was compared mostly with placebo or usual care. A few trials compared it with other antivirals, such as lopinavir/ritonavir (a combination drug) or umifenovir (an antiviral).\n- We do not know if favipiravir reduces death or the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.\n- For people treated at home, favipiravir may make little to no difference to the chance of being admitted to hospital.\n- We do not know if favipiravir shortens the time to feeling better.\n- Favipiravir may make little to no difference to the need for oxygen therapy.\n- Favipiravir may increase any adverse events but may make little to no difference to serious adverse events.\n- Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low to very low, so we are uncertain whether favipiravir helps.\n\nHow sure are we about these results?\nWe rated the evidence as low to very low certainty using GRADE. This means we have little confidence that the study results reflect the true effects.\n\nWhat are the main limitations?\n- Many trials were small. \n- Trials differed in who joined and in dose (mg) and duration. \n- Some trials may not have been blinded, so participants or staff might have known which treatment they received. \n- Not all trials reported all outcomes or funding.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and clinicians?\n- Based on current evidence, we cannot recommend favipiravir as a proven treatment for COVID-19. Clinicians should follow local guidance and use treatments proven to work.\n\nGlossary (plain language)\n- SARS-CoV-2: the virus that causes COVID-19.  \n- COVID-19: the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.  \n- Antiviral/drug: a medicine that treats virus infections.  \n- Favipiravir: an antiviral made for flu, tested for COVID-19.  \n- RCT/randomized controlled trial: a study that randomly assigns people to different treatments so researchers can fairly test if a treatment works.  \n- Placebo: an inactive dummy treatment that looks like the real one.  \n- Usual care/standard of care: the normal treatment people get for a condition.  \n- Supportive treatment: care that eases symptoms (oxygen, fluids, fever control).  \n- Oxygen therapy: giving extra oxygen using a mask or tubes.  \n- Invasive mechanical ventilation: a breathing tube placed into the windpipe and a ventilator that helps or replaces breathing.  \n- Lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir: other antiviral drugs used in some trials.  \n- Mortality (rate): number of deaths over time.  \n- Adverse event: an unwanted side effect.  \n- Serious adverse event: a side effect that causes death, is life‑threatening, or needs hospital care.  \n- Progression: getting worse.  \n- Ambulatory: able to walk; not in hospital.  \n- Risk ratio (RR), hazard ratio (HR), confidence interval (CI): numbers studies use to compare groups and show uncertainty.  \n- GRADE approach/certainty of evidence: a system that rates how much we trust study results.  \n- Acute: sudden or severe.  \n- mg: milligram, a unit for drug dose.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023."
