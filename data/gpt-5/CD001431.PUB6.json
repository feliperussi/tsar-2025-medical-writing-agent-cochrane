    "output": "Title: Do decision aids (tools like booklets, videos, or websites that explain options, benefits, and risks and help people think about what matters to them when choosing a treatment or a screening test) help people make better informed choices about treatment or screening (checking for disease when there are no symptoms) than usual care (the care a provider would normally give their patients)?\n\nKey messages\n- Decision aids improve knowledge, understanding of risk (chance), and help people choose in line with their values (what matters most to them). This result comes from many randomized trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to groups to compare treatments fairly).\n- Decision aids help people feel informed and clear about what matters to them, and make them take a more active role in decisions with their clinician (a health professional who takes care of patients). They did not lengthen the consultation (the appointment time with the health professional) when used before the visit. Using aids during the visit was linked to slightly longer consultations.\n- We found no evidence of harms such as more decision regret (feeling sorry or wishing you had chosen differently later). We are uncertain about longer-term effects, adherence (whether people follow the chosen option), costs, and resource use (healthcare services, staff time, equipment, and money).\n\nWhy can health treatment and screening decisions be hard?\nWe face choices such as starting a medicine, having surgery (an operation to remove or repair a part of the body), trying a mental health treatment (care for a person’s psychological and emotional condition), or taking part in screening (checking for disease when there are no symptoms). Each option can bring benefits and adverse events (unwanted events that cause harm). There may not be a single best choice. People have different values (what matters most to them). Health information can be complex and appointment time is often limited. These factors make decisions hard.\n\nWhat are patient decision aids?\nPatient decision aids are tools designed to help people choose about treatments or screening. They include leaflets, websites, videos, or worksheets. They explain the options, the likely benefits and harms (adverse events), and the chances of these happening (risk). They help people compare options and think about their values. Decision aids are used before or during appointments to prepare people for shared decision-making (patients and clinicians working together to choose care). They focus on a specific decision and guide people to weigh options based on their priorities.\n\nWhat did this review want to find out?\nWe asked whether patient decision aids help adults deciding about treatment or screening compared with usual care (the care a provider would normally give). We looked at whether decision aids:\n- improve knowledge and accurate risk perception (how people understand their chance of benefits and harms);\n- make people feel informed and clear about their values (what matters most to them);\n- increase active participation in decisions and make choices match those values;\n- change decision regret (feeling sorry or wishing you chose differently later) and consultation length (the appointment time).\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched medical databases and grey literature (research not published in traditional journals) up to March 2022. We included adults and randomized trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to groups to compare treatments fairly). We screened and extracted data in duplicate. We combined results across studies for the outcomes above. We rated how certain the evidence is using GRADE (a system for rating how trustworthy the evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 209 randomized trials involving 107,698 adults. The trials covered 71 different decisions. Common topics included heart disease treatments (having to do with the heart and blood vessels), cancer screening (colorectal, prostate, breast), cancer treatments, mental health treatments, and joint replacement surgery (a procedure to replace a joint). Compared with usual care, decision aids caused large increases in knowledge and in accurate understanding of the chances of benefits and harms. They probably increased the match between people’s values and the choices they made (informed values-based choice congruence). Decision aids made people feel more informed and clearer about what matters to them. More people took an active role in decisions. Decision aids made little or no difference to later decision regret. We do not know whether decision aids affect adherence (following the chosen option), costs, or use of healthcare resources.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\nWe rated our confidence as moderate (medium confidence). Some studies did not report methods clearly. Participants or staff may have known which group they were in, which could cause bias (a flaw in the study design or conduct that favors one conclusion). Few studies measured long-term outcomes, adherence, costs, or unwanted effects beyond decision regret.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to searches done in March 2022."
