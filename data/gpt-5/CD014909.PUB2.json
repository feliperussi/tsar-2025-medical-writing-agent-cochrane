    "output": "Title: Is cleaning out the bowel with laxatives plus antibiotic pills before planned colon or rectal surgery better at preventing infections and leaks where the bowel is reconnected than laxatives alone, antibiotic pills alone, or no cleaning?\n\nKey messages\n- For adults having planned colon or rectal surgery (elective colorectal surgery: a planned, non-emergency operation on the colon, the main part of the large intestine, or the rectum, the last part of the large intestine), using laxatives to empty the bowel (mechanical bowel preparation: medicines or fluids that flush stool out) plus antibiotic pills by mouth (oral antibiotics: antibiotics taken by mouth) probably reduces wound infections (surgical site infection: infection in the cut or nearby tissues) and leaks where the bowel is joined (anastomotic leak: a leak from the surgical join) compared with laxatives alone.\n- We could not tell if adding laxatives to antibiotic pills gives extra benefit, or if doing both is better than no preparation, because the evidence was limited. Side effects (unwanted or harmful effects) were poorly reported. Important harms such as dehydration (loss of too much body fluid) or electrolyte imbalance (changes in body salts like sodium or potassium) were not recorded, so we cannot judge how often they occur.\n- More well-designed trials are needed that compare oral antibiotics alone, combined treatment, and no preparation; use consistent regimens (regimens: the exact drugs, doses, and timing used); and fully report harms. Trials should study subgroups (specific groups of patients, for example colon versus rectal surgery) to see who benefits most.\n\nWhat is elective colorectal surgery and why can complications happen?\nWe use elective colorectal surgery to treat problems of the colon or rectum. The colon and rectum normally contain many bacteria. These bacteria can cause infections after an operation. Two common problems are surgical site infection (an infection at or near the operation area) and anastomotic leak (a leak from the place where two ends of bowel are joined). Both problems can slow recovery and affect long-term health.\n\nWhat is bowel preparation before colorectal surgery?\nTeams may use mechanical bowel preparation (strong laxatives or fluids that flush stool out) and/or oral antibiotic bowel preparation (antibiotics taken by mouth to reduce bowel bacteria). Everyone in the trials also received standard intravenous antibiotics (antibiotics given into a vein, called IV, around the time of surgery). Mechanical bowel preparation alone does not seem to help. Clinicians debate whether adding oral antibiotics to mechanical cleansing helps more than either approach alone or no preparation.\n\nWhat did we study and how?\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials (studies that assign people by chance to different treatments) in adults having planned colorectal surgery. We compared combined mechanical bowel preparation plus oral antibiotics with mechanical preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation. We pooled results (combined data from multiple studies) for outcomes such as surgical site infection and anastomotic leak. We rated how certain the evidence was by looking at study methods, size, and consistency.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 randomized trials with 5,264 adults. Seventeen trials compared combined treatment with mechanical preparation alone. Three compared combined treatment with oral antibiotics alone. One compared combined treatment with no preparation. The exact cleansing methods and antibiotic regimens differed between trials. No trial was clearly at high risk of bias (bias: flaws in study design or conduct that can distort results), but about two-thirds had some concerns.\n\nMain results\n- Adding oral antibiotics to mechanical bowel preparation probably reduces surgical site infections and anastomotic leaks compared with mechanical preparation alone.\n- We did not find clear differences in deaths (mortality: the number of deaths in a group over time), temporary bowel paralysis after surgery (postoperative ileus: when the bowel stops moving for a time), or length of hospital stay between the combined approach and mechanical preparation alone.\n- When people already received oral antibiotics, adding mechanical preparation showed uncertain benefit. Compared with no preparation, the effects of combining treatments were also uncertain.\n\nLimitations\nWe judged the evidence to be of moderate certainty. Trials varied in methods and reporting. People in trials may have known which treatment they received. Many trials did not report side effects such as dehydration or electrolyte problems. Funding sources were not reported. We need more consistent, well-designed trials that report harms and compare oral antibiotics alone, combined treatment, and no preparation. Trials should report results for subgroups (for example colon versus rectal surgery).\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current to December 2021."
