    "output": "How accurate are common laboratory tests (like blood tests) for detecting vitamin A deficiency in people at risk?\n\nKey messages\n- We found that common blood tests—serum or plasma retinol (SR; the level of vitamin A measured in the liquid part of blood after removing clotting proteins) and retinol-binding protein (RBP; a blood protein that carries vitamin A)—often missed people who truly had vitamin A deficiency (a shortage of a substance needed by the body). These tests had low sensitivity (how well a test finds people who have the condition). They more often correctly showed when people did not have deficiency (high specificity: how well a test finds people who do not have the condition). Studies did not report harms from doing these tests.\n- Test performance depended on the comparison method (reference standard; the best available method to decide who truly has the condition). Retinol isotope dilution (RID; a lab test that gives a small, safe labeled dose of vitamin A and measures how it mixes to estimate total body stores) and liver vitamin A concentration (the amount of vitamin A stored in the liver, reported in micromol/g, a unit showing millionths of a mole per gram) gave different pictures. Evidence was limited for the relative dose response (RDR; a test that gives a small dose of vitamin A and measures the rise in blood a few hours later) and for vitamin A in breast milk (the amount of vitamin A in a mother’s milk). No eligible studies assessed the modified RDR (MRDR; a simplified version of RDR using a vitamin A analog and one blood sample).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We wanted to know how accurate common laboratory tests (diagnostic tests; tests used to find out if a person has a condition) are at detecting subclinical vitamin A deficiency (low vitamin A without obvious symptoms) in people at risk (people with a significant chance of having or developing the condition).\n\nHow did we do the review?\n- We searched multiple databases to August 2022. We included studies that measured an index test (the test being evaluated) and compared it at the same time with a reference standard (for example RID or liver vitamin A). We combined sensitivity and specificity (measures of test accuracy) when possible and judged study quality using standard tools (for example GRADE; a system that rates how certain we are about study findings).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We included 40 studies reported in 65 records. Studies had no restrictions by age, sex, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or country. Index tests included SR, RBP, RDR, and breast milk vitamin A. Reference standards were RID or liver vitamin A, using liver cutoffs (threshold values used to decide if someone is deficient) of 0.1 and 0.07 micromol/g.\n- None of the studies was planned as a diagnostic test accuracy study (a study that compares a test with the best available method to see how well it identifies who has the condition). Many studies had small samples and few condition-positive people (those who truly have the condition by the reference standard).\n- Across tests, accuracy varied. Tests often had low sensitivity, meaning many false negatives (tests that say a person is not deficient when they are). Tests more often had higher specificity, meaning fewer false positives (tests that say a person is deficient when they are not). For SR versus RID, sensitivity was very low and specificity was high. For SR versus liver vitamin A, sensitivity was about 50% and specificity was moderate. For RBP, sensitivity and specificity were moderate versus RID, but sensitivity was very low and specificity high versus liver vitamin A. For RDR and breast milk vitamin A, data were too few to draw firm conclusions. No eligible MRDR studies were found.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\n- We have low confidence in the evidence (GRADE). Studies were not designed to evaluate test accuracy. They often included few condition-positive people. Reporting was inconsistent. Many analyses used small numbers. Factors such as infection or inflammation (the body’s response to injury or illness) can change blood vitamin A but were not always accounted for. These issues can cause bias (flaws in study design or methods that lead to wrong conclusions).\n\nWhat should happen next?\n- We recommend well-designed diagnostic accuracy studies that compare index tests with reference standards and include enough condition-positive people. Studies should use consistent cutoffs, report any harms, and consider covariates (characteristics such as age, infection, or inflammation that can affect results). Researchers should report sensitivity and specificity clearly so clinicians can judge test value.\n\nCurrency\n- The evidence is up to date to August 2022."
