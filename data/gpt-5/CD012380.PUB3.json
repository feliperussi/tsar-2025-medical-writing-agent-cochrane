    "output": "Do treatments help prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease (an inherited disease in which red blood cells have an abnormal crescent shape, block small blood vessels, and do not last as long as normal red blood cells)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found too little reliable evidence to know if current treatments prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. In infants, hydroxyurea (a drug used to reduce complications of sickle cell disease) did not clearly change glomerular filtration rate (a measure of the kidney’s ability to filter and remove waste products) but may improve urine concentrating ability (how well the kidneys make urine that is more concentrated). Serious unwanted effects of sickle cell disease, such as acute chest syndrome (a sudden, serious lung problem causing chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing) and pain crises (episodes of severe pain caused by blocked small blood vessels), occurred in both groups. Hydroxyurea may make little or no difference compared with placebo (an inactive treatment used to test a drug).\n- Only a few small randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to 2 or more treatment groups) tested hydroxyurea or ACE inhibitors (angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors; medicines that lower blood pressure and can protect the kidneys by blocking a hormone that tightens blood vessels). No trials tested red blood cell transfusion (a procedure giving donor red blood cells through a vein) or combinations of treatments. Most people in the trials were very young children or had microalbuminuria (small amounts of the protein albumin in the urine, an early sign of kidney damage). Information on deaths (mortality), serious adverse events (harmful or unwanted effects), and quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) was missing or very limited.\n- We need well‑designed, larger trials with longer follow-up. These should include older children and adults and people with different genotypes (the genetic makeup that causes different forms of sickle cell disease). Trials should compare hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, red blood cell transfusion, and combination treatments. They should measure outcomes that matter to patients, such as proteinuria (protein in the urine) and kidney or renal function (how well the kidneys work), and report unwanted effects and quality of life.\n\nIntroduction / Aims\nWhat is sickle cell disease and how can it affect the kidneys?\nSickle cell disease is an inherited blood condition caused by changes in the haemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen) gene. Red blood cells can become rigid and sickle-shaped. These cells can block blood flow, cause severe pain, damage organs, and shorten life. The kidneys are often affected. Chronic kidney disease (a condition in which the kidneys become damaged slowly over time and cannot remove waste and extra water well) can develop. Early signs include microalbuminuria (small amounts of the protein albumin in the urine). This can progress to proteinuria (the presence of protein in the urine) and a lowering of glomerular filtration rate. Some people reach end-stage renal disease (when kidneys fail and dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed).\n\nWhat treatments might help protect the kidneys in people with sickle cell disease?\nPossible treatments include:\n- Hydroxyurea (a drug that may help keep abnormal red blood cells from forming and reduce painful crises).\n- ACE inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; medicines that lower blood pressure and can protect the kidneys by blocking a hormone that tightens blood vessels).\n- Red blood cell transfusions (a procedure that gives donor red blood cells through a vein to improve oxygen delivery and reduce sickling).\nClinicians track kidney health with measures such as proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether these treatments prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We looked at hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, and red blood cell transfusions, given alone or in combination. We planned to assess effects on signs of kidney damage (microalbuminuria and proteinuria), on kidney function (glomerular filtration rate), and on unwanted effects.\n\nMethods\nWe searched databases and trial registers for randomized controlled trials testing hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, or red blood cell transfusions to prevent or reduce kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We compared results and rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE (a system to rate how confident we are in research findings).\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 3 randomized controlled trials with 385 people. One trial compared hydroxyurea with placebo in 193 children aged 9 to 18 months. One small trial compared captopril (an ACE inhibitor) with placebo in 22 adults with normal blood pressure (the force of circulating blood on the artery walls) and microalbuminuria, followed for 6 months. One trial compared lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) with vitamin C (an antioxidant nutrient) in 170 children aged 1 to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. No trials tested red blood cell transfusion or combinations of treatments.\n\nThe ACE inhibitor trials did not report deaths (mortality), serious adverse events, or quality of life. The hydroxyurea trial did not report quality of life. Overall, our confidence in the evidence was low to very low. In infants, hydroxyurea may improve urine concentrating ability (measured as osmolality, a way to describe how concentrated a fluid is) but it is unclear if it improves overall kidney function. Hydroxyurea may make little or no difference to acute chest syndrome or pain crises. In adults, we are uncertain whether captopril reduces proteinuria or affects kidney function. In children, we are uncertain whether lisinopril is better than vitamin C for reducing proteinuria. No randomized studies addressed red blood cell transfusion or combined treatments. Studies were small and not designed to answer key questions.\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident in the evidence. People in the studies may have known which treatment they received. Not all studies reported the outcomes we wanted. The evidence does not cover all ages, genotypes, or treatments. Studies were small and short, so results may be imprecise (uncertain because of small study size or wide result ranges).\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to the 2020 search."
