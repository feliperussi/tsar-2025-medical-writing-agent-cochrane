    "output": "Does cognitive rehabilitation (a personalized therapy that teaches practical strategies, uses reminders or aids, and changes the environment to help a person reach specific everyday goals) help people with mild to moderate dementia (a condition that affects thinking and memory and usually gets worse over time; mild = slight problems, moderate = medium problems) do everyday tasks, compared with usual care (the care a provider would normally give)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found 6 studies (including 1 large, high-quality randomized controlled trial — a study where people are assigned by chance to different groups) showing that cognitive rehabilitation leads to large improvements in the specific everyday goals people work on (goal attainment: how much a person achieved their individual therapy goals). Benefits were clear at the end of treatment and lasted for several months.\n- Cognitive rehabilitation may slightly increase self-efficacy (a person’s belief in their ability to manage tasks), immediate recall (remembering information right after it is presented), and some attention skills (sustained attention: the ability to keep concentrating over time). It made little to no difference to overall daily functioning (a person’s ability to carry out everyday activities), mood, or quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day); some measures were slightly worse several months later. For care partners (family members or friends who support the person), results for quality of life and emotional well-being were mixed.\n- Most evidence came from 1 large trial plus smaller trials. We need more large, high-quality trials to test how long benefits last, which parts of the intervention (treatment, procedure, or action) work best, and to record any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat is dementia and why can it make daily life difficult?\nDementia (a condition that reduces ability to think, remember, and solve problems and usually gets worse over time) can make simple tasks hard. In mild to moderate stages, people may still do many activities but may forget appointments, mismanage medicines, struggle with money, cooking, or getting around. These changes can reduce independence and cause stress for family and friends who help.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation?\nCognitive rehabilitation (a personalised, goal-focused therapy that teaches practical steps, routines, and aids, and adapts the setting to make tasks easier) targets real-life goals chosen by the person. A trained practitioner (health professional who delivers the therapy) and often a care partner (family member or friend who supports the person) work together to set goals and practise strategies. This approach differs from general brain training because it focuses on specific daily tasks.\n\nWhat did the review want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia reach their own daily goals and maintain or improve everyday functioning (outcomes: the measured results of the study). We also looked at memory, attention, mood, confidence, and quality of life. We checked effects for care partners and explored factors that might change how well the intervention works.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched multiple research databases (collections of organised research information) for trials that compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care (the normal care people get) or another inactive control (a comparison group that receives no extra treatment beyond usual care). We combined results where possible, used standard methods to pool data, and rated how certain the evidence is.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs: studies where participants are assigned by chance) with 1,702 people, mostly with Alzheimer’s disease (the most common cause of dementia). Average ages were 76–80 years.\n- Cognitive rehabilitation produced large, consistent improvements in goal attainment (how much people achieved their chosen goals) at the end of treatment and several months later.\n- At the end of treatment, it slightly improved self-efficacy and immediate recall. Several months later it probably slightly improved focus and sustained attention. It made little to no difference to overall daily functioning or quality of life; some memory tests and anxiety measures were slightly worse later.\n- For care partners, some environmental or social parts of quality of life changed slightly, while mood and emotional well-being results were mixed.\n- Trials did not report unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nHow sure are we?\nWe are reasonably confident that cognitive rehabilitation improves person-specific goals. Much of the evidence came from 1 large, well-run trial, which strengthens certainty. However, participants and staff may have known which treatment was given (risk of bias: chance that flaws in study design or conduct could skew results). Not all outcomes had enough data, and some results relied on a small number of studies.\n\nWhat does this mean for people?\n- Cognitive rehabilitation can help people with mild to moderate dementia reach the real-life goals they choose. It may also help confidence and some thinking skills.\n- It is less clear whether it improves overall day-to-day independence, mood, or overall enjoyment of life (quality of life).\n- We need more large, high-quality trials to learn how long benefits last, which parts of the intervention work best, and whether there are any harms or costs.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022."
