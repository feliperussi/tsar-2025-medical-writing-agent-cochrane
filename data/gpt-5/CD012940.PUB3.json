    "output": "In babies born early, is putting leftover stomach milk back better than throwing it away to help them grow?\n\nKey messages\n- We found 1 small randomized trial of 72 preterm infants (preterm infant — a baby born before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy). We did not find clear evidence that re-feeding gastric residuals (re-feeding — putting the stomach contents withdrawn through a feeding tube back into the baby’s stomach instead of throwing them away; gastric residuals — the milk and digestive fluids left in the stomach from the last feeding that can be drawn out through a feeding tube before the next feed) is better or worse than discarding them.\n- The evidence is low certainty (GRADE approach — a system to rate how confident we are in study findings). Re-feeding may make little or no difference to necrotising enterocolitis (NEC — a serious intestinal disease in premature babies where part of the bowel becomes inflamed and can die), spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP — a sudden hole in the intestine not caused by NEC), perforation (perforation — hole), death before discharge (all-cause mortality — deaths from any cause), time to reach full enteral feeds (enteral feeding — giving nutrition directly into the stomach or intestines by tube; full feeds defined as ≥120 mL/kg/day), or need for total parenteral nutrition (TPN/total parenteral nutrition — complete nutrition given directly into the bloodstream through a vein). The trial did not report some harms such as vomiting (forceful ejection of stomach contents) or sepsis (sepsis — an extreme immune response to infection that can lead to organ failure).\n\nWhy do we check stomach contents during tube feeding?\n- We care for preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs — hospital units for sick or premature newborns). These babies often need tube feeding (tube feeding — giving nutrition through a small tube into the stomach or intestine). Staff monitor (monitoring — keeping track of) gastric (gastric — having to do with the stomach) residuals to decide when to start feeds, how fast to increase feeds, and whether the baby tolerates feeds.\n\nWhat does re-feeding or discarding mean and why might it matter?\n- After staff aspirate (aspirated — remove by suction) gastric residuals, they may re-feed them or discard them. Re-feeding returns milk and digestive juices that contain trophic substances (trophic substances — natural nutrients and growth-promoting chemicals in milk and digestive juices). These may help gastrointestinal (gastrointestinal — having to do with the GI tract) motility (motility — the ability to move) and digestion (digestion — the process of breaking down food).\n- If residuals look abnormal (abnormal — not normal), for example green or bloody, re-feeding might cause vomiting or signal risk (risk — chance) of NEC or sepsis. This choice could also affect time to full feeds, days on TPN, and growth to discharge (discharge — release from care). Poor growth after birth is called extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR — poor growth after birth).\n\nWhat did we want to find out and how did we search?\n- We wanted to assess (assess — learn about or measure) whether re-feeding is safe and helps growth and feeding. We looked for randomized controlled trials (randomized controlled trial/RCT — a study that assigns participants randomly to treatment groups) and quasi-RCTs (quasi-randomized controlled trial — assignment that is not truly random). We searched databases including Cochrane CENTRAL (Cochrane CENTRAL — a database of controlled clinical trials), CRS (CRS — Cochrane Register of Studies), Ovid MEDLINE (Ovid MEDLINE — an online MEDLINE database), Embase (Embase — a biomedical database), and CINAHL (CINAHL — a nursing and allied health database). We collected data (data — information from the studies) and did analysis (analysis — breaking things into parts).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 1 randomized trial of 72 babies. The trial was not masked and did not report location or funding. The mean (mean — the average) results showed no clear differences for growth or key safety outcomes. We judged the evidence as low certainty. People in the trial may have known who got re-feeding, which can cause bias (bias — flaws that favor one conclusion). The trial was small.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\n- The evidence is limited by small size and possible bias. The study did not report some outcomes such as vomiting or bloodstream infection. We cannot be sure about long-term effects or costs.\n\nWhat should happen next?\n- We need larger, well-designed trials. They should measure NEC (using Bell staging — a scale where stage ≥2 means definite NEC), SIP and other perforations, infections including sepsis, time to full enteral feeds, days on TPN, growth to discharge, vomiting, costs, and longer-term development.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\n- The evidence is current to February 2022."
