    "output": "Title: Does audit and feedback (measuring a health professional’s performance and giving them a report) improve how they deliver care, and what makes it work best?\n\nKey messages:\n- Audit and feedback (A&F) (a quality improvement approach where clinicians’ performance is measured and then shared back with them to show gaps and encourage better practice) probably causes a small improvement in how often clinicians follow recommendations. Many studies added other supports at the same time (co-interventions; other interventions given alongside A&F, such as education or reminders), so the effect of A&F alone is unclear.\n- A&F works better when there is more room for improvement at the start (baseline performance; the level of practice measured before any change), when feedback is about an individual clinician rather than only team-level data (summaries for a whole group that can hide individual differences), when performance is compared with top peers or a benchmark (a clear reference level of performance), when a local champion (a respected colleague who advocates for change) helps deliver it, when formats are interactive or multi-modal (for example, written reports plus meetings), and when recipients get facilitation (practical help to interpret feedback and make changes) and a specific action plan (clear steps, responsibilities, and timelines).\n- We need more head-to-head trials (direct comparisons of different A&F designs), studies that separate A&F from co-interventions, longer follow-up and patient outcomes, and better reporting of harms (for example, stress, gaming—changing behaviour mainly to look better on the report rather than truly improve care—or extra workload) and costs. We also need studies in more low- and middle-income countries (LMICs; countries with lower or middle national income).\n\nIntroduction / Aims\n\nWhy is improving everyday healthcare practice important?\nWe want care to match guidelines and best practice. When routine practice drifts, patients may miss helpful treatments, get unnecessary tests or medicines, or face delays. Improving routine care can reduce harm, improve outcomes, and save resources.\n\nWhat is audit and feedback in healthcare?\nAudit and feedback (A&F) means measuring what clinicians do over time (audit; the systematic measurement of clinical performance) and giving them a report (feedback) that shows how they compare with a target or goal. A benchmark is a clear target or standard used for comparison. Feedback can be written, verbal, or interactive.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether A&F helps clinicians change practice and which design features make it work best. We also looked at whether adding other supports (co-interventions) changed the results.\n\nMethods\nWe searched several databases to June 2020 and updated in 2022 for trials that tested A&F with clinicians. We combined results from randomized studies (randomized trial; participants are assigned by chance to different groups) and used extra analyses to explore which features were linked to larger improvements. We rated how certain the evidence is.\n\nResults\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 292 randomized studies. Most recipients were physicians (81%). Twenty-six studies (9%) were in LMICs. The most common targets were prescribing (ordering medicines) and test-ordering (requesting diagnostic tests). Many study arms added clinician education (56%) or reminders (15%) to A&F.\n\nOverall effect\nA&F probably produces a small improvement in how often clinicians follow recommended practices. Similar small improvements occurred for prescribing and test-ordering. Effects were larger when there was more room for improvement at baseline and when A&F was combined with other supports (co-interventions).\n\nWhich features helped most?\n- Feedback about an individual clinician rather than only team-level data (team-level data: summaries for a whole group).\n- Comparing performance with top peers or a benchmark (benchmark: a reference level of performance).\n- Involving a local champion (a respected colleague who advocates and supports change).\n- Using interactive or multi-modal formats (for example, written reports plus face-to-face discussion).\n- Offering facilitation (practical help to interpret feedback and take action).\n- Including a specific action plan (clear steps and responsibilities to improve).\n\nWhich features did not clearly help more?\n- Comparing someone to the average of all peers showed no clear extra benefit.\n- Adding many performance indicators (performance indicator: a measurable metric of care) did not clearly help.\n- Co-developing action plans did not always add benefit.\n- Repeating feedback did not always increase effect.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Many studies could not hide which group clinicians were in. Studies varied in design, settings, and measures. Not all studies reported unwanted effects (possible harms such as stress, gaming, or extra workload) or costs. Few studies measured long-term effects or patient health outcomes.\n\nWhat this means for practice and research\nA&F can help improve care, often by a small amount. It seems most useful when feedback is specific, compared to a high standard, supported by a local champion, and linked to practical help and clear action steps. Future research should run head-to-head trials of different A&F designs, separate A&F from co-interventions, measure longer-term and patient outcomes, report harms and costs, and include more LMIC settings.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to June 2020 (search)."
