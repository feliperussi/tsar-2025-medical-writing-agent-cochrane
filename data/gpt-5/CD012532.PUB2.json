    "output": "Do PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking drugs (medicines that help the immune system attack cancer) help adults with glioma (a type of brain tumor)?\n\nKey messages\n- Based on 7 randomized trials with 1,953 adults (mostly glioblastoma, a fast-growing type of central nervous system tumor that forms from glial [supportive] brain tissue and is also called GBM), PD-1 blockers (drugs that block PD-1, a protein on immune cells that acts like a brake and slows immune attack) did not show clear benefit for most people with glioma (a group of tumors that form in glial cells). We found no trials of PD-L1 blockers (drugs that block PD-L1, a protein on some cancer and immune cells that binds PD-1 to turn down immune activity).\n- Adding a PD-1 blocker such as nivolumab (Opdivo) or pembrolizumab (Keytruda) to standard treatment for newly diagnosed GBM (radiotherapy: high-energy rays to kill cancer cells; and temozolomide: a chemotherapy tablet) did not improve overall survival (OS: how long people live) or progression-free survival (PFS: time the disease does not get worse). In one group, adding nivolumab probably increased serious adverse events (SAE: events that can lead to hospital care, lasting harm, or death). In recurrent disease (cancer that has come back), PD-1 blockers alone or with bevacizumab (a drug that blocks blood vessel growth to tumors) showed no clear benefit.\n- One very small trial gave pembrolizumab before surgery (neoadjuvant: treatment given before the main treatment) and after surgery (adjuvant: treatment given after the main treatment). That trial suggested a possible survival benefit and longer time before progression, but the result is uncertain because the trial was very small. Across trials, quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day) data were limited.\n\nWhat is glioblastoma and why is it serious?\n- Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive adult diffuse glioma (a tumor that grows into surrounding brain tissue and is hard to remove). It grows fast and often comes back. Median survival is about 16 months after diagnosis.\n- Standard care usually includes surgery to remove as much tumor as possible (resection: surgery to remove tissue), followed by radiotherapy (high-energy rays) plus temozolomide (a chemotherapy drug). Some people receive bevacizumab to help with symptoms by blocking blood vessel growth that tumors need.\n\nWhat are anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 treatments?\n- These are immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs: medicines that remove brakes on the immune system). PD-1 is a protein on T cells (a type of immune cell) that slows immune activity when it binds PD-L1. PD-L1 is a matching protein on some cancer or other cells that turns down T cell activity. Antibodies (targeted proteins made to block specific molecules) that block PD-1 or PD-L1 release this brake so T cells can attack cancer better. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are anti-PD-1 antibodies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We looked for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to treatments to allow fair comparison) of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 drugs for adults with diffuse glioma/GBM. We wanted reliable data on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response (percent whose tumor shrinks), quality of life, and side effects (adverse events).\n\nWhat did we do?\n- We searched for randomized trials comparing these drugs, alone or with radiotherapy, temozolomide, or bevacizumab, versus placebo (a dummy treatment that looks the same but has no medicine) or usual care. We summarized trial results and rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 7 randomized trials with 1,953 adults. Trial sizes ranged from 35 to 716 people. Four trials enrolled people with recurrent disease and 3 enrolled newly diagnosed disease; 1 trial focused on older adults. All trials tested PD-1 blockers (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). No PD-L1 trials were found.\n- Overall, PD-1 blockers did not improve survival. In recurrent GBM, nivolumab probably made little or no difference to survival compared with bevacizumab and probably gave shorter PFS and fewer tumor responses (overall response rate). Adding bevacizumab to pembrolizumab or using different bevacizumab doses with nivolumab gave very uncertain results. Giving pembrolizumab before and after surgery showed possible benefit in one very small trial but the result is very uncertain. In newly diagnosed GBM without MGMT promoter methylation (where the MGMT gene promoter is active and often makes tumors less responsive to temozolomide), nivolumab plus radiotherapy probably made little or no difference versus temozolomide plus radiotherapy. In tumors with MGMT promoter methylation (where the MGMT promoter is switched off and tumors often respond better to temozolomide), adding nivolumab to temozolomide and radiotherapy probably made little or no difference to survival or PFS and probably increased SAEs. In older adults, adding nivolumab to temozolomide probably made little or no difference. Less serious side effects were generally similar between groups. Quality of life data were often missing or unclear.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\n- We have low confidence in the evidence. Many trials had potential bias (flaws in study design, conduct, or analysis that can favor one result). Some trials did not report all outcomes we wanted. The trials varied in who they included and how they gave treatments, which makes combining results hard.\n\nWhen is the evidence current?\n- The search is up to date to March 2024.\n\nWhat should happen next?\n- We need more large, well-run randomized trials. Trials should test PD-L1 drugs, study clearly defined groups (for example, newly diagnosed vs recurrent, and by MGMT promoter methylation status: “methylated” or “unmethylated”), and report outcomes that matter to patients: survival, time without worsening, quality of life, and short- and long-term side effects."
