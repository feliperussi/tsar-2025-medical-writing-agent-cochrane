    "output": "Do personal stress-reduction programs help healthcare workers feel less stressed at work?\n\nKey messages\n- Personal stress-reduction programs for healthcare workers may reduce how stressed people feel at work, based on self-reported questionnaires (forms where participants rate their own stress). Benefits appeared in the short term (up to 3 months after the program) and sometimes up to about 1 year. The studies were not strong enough to be sure how large or long-lasting the effects are. Unwanted or harmful effects were not reported.\n- Different program types may help. Programs that focus on the experience of stress (how a person feels or notices stress) and programs that focus attention away from stress (for example, relaxation or physical activity) both may reduce stress. Combining approaches may help short term. Programs that try to change work-related habits at the individual level (for example, time-management or coping skills) have very uncertain results. Few studies compared program types directly, so we do not know if one type works better than another.\n\nWhat is work-related stress in healthcare and why does it matter?\nHealthcare work can be demanding, fast, and emotionally hard. When job demands outweigh a person’s skills, time, or support, they can get work-related stress (the body’s response to physical, mental, or emotional pressure). Over time, stress can lead to burnout (a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by long-term work stress) and to mental health problems such as anxiety or low mood. Stress can also cause psychosomatic symptoms (physical problems that are caused or made worse by stress, such as headaches or stomach upset). High stress can affect patient care, raise sick leave, and cause staff to leave.\n\nWhat are individual-level ways to reduce stress for healthcare workers?\nWe mean actions aimed at the person rather than changing the workplace (individual-level interventions: stress-reduction strategies aimed at the worker, such as mindfulness, cognitive-behavioural techniques, relaxation, or exercise). Examples include:\n- Focusing on the experience of stress (helping people notice and manage thoughts and feelings). This can include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; a talking therapy that helps people notice and change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours) and mindfulness or meditation (paying attention to the present moment without judging it).\n- Focusing attention away from stress (helping the body and mind unwind), such as relaxation training (slow breathing or progressive muscle relaxation), guided imagery, or physical activity.\n- Changing work-related habits at the individual level (for example, time-management or coping-skills training to handle demands better).\n- Combining two or more of the above.\nOrganisational-level interventions (changes at the workplace, such as staffing or scheduling) are important but are covered in a separate review.\n\nWhat did this review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether stress-reduction strategies aimed at individual healthcare workers reduce stress symptoms (including parts of burnout). We compared these strategies with no intervention, wait list (a group that waits to receive the intervention until after the study), placebo (an inactive intervention used to compare effects), or a different stress-reduction approach. We also wanted to know which types work best and how long any benefits last: short term (up to 3 months), medium term (>3 to 12 months), and long term (>12 months). We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs; studies that assign people by chance to 2 or more groups to compare treatments).\n\nMethods\nWe searched several databases up to February 2022 for RCTs in healthcare workers that compared individual-level stress-reduction strategies with no intervention, wait list, placebo, or other strategies, and that measured stress or burnout using outcome measures (the way a study endpoint is measured). We grouped interventions by approach and by follow-up (the period after an intervention when researchers check participants) and combined results where possible. We rated our confidence in the findings based on study methods, sample size (the number of people in a study), and risk of bias (the chance that flaws in study design or conduct could skew results).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 117 RCTs with 11,119 healthcare workers. Most trials compared an intervention with no intervention, wait list, placebo, or usual care. Few trials compared different intervention types directly. Stress was usually measured with self-reported questionnaires such as the Maslach Burnout Inventory (a questionnaire that measures job burnout). Most data were short term or medium term. Very little long-term data were available.\n\nOverall, interventions that focus on the experience of stress and those that focus attention away from stress may reduce stress symptoms soon after the intervention and may still help for some months. Combining approaches may also reduce stress short term and may help for some months. Evidence for interventions that try to change work-related habits at the individual level is very uncertain. Few direct comparisons mean we cannot say one approach is better than another. We rated the certainty of the evidence as low (certainty of the evidence means how confident we are that the results reflect the true effect; low certainty means the true effect may be quite different), mainly because many studies were small, participants could not be blinded (participants knew which treatment they got), and long-term outcomes were rarely reported. We used study data (information collected from people in the studies) to draw these conclusions.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. People in the studies often knew which treatment they received (no blinding). Many studies were small. Not all studies reported everything we wanted. These issues increase risk of bias (flaws that could skew results) and limit how sure we can be about the findings.\n\nWhat should future research do?\nWe suggest larger, better-designed trials with longer follow-up, direct comparisons between program types, and studies of programs that target work-related factors. Trials should also report any unwanted effects and costs, and use clear outcome measures so we can compare studies.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to February 2022."
