    "output": "Title: What are the benefits and harms of fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR; a less invasive repair using a customized stent-graft—a fabric tube with a metal frame—made with small openings called fenestrations or scallops so blood can keep flowing to nearby branch arteries) compared with open surgery or no surgery (watchful waiting; conservative non-operative management where doctors monitor with scans and medicines) for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (complex AAAs; balloon-like bulges in the main belly artery near the kidneys that involve nearby branch arteries)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found no randomized or quasi-randomized trials (randomized controlled trials assign people by chance; quasi-randomized use non-random methods) that compared FEVAR with open surgical repair (OSR; a traditional operation through a large incision to replace the damaged artery segment) or with watchful waiting for adults needing first-time (primary) repair.\n- Because no eligible trials were found, we have no data on key outcomes. These include deaths at 30 days or 1 year (all-cause mortality; deaths from any cause), deaths caused by the aneurysm or its treatment (aneurysm-related mortality), kidney problems (renal dysfunction; reduced kidney function), need for more procedures (reintervention rate), whether arteries to organs stay open (visceral vessel patency; condition of being open), length of hospital stay (the number of days a patient remains in hospital), unwanted events that cause harm (adverse events), or patient-reported quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day).\n\nIntroduction / Aims\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and why is it a concern?\n- The aorta (the largest artery that carries blood from the heart) runs through the belly. An AAA (a balloon-like bulge in the aorta in the abdomen) is a weak spot in the artery wall. If it grows and bursts, it can cause life-threatening bleeding.\n- Some AAAs are infrarenal (located below the kidney arteries). Complex AAAs (those close to or involving arteries that feed the kidneys and other organs) make repair harder. Surgeons must also protect blood flow to those organs.\n\nHow can complex AAAs be treated, and what is fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR)?\n- Doctors can do open surgical repair (OSR; a major operation through a large incision to sew in a graft or replace the weak segment). A graft here means tissue or a synthetic tube used to replace the diseased artery.\n- Doctors can also do endovascular repair. This is less invasive and uses a stent-graft (a fabric tube supported by a metal frame placed inside the artery through blood vessels).\n- For complex AAAs near branch arteries, clinicians can use FEVAR. FEVAR uses a custom stent-graft with fenestrations or scallops (small openings or notches) that line up with visceral arteries (the arteries that supply organs such as the kidneys and intestines). This keeps those arteries open while the aneurysm is sealed.\n- Some people have conservative (non-operative) management or watchful waiting. This means careful monitoring with scans and medicines instead of immediate surgery.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We planned to compare benefits and harms of FEVAR versus OSR and versus watchful waiting for adults needing primary repair. We wanted short-term and 1-year survival, aneurysm-related deaths, renal function, need for further procedures, visceral vessel patency, length of hospital stay, adverse events, and patient-reported quality of life.\n\nMethods\n- We searched for trials that compared FEVAR with OSR or with watchful waiting and that reported the outcomes above. We planned to combine results and rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults — What did we find?\n- We found no randomized or quasi-randomized trials comparing FEVAR with OSR or with no operation for adults having primary repair of complex AAAs.\n- Because there were no eligible trials, we included no studies and no participants. We therefore have no data for any planned outcome.\n- We do not know whether FEVAR changes the risk of dying at 30 days or 1 year, aneurysm-related deaths, time in hospital, renal dysfunction, need for more procedures, visceral vessel patency, quality of life, or other adverse events.\n\nLimitations\n- We lack confidence in the evidence because no trials were available. The evidence does not cover the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we wanted to assess.\n\nWhat this means for patients and clinicians\n- We cannot say whether FEVAR is better or worse than open surgery or watchful waiting for complex AAAs.\n- High-quality randomized trials (people assigned by chance) that are large enough and include longer follow-up are needed. Trials should measure outcomes that matter to patients and clinicians: survival, renal function, need for further procedures, visceral vessel patency, patient-reported quality of life, adverse events, and length of hospital stay.\n- Research is challenging because complex AAAs are uncommon and show aneurysm heterogeneity (differences in size, location, shape, and patient factors), which makes them hard to study as one uniform group.\n\nCurrency\n- The search is up to date to March 2023."
