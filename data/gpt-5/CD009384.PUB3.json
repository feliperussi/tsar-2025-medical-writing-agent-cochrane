    "output": "Does giving zinc supplements (zinc as a pill or syrup) to children aged 6 months to 12 years help prevent illness and death and improve growth?\n\nKey messages\n- We probably prevent some diarrhea episodes and we slightly improve height when we give regular zinc supplements to children aged 6 months to 12 years. Diarrhea means frequent loose or watery bowel movements.\n- Zinc supplements make little to no difference to deaths from any cause (all-cause mortality, which means deaths from any reason). The effect on deaths from chest infections (lower respiratory tract infections, infections of the lungs and lower airways such as pneumonia) or from malaria (a serious disease spread by mosquitoes) is uncertain.\n- More children who took zinc had vomiting (being sick). Most studies were in low- and middle-income countries (countries with lower average incomes and fewer resources). Giving zinc together with iron (co-supplementation, meaning taking two supplements at the same time) may reduce some benefits.\n\nWhat is zinc deficiency and why does it matter for children?\nZinc is a mineral the body needs for a strong immune system, healthy growth, and healing. When children do not get enough zinc, they get more infections such as diarrhea and pneumonia, and they may not grow in height as expected (linear growth failure or stunting, meaning being too short for age). Zinc deficiency is common in low- and middle-income countries (countries with lower average incomes and fewer resources). These infections cause much illness (morbidity, meaning being unwell) and many deaths (mortality, meaning the number of deaths).\n\nWhat is preventive zinc supplementation?\nPreventive zinc supplementation means giving children small, regular doses of zinc (for example, as syrup or tablets) to stop deficiency before it causes problems. This is different from therapeutic zinc, which treats a specific illness. We did not look at adding zinc to food (food fortification) or short-term mixes like sprinkles.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether preventive zinc given to children aged 6 months to 12 years reduces deaths from any cause and from specific illnesses, lowers how often and how long children are ill, helps growth in height and weight, changes nutrient blood levels (serum levels, the clear liquid part of the blood), or causes unwanted effects (adverse events, meaning harmful or unwanted events).\n\nHow did we do the review?\n- We searched databases and a trials register (a public database where researchers record study details) up to February 2022.\n- We included 96 randomized controlled trials (RCTs; studies where people are randomly assigned to a treatment or to a comparison) with 219,584 children aged 6 months to 12 years. Most children were under 5 years old.\n- The trials took place in 34 countries, mostly low- and middle-income countries.\n- Zinc was usually zinc sulfate (a common form of zinc used in syrups) at doses of 10 to 15 mg daily. The median follow-up (the middle length of time participants were checked) was about 26 weeks.\n- We compared zinc with no supplement, a placebo (a dummy treatment that looks like the real one), or a waiting list control (a group scheduled to get the intervention later).\n- We pooled results to assess deaths (all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality, meaning deaths counted for a particular cause), illness episodes, growth, blood nutrient levels, and side effects. We used GRADE (a system to rate how trustworthy the evidence is) to judge how sure we are.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- Deaths: Zinc supplements made little to no difference to deaths from any cause. The effect on deaths from diarrhea and from chest infections or malaria is uncertain because the results were not precise.\n- Diarrhea: Zinc probably slightly reduced the number of diarrhea episodes.\n- Chest infections: Zinc probably made little to no difference to illness from chest infections (lower respiratory tract infections).\n- Growth: Zinc probably increased height slightly.\n- Side effects: Vomiting (being sick) happened more often in children who took zinc.\n- Co-supplementation: Giving zinc together with iron may reduce some of zincâ€™s benefits.\n\nHow sure are we?\nWe are moderately confident in some findings but less sure about others. This rating reflects how trustworthy the evidence and results seem after using GRADE (the rating system). Some outcomes had few cases or imprecise results. We need more well-designed studies to be certain.\n\nWhat is the take-home for programs and families?\n- Preventive zinc may help reduce diarrhea episodes and help height a little in young children, especially where zinc deficiency is common.\n- Zinc does not seem to lower overall death rates, and its effect on death from specific infections is unclear.\n- Vomiting is a possible side effect.\n- More research is needed on long-term effects, different doses and forms, effects in school-aged children, and what happens when zinc is given with iron.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nThis review updates a previous version and includes evidence up to February 2022."
