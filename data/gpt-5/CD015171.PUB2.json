    "output": "Do medicines taken by mouth help prevent vertigo attacks in Ménière’s disease (a disorder of the inner ear that causes repeated spinning attacks [vertigo — a false sensation that you or your surroundings are spinning], fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear [tinnitus — hearing noises with no outside sound], and a feeling of fullness) compared with no treatment or a dummy pill (placebo — a ‘dummy’ treatment that looks like the medicine but has no active drug), and are they safe?\n\nKey messages\n- We do not know if systemic medicines (drugs that affect the whole body) taken by mouth prevent vertigo in adults with Ménière’s disease. The evidence is low or very low certainty (how confident we are about study results). Serious unwanted effects (major side effects that may need hospital care or cause lasting harm) were rarely reported, so safety is also uncertain.\n- Studies were few, small, and tested different medicines: betahistine (an oral medicine used to try to reduce vertigo attacks), diuretics or “water pills” (drugs that help the body remove extra salt and water; studied examples include isosorbide — an oral osmotic diuretic used to draw excess fluid, and amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide — a combination that removes salt and water), antivirals (drugs for viral infections), and corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory medicines). No trials tested antihistamines (medicines often used for allergies and sometimes to ease nausea and dizziness).\n- Future trials should be larger, well designed, run for longer follow-up (the period after starting treatment when people are monitored), and use a core outcome set (an agreed minimum list of outcomes all trials should measure).\n\nIntroduction / Aims\nWhat is Ménière’s disease and why does it matter?\nMénière’s disease causes repeating, unpredictable attacks of severe vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. These attacks can be frightening and limit daily activities, work, and safety.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether systemic medicines given to adults with Ménière’s disease, compared with placebo or no treatment, reduce how often or how severe vertigo attacks are. We also wanted to know if these medicines help hearing, tinnitus, or quality of life (how someone feels and functions day to day). We looked for unwanted effects, including serious adverse events (major side effects that can cause death, need hospitalisation, or cause lasting disability). We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs — studies where people are randomly assigned to treatment or control) or quasi-randomised trials (studies where allocation was not truly random) with at least 3 months of follow-up.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for trials in adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease that compared systemic medicines taken by mouth with placebo or no treatment for at least 3 months. We combined results when possible and rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nResults: What did we find?\nWe found 10 trials with 848 adults. All trials were randomized or quasi-randomised. Follow-up times included about 3 to <6 months, 6 to 12 months, and beyond 12 months.\n- Betahistine: 7 trials, 548 people. We are uncertain whether betahistine improves vertigo or changes the risk of serious unwanted effects. Only one betahistine trial reported serious unwanted effects.\n- Diuretics: 2 trials (isosorbide, 220 people; amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, 80 people). We are uncertain whether these diuretics help vertigo. These trials did not assess serious unwanted effects.\n- Antivirals: 1 small trial, 24 people. We are uncertain whether antivirals help vertigo.\n- Corticosteroids taken by mouth: 1 small trial, 16 people. We are uncertain whether oral corticosteroids help vertigo.\n- Antihistamines: we found no trials.\nTrials used different methods to measure vertigo. Many did not report effects on hearing, tinnitus, or quality of life. Serious unwanted effects were rarely reported.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is low or very low certainty. Trials were few and small. They measured outcomes in different ways and at different times. People or researchers may have known which treatment was given, which can bias results. Not all outcomes we wanted were reported.\n\nWhat this means for patients and clinicians\nWe cannot say that any systemic medicine taken by mouth definitely prevents vertigo in Ménière’s disease. Clinicians and patients should weigh the uncertain possible benefits against the uncertain possible harms when deciding on these medicines. Better, larger RCTs with longer follow-up and agreed outcomes are needed.\n\nCurrency\nSearches are up to date to September 2022."
