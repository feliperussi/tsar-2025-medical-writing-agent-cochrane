    "output": "Title\nDo education and support programs help adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (a condition in which the kidneys become damaged slowly over time and cannot remove waste and extra water from the blood) and diabetes (a disease in which the body does not control blood sugar) manage their health better than routine care (the usual care people receive without extra education)?\n\nKey messages\n- Compared with routine care, education and support programmes led by health professionals probably lower average blood sugar (HbA1c, a blood test that shows average blood sugar over 2 to 3 months) by about 0.4 percentage points and may lower LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, often called “bad” cholesterol because it can build up in arteries). The evidence on kidney function (eGFR, a calculation that estimates how well the kidneys filter waste), serious low blood sugar (serious hypoglycaemia, very low blood sugar that needs help from another person), and death is unclear because studies were few and small and adverse events (unwanted harmful effects) were rarely reported.\n- Some programmes improved diabetes knowledge and self-efficacy (confidence in one’s ability to manage health tasks) and short-term self-care, such as following a diet (the things a person eats and drinks) and home blood glucose monitoring (checking blood sugar at home). Benefits were more evident in people on dialysis (treatment that filters the blood when the kidneys do not work well) or with moderately increased albuminuria (A2, a moderate amount of the protein albumin in the urine that may signal early kidney damage). These gains were not consistent across studies or over time.\n- We need more large, well-designed trials that compare different education approaches, follow people longer, and report outcomes that matter to patients (patient-oriented measures such as quality of life, meaning how someone feels and functions day to day), hospital use, survival, kidney measures (eGFR and creatinine, a waste product used to assess kidney function), and serious low or high blood sugar (hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia).\n\nWhat are chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and why do they matter together?\n- CKD means the kidneys are damaged and cannot filter blood well. The kidneys remove waste and extra water and help keep body chemicals balanced.\n- Diabetes means blood sugar is too high over time. Diabetes is a leading cause of CKD.\n- Having both raises the chance of heart problems (cardiovascular disease, disease of the heart and blood vessels) and makes care more complex. Care may include medicines (for example, insulin, a hormone that helps the body use glucose), diet changes, regular blood and urine tests, and sometimes dialysis. Many people find it hard to follow all parts of care.\n\nWhat are education programmes, and how might they help?\n- Education programmes are structured sessions that give information, coaching, and practical skills to help people manage their health.\n- Health professionals such as nurses (health professionals trained to care for people who are ill) and pharmacists (health professionals who prepare and give medicines) deliver these programmes. They use talks, written materials, videos, phone calls, or computer tools.\n- Programmes aim to improve knowledge, self-efficacy, medication use, diet, and home blood glucose monitoring.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We asked whether education programmes help adults with CKD and diabetes more than routine care. We looked for benefits and harms on outcomes such as HbA1c, cholesterol, blood pressure (the force of blood on blood vessel walls), eGFR and albuminuria (protein in the urine), self-efficacy, self-care, serious hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar), starting dialysis or kidney failure, death, and adverse events.\n\nMethods\n- We searched for randomized and quasi-randomized trials (studies that assign people to groups by chance or by a method that is not truly random) that compared education programmes with routine care in adults with CKD and diabetes. We combined results when appropriate and rated how confident we are in the evidence using GRADE (a system that shows how certain we are about study findings).\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We found 8 randomized or quasi-randomized studies (13 reports) with 840 adults. Participants included people on dialysis, people with moderately increased albuminuria (A2), and people with advanced diabetic kidney disease.\n- Programs were run by health professionals and used spoken, written, audio, or computer materials. Most studies compared programmes with routine care. One study tested education plus coordinated care (a team-based approach where providers share information and plan together).\n\nMain results\n- Education programmes probably lower HbA1c slightly after about 1 year (by about 0.4 percentage points).\n- Education may slightly lower total and LDL cholesterol at about 18 months.\n- Education may improve diabetes knowledge, some self-efficacy, and short-term self-care. For example, single studies showed improved knowledge in people on dialysis and improved confidence for home blood glucose monitoring in people with A2 albuminuria. One study found better self-care at the end of treatment, but not at 3 months later.\n- We are uncertain about effects on death, serious hypoglycaemia, kidney failure, or overall kidney function because the evidence was limited or not reported.\n- When education was added to coordinated team care for advanced disease, it may have made little or no difference for several clinical outcomes, but key outcomes such as survival, quality of life, and side effects were not reported.\n\nLimitations\n- The studies were few and small. People may have known which group they were in. Many patient-important outcomes were not reported. Studies varied in who took part and how programmes were delivered.\n\nCurrency\n- This review updates our earlier review and includes evidence up to July 2024."
