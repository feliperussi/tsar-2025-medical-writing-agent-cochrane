    "output": "Title: Does letting babies born early smell or taste breast milk or formula during feeding through a tube help them start full feeding by mouth sooner?\n\nKey messages\n- We found no clear evidence that letting preterm babies smell or taste breast milk or formula during tube feeding helps them reach full sucking feeds sooner. (Preterm = born before 37 weeks; full sucking feeds = taking all feeds by mouth at the breast or bottle.)\n- We found no clear signs of harm. Two studies reported no adverse effects (adverse effects = harmful or unwanted effects). There was no clear difference in necrotising enterocolitis (NEC = serious inflammation and damage in a newbornâ€™s intestine) or late infection (infection = germs causing illness; late infection = starts days after birth). Studies did not report feeding intolerance (trouble handling feeds, e.g., vomiting or a swollen belly).\n- The trials were small, used different methods, and often lacked blinding (masking = keeping staff or assessors unaware of which group babies were in). This raises risk of bias (flaws that can favour one result). We need larger, better trials.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n- We asked if smelling or tasting milk during tube feeding helps preterm babies move to full sucking feeds sooner. (Tube feeding / gavage feeding = milk given through a thin tube passed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. Nasogastric tube = tube through the nose into the stomach. Orogastric tube = tube through the mouth into the stomach.)\n- We also looked at time to full enteral feeds (all nutrition given through the stomach or intestines, by mouth or tube), days on parenteral nutrition (parenteral nutrition = nutrition given into a vein, bypassing the gut), and safety outcomes like NEC and late infection.\n\nWhat did we do?\n- We searched multiple databases and trial registers up to 26 April 2023. (Clinical trial = research that tests treatments in people; CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase are examples of databases we searched.)\n- We included 8 randomized or quasi-randomized studies (randomized = participants assigned by chance; quasi-randomized = assignment not truly by chance) that enrolled 1,277 preterm babies. Seven studies (1,244 babies) gave data we could combine. Trials used different inclusion criteria (rules for who could join) and different ways to give smell or taste.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- Smell or taste given before or during tube feeds may make little or no difference to time to full sucking feeds. We are very uncertain. (Outcome = the specific result we measured.)\n- It may make little or no difference to days on parenteral nutrition or to time to full enteral feeds. We are very uncertain about time to full enteral feeds.\n- It may make little or no difference to NEC. It probably makes little or no difference to late infections.\n- Two studies reported no adverse effects. No study reported feeding intolerance data.\n\nHow confident are we and what are the limits?\n- We have low confidence in the evidence. Many trials were small. Trials differed in methods and in which babies they included. Staff and outcome assessors (the people who measure results) were often not blinded, which increases risk of bias. Some trials were not truly randomized. Not all planned outcomes were reported. These limits mean real benefits or harms could be missed.\n\nWhat do we recommend?\n- We need larger, well-designed trials. Trials should test babies born at different gestational ages (gestational age = weeks a baby spent developing before birth). They should compare different ways, timing, and frequency of offering smell or taste. Trials should measure feeding skill (ability to suck, swallow, and breathe together), safety (including feeding intolerance, infection, and bowel health), growth (weight and length), and length of hospital stay.\n- Future trials should use random assignment and proper blinding where possible to reduce bias. They should report all key outcomes so we can judge true effects.\n\nCurrency\n- The evidence is up to date to 26 April 2023. (Cochrane review = a high-quality systematic summary of research.)"
