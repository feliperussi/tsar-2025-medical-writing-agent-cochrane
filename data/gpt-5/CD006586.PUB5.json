    "output": "Title\nAre birth control pills with drospirenone (a progestin hormone) effective and safe for premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?\n\nKey messages\n- Drospirenone-containing combined birth control pills (combined oral contraceptives, COCs, a pill taken by mouth that contains oestrogen and a progestin; drospirenone is a lab-made form of progesterone; ethinylestradiol is a synthetic oestrogen) may give small to moderate relief of premenstrual symptoms and may help with daily activities in people with PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a severe form of PMS that causes intense mood symptoms and major problems with daily life). Placebo (a dummy pill that looks like the real pill but has no medicine) also helped some people.\n- These pills may increase unwanted effects (adverse effects, meaning harmful or unwanted effects of a treatment), such as breast pain (pain or discomfort in one or both breasts), nausea (a feeling of sickness in the stomach), bleeding between periods (intermenstrual bleeding), and other menstrual problems (any problem with periods, such as irregular timing or heavy flow). More people stopped taking the pills because of these effects.\n\nWhat are PMS and PMDD?\nMany people have physical and emotional symptoms in the days before their period. This is premenstrual syndrome (PMS), a group of symptoms that usually ease when bleeding starts. A severe form is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which causes more intense mood problems and affects daily life.\n\nHow might combined oral contraceptives help?\nCombined oral contraceptives (COCs) are birth control pills taken by mouth that contain both oestrogen (female sex hormones that help control the menstrual cycle) and a progestin (a lab-made substance that acts like the hormone progesterone). One studied pill combines drospirenone (a lab-made form of progesterone) with a low dose of ethinylestradiol (a synthetic oestrogen). COCs can cause side effects, so we need to know both benefits and harms.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether drospirenone-containing COCs reduce premenstrual symptoms and improve day-to-day functioning. We also wanted to know about safety, including side effects and people stopping treatment (withdrawal from a study, meaning when a participant stops taking part before the study ends) because of these effects. We compared drospirenone pills with placebo or other COCs when data were available.\n\nHow did we do this?\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs, studies in which people are assigned by chance to different treatments) that compared drospirenone-containing COCs with placebo or other combined pills. We combined results and judged how much we could trust them based on study quality, consistency, and precision.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 5 RCTs with 858 women, most diagnosed with PMDD. All trials compared drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol with placebo. None compared drospirenone pills with other combined pills.\n\n- Overall symptom effects: Drospirenone pills may slightly reduce premenstrual symptoms and may slightly reduce problems with work, social activities, and relationships. They may slightly increase the number of people who feel better.\n- Side effects and stopping treatment: These pills likely increase stopping treatment because of adverse effects and increase unwanted effects overall. Breast pain probably increases. Nausea, bleeding between periods (intermenstrual bleeding), and other menstrual problems may also increase.\n- Other outcomes: It is unclear whether these pills improve mood symptoms or affect nervousness, headache, tiredness (weakness, also called asthenia), or pain. The included studies did not report rare but serious harms such as venous thromboembolism (a blood clot in a vein that can travel to the lungs).\n\nHow confident are we?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. People in the studies may have known which treatment they got (risk of bias, meaning flaws in study design or reporting that can affect results). Not all studies reported all outcomes. The trials were short and mostly included people with PMDD, so we do not know whether effects apply to milder PMS or whether benefits last with longer use.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and doctors?\nIf someone with PMDD chooses a COC, a drospirenone-containing pill may give small benefits for symptoms and daily functioning. We must weigh these possible benefits against more unwanted effects and a higher chance of stopping the pill because of side effects. No studies compared these pills directly with other combined pills, so we do not know whether drospirenone pills are better or worse than other COCs.\n\nWhat do we need next?\nWe need larger, longer, and better studies. These should compare drospirenone pills with other combined pills, include people with milder PMS, and track mood, daily functioning, stopping treatment, and rare serious harms such as venous thromboembolism.\n\nWords explained (short definitions for other technical terms used)\n- Randomized controlled trial (RCT): a study where participants are randomly assigned to different treatments to reduce bias.\n- Placebo: a dummy treatment that looks like the real thing but has no active medicine.\n- Adverse effects (adverse events): unwanted or harmful effects of a treatment.\n- Withdrawal (from a study): when a participant stops taking part before the study ends.\n- Venous thromboembolism: a blood clot in a vein that can travel to the lungs.\n- Asthenia: weakness or lack of energy."
