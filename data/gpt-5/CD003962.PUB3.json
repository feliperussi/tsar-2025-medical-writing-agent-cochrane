    "output": "Title: What are the benefits and harms of treatments that don’t suppress the immune system for people with IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease)?\n\nKey messages\n- RAS-blocking blood pressure medicines (drugs that block the renin–angiotensin system, a hormone system that helps control blood pressure) such as ACE inhibitors (drugs that block an enzyme that raises blood pressure) or ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers; drugs that block the effect of a blood-pressure hormone) probably reduce proteinuria (protein in the urine, which shows the kidneys are leaking protein) and may improve kidney tests (for example, serum creatinine, a blood test that rises when kidneys filter less well). It is unclear if these medicines prevent kidney failure (when the kidneys stop working and a person needs dialysis, a machine to clean the blood, or a transplant, a new kidney).\n- Tonsillectomy (surgery to remove the tonsils) may reduce proteinuria and microscopic haematuria (blood in the urine only seen on testing) in Japanese people, but benefits and harms in other groups are uncertain. Other options—anticoagulants (blood thinners that prevent clots), fish oil (an oil from fish rich in omega-3 fats), traditional Chinese medicines (a system of medicine using plant-based remedies and other practices), and antimalarial therapy (drugs used to treat malaria)—showed at most small or uncertain benefits and harms were not well reported.\n- The evidence is limited: most studies were small, short, focused on proteinuria rather than long-term outcomes like kidney failure or death, and often did not report unwanted effects (adverse events).\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why is it important?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a kidney disease (disease of the organs that filter blood) in which an antibody called IgA builds up in the kidney filters (glomeruli; the tiny filtering units in the kidney). This build-up causes inflammation and scarring. People may have blood in the urine (haematuria) or protein in the urine (proteinuria). High blood pressure is common. Over time, about 20% to 40% of people develop kidney failure within 25 years, which may need dialysis or a transplant.\n\nWhat are non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgA nephropathy?\nNon-immunosuppressive treatments do not lower the immune system (immunosuppressive treatment reduces the body’s immune activity and can raise infection risk). These treatments aim to protect the kidneys and slow damage. They include:\n- RAS-blocking blood pressure medicines (ACE inhibitors and ARBs) to lower blood pressure and reduce protein leakage from the kidney.\n- Lifestyle and diet measures (for example, less salt) and supplements such as fish oil (an oil from fish rich in omega-3 fats).\n- Surgery such as tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils).\n- Anticoagulants (medicines that prevent blood clots, also called blood thinners), traditional Chinese medicines (plant-based remedies and other practices), and antimalarial drugs (medicines mainly used to treat malaria).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know which non-immunosuppressive treatments help people with biopsy-proven IgAN (diagnosis confirmed by examining kidney tissue) and which cause harms. We looked at adults and children. We compared treatments with placebo (a dummy treatment that contains no medicine), no treatment, usual care (the standard treatment patients receive), or each other. We focused on outcomes that matter: progression to kidney failure, changes in kidney function (serum creatinine and creatinine clearance, tests that show how well the kidneys filter), proteinuria, haematuria, deaths, and unwanted effects (adverse events).\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for randomized or quasi-randomized trials (studies that assign treatments randomly or by a non-random method). We combined results where we could and graded how certain we are in the findings using standard approaches.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 80 randomized or quasi-randomized studies with 4,856 people; 24 studies (2,018 people) were new since the last review. Most trials tested ACE inhibitors or ARBs (RAS blockers). Other trials studied anticoagulants, fish oil, traditional Chinese medicines, tonsillectomy, and antimalarial drugs. Many studies were small and short. Trials often did not report deaths, kidney failure, or harms. Study quality was often poor and the risk of bias (flaws in study design or conduct) was common. The tonsillectomy trials were done in Japan, which limits generalizability (how well results apply to other groups).\n\nMain results\n- ACE inhibitors or ARBs probably reduce proteinuria and may improve kidney function tests compared with placebo, no treatment, or symptomatic care (care that treats symptoms). We remain uncertain if they reduce the risk of kidney failure or death. Reported unwanted effects were usually similar to comparison treatments, but harms were often not well reported.\n- Tonsillectomy may increase the chance that proteinuria and microscopic haematuria clear and may reduce relapses (return of disease signs). The evidence is low certainty and comes only from Japan. Harms were not well reported.\n- Anticoagulants, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines showed small improvements compared with no treatment but not when compared with standard care. One small antimalarial trial suggested a large drop in proteinuria, but events were too few to be sure and harms were unclear.\n- Overall, the trials were too few, small, and short to tell us if these treatments change long-term outcomes such as kidney failure, survival, or cardiovascular disease (heart and blood vessel problems).\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\nMost studies were small, short, and focused on proteinuria rather than long-term outcomes such as kidney failure or survival. Many studies had high or unclear risk of bias. Harms were often missing or reported poorly. These issues lower our confidence in the findings.\n\nWhat should research do next?\nFuture trials should be larger, run longer, and measure outcomes that matter to patients, such as kidney failure, survival, heart and blood vessel problems, daily wellbeing, and harms. Studies should include diverse populations beyond Japan and include both adults and children.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates a previous Cochrane review and includes evidence up to the search date of December 2023."
