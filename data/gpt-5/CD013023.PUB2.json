    "output": "Title\nWhich dressings and holding methods work best to prevent problems with arterial lines (thin tubes placed in an artery to monitor blood pressure and to take blood samples)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found no strong evidence that any dressing or securement method is better than a standard clear dressing for keeping an arterial catheter (a thin tube placed into an artery to monitor blood pressure and draw blood) working or for preventing problems such as the line coming out (dislodgement — when the catheter moves or comes out by accident), blocking (occlusion — a blockage of the tube), or a catheter-related bloodstream infection (a blood infection that starts when germs enter through the catheter or the skin around it). Serious infections were rare and harms (adverse events — unwanted events that cause harm) were seldom reported, so benefits and harms are uncertain.\n- The review included 5 small randomised studies (participants were assigned by chance to different treatments) with 1,228 hospitalised people. The studies compared standard clear polyurethane dressing (polyurethane — a thin plastic film), bordered clear dressing (a clear film with a sticky border), adding tissue adhesive (medical skin glue) to the dressing, using a sutureless securement device (a device that anchors a catheter without stitches), and an integrated securement dressing (a dressing that also has built-in parts to hold the catheter). The studies were small and measured different outcomes, and events such as bloodstream infection were uncommon. This made results inconsistent and uncertain.\n- We need larger, better-designed studies that directly compare these products, use standard ways to measure key outcomes such as catheter failure (when the catheter stops working and needs replacement), catheter-related bloodstream infection (blood infection from the catheter), dislodgement (catheter moving or coming out), and occlusion (blockage). Studies should also report harms, patient comfort, and costs in settings such as intensive care units (ICU — hospital units for very sick patients) and operating theatres (surgery rooms).\n\nIntroduction / Aims\nWhat are peripheral arterial catheters and why are they used?\nA peripheral arterial catheter (a small tube placed into an artery, often in the wrist) lets staff take frequent blood samples and continuously monitor blood pressure. Clinicians use them in surgery and in intensive care to monitor and treat very unwell people. If a catheter stops working, staff may need to put in a new one. That can cause extra needle sticks and take time. Catheters can also cause skin infection, bloodstream infection, accidental pulling out (dislodgement), blockage (occlusion), or skin irritation.\n\nWhat are dressings and securement devices for these catheters?\n- Dressings are protective covers placed over where the catheter enters the skin. A common dressing is a clear polyurethane dressing (polyurethane — a thin plastic film). A bordered dressing adds a sticky border to help it stick.\n- Securement devices hold the catheter steady to stop it moving or falling out. Tissue adhesive (medical skin glue) is applied on the skin to help hold the catheter. Sutureless securement devices are clip-like anchors that do not use stitches. Integrated securement dressings combine a dressing and a device to hold the catheter in one product.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know which dressings and securement devices best prevent catheter failure and reduce complications in people in hospital. We looked for evidence on catheter failure, catheter-related bloodstream infection, dislodgement, occlusion, and other harms.\n\nMethods\nWe searched medical databases and trial registries up to May 2023 for studies comparing dressings and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters in hospital patients. We combined results when we could and rated how certain the evidence was. We judged study reliability and noted possible problems with study methods (risk of bias — flaws that can make study results unreliable).\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 5 small randomised studies with 1,228 people. The studies compared the devices above. Important outcomes, such as bloodstream infection, were rarely measured or had no events. Overall, we are uncertain whether any method reduces catheter failure, bloodstream infection, dislodgement, occlusion, or harms compared with a standard clear dressing. Data for bordered and integrated securement dressings suggest they may make little or no difference for most outcomes, but our confidence is low. Evidence for tissue adhesive and sutureless securement devices is very uncertain. The studies were small, they measured different outcomes, and they reported few events. These factors made results inconsistent and hard to interpret.\n\nLimitations\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because studies were small, they often reported few events, and people or staff may have known which treatment they received (risk of bias). Not all studies reported all the outcomes we wanted.\n\nWhat this means\nWe cannot recommend one dressing or securement method over another. Clinicians and hospitals should consider local practice and cost until better evidence is available. We need larger, well-designed trials that measure the same key outcomes and report harms, comfort, and costs.\n\nCurrency\nWe searched to May 2023."
