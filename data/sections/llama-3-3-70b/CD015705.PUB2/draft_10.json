  "draft": "How do healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other devices to support their work, and what are the benefits and drawbacks of these informal solutions?\n\n- We found that healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and devices to support their work. This can make them more flexible and efficient, but it also raises concerns about patient confidentiality and distractions.\n- The use of personal devices can replicate existing social hierarchies and deepen inequities among healthcare workers, particularly in low-income settings where access to resources and training may be limited.\n- Future research should focus on understanding how to retain the benefits of informal solutions while reducing their negative effects.\n\nWhat is the problem of healthcare workers using personal mobile devices for work purposes?\nHealthcare workers often use their personal mobile phones or other mobile devices to support their work, especially when their workplace lacks standard ways of sharing information and communicating. This can lead to new challenges, such as the potential for unregulated use, data privacy concerns, and unequal access to resources.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to explore the views, experiences, and practices of healthcare workers, managers, and other professionals regarding their informal use of mobile devices to support their work. We wanted to understand how healthcare workers use their personal mobile devices, the benefits and drawbacks of this practice, and how it affects their work and patient care.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that were published between 2013 and 2022. The studies were from high-, middle-, and low-income countries and covered a range of healthcare settings and healthcare worker cadres. Most described mobile phone use as opposed to other mobile devices, such as tablets. Healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other mobile devices in ways that are not regulated by their workplace to support their work, which can help them be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs, but also leads to challenges such as replicating existing social hierarchies, deepening inequities, and raising concerns about patient confidentiality and the potential for healthcare workers to be distracted at work.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received) and by heterogeneity across studies, including different participant populations and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other devices to support their work, which can help them be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs, but also leads to challenges such as costs, distractions, and potential breaches of patient confidentiality (confidentiality refers to keeping personal information private and secure).\n- The use of personal devices can also replicate existing social hierarchies and deepen inequities among healthcare workers, particularly in low-income settings where access to resources and training may be limited, and may benefit some patients more than others, depending on the healthcare workers' personal values and ideas about social equity (fairness and justice in the distribution of resources and opportunities) and patient 'worthiness'.\n- Future research should focus on understanding how to retain the benefits of informal solutions while reducing their negative effects, and address key limitations such as the lack of robust evidence on the long-term consequences of using personal devices in healthcare settings, and the need for studies that consider the perspectives of diverse stakeholders, including patients, healthcare workers, and policymakers.",

For example, the sentence 'Healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other mobile devices in ways that are not regulated by their workplace to support their work, which can help them be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs, but also leads to challenges such as replicating existing social hierarchies, deepening inequities, and raising concerns about patient confidentiality and the potential for healthcare workers to be distracted at work.' is hard to follow due to its length and complexity. A suggested rewrite could be 'Healthcare workers use personal mobile devices to support their work. This can make them more flexible and efficient, but it also raises concerns about patient confidentiality and distractions.' Additionally, the draft text exceeds the recommended word count and has high levels of complexity, with metrics showing significant deviation from typical patterns, including high noun count, complex words, and low readability scores.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show that the draft text deviates from typical patterns in several areas, including word count, sentence length, and complexity. The text has a high noun count, complex words, and low readability scores, indicating a need for simplification and clarification. The metrics also show a high level of passive voice, which can make the text harder to follow. Overall, the draft text requires significant revisions to improve its clarity, readability, and conformity to typical PLS patterns."
