  "draft": "# How do healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other devices to support their work, and what are the benefits and drawbacks of these informal solutions?\n**Key Messages**\n- Healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other devices to support their work, which can help them be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs, but also leads to challenges such as costs, distractions, and potential breaches of patient confidentiality (confidentiality refers to keeping personal information private and secure).\n- The use of personal devices can also replicate existing social hierarchies and deepen inequities among healthcare workers, particularly in low-income settings where access to resources and training may be limited, and may benefit some patients more than others, depending on the healthcare workers' personal values and ideas about social equity and patient 'worthiness' (social equity refers to fairness and justice in the distribution of resources and opportunities).\n- Future research should focus on understanding how to retain the benefits of informal solutions while reducing their negative effects, and address key limitations such as the lack of robust evidence on the long-term consequences of using personal devices in healthcare settings, and the need for studies that consider the perspectives of diverse stakeholders, including patients, healthcare workers, and policymakers.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of healthcare workers using personal mobile devices for work purposes?\nHealthcare workers often use their personal mobile phones or other mobile devices to support their work, especially when their workplace lacks functional formal communication and information systems. This can lead to new challenges, such as the potential for unregulated use, data privacy concerns, and unequal access to resources.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to explore the views, experiences, and practices of healthcare workers, managers, and other professionals regarding their informal use of mobile devices to support their work. They wanted to understand how healthcare workers use their personal mobile devices, the benefits and drawbacks of this practice, and how it affects their work and patient care.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search for studies reporting informal use of mobile devices by healthcare workers, using multiple bibliographic databases and relevant keywords.\n### Data Synthesis\nIdentified studies were summarized qualitatively, extracting key findings on usage patterns, contexts, and outcomes.\n### Confidence Assessment\nWe evaluated the confidence in the evidence using a structured approach, considering study design, risk of bias, consistency, and precision.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that were published between 2013 and 2022. The studies were from high-, middle-, and low-income countries and covered a range of healthcare settings and healthcare worker cadres. Most described mobile phone use as opposed to other mobile devices, such as tablets. The studies did not report the total number of people who took part, the duration of the studies, or the funding sources. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not specified. The study settings included various countries, but the specific locations were not detailed. The types of interventions and comparisons were not applicable in this review, as it focused on the informal use of mobile devices by healthcare workers. Healthcare workers use their personal mobile phones and other mobile devices in ways that are not regulated by their workplace to support their work, which can help them be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to patient needs, but also leads to challenges such as replicating existing social hierarchies, deepening inequities, and raising concerns about patient confidentiality and the potential for healthcare workers to be distracted at work.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received) and by heterogeneity across studies, including different participant populations and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

A suggested rewrite could be 'Healthcare workers use personal mobile phones and devices to support their work. This can make them more flexible and efficient, but it also raises concerns about patient confidentiality and distractions.' Additionally, the draft text exceeds the recommended word count and has high levels of complexity, with metrics showing significant deviation from typical patterns, including a Flesch Reading Ease score of 32.51, which is below the median, and a Gunning Fog Index of 20.71, which is above the 90th percentile.",
