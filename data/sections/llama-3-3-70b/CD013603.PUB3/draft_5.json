  "draft": "What are healthcare workers' experiences and perceptions of integrating different health services into primary healthcare?\n\nKey messages:\n- Healthcare workers have different experiences and views about combining health services into primary healthcare. This can improve how services are delivered but also presents challenges.\n- Healthcare workers play a crucial role in making primary healthcare integration work. Their views can help guide future research and decisions.\n- Future studies should look into gaps in current knowledge to better understand healthcare workers' experiences and improve primary healthcare integration.\n\nWhat is primary healthcare integration?\nPrimary healthcare integration means combining different health services into one system. This approach aims to provide comprehensive and coordinated care to patients, improving health outcomes and efficiency. It's crucial for achieving universal health coverage, especially in low-resource settings.\n\nWhy is understanding healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration important?\nHealthcare workers are vital in making primary healthcare integration successful. Their perceptions and experiences can influence how integrated healthcare services are implemented, delivered, and impact patients.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to map the qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration. They sought to characterize the evidence base, identify gaps in knowledge, and inform future syntheses on the topic.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a systematic search for qualitative studies examining healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences regarding primary healthcare integration. The identified studies were summarized, and the evidence was evaluated to understand the role of healthcare workers in shaping implementation efforts.\n\nResults\nThe review included 184 studies for analysis. Most studies were published in the last 12 years, with a sharp increase in the last five years. Studies covered 37 countries, with a near-even split between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and did not cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand healthcare workers' experiences and perceptions of integrating different health services into primary healthcare.",
