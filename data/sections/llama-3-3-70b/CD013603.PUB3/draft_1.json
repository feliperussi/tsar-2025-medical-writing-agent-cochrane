  "draft": "# What are healthcare workers' experiences and perceptions of integrating different health services into primary healthcare (primary healthcare means the first level of care that people receive when they have a health problem)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Healthcare workers have varied experiences and perceptions of integrating different health services into primary healthcare (primary healthcare means the first level of care that people receive when they have a health problem), with benefits including improved delivery of services, but also challenges such as diversity in country settings, study types, client populations, and intervention focus, scope, and strategies, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The review found that healthcare workers play a crucial role in shaping the implementation and impact of primary healthcare integration, and their perceptions and experiences can inform future research and decision-making, particularly in understanding how the diversity in primary healthcare integration intervention design, implementation, and context may influence healthcare workers' roles.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the gaps in the current evidence base, including the need for more studies on the long-term effects of primary healthcare integration, the impact on specific subgroups of the population, and the development of analytical conceptual models to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of integration studies, to better understand the experiences and perceptions of healthcare workers and to improve primary healthcare integration.\n**Introduction**\n### What is primary healthcare integration?\nPrimary healthcare (PHC) integration refers to the delivery of PHC services together, rather than as separate or 'vertical' health programs. This approach aims to provide comprehensive and coordinated care to patients, improving health outcomes and efficiency. PHC integration is crucial for achieving universal health coverage (UHC), especially in low-resource settings.\n### Why is understanding healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration important?\nHealthcare workers play a vital role in shaping the success of PHC integration. Their perceptions and experiences can influence the implementation, delivery, and impact of integrated healthcare services. However, the evidence base on this topic is heterogeneous, making it challenging to understand the role of healthcare workers in PHC integration. This review aims to address this knowledge gap.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to map the qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. They sought to characterize the evidence base, identify gaps in knowledge, and inform future syntheses on the topic. Specifically, they wanted to understand how healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences vary across different country settings, study types, client populations, and intervention focuses, scopes, and strategies.\n**Methods**\n### Methods Summary\nWe conducted a systematic search for qualitative studies examining healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences regarding primary healthcare integration. The identified studies were summarized, and the evidence was evaluated to elucidate the role of healthcare workers in shaping implementation efforts.\n**Results**\n### Reason for Termination\nThe agent stopped because it reached the maximum number of iterations allowed without completing the task.\n### Suggested Next Steps\nReview the task complexity, simplify the problem, or increase the iteration limit to allow the agent to continue processing.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and did not cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed before it can be approved. The text contains several long sentences that are hard to follow, and there are instances of passive voice that obscure who did what. Additionally, there are some technical terms that are not explained, which could confuse readers. The PLS evaluation results show that the text has a high number of passive voice constructions, complex words, and long words, which contribute to its low readability score. To improve the text, it is suggested that the writer breaks up long sentences, uses active voice instead of passive voice, and explains technical terms. Furthermore, the writer should aim to reduce the number of complex words and long words to improve the overall readability of the text. The top 3-5 improvements needed are: 1. Break up long sentences to improve clarity, 2. Use active voice instead of passive voice, 3. Explain technical terms, 4. Reduce complex words, and 5. Reduce long words. The supporting evidence from the PLS evaluation results includes the high number of passive voice constructions, complex words, and long words, which all contribute to the low readability score.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show that the text has a high number of passive voice constructions, complex words, and long words, which contribute to its low readability score. The text exceeds the 90th percentile in several metrics, including words per sentence, nominalization, nouns, and complex words. The readability indices, such as the Flesch-Kincaid grade and the Gunning-Fog index, also indicate that the text is difficult to read. Overall, the text needs significant revisions to improve its clarity, readability, and conformity to typical PLS patterns."
