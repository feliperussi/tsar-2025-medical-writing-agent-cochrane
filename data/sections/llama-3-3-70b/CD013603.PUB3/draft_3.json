  "draft": "What are healthcare workers' experiences and perceptions of integrating different health services into primary healthcare (primary healthcare means the first level of care that people receive when they have a health problem)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Healthcare workers have varied experiences and perceptions of integrating different health services into primary healthcare, with benefits including improved delivery of services, but also challenges such as diversity in country settings, study types, client populations, and intervention focus, scope, and strategies, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The review found that healthcare workers play a crucial role in shaping the implementation and impact of primary healthcare integration, and their perceptions and experiences can inform future research and decision-making, particularly in understanding how the diversity in primary healthcare integration intervention design, implementation, and context may influence healthcare workers' roles.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the gaps in the current evidence base, including the need for more studies on the long-term effects of primary healthcare integration, the impact on specific subgroups of the population, and the development of analytical conceptual models to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of integration studies, to better understand the experiences and perceptions of healthcare workers and to improve primary healthcare integration.\n\nWhat is primary healthcare integration?\nPrimary healthcare (PHC) integration refers to the delivery of PHC services together, rather than as separate or 'vertical' health programs. This approach aims to provide comprehensive and coordinated care to patients, improving health outcomes and efficiency. PHC integration is crucial for achieving universal health coverage (UHC), especially in low-resource settings.\n\nWhy is understanding healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration important?\nHealthcare workers play a vital role in shaping the success of PHC integration. Their perceptions and experiences can influence the implementation, delivery, and impact of integrated healthcare services. However, the evidence base on this topic is heterogeneous, making it challenging to understand the role of healthcare workers in PHC integration. This review aims to address this knowledge gap.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to map the qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. They sought to characterize the evidence base, identify gaps in knowledge, and inform future syntheses on the topic. Specifically, they wanted to understand how healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences vary across different country settings, study types, client populations, and intervention focuses, scopes, and strategies.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a systematic search for qualitative studies examining healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences regarding primary healthcare integration. The identified studies were summarized, and the evidence was evaluated to elucidate the role of healthcare workers in shaping implementation efforts.\n\nResults\nThe review included 184 studies for analysis based on 191 included papers. Most studies were published in the last 12 years, with a sharp increase in the last five years. Studies mostly employed methods with cross-sectional qualitative design, and few used longitudinal or ethnographic designs. Studies covered 37 countries, with close to an even split in the proportions of high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and did not cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020 of search.",

For example, the sentence 'Primary healthcare (PHC) integration refers to the delivery of PHC services together, rather than as separate or 'vertical' health programs' is unclear because it assumes the reader is familiar with the term 'vertical' health programs. A suggested rewrite could be 'Primary healthcare integration means combining different health services into one system, rather than having separate programs for each service.' Additionally, the draft has high levels of nominalization, complex words, and long words, which contribute to its low readability scores. The PLS evaluation results show significant deviations from typical patterns, including high gunning_fog_index, dale_chall_readability, and lix scores, indicating that the text is difficult to read and understand.",
