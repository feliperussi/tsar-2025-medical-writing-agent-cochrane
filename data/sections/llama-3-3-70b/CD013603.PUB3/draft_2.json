  "draft": "What are healthcare workers' experiences and perceptions of integrating different health services into primary healthcare?\n\nKey messages:\n- Healthcare workers have varied experiences and perceptions of integrating different health services into primary healthcare, with benefits including improved delivery of services.\n- Healthcare workers play a crucial role in shaping the implementation and impact of primary healthcare integration, and their perceptions and experiences can inform future research and decision-making.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the gaps in the current evidence base, including the need for more studies on the long-term effects of primary healthcare integration.\n\nWhat is primary healthcare integration?\nPrimary healthcare integration refers to the delivery of primary healthcare services together, rather than as separate programs. This approach aims to provide comprehensive and coordinated care to patients, improving health outcomes and efficiency. Primary healthcare integration is crucial for achieving universal health coverage, especially in low-resource settings.\n\nWhy is understanding healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration important?\nHealthcare workers play a vital role in shaping the success of primary healthcare integration. Their perceptions and experiences can influence the implementation, delivery, and impact of integrated healthcare services. However, the evidence base on this topic is heterogeneous, making it challenging to understand the role of healthcare workers in primary healthcare integration.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to map the qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration. They sought to characterize the evidence base, identify gaps in knowledge, and inform future syntheses on the topic. Specifically, they wanted to understand how healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences vary across different country settings, study types, client populations, and intervention focuses, scopes, and strategies.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a systematic search for qualitative studies examining healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences regarding primary healthcare integration. The identified studies were summarized, and the evidence was evaluated to elucidate the role of healthcare workers in shaping implementation efforts.\n\nResults\nThe review included 184 studies for analysis based on 191 included papers. Most studies were published in the last 12 years, with a sharp increase in the last five years. Studies mostly employed methods with cross-sectional qualitative design, and few used longitudinal or ethnographic designs. Studies covered 37 countries, with close to an even split in the proportions of high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and did not cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020 of search.",
