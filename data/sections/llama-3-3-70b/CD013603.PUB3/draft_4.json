  "draft": "What are healthcare workers' experiences and perceptions of integrating different health services into primary healthcare?\n\nKey messages:\n- Healthcare workers have different experiences and views about combining health services into primary healthcare, which can improve how services are delivered but also presents challenges due to differences in settings, study types, and populations.\n- Healthcare workers play a crucial role in making primary healthcare integration work and their views can help guide future research and decisions, especially in understanding how different integration approaches affect their roles.\n- Future studies should look into gaps in current knowledge, such as long-term effects, impacts on specific groups, and developing models to guide integration studies, to better understand healthcare workers' experiences and improve primary healthcare integration.\n\nWhat is primary healthcare integration?\nPrimary healthcare integration means combining different health services into one system, rather than having separate programs for each service. This approach aims to provide comprehensive and coordinated care to patients, improving health outcomes and efficiency. It's crucial for achieving universal health coverage, especially in low-resource settings.\n\nWhy is understanding healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration important?\nHealthcare workers are vital in making primary healthcare integration successful. Their perceptions and experiences can influence how integrated healthcare services are implemented, delivered, and impact patients. However, the evidence base on this topic is mixed, making it hard to understand their role in primary healthcare integration. This review aims to address this knowledge gap.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to map the qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration. They sought to characterize the evidence base, identify gaps in knowledge, and inform future syntheses on the topic. Specifically, they wanted to understand how healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences vary across different country settings, study types, client populations, and intervention focuses, scopes, and strategies.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a systematic search for qualitative studies examining healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences regarding primary healthcare integration. The identified studies were summarized, and the evidence was evaluated to understand the role of healthcare workers in shaping implementation efforts.\n\nResults\nThe review included 184 studies for analysis based on 191 included papers. Most studies were published in the last 12 years, with a sharp increase in the last five years. Studies mostly employed cross-sectional qualitative design, and few used longitudinal or ethnographic designs. Studies covered 37 countries, with a near-even split between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and did not cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020.",

To address these issues, it is suggested to reduce the number of nouns, increase the readability by shortening sentences and using simpler vocabulary, and replace complex words with more straightforward).
