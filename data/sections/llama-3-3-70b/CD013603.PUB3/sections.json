  "key_messages": [
    "Healthcare workers have varied experiences and perceptions of integrating different health services into primary healthcare (primary healthcare means the first level of care that people receive when they have a health problem), with benefits including improved delivery of services, but also challenges such as diversity in country settings, study types, client populations, and intervention focus, scope, and strategies, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "The review found that healthcare workers play a crucial role in shaping the implementation and impact of primary healthcare integration, and their perceptions and experiences can inform future research and decision-making, particularly in understanding how the diversity in primary healthcare integration intervention design, implementation, and context may influence healthcare workers' roles.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the gaps in the current evidence base, including the need for more studies on the long-term effects of primary healthcare integration, the impact on specific subgroups of the population, and the development of analytical conceptual models to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of integration studies, to better understand the experiences and perceptions of healthcare workers and to improve primary healthcare integration."

      "content": "Primary healthcare (PHC) integration refers to the delivery of PHC services together, rather than as separate or 'vertical' health programs. This approach aims to provide comprehensive and coordinated care to patients, improving health outcomes and efficiency. PHC integration is crucial for achieving universal health coverage (UHC), especially in low-resource settings."

      "subheading": "Why is understanding healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration important?",
      "content": "Healthcare workers play a vital role in shaping the success of PHC integration. Their perceptions and experiences can influence the implementation, delivery, and impact of integrated healthcare services. However, the evidence base on this topic is heterogeneous, making it challenging to understand the role of healthcare workers in PHC integration. This review aims to address this knowledge gap."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to map the qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. They sought to characterize the evidence base, identify gaps in knowledge, and inform future syntheses on the topic. Specifically, they wanted to understand how healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences vary across different country settings, study types, client populations, and intervention focuses, scopes, and strategies."
