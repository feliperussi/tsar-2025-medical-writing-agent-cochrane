  "draft": "Are antibiotics or antiseptics more effective for treating chronic suppurative otitis media (a long-term infection of the middle ear that causes discharge and hearing loss)?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- We found that topical antibiotics (medicines applied directly to the affected area) may be more effective than topical antiseptics (substances that reduce the growth of microorganisms) in treating chronic suppurative otitis media, particularly when compared to boric acid. However, the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions about all types of antibiotics or antiseptics.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, we cannot determine the effectiveness of most types of topical antibiotics or antiseptics. There is also limited information on their potential harmful effects, such as ear pain or discomfort.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the benefits and harms of different topical treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media, including their effects on hearing loss and quality of life.\n\n**What is chronic suppurative otitis media?**\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. It is characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. CSOM is a significant health problem that affects many people worldwide, causing discomfort, pain, and difficulty hearing.\n\n**How is chronic suppurative otitis media typically treated?**\nCSOM is typically treated with antibiotics or antiseptics. Antibiotics can be applied topically or administered systemically via the oral or injection route. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically). The goal of treatment is to resolve the ear discharge, reduce pain and discomfort, and improve hearing.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). They aimed to compare the effectiveness of different treatments in resolving ear discharge, improving hearing, and reducing pain and discomfort. They also wanted to evaluate the potential harmful effects of these treatments.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 15 studies that involved 2371 people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The studies compared antibiotics with topical antiseptics, including acetic acid, aluminium acetate, boric acid, and povidone-iodine. The duration of the studies ranged from one week to more than four weeks.\n\n**Main results: Topical antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media**\nThe use of topical antibiotics, such as quinolones, may increase the resolution of ear discharge in people with chronic suppurative otitis media compared to the use of topical antiseptics, such as boric acid. However, it is unclear if there is a difference between quinolones and other topical antiseptics, such as acetic acid or povidone-iodine, in terms of resolution of ear discharge. Topical quinolones may also result in less ear pain, discomfort, or irritation compared to boric acid, but the evidence is limited and uncertain.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

For example, the sentence 'CSOM is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity' is unclear because it does not define 'polymicrobial infection'. A suggested rewrite is 'CSOM is a long-term infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, often caused by multiple types of bacteria'. Additionally, the draft has high numbers of complex words, long words, and nouns, which contribute to its low readability. The PLS evaluation results show that the draft has 149 complex words, 191 long words, and 164 nouns, which are all above the typical ranges for PLS texts.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 33.3% of features in the best quartile and 27.8% in the P90 range. However, the draft has significant deviations from typical patterns in terms of complex words, long words, and nouns, which suggests that it may be difficult for readers to understand. The results also show that the draft has a high smog index, dale-chall readability, and complex words DC, which further supports the need for revisions to improve clarity and readability."
