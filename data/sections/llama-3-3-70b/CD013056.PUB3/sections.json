  "key_messages": [
    "Topical antibiotics (medicines applied directly to the affected area) may be more effective than topical antiseptics (substances that reduce the growth of microorganisms) in treating chronic suppurative otitis media (a long-term infection of the middle ear that causes discharge and hearing loss), particularly when compared to boric acid, but the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions about all types of antibiotics or antiseptics.",
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, we cannot determine the effectiveness of most types of topical antibiotics or antiseptics, and there is limited information on their potential harmful effects, such as ear pain or discomfort, which is a sensation of unease or distress in the ear.",
    "Future research should focus on comparing the benefits and harms of different topical treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media, including their effects on hearing loss (a reduction in the ability to hear) and quality of life (a person's overall sense of well-being), to provide clearer guidance for people with this condition and their healthcare providers."

      "subheading": "What is chronic suppurative otitis media?",
      "content": "Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. It is characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. CSOM is a significant health problem that affects many people worldwide, causing discomfort, pain, and difficulty hearing."

    {
      "subheading": "How is chronic suppurative otitis media typically treated?",
      "content": "CSOM is typically treated with antibiotics or antiseptics. Antibiotics can be applied topically or administered systemically via the oral or injection route. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically). The goal of treatment is to resolve the ear discharge, reduce pain and discomfort, and improve hearing."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). They aimed to compare the effectiveness of different treatments in resolving ear discharge, improving hearing, and reducing pain and discomfort. They also wanted to evaluate the potential harmful effects of these treatments."

      "content": "We performed a systematic search of databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for studies that directly compared antibiotics with antiseptics in the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media. Search terms included combinations of \"chronic suppurative otitis media\", \"antibiotics\", \"antiseptics\", and related synonyms. No date or language restrictions were applied."

      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, extracting data on study design, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes (clinical cure, adverse events), and followâ€‘up duration. Results were summarized qualitatively, and where possible, effect sizes were calculated as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals."

    {
      "subheading": "Confidence in the Evidence",
      "content": "The overall confidence in the body of evidence was assessed using the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Evidence was rated as low to moderate confidence due to heterogeneity in interventions and limited sample sizes."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 15 studies that involved 2371 people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The studies compared antibiotics with topical antiseptics, including acetic acid, aluminium acetate, boric acid, and povidone-iodine. The duration of the studies ranged from one week to more than four weeks. The population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources were not explicitly reported in the abstract. The interventions included topical antibiotics, such as quinolones and aminoglycosides, and topical antiseptics. The comparisons were between topical antibiotics and topical antiseptics, with some studies also including aural toileting or other add-on therapies. No studies reported on health-related quality of life or serious complications."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Topical antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media",
      "content": "The use of topical antibiotics, such as quinolones, may increase the resolution of ear discharge in people with chronic suppurative otitis media compared to the use of topical antiseptics, such as boric acid. However, it is unclear if there is a difference between quinolones and other topical antiseptics, such as acetic acid or povidone-iodine, in terms of resolution of ear discharge. Topical quinolones may also result in less ear pain, discomfort, or irritation compared to boric acid, but the evidence is limited and uncertain. Additionally, topical quinolones may lead to a greater improvement in hearing compared to boric acid, but this difference may not be clinically significant."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.",
