  "draft": "# Is home-based cardiac rehabilitation (a programme to help your heart recover from illness or surgery, done at home) as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation (a programme done at a hospital or clinic) for people with heart disease?\n**Key Messages**\n- Home-based cardiac rehabilitation (a programme to help your heart recover from illness or surgery, done at home) seems to be as effective as centre-based cardiac rehabilitation (a programme done at a hospital or clinic) for people with heart disease, with no significant difference found in benefits or unwanted effects.\n- The quality of evidence is not strong enough to confirm the long-term effects of home-based versus centre-based cardiac rehabilitation, and more research is needed to understand the impact on patients over a longer period.\n- Future studies should investigate the effectiveness of home-based cardiac rehabilitation for different types of heart patients and explore hybrid models that combine elements of both centre-based and home-based programmes to provide more personalized care.\n**Introduction**\n### What is cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem?\nCardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally. It refers to conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as heart attacks, strokes, and other diseases. Traditionally, people who have had heart problems or procedures are offered centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes to help them recover and prevent further heart problems.\n### What are home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes?\nCentre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are supervised programmes that take place in hospitals, sports centres, or community centres. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, on the other hand, can include digital or telehealth interventions and are supervised by healthcare staff. These programmes aim to improve exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and reduce the risk of further heart problems.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to compare the effects of home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes on mortality, morbidity, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors in patients with heart disease. They also wanted to determine whether one type of programme is more effective than the other in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 24 studies that involved 3046 people with heart disease. The studies were conducted in various countries around the world, although the specific countries are not mentioned. Most studies lasted for around 12 months or less, with only three studies reporting outcomes beyond 12 months. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, are not specified in the abstract. The studies compared home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, with some studies incorporating digital or telehealth platforms. No information is provided about the funding sources of the studies. Home-based and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes in patients after myocardial infarction, or revascularisation, or with heart failure. The effects of this treatment are similar, so it is possible that it may make little or no difference. For every 100 people undergoing cardiac rehabilitation, the chance of death or further cardiac illness may be similar whether they receive home-based or centre-based care.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and incomplete reporting of outcomes across the studies.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

For example, the sentence 'Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally' could be rephrased as 'What is cardiovascular disease and why is it a leading cause of death worldwide?' to better follow the MASTER_STYLE_GUIDE. Additionally, the text uses excessive passive voice, with 45 instances, which can make it harder for readers to understand who is performing the actions. The PLS_EVALUATION_RESULTS show that the draft has a high gunning_fog_index, rix, smog_index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words, indicating that the text may be too complex for some readers. To improve, the writer could reduce the use of passive voice, break up long sentences, and provide more context for technical terms.",

However, there are significant deviations in passive voice, nominalization, nouns, gunning_fog_index, rix, smog_index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words, suggesting that the text could be improved for better readability and clarity."
