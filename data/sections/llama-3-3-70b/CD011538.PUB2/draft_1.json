  "draft": "# Can education support services help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions (long-term illnesses that do not go away) stay engaged in school and improve their academic performance?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Education support services may help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions (long-term illnesses that do not go away) stay engaged in school, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and we did not find any information about harmful effects.\n- There is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self-esteem, in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, but again, the evidence is not strong.\n- Future research should focus on studying education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions to find out if they really work and what kinds of support are most helpful, as the current evidence is limited and uncertain.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What are chronic health conditions in children and adolescents, and why are they a problem?\nChronic health conditions in children and adolescents are long-term illnesses that do not resolve spontaneously and are rarely cured completely. These conditions can have a significant impact on a child's education, well-being, and health. Children and adolescents with chronic health conditions often experience difficulties attending school, which can lead to disengagement from school and poorer academic achievement, social-emotional functioning, and career choices.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to describe the nature of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions and to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement. They also wanted to investigate the impact of education support interventions on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, transition to school, mental health, and adverse effects.\n\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe searched for studies on education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions.\n### Data Summarization\nWe summarized the results of the identified studies.\n### Confidence Assessment\nWe evaluated our confidence in the evidence to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 359 participants with chronic health conditions. All studies were randomised controlled trials and were disease-specific, with three focusing on children with cancer and one on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The studies did not report on the duration of the interventions. There is no information available on the funding sources of the studies. The population characteristics included children and adolescents aged four to 18 years with chronic health conditions. The study settings were not specified in terms of countries. The types of interventions included educational support services, and the comparisons were between the intervention and control groups. No studies were found that reported on the quality of life or adverse effects of the interventions. Education support services may improve school engagement and mental health, measured as self-esteem, for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021.",
