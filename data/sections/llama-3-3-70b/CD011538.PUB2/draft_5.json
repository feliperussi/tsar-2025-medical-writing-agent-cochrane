  "draft": "Can education support services help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions stay engaged in school and improve their academic performance?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if education support services can help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. \n- Education support services may help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions stay engaged in school, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- There is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self-esteem, in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, but again, the evidence is not strong.\n- Future research should focus on studying education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions to find out if they really work and what kinds of support are most helpful.\n\nWhat are chronic health conditions in children and adolescents, and why are they a problem? \nChronic health conditions are long-term illnesses that do not go away on their own and usually can't be completely cured. These conditions can have a significant impact on a child's education, well-being, and health. Children and adolescents with chronic health conditions often experience difficulties attending school, which can lead to disengagement from school and poorer academic achievement, social-emotional functioning, and career choices.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nThe review authors aimed to describe the nature of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions and to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement. They also wanted to investigate the impact of education support interventions on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, transition to school, mental health, and adverse effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence? \nWe searched for studies on education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. We summarized the results of the identified studies and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 4 studies that involved 359 participants with chronic health conditions. All studies were randomized controlled trials and were disease-specific, with 3 focusing on children with cancer and 1 on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Education support services may improve school engagement and mental health, measured as self-esteem, for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021.",

The main issues include the use of unexplained technical terms, sentences that are too long and hard to follow, and missing context that could confuse readers. For instance, the sentence 'Chronic health conditions are long-term illnesses that do not resolve spontaneously and are rarely cured completely' could be simplified by adding a brief explanation of what chronic health conditions are. Additionally, the draft contains some passive voice constructions and wordy phrases that could be rephrased for better readability. The PLS evaluation results show that the draft has good conformity with typical PLS patterns in many areas, such as the use of pronouns, nouns, and readability indices. However, there are deviations in nominalization and long words that should be addressed to improve the overall clarity and readability of the text.",

However, the draft has 31 instances of nominalization and 167 long words, which are beyond the typical ranges and should be reduced to improve clarity and readability."
