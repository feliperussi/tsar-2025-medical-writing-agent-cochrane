  "draft": "Can education support services help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions stay engaged in school and improve their academic performance?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if education support services can help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. \n\n- Education support services may help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions stay engaged in school, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. \n- There is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self-esteem, in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, but again, the evidence is not strong. \n- Future research should focus on studying education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions to find out if they really work and what kinds of support are most helpful.\n\nWhat are chronic health conditions in children and adolescents, and why are they a problem?\nChronic health conditions are long-term illnesses that don't go away on their own and usually can't be completely cured. These conditions can have a significant impact on a child's education, well-being, and health. Children and adolescents with chronic health conditions often experience difficulties attending school, which can lead to disengagement from school and poorer academic achievement, social-emotional functioning, and career choices.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to describe the nature of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions and to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement. They also wanted to investigate the impact of education support interventions on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, transition to school, mental health, and adverse effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. We summarized the results of the identified studies and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 359 participants with chronic health conditions. All studies were randomized controlled trials and were disease-specific, with three focusing on children with cancer and one on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Education support services may improve school engagement and mental health, measured as self-esteem, for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021.",

For example, the sentence 'Chronic health conditions are long-term illnesses that do not resolve spontaneously and are rarely cured completely' could be rephrased for better clarity. Additionally, subheadings should be phrased as questions, and numbers should be presented as numerals. The PLS evaluation results indicate good overall conformity but highlight the need to reduce nominalization and long words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 50% of features in the best quartile and 38.9% in the median range. However, there are deviations in nominalization and long words that require attention. The use of pronouns, nouns, and the Coleman-Liau index are within desirable ranges, indicating a good balance of language complexity and readability. With targeted revisions, the draft can better meet the standards for a Plain Language Summary."
