  "draft": "Can education support services help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions stay engaged in school and improve their academic performance?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if education support services can help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. \n- Education support services may help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions stay engaged in school, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- There is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self-esteem, in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, but again, the evidence is not strong.\n- Future research should focus on studying education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions to find out if they really work and what kinds of support are most helpful.\n\nWhat are chronic health conditions in children and adolescents, and why are they a problem? \nChronic health conditions are long-term illnesses that cannot be cured. These conditions can significantly impact a child's education, well-being, and health. Children and adolescents with chronic health conditions often experience difficulties attending school, which can lead to disengagement from school and poorer academic achievement, social-emotional functioning, and career choices.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nThe review authors aimed to describe the nature of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions and to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement. They also wanted to investigate the impact of education support interventions on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, transition to school, mental health, and adverse effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence? \nWe searched for studies on education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. We summarized the results of the identified studies and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 4 studies that involved 359 participants with chronic health conditions. All studies were randomized controlled trials and were disease-specific, with 3 focusing on children with cancer and 1 on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Education support services may improve school engagement and mental health, measured as self-esteem, for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021.",

Firstly, the sentence \"Chronic health conditions are long-term illnesses that do not resolve spontaneously and are rarely cured completely\" could be simplified for better understanding. Additionally, the use of passive voice in some sentences, such as \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential bias due to lack of blinding,\" should be converted to active voice for clearer attribution of actions. Furthermore, the draft could benefit from more concise language and shorter sentences to improve readability. The PLS evaluation results support these suggestions, indicating areas such as nominalization, coleman_liau_index, and long_words are beyond typical PLS patterns, suggesting a need for reduction. Overall, while the draft provides valuable information, these improvements are necessary to ensure the text is accessible and clear to the target audience.",

The best quartile rate is 38.9%, indicating that while some aspects of the draft are well-written, there are areas needing improvement to meet the standards of a Plain Language Summary."
