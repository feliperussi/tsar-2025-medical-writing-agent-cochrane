  "key_messages": [
    "General health checks (medical examinations that assess overall health in people without symptoms) are valued by clients, healthcare providers, and policymakers, despite a lack of evidence showing they reduce deaths from all causes, cancer, or heart disease, or prevent heart disease (a condition where the heart or blood vessels are not functioning normally), likely because they help motivate lifestyle changes and provide reassurance about health, although some people may be reluctant due to fear of negative results or reliance on symptom-based care (treating symptoms as they appear)",
    "The perceptions and experiences of general health checks vary among different stakeholders, including clients, healthcare providers, and policymakers, with factors such as the skill and cultural competence (ability to understand and respond to diverse cultural needs) of healthcare providers, accessibility, and awareness systems influencing uptake (the extent to which people participate in general health checks), highlighting the need for tailored approaches and effective communication to improve participation and address concerns",
    "Future research should focus on understanding the reasons behind the commissioning of general health checks, exploring the impact of contextual factors such as cultural background, social norms, and language on uptake, and investigating alternative approaches that address the needs and wants of different stakeholders, to inform constructive debates about the role and delivery of general health checks in various healthcare systems"

      "subheading": "What are general health checks and why are they important?",
      "content": "General health checks are a series of screening tests that assess the overall health of individuals who do not have any symptoms. These checks aim to reduce the population's morbidity and mortality by identifying potential health issues early on. Despite their widespread use, a 2019 Cochrane review found that general health checks have little or no effect on all-cause mortality, cancer, or cardiovascular mortality or morbidity. This raises questions about the value and effectiveness of these checks."

      "subheading": "What do we want to find out about general health checks?",
      "content": "The authors of this review wanted to explore how different stakeholders, including healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, perceive and experience general health checks. They also aimed to identify the factors that influence the commissioning, delivery, and uptake of these checks. By examining the perspectives and experiences of various stakeholders, the review seeks to supplement and contextualize the findings of the 2019 Cochrane effectiveness review and provide a more comprehensive understanding of general health checks."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 146 studies that involved stakeholdersâ€™ perceptions and experiences of factors influencing the commissioning, delivery, and uptake of general health checks. The studies were conducted in various countries, with most set in high-income countries in Europe and nearly a third in culturally diverse middle-income countries across Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The studies explored the perceptions and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners. The included studies were set in primary and community healthcare settings, workplace settings, and community settings. General health checks are valued by clients, healthcare providers, managers, and policymakers across different countries and settings, despite a lack of effectiveness in reducing mortality or morbidity. Clients trust general health checks to assess their health objectively and find reassurance through professional confirmation. However, some clients are reluctant to attend due to fear of negative results or reliance on symptom-based care. Healthcare providers play a crucial role in motivating participation, and the availability and accessibility of general health checks influence clients' decision-making."
