  "draft": "# What influences people's decisions to get general health checks, and how do different stakeholders, such as healthcare providers and clients, perceive and experience them?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- General health checks (medical examinations that assess overall health in people without symptoms) are valued by clients, healthcare providers, and policymakers, despite a lack of evidence showing they reduce deaths from all causes, cancer, or heart disease, or prevent heart disease (a condition where the heart or blood vessels are not functioning normally), likely because they help motivate lifestyle changes and provide reassurance about health, although some people may be reluctant due to fear of negative results or reliance on symptom-based care (treating symptoms as they appear)\n- The perceptions and experiences of general health checks vary among different stakeholders, including clients, healthcare providers, and policymakers, with factors such as the skill and cultural competence (ability to understand and respond to diverse cultural needs) of healthcare providers, accessibility, and awareness systems influencing uptake (the extent to which people participate in general health checks), highlighting the need for tailored approaches and effective communication to improve participation and address concerns\n- Future research should focus on understanding the reasons behind the commissioning of general health checks, exploring the impact of contextual factors such as cultural background, social norms, and language on uptake, and investigating alternative approaches that address the needs and wants of different stakeholders, to inform constructive debates about the role and delivery of general health checks in various healthcare systems\n\n**Introduction**\n### What are general health checks and why are they important?\nGeneral health checks are a series of screening tests that assess the overall health of individuals who do not have any symptoms. These checks aim to reduce the population's morbidity and mortality by identifying potential health issues early on. Despite their widespread use, a 2019 Cochrane review found that general health checks have little or no effect on all-cause mortality, cancer, or cardiovascular mortality or morbidity. This raises questions about the value and effectiveness of these checks.\n### What do we want to find out about general health checks?\nThe authors of this review wanted to explore how different stakeholders, including healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, perceive and experience general health checks. They also aimed to identify the factors that influence the commissioning, delivery, and uptake of these checks. By examining the perspectives and experiences of various stakeholders, the review seeks to supplement and contextualize the findings of the 2019 Cochrane effectiveness review and provide a more comprehensive understanding of general health checks.\n\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search for qualitative studies that explored stakeholders' perceptions of general health checks across multiple databases, using relevant keywords and Boolean operators, and screened titles, abstracts, and full texts according to predefined inclusion criteria.\n### Data Synthesis\nThe included studies were summarized narratively, extracting key themes related to perceptions, barriers, and facilitators of general health checks. Findings were organized thematically to provide a coherent overview of stakeholder views.\n### Confidence Assessment\nWe applied the GRADE-CERQual approach to rate our confidence in each synthesized finding, evaluating methodological limitations, coherence, adequacy of data, and relevance to the review question.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 146 studies that involved stakeholdersâ€™ perceptions and experiences of factors influencing the commissioning, delivery, and uptake of general health checks. The studies were conducted in various countries, with most set in high-income countries in Europe and nearly a third in culturally diverse middle-income countries across Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The studies explored the perceptions and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners. The included studies were set in primary and community healthcare settings, workplace settings, and community settings. General health checks are valued by clients, healthcare providers, managers, and policymakers across different countries and settings, despite a lack of effectiveness in reducing mortality or morbidity. Clients trust general health checks to assess their health objectively and find reassurance through professional confirmation. However, some clients are reluctant to attend due to fear of negative results or reliance on symptom-based care. Healthcare providers play a crucial role in motivating participation, and the availability and accessibility of general health checks influence clients' decision-making.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have known which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, the sentence 'General health checks are a series of screening tests that assess the overall health of individuals who do not have any symptoms.' is unclear because it does not define what screening tests are. A suggested rewrite could be 'General health checks are a series of tests, including blood pressure and blood glucose tests, that assess the overall health of individuals who do not have any symptoms.' Secondly, the sentence 'The authors of this review wanted to explore how different stakeholders, including healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients, perceive and experience general health checks.' is too long and hard to follow. A suggested rewrite could be 'We wanted to explore how healthcare managers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and clients perceive and experience general health checks.' Lastly, the draft text has excessive use of passive voice, with 16 instances, which can make it difficult to understand who is performing the actions. For example, the sentence 'The included studies were summarized narratively, extracting key themes related to perceptions, barriers, and facilitators of general health checks.' could be rewritten as 'We summarized the included studies narratively, extracting key themes related to perceptions, barriers, and facilitators of general health checks.' The PLS evaluation results show that the draft text has several metrics that deviate from typical PLS patterns, including high levels of nominalization, complex words, and long words. The word count is within the limit of 850 words. Overall, the draft text needs significant revisions to improve clarity and readability.",
