  "key_messages": [
    "Bronchoscopy (a procedure that uses a tube to look into the lungs) to guide antibiotic treatment may have little or no difference in effectiveness compared to standard treatment for lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs and other organs), in terms of benefits and unwanted or harmful effects, although harmful effects such as transient worsening of cough were reported.",
    "The current evidence does not support the routine use of bronchoscopy for diagnosing and managing pulmonary (relating to the lungs) infections in preschool children with cystic fibrosis, and there is no evidence available for adults, highlighting the need for more research in this area.",
    "Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of bronchoscopy-guided antibiotic treatment and compare it directly with standard care, addressing key limitations such as the small number of studies and participants, to provide more robust evidence for decision-making."

      "subheading": "What is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system, and other organs in the body. CF affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat, and digestive juices, causing these fluids to become thick and sticky. This thickness clogs tubes, ducts, and passageways, particularly in the lungs and pancreas. People with CF are at a higher risk of developing lung infections, which can be life‑threatening if left untreated. Early diagnosis and treatment of these infections are crucial to manage the disease and improve the quality of life for people with CF."

      "subheading": "What are the common treatments for lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis?",
      "content": "The main goal of treating lung infections in people with CF is to clear the infection and prevent further damage to the lungs. Common treatments include antibiotics, which can be given orally, intravenously, or through inhalation. However, diagnosing lung infections in people with CF can be challenging, especially when they are not producing sputum. In such cases, doctors rely on cultures from oropharyngeal specimens, which may not always accurately identify the infection‑causing bacteria in the lungs."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of using bronchoscopy‑guided antimicrobial therapy in managing lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. They aimed to compare the outcomes of this approach with standard care, which relies on cultures from sputum, throat swabs, or other non‑invasive methods. The authors sought to determine whether bronchoscopy‑guided therapy leads to better lung function, reduced hospitalizations, and improved quality of life for people with CF."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 2 studies that involved 200 people with cystic fibrosis. The studies were conducted in unspecified countries. Most studies lasted for around 5 years. The funding sources of the studies were not specified. The population characteristics included infants under six months of age and children aged between five and 18 years. The studies compared bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy to standard treatment based on clinical features and oropharyngeal cultures. Bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy may make little to no difference in lung function, and probably makes little to no difference in chest scores assessed by computed tomography scan. It may lead to more hospitalisations per year, but probably makes little to no difference in the average cost of care per participant. There is probably no difference in health-related quality of life between bronchoscopy-guided therapy and standard care."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (potential lack of blinding), and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2023."
