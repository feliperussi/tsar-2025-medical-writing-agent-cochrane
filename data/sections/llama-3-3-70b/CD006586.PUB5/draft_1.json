  "draft": "# Can birth control pills containing drospirenone (a type of hormone) help women with premenstrual syndrome (a condition that causes symptoms like mood swings and bloating before a woman's period)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Birth control pills containing drospirenone (a type of hormone) may help improve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (a condition that causes symptoms like mood swings and bloating before a woman's period), including functional impairments such as productivity, social activities, and relationships, but may also lead to more unwanted effects, such as breast pain and nausea, although the overall quality of the evidence is not strong due to limitations in the studies.\n- The effect of drospirenone on premenstrual mood symptoms is uncertain, and it is also unclear whether it works better than other types of birth control pills or has long-term benefits, highlighting the need for more research in these areas.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of drospirenone, compare it directly with other birth control methods, and focus on outcomes that matter most to women with premenstrual syndrome, to provide clearer guidance on the use of this treatment option.\n**Introduction**\n### What is premenstrual syndrome and why is it a problem?\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common problem that affects many women. It is characterized by physical and emotional symptoms that occur in the premenstrual phase of a woman's cycle and can interfere with daily life. A more severe form of PMS is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). While there are various treatments available, including lifestyle changes and medication, some women may not find relief from their symptoms. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs), which contain both progestin and oestrogen, have been studied as a potential treatment option for PMS.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of COCs containing drospirenone in women with PMS. Specifically, they aimed to investigate whether these contraceptives can improve premenstrual symptoms, functional impairment, and mood symptoms, as well as assess their potential side effects and compare them to other treatment options.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on oral contraceptives containing drospirenone for premenstrual syndrome, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 5 studies that involved 858 women with premenstrual syndrome, most of whom were diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone. The total number of people who took part in the studies was 858. Unfortunately, the abstract does not provide information on the duration of the studies, the funding sources, or the countries in which they took place. The population characteristics included women with premenstrual syndrome, and the interventions used were combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol compared to placebo or other combined oral contraceptives. No studies were found that compared combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone with other combined oral contraceptives. The combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone may improve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, but it may also lead to more adverse effects. For every 100 women taking this contraceptive, 10 to 16 may stop using it due to adverse effects, compared to 3 out of 100 women taking a placebo. The contraceptive may also lead to more breast pain, nausea, and other side effects. However, it may improve response rate, with 39 to 58 out of 100 women responding to the treatment, compared to 36 out of 100 women taking a placebo.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because many studies were not blinded, leading to potential bias; some studies lacked data on outcomes of interest; there was heterogeneity in the populations studied and the ways the interventions were delivered; and the sample sizes were very small.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

For example, the sentence 'The combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone may improve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, but it may also lead to more adverse effects' is unclear because it does not define what 'adverse effects' are. A suggested rewrite could be 'The combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone may improve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, but it may also lead to more side effects, such as breast pain and nausea.' Additionally, the draft text has excessive passive voice, with 21 instances, which can make it harder to understand who is performing the actions. The metrics also show that the draft text has a high number of complex words and long words, which can make it harder for readers to understand. To improve the draft text, it is suggested to reduce the number of passive constructions, define technical terms, and use shorter sentences.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show that the draft text has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 55.6% of features in the best quartile. However, there are several features that deviate from typical PLS patterns, including passive voice, nouns, rix, smog index, complex words, and long words. These deviations contribute to the clarity issues noted in the feedback."
