  "draft": "Is re-feeding gastric residuals (the leftover food in the stomach) better than discarding them for improving growth in premature babies?\n\nKey messages:\n- Re-feeding gastric residuals may have little or no effect on important clinical outcomes.\n- We need more research to understand the benefits and risks of re-feeding gastric residuals.\n- The current evidence is limited and based on a small study.\n\nWhat is the problem of gastric residuals in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants often have trouble digesting food. This can lead to leftover food in their stomachs, known as gastric residuals (undigested food). Gastric residuals can cause vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (a serious infection of the intestine), or sepsis (a life-threatening infection). Healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in preterm infants who are being fed through a tube. However, there is no clear consensus on whether to re-feed these residuals to the infant or discard them.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to determine whether re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants is effective and safe compared to discarding them. We aimed to find out if re-feeding gastric residuals can improve growth and reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, and death. We also sought to understand the effects of re-feeding gastric residuals on other important outcomes, including the time it takes for infants to regain their birth weight, the time it takes to establish full tube feeding, and the number of days infants require total parenteral nutrition (intravenous nutrition).\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing re-feeding and discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. We summarized and combined their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence to assess the efficacy and safety of re-feeding gastric residuals.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one eligible trial that included 72 preterm infants. The trial was unmasked but was otherwise of good methodological quality. Re-feeding gastric residuals may have little or no effect on time to regain birth weight, risk of necrotising enterocolitis, all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds, number of total parenteral nutrition days, and risk of extrauterine growth restriction at discharge.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by the lack of blinding, which introduces potential observer and participant bias, and by the small sample size, which reduces statistical power and limits the generalizability of the findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nWe found that re-feeding gastric residuals may have little or no effect on important clinical outcomes such as necrotising enterocolitis, all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds, number of total parenteral nutrition days, and in-hospital weight gain. A large randomized controlled trial is needed to assess the efficacy and safety of re-feeding of gastric residuals in preterm infants with adequate certainty of evidence to inform policy and practice.",

The PLS evaluation results support these observations, showing deviations in smog index, complex words, and long words that need to be addressed.",
