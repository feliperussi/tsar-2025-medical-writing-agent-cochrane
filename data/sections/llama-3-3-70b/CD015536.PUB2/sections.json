  "key_messages": [
    "We could not determine the effect of entecavir (a type of antiviral medicine) versus no treatment or placebo on critical outcomes such as all-cause mortality (death from any cause) and serious adverse events (unwanted effects that are serious and require medical attention) in children and adults with chronic hepatitis B (a long-term liver infection), due to a lack of robust evidence and issues with the quality of the included studies.",
    "Entecavir is widely used and recommended as a first-line treatment for chronic hepatitis B, but there is a need for more research to understand its benefits and harms, particularly in terms of health-related quality of life (how well a person can carry out daily activities and enjoy life), which was not reported in the included studies.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current evidence, including the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for studies that compare entecavir directly with other treatments, to provide clearer answers for people with chronic hepatitis B and their healthcare providers."

      "subheading": "What is chronic hepatitis B and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Chronic hepatitis B is a major worldwide public health concern. It is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus that can lead to serious health problems, including liver damage, liver cancer, and death. The virus is transmitted through bodily fluids, such as blood and semen, and can be spread through sexual contact, sharing needles, or from mother to child during birth. Chronic hepatitis B is a long-term infection that can cause ongoing liver damage and increase the risk of liver cancer. Common treatments for chronic hepatitis B include antiviral medications, such as entecavir, which can help slow the progression of the disease."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of entecavir, a commonly used antiviral medication, compared to no treatment or placebo in children and adults with chronic hepatitis B. They aimed to determine the effect of entecavir on critical outcomes such as all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life, and the proportion of people with serious adverse events. The authors also wanted to assess the certainty of the evidence and identify any gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed through further research."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 22 studies that involved 2940 people with chronic hepatitis B. The studies were conducted over a period of 5 weeks to 228 weeks. One trial included participants between 14 years and 55 years of age, one trial included only children, 19 trials included only adults, and one trial did not provide the age of participants. The experimental intervention was oral entecavir, and the comparator in 12 trials was no treatment, and in 10 trials was placebo. Fourteen trials equally administered co-interventions to the trial participants in the entecavir and no treatment and placebo groups. This Cochrane review had no dedicated funding. Entecavir may reduce the risk of serious adverse events in people with chronic hepatitis B, but we are very uncertain about the results. It is unclear if entecavir has an effect on all-cause mortality. There is a lack of data on health-related quality of life."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because most trials have a high or unclear risk of bias, the studies are very small with few events, and there are insufficient numbers of studies to be confident in the outcome results.",
