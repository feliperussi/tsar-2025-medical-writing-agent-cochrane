  "draft": "Is entecavir (a type of antiviral medicine) effective and safe for children and adults with chronic hepatitis B (a long-term liver infection)?\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if entecavir is effective and safe for people with chronic hepatitis B. Here are the key messages:\n- We could not determine if entecavir is better than no treatment or a placebo for critical outcomes like death from any cause and serious side effects (like hospitalization or life-threatening conditions) in people with chronic hepatitis B. This is because the evidence is not strong enough.\n- Entecavir is widely used and recommended as a first-line treatment for chronic hepatitis B. However, we need more research to understand its benefits and harms, especially in terms of how well people can carry out daily activities and enjoy life.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current evidence. This includes the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for studies that compare entecavir directly with other treatments.\n\nWhat is chronic hepatitis B and why is it a problem?\nChronic hepatitis B is a major worldwide public health concern. It is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (a virus that attacks the liver) that can lead to serious health problems, including liver damage, liver cancer, and death. The virus is transmitted through bodily fluids, such as blood and semen, and can be spread through sexual contact, sharing needles, or from mother to child during birth.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of entecavir compared to no treatment or a placebo in children and adults with chronic hepatitis B. They aimed to determine the effect of entecavir on critical outcomes like death from any cause, how well people can carry out daily activities and enjoy life, and the proportion of people with serious side effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing entecavir with no treatment or a placebo in people with chronic hepatitis B. We summarized the results of the identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 22 studies that involved 2940 people with chronic hepatitis B. The studies were conducted over a period of 5 weeks to 228 weeks. Entecavir may reduce the risk of serious side effects in people with chronic hepatitis B, but we are very uncertain about the results. It is unclear if entecavir has an effect on death from any cause. There is a lack of data on how well people can carry out daily activities and enjoy life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because most trials have a high or unclear risk of bias (the trials may not have been conducted fairly), the studies are very small with few events, and there are insufficient numbers of studies to be confident in the outcome results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
