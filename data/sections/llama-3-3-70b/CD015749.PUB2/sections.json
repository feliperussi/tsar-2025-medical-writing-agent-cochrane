  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of combined treatments (including medication, nutrition, and exercise) for managing cachexia (a condition where the body wastes away due to chronic illness, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, or heart disease) are unclear, and no harmful effects were reported in the available studies.",
    "The review found that multimodal interventions (treatments that combine two or more approaches, such as pharmacology, nutrition, and exercise) may have some effects on symptoms like fatigue, but the evidence is very uncertain and does not allow for firm conclusions.",
    "Future research should focus on conducting methodologically rigorous, well-powered studies with adequate interaction times to assess the effectiveness of multimodal interventions in managing cachexia across different chronic illnesses, and to provide clearer answers to the questions of people with cachexia and their healthcare providers."

      "subheading": "What is cachexia and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome that occurs in people with chronic illnesses, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is characterized by unintentional weight loss, muscle loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, and reduced quality of life. Cachexia is a significant problem because it can lead to a decline in physical function, strength, and overall health, making it difficult for people to perform daily activities and increasing their risk of complications and death."

      "subheading": "What are multimodal interventions and how might they help with cachexia?",
      "content": "Multimodal interventions are treatments that combine two or more different approaches, such as pharmacology, nutrition, and exercise, to manage a condition. In the case of cachexia, multimodal interventions aim to alleviate or stabilize the syndrome by addressing its multiple causes and symptoms. These interventions may include a combination of medications, nutritional supplements, physical therapy, and counseling to help people with cachexia regain weight, improve their physical function, and enhance their quality of life."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions for managing cachexia in people with chronic illnesses. They aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve physical function, strength, quality of life, and other outcomes, and whether they are safe and effective for people with different types of chronic illnesses."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 9 studies that involved 926 adults with a mean age of 63 years. The studies were conducted in several countries, with 6 studies in Europe, and one each in Turkey, New Zealand, and the USA. The studies lasted from 6 weeks to 7 months. Six studies were conducted in people with cancer, and one each in people with COPD, chronic kidney disease, and HIV/AIDS. The interventions compared were multimodal interventions, including pharmacological, nutritional, and/or exercise interventions, compared to treatment as usual, variation of the intervention, or unimodal intervention. The review found insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of multimodal interventions in managing cachexia. It is unclear if multimodal interventions have an effect on outcomes such as physical function, strength, adverse events, body composition, weight, quality of life, appetite, fatigue, and biochemical markers."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and the findings do not cover all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to July 2024."
