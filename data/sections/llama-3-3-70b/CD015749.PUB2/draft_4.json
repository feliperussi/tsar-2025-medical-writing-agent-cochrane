  "draft": "Can combined treatments (including medication, nutrition, and exercise) help manage cachexia (a condition where the body wastes away due to chronic illness) better than a single treatment or standard care?\n\nKey messages:\n- We do not know if combined treatments are better than single treatments or standard care for managing cachexia, because the evidence is not strong enough.\n- Multimodal interventions (treatments that combine two or more approaches, such as medication, nutrition, and exercise) may have some effects on symptoms like fatigue, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- More research is needed to find out if multimodal interventions are effective and safe for people with different types of chronic illnesses.\n\nWhat is cachexia and why is it a problem?\nCachexia is a serious condition that causes the body to waste away due to illnesses like cancer or HIV/AIDS. It's characterized by unintentional weight loss, muscle loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, and reduced quality of life. Cachexia is a significant problem because it can lead to a decline in physical function, strength, and overall health, making it difficult for people to perform daily activities and increasing their risk of complications and death.\n\nWhat are multimodal interventions and how might they help with cachexia?\nMultimodal interventions combine different treatments, like medication, nutrition, and exercise, to help manage conditions. In the case of cachexia, these interventions aim to alleviate or stabilize the condition by addressing its multiple causes and symptoms. They may include a combination of medications, nutritional supplements, physical therapy, and counseling to help people with cachexia regain weight, improve their physical function, and enhance their quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions for managing cachexia in people with chronic illnesses. We aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve physical function, strength, quality of life, and other outcomes, and whether they are safe and effective for people with different types of chronic illnesses.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on multimodal interventions for cachexia management, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the benefits and harms of these interventions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that involved 926 adults with a mean age of 63 years. The studies were conducted in several countries, with 6 studies in Europe, and one each in Turkey, New Zealand, and the USA. The studies lasted from 6 weeks to 7 months. Six studies were conducted in people with cancer, and one each in people with COPD, chronic kidney disease, and HIV/AIDS. The interventions compared were multimodal interventions, including medication, nutrition, and/or exercise interventions, compared to treatment as usual, variation of the intervention, or single treatment. We found insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of multimodal interventions in managing cachexia. It is unclear if multimodal interventions have an effect on outcomes such as physical function, strength, adverse events, body composition, weight, quality of life, appetite, fatigue, and biochemical markers.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small and did not cover all relevant groups or outcomes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.\n\nWe need more research to find out if combined treatments are effective and safe for people with different types of chronic illnesses. The current evidence is not strong enough to support or refute the use of multimodal interventions in managing cachexia.",
