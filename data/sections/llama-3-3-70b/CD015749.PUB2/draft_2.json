  "draft": "Can combined treatments (including medication, nutrition, and exercise) help manage cachexia (a condition where the body wastes away due to chronic illness) better than a single treatment or standard care?\n\nKey messages:\n- We do not know if combined treatments are better than single treatments or standard care for managing cachexia, because the evidence is not strong enough.\n- Multimodal interventions (treatments that combine two or more approaches, such as medication, nutrition, and exercise) may have some effects on symptoms like fatigue, but we are very uncertain about this.\n- More research is needed to find out if multimodal interventions are effective and safe for people with different types of chronic illnesses.\n\nWhat is cachexia and why is it a problem?\nCachexia is a complex condition (a metabolic syndrome) that occurs in people with chronic illnesses, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is characterized by unintentional weight loss, muscle loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, and reduced quality of life. Cachexia is a significant problem because it can lead to a decline in physical function, strength, and overall health, making it difficult for people to perform daily activities and increasing their risk of complications and death.\n\nWhat are multimodal interventions and how might they help with cachexia?\nMultimodal interventions are treatments that combine two or more different approaches, such as medication, nutrition, and exercise, to manage a condition. In the case of cachexia, multimodal interventions aim to alleviate or stabilize the condition by addressing its multiple causes and symptoms. These interventions may include a combination of medications, nutritional supplements, physical therapy, and counseling to help people with cachexia regain weight, improve their physical function, and enhance their quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions for managing cachexia in people with chronic illnesses. We aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve physical function, strength, quality of life, and other outcomes, and whether they are safe and effective for people with different types of chronic illnesses.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies on multimodal interventions for cachexia management, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the benefits and harms of these interventions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that involved 926 adults with a mean age of 63 years. The studies were conducted in several countries, with 6 studies in Europe, and one each in Turkey, New Zealand, and the USA. The studies lasted from 6 weeks to 7 months. Six studies were conducted in people with cancer, and one each in people with COPD, chronic kidney disease, and HIV/AIDS. The interventions compared were multimodal interventions, including medication, nutrition, and/or exercise interventions, compared to treatment as usual, variation of the intervention, or single treatment. We found insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of multimodal interventions in managing cachexia. It is unclear if multimodal interventions have an effect on outcomes such as physical function, strength, adverse events, body composition, weight, quality of life, appetite, fatigue, and biochemical markers.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and the findings do not cover all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft text provided has several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity and readability for patients. Firstly, the sentence \"Cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome that occurs in people with chronic illnesses, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\" is somewhat lengthy and contains technical terms without clear explanations. A suggested rewrite could be: \"What is cachexia? It's a condition where the body wastes away due to chronic illnesses like cancer, HIV/AIDS, or heart disease.\" This simplifies the language and breaks the information into more manageable parts. Secondly, the use of passive voice in several instances, such as \"The review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions for managing cachexia in people with chronic illnesses,\" could be improved by using active voice: \"We wanted to assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions for managing cachexia in people with chronic illnesses.\" Lastly, the metrics show a high number of nouns, complex words, and long words, which can make the text harder to understand. For example, the sentence \"Multimodal interventions are treatments that combine two or more different approaches, such as pharmacology, nutrition, and exercise, to manage a condition.\" could be simplified by using shorter words and more active verbs: \"Multimodal interventions combine different treatments, like medication, nutrition, and exercise, to help manage conditions.\" The PLS evaluation results support these observations, indicating areas such as nominalization, noun count, and readability indices that deviate from typical PLS patterns. Overall, while the draft provides comprehensive information, it requires revisions to improve clarity, readability, and conformity to PLS guidelines.",
