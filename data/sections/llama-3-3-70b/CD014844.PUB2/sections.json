  "key_messages": [
    "Antibiotics given before surgery to remove pregnancy tissue (uterine evacuation) may have little or no effect on preventing infection after the procedure, but the evidence is not strong (low certainty), and more research is needed to confirm this finding.",
    "Prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the risk of uterine infection in women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss, especially when the studies have a low risk of bias, but the quality of the evidence is affected by poor follow-up and high non-compliance with antibiotic prophylaxis.",
    "Future research should focus on high-quality studies that assess the benefits and potential harms of prophylactic antibiotics in uterine evacuation procedures, including their effects on reducing hospitalization for treatment of infection and the need for antibiotic treatment, as well as potential adverse effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, allergy, and anaphylaxis."

      "subheading": "What is early pregnancy loss and how is it managed?",
      "content": "Early pregnancy loss (EPL) is when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation. It can be a difficult and emotional experience for women. Procedural management of EPL involves removing any residual pregnancy tissue from the uterus. This is usually done through a surgical procedure called uterine evacuation. Clinical evidence and guidance are clear that antibiotic treatment is needed for women experiencing EPL with signs and symptoms of infection. However, it is less clear whether prophylactic antibiotics are routinely required during procedural management in those without features of infection."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. They aimed to find out whether prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the risk of uterine infection and other complications after the procedure, and whether they can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment to treat infection. They also wanted to know if prophylactic antibiotics can cause any unwanted effects, such as vomiting, diarrhea, allergy, or anaphylaxis."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 6 studies that involved 4371 people undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. The studies were conducted in various countries, although the specific locations were not detailed. Most studies compared prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment. The population characteristics, such as age and severity of condition, were not explicitly stated in the abstract. The studies did not report on the duration of the interventions, as this information is not typically relevant for procedural management reviews. The funding sources for the studies were also not mentioned. The interventions included routine antibiotic prophylaxis, and the comparisons were made against placebo or no treatment. Prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the risk of uterine infection after uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss, but the evidence is uncertain. Prophylactic antibiotics may make little to no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea, and may increase the risk of allergy, but the evidence is uncertain. Prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the need for antibiotic treatment to treat infection and may reduce hospitalisation for treatment of infection, but the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the trials were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and the studies involved different populations and varied methods of delivering the intervention, leading to heterogeneity and reduced generalizability.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to October 2023."
