  "draft": "# Are antibiotics before surgery to remove pregnancy tissue (uterine evacuation) helpful in preventing infection after the procedure?\n**Key Messages**\n- Antibiotics given before surgery to remove pregnancy tissue (uterine evacuation) may have little or no effect on preventing infection after the procedure, but the evidence is not strong (low certainty), and more research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- Prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the risk of uterine infection in women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss, especially when the studies have a low risk of bias, but the quality of the evidence is affected by poor follow-up and high non-compliance with antibiotic prophylaxis.\n- Future research should focus on high-quality studies that assess the benefits and potential harms of prophylactic antibiotics in uterine evacuation procedures, including their effects on reducing hospitalization for treatment of infection and the need for antibiotic treatment, as well as potential adverse effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, allergy, and anaphylaxis.\n**Introduction**\n### What is early pregnancy loss and how is it managed?\nEarly pregnancy loss (EPL) is when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks of gestation. It can be a difficult and emotional experience for women. Procedural management of EPL involves removing any residual pregnancy tissue from the uterus. This is usually done through a surgical procedure called uterine evacuation. Clinical evidence and guidance are clear that antibiotic treatment is needed for women experiencing EPL with signs and symptoms of infection. However, it is less clear whether prophylactic antibiotics are routinely required during procedural management in those without features of infection.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. They aimed to find out whether prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the risk of uterine infection and other complications after the procedure, and whether they can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment to treat infection. They also wanted to know if prophylactic antibiotics can cause any unwanted effects, such as vomiting, diarrhea, allergy, or anaphylaxis.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 6 studies that involved 4371 people undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss. The studies were conducted in various countries, although the specific locations were not detailed. Most studies compared prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment. The population characteristics, such as age and severity of condition, were not explicitly stated in the abstract. The studies did not report on the duration of the interventions, as this information is not typically relevant for procedural management reviews. The funding sources for the studies were also not mentioned. The interventions included routine antibiotic prophylaxis, and the comparisons were made against placebo or no treatment. Prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the risk of uterine infection after uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss, but the evidence is uncertain. Prophylactic antibiotics may make little to no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea, and may increase the risk of allergy, but the evidence is uncertain. Prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the need for antibiotic treatment to treat infection and may reduce hospitalisation for treatment of infection, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the trials were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and the studies involved different populations and varied methods of delivering the intervention, leading to heterogeneity and reduced generalizability.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains some technical terms without definitions, such as 'prophylactic antibiotics' and 'uterine evacuation procedures', which may confuse readers who are not familiar with medical terminology. For example, the sentence 'Prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the risk of uterine infection after uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss, but the evidence is uncertain' could be rephrased to 'Using antibiotics before surgery to remove pregnancy tissue may help prevent infection, but we are not sure if it works.' Secondly, some sentences are too long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For instance, the sentence 'The review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing uterine evacuation procedures to manage early pregnancy loss, and they aimed to find out whether prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the risk of uterine infection and other complications after the procedure, and whether they can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment to treat infection' could be broken up into simpler sentences. Lastly, the text could benefit from more active voice and concise language. According to the PLS evaluation results, the draft text has a high number of passive voice constructions, complex words, and long words, which contribute to its low readability score. To improve the text, the writer could simplify the language, break up long sentences, and use more active voice. For example, the sentence 'The evidence is limited because the trials were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies involved different populations and varied methods of delivering the intervention' could be rephrased to 'We found that the studies had some limitations, including small sample sizes and different methods, which makes it hard to draw firm conclusions.' Overall, the draft text needs significant revisions to make it clearer and more readable for patients.",
