  "draft": "# Do self-management programs (teaching people skills to manage their condition) improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment (problems with eyesight)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Self-management programs (teaching people skills to manage their condition) may have little to no effect on improving quality of life for adults with visual impairment (problems with eyesight), and we did not find any evidence of harmful effects from these programs.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of self-management interventions for adults with visual impairment, particularly for people with different stages of vision impairment or those with dual-sensory impairment (both vision and hearing problems).\n- Future research should focus on developing more sensitive measures of quality of life and assessing the benefits of self-management interventions across a broader demographic, including different stages of vision impairment and people with dual-sensory impairment, to better inform decision-making for adults with visual impairment.\n**Introduction**\n### What is visual impairment and why is it a problem?\nVisual impairment is a major health concern that affects more than 2200 million people worldwide, predominantly older adults due to age-related ocular diseases. It can lead to functional and psychological decline, emphasizing the need for effective self-management interventions. Self-management interventions aim to enhance individuals' abilities to manage their condition, maintain activities of daily living, and improve overall well-being.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of self-management interventions on quality of life in adults with visual impairment compared with inactive or active control interventions. They aimed to determine whether multifaceted self-management interventions can improve health-related quality of life and vision-related quality of life in adults with visual impairment.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing self-management interventions with inactive or active control interventions in adults with visual impairment, summarized and combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### Cause\nThe agent stopped because it reached the maximum number of iterations allowed for the current task, preventing further processing.\n### Resolution\nConsider simplifying the request, breaking it into smaller steps, or increasing the iteration limit if possible.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by small sample sizes and heterogeneity in the study populations and intervention delivery methods.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",
