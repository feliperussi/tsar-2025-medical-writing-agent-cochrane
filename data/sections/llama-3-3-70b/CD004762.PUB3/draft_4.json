  "draft": "What are the effects of different medicines on muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders?\n\nKey messages:\n- Myotonic disorders, including myotonic dystrophy (a genetic disorder that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting) and non-dystrophic myotonia (a condition that affects the muscle's ability to relax), can cause significant disability due to muscle stiffness (myotonia). \n- We found that mexiletine, a medicine that blocks sodium channels (which help control muscle contractions), likely reduces muscle stiffness in people with non-dystrophic myotonia. \n- However, its effectiveness in people with myotonic dystrophy is less clear, with some improvement in hand grip relaxation time but no clear improvement in overall muscle stiffness. \n- Mexiletine may cause unwanted effects like gastrointestinal symptoms, lethargy, and headache.\n- Lamotrigine, another tested medicine, may improve relaxation time and quality of life in people with myotonic disorders. \n- But the evidence is not as strong as for mexiletine, and it also may cause side effects such as headache, fatigue, and rash.\n\nWhat is myotonia and why is it a problem?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles have trouble relaxing, causing stiffness, cramps, and pain. \nIt can cause significant disability and morbidity in people with myotonic disorders, such as non-dystrophic myotonia and myotonic dystrophy. \nMyotonic dystrophy is a more systemic neuromuscular disorder that can also cause progressive myopathy (muscle disease) and systemic manifestations like arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) and cataracts.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to investigate the efficacy (effectiveness) and tolerability (safety) of drug treatments for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders. \nWe wanted to review evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine which drug treatments are effective in reducing myotonia and improving quality of life, as well as to assess the potential adverse events (side effects) associated with these treatments.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 17 double-blind or single-blind RCTs involving a total of 392 participants, 219 with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 with non-dystrophic myotonia. \nThe primary outcome was participant-reported improvement in clinical myotonia, and secondary outcomes included relaxation time, electromyographic relaxation time, adverse events, and quality of life. \nWe found that mexiletine probably reduces myotonia in people with non-dystrophic myotonia and may improve quality of life. \nHowever, it is unclear if mexiletine has an effect on myotonia in people with myotonic dystrophy. \nLamotrigine may improve relaxation time and quality of life in people with non-dystrophic myotonia, but the evidence is not certain. \nOther medications, such as phenytoin and imipramine, may have little to no effect on myotonia.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

Firstly, the sentence “Myotonic disorders, which include conditions like myotonic dystrophy (a genetic disorder that affects muscle tone and causes muscle wasting) and non-dystrophic myotonia (a condition that affects the muscle’s ability to relax), can cause significant disability due to muscle stiffness (myotonia), and the main question this review aims to answer is what are the effects of different medicines on this stiffness.” is too long and contains technical terms without clear explanations. A suggested rewrite could be: “Myotonic disorders, such as myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonia, cause muscle stiffness. This review looks at how different medicines affect this stiffness.” Secondly, the use of passive voice in several sentences, such as “The review authors aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatments for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders,” should be converted to active voice for better clarity. For example, “We investigated the efficacy and tolerability of drug treatments for people with clinical myotonia due to myotonic disorders.” Lastly, the metrics show a high number of complex words and long words, which can make the text harder to understand. Simplifying these words and breaking down long sentences will improve readability. The PLS evaluation results support these suggestions, indicating areas such as noun usage, gunning fog index, and smog index are beyond the typical PLS patterns, suggesting a need for revision to enhance readability and clarity.",
