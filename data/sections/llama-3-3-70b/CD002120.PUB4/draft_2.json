  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea)?\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progesterone hormones) are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea). However, they can cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding (changes in menstrual cycle), headaches, and nausea (feeling sick to the stomach).\n- The evidence for the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills for treating dysmenorrhoea is based on studies that compared them to placebo (a dummy treatment) or other treatments. The quality of this evidence is generally good, but there is still some uncertainty about the magnitude of the benefits and harms.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the effectiveness and safety of different types of combined oral contraceptive pills, as well as their effects on quality of life and long-term outcomes.\n\nWhat is dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nDysmenorrhoea, also known as painful menstrual cramps, is a common health issue affecting many women. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Dysmenorrhoea is usually treated with pain relievers or hormonal contraceptives, but the effectiveness and potential side effects of these treatments can vary.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) to manage primary dysmenorrhoea. They aimed to determine how effective OCPs are in reducing pain and improving symptoms, as well as the potential risks and side effects associated with their use.\n\nHow did the authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for studies comparing combined oral contraceptive pills with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. No language or date restrictions were applied.\n\nWhat did the authors find?\nWe found 21 studies that involved 3723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies compared combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) with placebo, other OCPs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The combined oral contraceptive pill is effective for treating dysmenorrhoea, but it causes irregular bleeding, and probably headache and nausea. For every 100 people using the combined oral contraceptive pill, between 37 and 60 may experience an improvement in pain, compared to 28 who would experience an improvement with placebo or no treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

For example, the sentence 'The combined oral contraceptive pill is effective for treating dysmenorrhoea, but it causes irregular bleeding, and probably headache and nausea' is problematic because it uses technical terms without definitions and is hard to follow. A suggested rewrite could be 'The birth control pill can help with painful menstrual cramps, but it may cause side effects like irregular periods, headaches, and feeling sick.' Additionally, the metrics show a high number of passive voice constructions and a high Coleman-Liau index, which contribute to the clarity issues. The draft needs revisions to improve readability and clarity.",
