  "plain_title": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progesterone hormones) are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea), but they can cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding (changes in menstrual cycle), headaches, and nausea (feeling sick to the stomach).",
    "The evidence for the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills for treating dysmenorrhoea is based on studies that compared them to placebo (a dummy treatment) or other treatments, and the quality of this evidence is generally good, but there is still some uncertainty about the magnitude of the benefits and harms.",
    "Future research should focus on comparing the effectiveness and safety of different types of combined oral contraceptive pills, as well as their effects on quality of life and long-term outcomes, to provide more comprehensive information for women with dysmenorrhoea and their healthcare providers."

      "subheading": "What is dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Dysmenorrhoea, also known as painful menstrual cramps, is a common health issue affecting many women. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Dysmenorrhoea is usually treated with pain relievers or hormonal contraceptives, but the effectiveness and potential side effects of these treatments can vary."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) to manage primary dysmenorrhoea. They aimed to determine how effective OCPs are in reducing pain and improving symptoms, as well as the potential risks and side effects associated with their use. The authors also compared the effectiveness of different types of OCPs and their regimens to find the best approach for managing dysmenorrhoea."

      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for studies comparing combined oral contraceptive pills with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. No language or date restrictions were applied."

      "subheading": "Eligibility Criteria",
      "content": "Randomised controlled trials enrolling women with primary dysmenorrhoea were eligible if they compared a combined oral contraceptive pill regimen with any other pharmacological or non‑pharmacological intervention and reported pain outcomes."

    {
      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, interventions, outcomes (e.g., visual analogue scale for pain), and adverse events. Meta‑analysis was conducted using a random‑effects model when studies were sufficiently homogeneous."

    {
      "subheading": "Risk of the Bias Assessment",
      "content": "Risk of bias was evaluated with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, considering randomisation, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selective reporting."

      "subheading": "Confidence in the Evidence",
      "content": "The certainty of the evidence for each comparison was rated using the GRADE framework, taking into account study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 21 studies that involved 3723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies compared combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) with placebo, other OCPs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Most studies were conducted in unspecified countries, and the duration of the studies was not explicitly stated. The population characteristics included women with primary dysmenorrhoea, diagnosed by ruling out pelvic pathology through pelvic examination or ultrasound. The studies did not report on the funding sources or the settings in which they took place. The interventions included different types of OCPs, including continuous and standard regimens, and comparisons were made between these interventions and placebo or other treatments. We did not find any studies that compared OCPs with NSAIDs for pain relief. The combined oral contraceptive pill is effective for treating dysmenorrhoea, but it causes irregular bleeding, and probably headache and nausea. For every 100 people using the combined oral contraceptive pill, between 37 and 60 may experience an improvement in pain, compared to 28 who would experience an improvement with placebo or no treatment. The pill may also reduce the need for additional medication and absence from work."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2023."
