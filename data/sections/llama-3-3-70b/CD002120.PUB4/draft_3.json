  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea)?\n- We looked at the evidence on using combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progesterone hormones) to treat painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea). \n- These pills can help with painful menstrual cramps, but they may cause side effects like irregular periods, headaches, and feeling sick.\n- The evidence for the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills for treating dysmenorrhoea is based on studies that compared them to placebo (a dummy treatment) or other treatments. \n\nWhat is dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nDysmenorrhoea, also known as painful menstrual cramps, is a common health issue affecting many women. \n- It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. \n- Dysmenorrhoea is usually treated with pain relievers or hormonal contraceptives, but the effectiveness and potential side effects of these treatments can vary.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) to manage primary dysmenorrhoea. \n- They aimed to determine how effective OCPs are in reducing pain and improving symptoms, as well as the potential risks and side effects associated with their use.\n\nHow did the authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for studies comparing combined oral contraceptive pills with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. \n- No language or date restrictions were applied.\n\nWhat did the authors find?\nWe found 21 studies that involved 3723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. \n- The studies compared combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) with placebo, other OCPs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n- The combined oral contraceptive pill is effective for treating dysmenorrhoea, but it causes irregular bleeding, and probably headache and nausea. \n- For every 100 people using the combined oral contraceptive pill, between 37 and 60 may experience an improvement in pain, compared to 28 who would experience an improvement with placebo or no treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

For example, the sentence 'The combined oral contraceptive pill is effective for treating dysmenorrhoea, but it causes irregular bleeding, and probably headache and nausea' is problematic because it assumes readers are familiar with the term 'dysmenorrhoea' and its treatment. A suggested rewrite could be 'The combined oral contraceptive pill can help with painful menstrual cramps, but it may cause side effects like irregular periods, headaches, and feeling sick.' Additionally, the draft has 18 instances of passive voice, which can make the text harder to follow. The metrics also show that the draft has a high number of complex words and long sentences, which can reduce readability. To improve, the writer should simplify the language, break up long sentences, and provide more context for technical terms.",

However, the metrics also highlight some areas for improvement, including the use of passive voice, complex words, and long sentences. The writer should focus on simplifying the language and improving clarity to make the text more readable for patients."
