  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea)?\nWe looked at the evidence on using combined oral contraceptive pills to treat painful menstrual cramps, also known as dysmenorrhoea. These pills contain both estrogen and progesterone hormones. They can help with painful menstrual cramps, but may cause side effects like irregular periods, headaches, and feeling sick.\n\nWhat is dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nDysmenorrhoea, or painful menstrual cramps, is a common health issue affecting many women. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Dysmenorrhoea is usually treated with pain relievers or hormonal contraceptives, but the effectiveness and potential side effects of these treatments can vary.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using combined oral contraceptive pills to manage primary dysmenorrhoea. We aimed to determine how effective these pills are in reducing pain and improving symptoms, as well as the potential risks and side effects associated with their use.\n\nHow did the authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for studies comparing combined oral contraceptive pills with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. No language or date restrictions were applied.\n\nWhat did the authors find?\nWe found 21 studies that involved 3723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies compared combined oral contraceptive pills with placebo, other pills, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Combined oral contraceptive pills are effective for treating dysmenorrhoea, but they cause irregular bleeding, and probably headache and nausea. For every 100 people using these pills, between 37 and 60 may experience an improvement in pain, compared to 28 who would experience an improvement with placebo or no treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nKey messages:\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps, but they can cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea.\n- The evidence for the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills for treating dysmenorrhoea is based on studies that compared them to placebo or other treatments, and the quality of this evidence is generally good, but there is still some uncertainty about the magnitude of the benefits and harms.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the effectiveness and safety of different types of combined oral contraceptive pills, as well as their effects on quality of life and long-term outcomes, to provide more comprehensive information for women with dysmenorrhoea and their healthcare providers.",
