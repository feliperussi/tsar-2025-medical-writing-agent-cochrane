  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea)?\n- We looked at the evidence on using combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progesterone hormones) to treat painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea), which is also known as painful cramps in the lower abdomen.\n- These pills can help with painful menstrual cramps, but they may cause side effects like irregular periods, headaches, and feeling sick.\n- The evidence for the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills for treating dysmenorrhoea is based on studies that compared them to placebo (a dummy treatment) or other treatments.\n\nWhat is dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\n- Dysmenorrhoea (painful menstrual cramps) is a common health issue affecting many women, characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen.\n- It can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities.\n- Dysmenorrhoea is usually treated with pain relievers or hormonal contraceptives, but the effectiveness and potential side effects of these treatments can vary.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\n- The authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) to manage primary dysmenorrhoea.\n- They aimed to determine how effective OCPs are in reducing pain and improving symptoms, as well as the potential risks and side effects associated with their use.\n\nHow did the authors search for evidence?\n- We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for studies comparing combined oral contraceptive pills with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea.\n- No language or date restrictions were applied.\n\nWhat did the authors find?\n- We found 21 studies that involved 3723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea.\n- The studies compared combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) with placebo, other OCPs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n- The combined oral contraceptive pill is effective for treating dysmenorrhoea, but it causes irregular bleeding, and probably headache and nausea.\n- For every 100 people using the combined oral contraceptive pill, between 37 and 60 may experience an improvement in pain, compared to 28 who would experience an improvement with placebo or no treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n- The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\n- The evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nKey messages:\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progesterone hormones) are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea), but they can cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding (changes in menstrual cycle), headaches, and nausea (feeling sick to the stomach).\n- The evidence for the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills for treating dysmenorrhoea is based on studies that compared them to placebo (a dummy treatment) or other treatments, and the quality of this evidence is generally good, but there is still some uncertainty about the magnitude of the benefits and harms.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the effectiveness and safety of different types of combined oral contraceptive pills, as well as their effects on quality of life and long-term outcomes, to provide more comprehensive information for women with dysmenorrhoea and their healthcare providers.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains some technical terms without definitions, such as \"dysmenorrhoea\" and \"NSAIDs\", which may confuse readers who are not familiar with these terms. For example, the sentence \"Dysmenorrhoea (painful menstrual cramps) is a common health issue affecting many women\" could be rephrased to \"Painful menstrual cramps, also known as dysmenorrhoea, are a common health issue affecting many women\" to provide a clearer definition. Secondly, some sentences are too long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For instance, the sentence \"The authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) to manage primary dysmenorrhoea, and they aimed to determine how effective OCPs are in reducing pain and improving symptoms, as well as the potential risks and side effects associated with their use\" could be broken up into two simpler sentences: \"The authors of this review wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) to manage primary dysmenorrhoea. They aimed to determine how effective OCPs are in reducing pain and improving symptoms, as well as the potential risks and side effects associated with their use.\" Thirdly, the text could benefit from more active voice constructions. For example, the sentence \"The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies\" could be rephrased to \"We found that the evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity across studies\" to make it more engaging and clear. Lastly, the text contains some wordy phrases that could be simplified. For instance, the phrase \"due to the fact that\" could be replaced with \"because\" to make the text more concise. The PLS evaluation results support these suggestions, showing that the text has a high number of passive voice constructions, complex words, and long sentences, which contribute to its low readability score. Overall, the draft text needs significant revisions to improve its clarity, readability, and conformity to typical PLS patterns.",
