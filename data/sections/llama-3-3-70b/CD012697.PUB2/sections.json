  "key_messages": [
    "Magnetic seizure therapy (a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic fields to induce seizures) may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT, a treatment that uses electricity to induce seizures) for people with schizophrenia, but the evidence is very limited and of low quality, so we are not sure if this is really the case.",
    "The available study suggests that magnetic seizure therapy might cause fewer unwanted effects, such as delayed memory deficit and cognitive deterioration, compared to ECT, but again, this finding is based on very low-quality evidence.",
    "More well-designed studies are needed to determine the true effects and potential benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia, as the current evidence is not reliable enough to inform treatment decisions."

      "content": "Schizophrenia is a common and disabling mental disorder that affects about 1% of the population. It can cause hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and a lack of motivation, making everyday life challenging. About 20% of people with schizophrenia do not respond to antipsychotics, which are the main treatment for schizophrenia, and need to seek other treatment options."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST) for people with schizophrenia. They aimed to compare MST with other treatments, such as Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), to see if it can improve symptoms and quality of life for people with schizophrenia."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found one study that involved 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy (MST) plus standard care to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care. The study was conducted in an unspecified country and setting. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The study funding sources were also not mentioned. The intervention types were MST and ECT, and the comparison was between these two interventions. No other studies were found that compared MST to other interventions for people with schizophrenia. Magnetic seizure therapy may cause a large reduction in delayed memory deficit and cognitive deterioration in people with schizophrenia. However, it is unclear if magnetic seizure therapy has an effect on the global state, positive symptoms, and negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia. We do not know if magnetic seizure therapy has an effect on leaving the study early due to any reason, adverse effects, or inefficacy."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation, by incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies, and by the small sample sizes of the trials, which reduce statistical power and precision.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2022."
