  "draft": "Is magnetic seizure therapy as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia?\nWe looked at whether magnetic seizure therapy (a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic fields to induce seizures) is as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT, a treatment that uses electricity to induce seizures) for people with schizophrenia.\n\n- Magnetic seizure therapy may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia, but the evidence is very limited and of low quality.\n- The available study suggests that magnetic seizure therapy might cause fewer unwanted effects, such as delayed memory deficit and cognitive deterioration, compared to ECT.\n- More well-designed studies are needed to determine the true effects and potential benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat is schizophrenia and why is it a problem?\nSchizophrenia is a common and disabling mental disorder that affects about 1% of the population. It can cause hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there), delusions (believing things that are not true), disorganized thinking, and a lack of motivation, making everyday life challenging. About 20% of people with schizophrenia do not respond to antipsychotics (the main treatment for schizophrenia) and need to seek other treatment options.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the efficacy (how well a treatment works) and tolerability (how well a treatment is accepted by patients) of Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST) for people with schizophrenia. They aimed to compare MST with other treatments, such as Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), to see if it can improve symptoms and quality of life for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy (MST) plus standard care to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care. Magnetic seizure therapy may cause a large reduction in delayed memory deficit and cognitive deterioration in people with schizophrenia. However, it is unclear if magnetic seizure therapy has an effect on the global state, positive symptoms, and negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential performance bias (when participants know which treatment they are receiving) and by incomplete reporting of outcomes across studies. The small sample sizes of the trials also reduce statistical power and precision.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

For example, the sentence 'Magnetic seizure therapy may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia, but the evidence is very limited and of low quality.' is unclear because it does not define what 'low quality' means in this context. A suggested rewrite could be 'Magnetic seizure therapy may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia, but the current evidence is based on only one study and has significant limitations.' Another issue is the use of passive voice, such as in the sentence 'The evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation.' A suggested rewrite could be 'We found that the evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they were receiving.' The PLS evaluation results show that the draft text has a high number of nouns and a low number of pronouns, which can make the text harder to read. The results also show that the text has a good readability score, but there are still areas for improvement to make the text more concise and clear.",

However, there are some areas for improvement, such as reducing the number of nouns and increasing the use of pronouns. The results also show that the text has a high number of complex words and long words, which can make the text harder to read. Overall, the draft text needs some revisions to improve its clarity and readability."
