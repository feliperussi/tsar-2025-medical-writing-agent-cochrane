It is commonly used in preterm neonates for primary respiratory support, either to avoid or prior to the use of mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube, for prophylaxis or treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS is a condition that can cause breathing difficulties in preterm infants due to a lack of surfactant, a substance that helps lungs expand and contract properly.\nWhat are the potential benefits and harms of nasal high flow therapy in preterm infants?\nWhile nHF therapy may be beneficial for preterm infants, its use also carries potential risks. For instance, it may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours of trial entry, but it may also reduce the risk of nasal trauma and pneumothorax compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support like continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Understanding the balance of these benefits and harms is crucial for making informed decisions about the care of preterm infants.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about nasal high flow therapy in preterm infants?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of nHF therapy for primary respiratory support in preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. Specifically, they wanted to assess the effectiveness of nHF in reducing the risk of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and other complications, as well as its impact on the need for mechanical ventilation and the incidence of treatment failure within 72 hours of trial entry.\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies were conducted to compare nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as continuous positive airway pressure and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation. The population characteristics included preterm infants born less than 37 weeks' gestation with respiratory distress soon after birth. The studies differed in the comparator treatment, devices for delivering nasal high flow, and gas flows used. Some studies allowed the use of 'rescue' continuous positive airway pressure in the event of nasal high flow treatment failure, prior to any mechanical ventilation, and some allowed surfactant administration via the INSURE technique without this being deemed treatment failure. The studies included very few extremely preterm infants less than 28 weeks' gestation. We found no studies examining the comparison of nasal high flow with ambient oxygen or low flow nasal cannulae.\nMain results: Nasal high flow therapy for preterm infants\nNasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia for preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. However, it may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours of trial entry. Nasal high flow therapy likely results in less nasal trauma and a reduction in pneumothorax compared to continuous positive airway pressure. The evidence is generally uncertain for extremely preterm infants less than 28 weeks' gestation.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were conducted in different types of people and used different delivery methods, were very small, and were not randomized, so any observed differences could be due to differences between participants rather than the interventions themselves.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",
