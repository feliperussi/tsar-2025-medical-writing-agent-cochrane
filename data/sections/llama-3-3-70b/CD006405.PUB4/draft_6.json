  "draft": "Is nasal high flow therapy as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe?\n\nWe compared nasal high flow therapy with other non-invasive methods, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) - a treatment that delivers air into the airways to keep them open - and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) - a treatment that delivers bursts of air into the airways to help breathing. We looked at how these methods help preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks of gestation) breathe.\n\nNasal high flow therapy may be as effective as these methods, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy may result in more treatment failures - when the treatment does not work and the baby needs more intensive care - within 72 hours. However, it may also reduce the risk of pneumothorax - a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall - and nasal trauma - injury to the nose.\n\nWhat is nasal high flow therapy and how is it used in preterm infants?\nNasal high flow therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support that provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs. We use it to help preterm infants breathe, either to avoid or before using mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube. This is for prophylaxis or treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) - a condition that can cause breathing difficulties in preterm infants due to a lack of surfactant, a substance that helps lungs expand and contract properly.\n\nWhat are the potential benefits and harms of nasal high flow therapy in preterm infants?\nWhile nasal high flow therapy may be beneficial, it also carries potential risks. For instance, it may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours. But it may also reduce the risk of nasal trauma and pneumothorax compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support like CPAP or NIPPV.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about nasal high flow therapy in preterm infants?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of nasal high flow therapy for primary respiratory support in preterm infants. They compared it to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. Specifically, they wanted to assess its effectiveness in reducing the risk of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) - a condition that can cause breathing difficulties in preterm infants - and other complications.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. These studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as CPAP and NIPPV. The population characteristics included preterm infants born less than 37 weeks' gestation with respiratory distress soon after birth.\n\nMain results: Nasal high flow therapy for preterm infants\nNasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or BPD for preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. However, it may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours. Nasal high flow therapy likely results in less nasal trauma and a reduction in pneumothorax compared to CPAP.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were conducted in different types of people and used different delivery methods. They were very small and not randomized, so any observed differences could be due to differences between participants rather than the interventions themselves.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Nasal high flow therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy may result in more treatment failures within 72 hours, but it may also reduce the risk of pneumothorax and nasal trauma.\n- Future research should focus on studying the effects of nasal high flow therapy in extremely preterm infants, as there is currently a lack of evidence in this population, and on comparing the long-term benefits and harms of different non-invasive respiratory support methods for preterm infants.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity and readability for patients. Firstly, the text contains unexplained jargon and technical terms without definitions, such as \"nasal high flow therapy\" and \"bronchopulmonary dysplasia,\" which could confuse readers. For instance, the sentence \"Nasal high flow therapy may be as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe\" does not explain what nasal high flow therapy is. A suggested rewrite could be \"Nasal high flow therapy, a treatment that provides heated, humidified air and oxygen through small nasal prongs, may be as effective as other non-invasive methods for helping preterm infants breathe.\" Secondly, some sentences are longer than 30 words and are hard to follow, such as \"The review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of nasal high flow therapy for primary respiratory support in preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support.\" This could be simplified to \"The review authors compared the benefits and harms of nasal high flow therapy to other non-invasive respiratory support methods for preterm infants.\" Lastly, the text has excessive passive voice, which obscures who did what, and noun-heavy sentences that should use more verbs. For example, \"The evidence is limited because the studies were conducted in different types of people and used different delivery methods\" could be rewritten as \"We found that the evidence is limited because the studies involved different populations and used various delivery methods.\" The PLS evaluation results support these suggestions, showing high rates of passive voice, nominalization, and complex words, which contribute to the clarity issues. Therefore, the draft text is not approved due to these significant clarity issues and style problems that reduce readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 38.9% of features in the best quartile (P25/P75) and 22.2% beyond the 90th percentile. The results show high rates of passive voice, nominalization, and complex words, which contribute to the clarity issues. The text also has high rates of nouns and long words, which can make it harder to read. Overall, the results suggest that the draft text needs significant revisions to improve clarity and readability for patients."
