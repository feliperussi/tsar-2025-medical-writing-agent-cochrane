  "key_messages": [
    "Nasal high flow therapy (a treatment that provides heated, humidified air and oxygen through small nasal prongs) may be as effective as other non-invasive methods, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (a treatment that delivers air into the airways to keep them open) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) (a treatment that delivers bursts of air into the airways to help breathing), for helping preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks of gestation) breathe, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.",
    "Compared to CPAP, nasal high flow therapy may result in more treatment failures (when the treatment does not work and the baby needs more intensive care) within 72 hours, but it may also reduce the risk of pneumothorax (a condition where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) and nasal trauma (injury to the nose); however, the quality of the evidence is limited, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.",
    "Future research should focus on studying the effects of nasal high flow therapy in extremely preterm infants (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation), as there is currently a lack of evidence in this population, and on comparing the long-term benefits and harms of different non-invasive respiratory support methods for preterm infants."

      "subheading": "What is nasal high flow therapy and how is it used in preterm infants?",
      "content": "Nasal high flow (nHF) therapy is a type of non-invasive respiratory support that provides heated, humidified air and oxygen to preterm infants through two small nasal prongs. It is commonly used in preterm neonates for primary respiratory support, either to avoid or prior to the use of mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube, for prophylaxis or treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS is a condition that can cause breathing difficulties in preterm infants due to a lack of surfactant, a substance that helps lungs expand and contract properly."

      "subheading": "What are the potential benefits and harms of nasal high flow therapy in preterm infants?",
      "content": "While nHF therapy may be beneficial for preterm infants, its use also carries potential risks. For instance, it may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours of trial entry, but it may also reduce the risk of nasal trauma and pneumothorax compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support like continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Understanding the balance of these benefits and harms is crucial for making informed decisions about the care of preterm infants."

      "content": "The review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of nHF therapy for primary respiratory support in preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. Specifically, they wanted to assess the effectiveness of nHF in reducing the risk of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and other complications, as well as its impact on the need for mechanical ventilation and the incidence of treatment failure within 72 hours of trial entry."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 13 studies that involved 2540 preterm infants. The studies were conducted to compare nasal high flow therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, such as continuous positive airway pressure and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation. The population characteristics included preterm infants born less than 37 weeks' gestation with respiratory distress soon after birth. The studies differed in the comparator treatment, devices for delivering nasal high flow, and gas flows used. Some studies allowed the use of 'rescue' continuous positive airway pressure in the event of nasal high flow treatment failure, prior to any mechanical ventilation, and some allowed surfactant administration via the INSURE technique without this being deemed treatment failure. The studies included very few extremely preterm infants less than 28 weeks' gestation. We found no studies examining the comparison of nasal high flow with ambient oxygen or low flow nasal cannulae."

      "subheading": "Main results: Nasal high flow therapy for preterm infants",
      "content": "Nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference in the risk of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia for preterm infants compared to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support. However, it may increase the risk of treatment failure within 72 hours of trial entry. Nasal high flow therapy likely results in less nasal trauma and a reduction in pneumothorax compared to continuous positive airway pressure. The evidence is generally uncertain for extremely preterm infants less than 28 weeks' gestation."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were conducted in different types of people and used different delivery methods, were very small, and were not randomized, so any observed differences could be due to differences between participants rather than the interventions themselves.",
