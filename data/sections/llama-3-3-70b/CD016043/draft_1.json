  "draft": "# What are the best ways to provide eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems (refractive errors)?\n**Key Messages**\n- The best ways to provide eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems (refractive errors) include school-based, pharmacy, and outreach models, as well as vision centre, health centre, and a combination of vision or health centre and door-to-door delivery approaches, although the effectiveness of these approaches is not well established due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- Further evaluation of the effectiveness of these service-delivery approaches is needed to better inform their application, particularly in regions where few approaches have been reported, such as the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region.\n- Future research should focus on assessing the benefits and potential harms of different service-delivery approaches, including their cost-effectiveness and feasibility in various settings, to guide the strengthening of refractive and optical services at community and primary care levels.\n**Introduction**\n## What is uncorrected refractive error and why is it a problem?\nUncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. It occurs when the shape of the eye doesn't allow light to focus correctly on the retina, resulting in blurry vision. This condition can be managed with appropriate spectacle correction, but many people, especially in low-resource settings, do not have access to eye care services. As a result, uncorrected refractive error can significantly impact daily life, affecting education, work, and overall well-being.\n## What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the range of approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings. They also wanted to identify the methods used to evaluate these approaches, in order to inform the development of technical guidance for improving refractive error services globally.\n**Methods**\n## Methods\nWe searched for studies on approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services, summarized their results, and evaluated the effectiveness of these approaches to inform improvements in testing and correction of refractive error.\n**Results**\n## What did we find?\nWe found 175 studies that involved delivery approaches for refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings. The studies were conducted in various countries around the world, with the school-based and outreach approaches being predominant in community care, while the vision-centre approach was mainly used in primary care. The World Health Organization Vision and Eye Care Programme supported this scoping review, and the protocol was published in the Open Source Framework. The total number of people who took part is not reported, and the duration of the studies is also not specified. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, are not provided, but the studies included preschool and school-aged children and adults. The study settings included countries in the WHO African region, the Americas, and the Eastern Mediterranean region, with prominent gaps existing in the evaluation of the approaches. The review found that there are various approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings, including school-based, pharmacy, and outreach models. However, there is a lack of evaluation of these approaches, and few studies have attempted to assess their effectiveness. The review highlights the need for further evaluation to inform the application of these service-delivery approaches.\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because few studies attempted to evaluate the approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

The main issues include high complexity metrics such as flesch_kincaid_grade, automated_readability_index, gunning_fog_index, lix, rix, smog_index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words, all of which are beyond the 90th percentile or higher. Additionally, the draft has high noun usage and low pronoun usage. To address these issues, it is suggested to reduce sentence length, use simpler vocabulary, and increase the use of active voice and pronouns. Furthermore, breaking up long sentences and paragraphs, and using more concise language will also improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show significant deviation from typical patterns, with 12 features deviating from the expected ranges. The draft has a high word count per sentence, high nominalization, and high usage of complex words, which contribute to its low readability scores. Revision is necessary to improve clarity, readability, and conformity to PLS guidelines."
