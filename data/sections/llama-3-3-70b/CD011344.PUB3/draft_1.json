It involves administering local anaesthetics, such as bupivacaine or ropivacaine, and sometimes opioids, like fentanyl, into the epidural space around the spine. This helps block pain signals from the abdomen, pelvis, and perineum, providing significant pain relief. Epidural analgesia can be administered through different methods, including continuous infusion (basal infusion) or automated mandatory bolus (AMB), where medications are injected at set intervals. Patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) allows patients to self-administer additional doses as needed. Effective pain management during labour is crucial for the well-being of both the mother and the baby.\n### What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of different epidural analgesia methods?\nThe choice between automated mandatory bolus (AMB) and basal infusion (BI) for epidural analgesia can impact the effectiveness of pain relief and the incidence of side effects. AMB may offer more consistent pain control by delivering medication at regular intervals, potentially reducing the need for additional interventions by anaesthesiologists. However, the optimal method must balance pain relief with the risk of adverse effects, such as caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, prolonged labour, and local anaesthetic consumption. Understanding the differences between these methods is essential for improving labour outcomes.\n### What did the review authors aim to find out about automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion for epidural analgesia?\nThe review authors sought to compare the benefits and harms of using automated mandatory bolus (AMB) versus basal infusion (BI) for maintaining epidural analgesia during labour. Specifically, they aimed to assess how these methods affect the incidence of breakthrough pain, the need for anaesthesiologist intervention, the rate of caesarean and instrumental deliveries, the duration of labour, local anaesthetic consumption, maternal satisfaction, and neonatal outcomes. By evaluating existing research, the authors aimed to provide evidence on which method is more effective and safer for women in labour.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing automated mandatory bolus with basal infusion for labour epidural analgesia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 4590 women. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, with different techniques used to initiate epidural analgesia, including combined spinal epidural and epidural only. The population characteristics included healthy nulliparous women and healthy nulli- and multiparous women, with all studies excluding women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The types of interventions and comparisons included automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion for maintaining labour epidural analgesia. The studies assessed various outcomes, including incidence of breakthrough pain, caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery: duration of labour analgesia, and maternal satisfaction.\n### Main results: Labour Epidural Analgesia\nAutomated mandatory bolus probably reduces the incidence of breakthrough pain and probably reduces the hourly consumption of local anaesthetics compared to basal infusion for maintaining labour epidural analgesia in women at term. Automated mandatory bolus may improve maternal satisfaction. However, automated mandatory bolus probably makes little to no difference to the incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, duration of labour analgesia, and neonatal Apgar scores.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods, which reduces precision and introduces indirectness.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.",
