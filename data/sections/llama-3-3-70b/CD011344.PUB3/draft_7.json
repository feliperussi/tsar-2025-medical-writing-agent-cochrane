  "draft": "Is automated mandatory bolus better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia?\n\nWe compared two methods of giving pain relief medication during labor: automated mandatory bolus and continuous infusion. Automated mandatory bolus gives medication at set time intervals, while continuous infusion gives medication all the time.\n\n- Automated mandatory bolus may be better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia. It is associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain (pain that is not controlled by the medication) and reduced use of local anesthetics (medications that numb the area).\n- However, there is no significant difference in the incidence of caesarean delivery (delivery of a baby through surgical incision) or instrumental delivery (use of forceps or vacuum devices to assist delivery) between the two methods.\n- The quality of evidence is moderate, meaning that while there is some evidence to support the use of automated mandatory bolus, it is not strong enough to be considered conclusive.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and why is it important for pain relief during labor?\nEpidural analgesia is a type of pain relief commonly used during labor and childbirth. It involves administering local anesthetics (medications that numb the area) and sometimes opioids (strong pain relievers) into the epidural space around the spine. This helps block pain signals from the abdomen, pelvis, and perineum, providing significant pain relief.\n\nWhat are the potential benefits and drawbacks of different epidural analgesia methods?\nThe choice between automated mandatory bolus and continuous infusion for epidural analgesia can impact the effectiveness of pain relief and the incidence of side effects. Automated mandatory bolus may offer more consistent pain control by delivering medication at regular intervals, potentially reducing the need for additional interventions by anesthesiologists.\n\nWhat did the review authors aim to find out about automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion for epidural analgesia?\nThe review authors sought to compare the benefits and harms of using automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion for maintaining epidural analgesia during labor. They aimed to assess how these methods affect the incidence of breakthrough pain, the need for anesthesiologist intervention, the rate of caesarean and instrumental deliveries, the duration of labor, local anesthetic consumption, maternal satisfaction, and neonatal outcomes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 4590 women. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, with different techniques used to initiate epidural analgesia. The population characteristics included healthy nulliparous women and healthy nulli- and multiparous women, with all studies excluding women with preterm or complicated pregnancies.\n\nMain results: Labor Epidural Analgesia\nAutomated mandatory bolus probably reduces the incidence of breakthrough pain and probably reduces the hourly consumption of local anesthetics compared to basal infusion for maintaining labor epidural analgesia in women at term. Automated mandatory bolus may improve maternal satisfaction. However, automated mandatory bolus probably makes little to no difference to the incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, duration of labor analgesia, and neonatal Apgar scores.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods, which reduces precision and introduces indirectness.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Automated mandatory bolus may be better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia, as it is associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain and reduced use of local anesthetics.\n- However, there is no significant difference in the incidence of caesarean delivery or instrumental delivery between the two methods.\n- The quality of evidence is moderate, meaning that while there is some evidence to support the use of automated mandatory bolus, it is not strong enough to be considered conclusive.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as the variation in techniques and medications used, and assessing the long-term effects of automated mandatory bolus on mothers and babies.",

For example, the sentence 'Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the incidence of breakthrough pain and probably reduces the hourly consumption of local anaesthetics compared to basal infusion for maintaining labour epidural analgesia in women at term' is hard to follow and contains technical terms without definitions. A suggested rewrite could be 'Using automated mandatory bolus instead of continuous infusion may lower the risk of breakthrough pain and reduce the amount of pain medication needed during labor.' Additionally, the metrics show high rates of passive voice, nominalization, and complex words, which contribute to the clarity issues. The flesch reading ease score is also very low, indicating that the text is difficult to read.",

The automated readability index, gunning fog index, and smog index are also higher than typical, indicating that the text is harder to read than usual.
