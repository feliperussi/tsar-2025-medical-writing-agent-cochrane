  "key_messages": [
    "Automated mandatory bolus (a way of giving pain relief medication at set time intervals) may be better than continuous infusion (giving medication all the time) for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia (a type of pain relief given through a tube in the back), as it is associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain (pain that is not controlled by the medication) and reduced use of local anesthetics (medications that numb the area), but there is no significant difference in the incidence of caesarean delivery (delivery of a baby through surgical incision) or instrumental delivery (use of forceps or vacuum devices to assist delivery).",
    "The quality of evidence is moderate, meaning that while there is some evidence to support the use of automated mandatory bolus, it is not strong enough to be considered conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand its benefits and harms.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as the variation in techniques and medications used, and assessing the long-term effects of automated mandatory bolus on mothers and babies, in order to provide more definitive answers to the question of whether automated mandatory bolus is better than continuous infusion for managing pain during labor with epidural analgesia."

      "subheading": "What is epidural analgesia and why is it important for pain relief during labour?",
      "content": "Epidural analgesia is a type of pain relief commonly used during labour and childbirth. It involves administering local anaesthetics, such as bupivacaine or ropivacaine, and sometimes opioids, like fentanyl, into the epidural space around the spine. This helps block pain signals from the abdomen, pelvis, and perineum, providing significant pain relief. Epidural analgesia can be administered through different methods, including continuous infusion (basal infusion) or automated mandatory bolus (AMB), where medications are injected at set intervals. Patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) allows patients to self-administer additional doses as needed. Effective pain management during labour is crucial for the well-being of both the mother and the baby."

      "subheading": "What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of different epidural analgesia methods?",
      "content": "The choice between automated mandatory bolus (AMB) and basal infusion (BI) for epidural analgesia can impact the effectiveness of pain relief and the incidence of side effects. AMB may offer more consistent pain control by delivering medication at regular intervals, potentially reducing the need for additional interventions by anaesthesiologists. However, the optimal method must balance pain relief with the risk of adverse effects, such as caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, prolonged labour, and local anaesthetic consumption. Understanding the differences between these methods is essential for improving labour outcomes."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors aim to find out about automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion for epidural analgesia?",
      "content": "The review authors sought to compare the benefits and harms of using automated mandatory bolus (AMB) versus basal infusion (BI) for maintaining epidural analgesia during labour. Specifically, they aimed to assess how these methods affect the incidence of breakthrough pain, the need for anaesthesiologist intervention, the rate of caesarean and instrumental deliveries, the duration of labour, local anaesthetic consumption, maternal satisfaction, and neonatal outcomes. By evaluating existing research, the authors aimed to provide evidence on which method is more effective and safer for women in labour."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 18 studies that involved 4590 women. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, with different techniques used to initiate epidural analgesia, including combined spinal epidural and epidural only. The population characteristics included healthy nulliparous women and healthy nulli- and multiparous women, with all studies excluding women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The types of interventions and comparisons included automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion for maintaining labour epidural analgesia. The studies assessed various outcomes, including incidence of breakthrough pain, caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery: duration of labour analgesia, and maternal satisfaction."

      "content": "Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the incidence of breakthrough pain and probably reduces the hourly consumption of local anaesthetics compared to basal infusion for maintaining labour epidural analgesia in women at term. Automated mandatory bolus may improve maternal satisfaction. However, automated mandatory bolus probably makes little to no difference to the incidence of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, duration of labour analgesia, and neonatal Apgar scores."
