  "draft": "# Does closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias?\n**Key Messages**\n- Closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery (a surgical procedure that involves creating a small stomach pouch and rerouting the small intestine) may reduce the incidence of internal hernia (a condition where part of the intestine bulges through a weakened area in the abdominal wall) with bowel obstruction (a blockage that prevents the normal flow of food, fluid, and gas, which can lead to severe complications) within 10 years, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- The closure of defects may not make a difference in the incidence of postoperative overall complications (problems that occur after surgery), postoperative mortality (death after surgery), or intraoperative overall complications (problems that occur during surgery), but again, the evidence is limited.\n- Future research should focus on conducting and well-designed studies with larger sample sizes to provide more reliable estimates of the benefits and potential harms of defect closure during gastric bypass surgery, including its effects on long-term outcomes and different subgroups of patients.\n**Introduction**\n### What is internal hernia and why is it a problem after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery?\nInternal hernia is a serious complication that can occur in people who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, a common type of weight-loss surgery. During RYGB, the stomach is made smaller and the small intestine is rerouted, which can create defects or holes in the mesentery, a fold of tissue that attaches the intestine to the back of the abdominal wall. If these defects are not closed, they can lead to internal hernias, where part of the intestine bulges through the defect, causing bowel obstruction, severe abdominal pain, and other life‑threatening complications.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about closing mesenteric defects during RYGB surgery?\nThe review authors wanted to determine whether closing the mesenteric defects during RYGB surgery can prevent internal hernias and other complications, such as bowel obstruction, postoperative mortality, and intraoperative complications. They also aimed to assess the potential benefits and harms of defect closure, including the impact on hospital stay and postoperative pain.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing defect closure with non-closure after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 3010 people with obesity who underwent laparoscopic or robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in bariatric surgery. The studies compared the closure of defects with the non-closure of defects. The population characteristics included people with obesity, defined as a body-mass index (BMI) µ 35 kg/m². The studies did not report on the age, gender, or severity of condition of the participants. The studies were conducted in unspecified countries. The types of interventions included non-absorbable, interrupt closure in one study, and non-absorbable running sutures in two studies. The funding sources were not dedicated, as this Cochrane review had no dedicated funding. The closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia. However, it may make little to no difference in the risk of postoperative complications or mortality. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes and an insufficient number of studies, resulting in low confidence in the outcomes.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",
