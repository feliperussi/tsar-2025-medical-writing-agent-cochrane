  "draft": "Does closing holes in the tissue (defects) during gastric bypass surgery help prevent internal hernias?\n\nWe looked at whether closing defects during gastric bypass surgery can prevent internal hernias and other complications. \n\n- Closing defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Closing defects may not make a difference in the risk of complications after surgery, death after surgery, or problems during surgery, but the evidence is limited.\n- Future research should focus on well-designed studies with larger sample sizes to provide more reliable estimates of the benefits and potential harms of defect closure.\n\nWhat is internal hernia and why is it a problem after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery?\nInternal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, a common type of weight-loss surgery. During RYGB, the stomach is made smaller and the small intestine is rerouted, creating defects or holes in the mesentery, a fold of tissue that attaches the intestine to the back of the abdominal wall. If these defects are not closed, they can lead to internal hernias, where part of the intestine bulges through the defect, causing bowel obstruction (a blockage that prevents the normal flow of food, fluid, and gas), severe abdominal pain, and other life-threatening complications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about closing mesenteric defects during RYGB surgery?\nThe review authors wanted to determine whether closing the mesenteric defects during RYGB surgery can prevent internal hernias and other complications, such as bowel obstruction, death after surgery, and problems during surgery. They also aimed to assess the potential benefits and harms of defect closure, including the impact on hospital stay and pain after surgery.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 3010 people with obesity who underwent laparoscopic or robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in bariatric surgery. The studies compared the closure of defects with the non-closure of defects. The closure of defects during gastric bypass surgery may reduce the risk of internal hernia. However, it may make little to no difference in the risk of complications after surgery or death after surgery. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes and an insufficient number of studies, resulting in low confidence in the outcomes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",
