  "draft": "Does tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone (a hormone that helps eggs grow in the ovaries) based on a woman's ovarian reserve (the ability of her ovaries to produce eggs) improve the chances of having a baby with in vitro fertilization (IVF, a type of fertility treatment where an egg is fertilized outside the body)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We are unsure if tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone based on a woman's ovarian reserve improves the chances of having a baby with IVF.\n- Using markers of ovarian reserve to individualize the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone does not seem to increase the rate of live births, but it may reduce the incidence of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by over-stimulation of the ovaries).\n- Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of individualizing follicle-stimulating hormone doses based on ovarian reserve.\n\nWhat is IVF and why is it important to get the dose of a fertility medicine right?\nIVF is a fertility treatment where an egg is fertilized outside the body. Women undergoing IVF often receive daily doses of a medicine called gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve 5 to 15 eggs, as this is considered a normal response to stimulation. However, getting the dose of FSH right is crucial because too high or too low a dose can lead to problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to see if tailoring the FSH dose to a woman's individual characteristics, such as her age, antral follicle count (AFC), basal FSH (bFSH), and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, improves pregnancy rates and reduces the risk of OHSS compared to using a standard dose of FSH for all women.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing individualized gonadotropin doses using markers of ovarian reserve in women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that involved 8520 women undergoing in vitro fertilization plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The studies compared different doses of FSH in women with a defined ovarian reserve test (ORT) profile or an individualized dosing strategy versus uniform dosing or a different individualized dosing algorithm. It is unclear if individualizing the dose of gonadotropin for women undergoing in vitro fertilization plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection affects the rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. However, using an ovarian reserve test-based algorithm may reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has limitations, including small study sizes and incomplete reporting. \n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

For example, the sentence 'The goal is to retrieve 5 to 15 eggs, as this is considered a normal response to stimulation' could be rephrased as 'We aim to get 5-15 eggs from the ovaries, which is a typical response to the treatment.' Additionally, the text uses passive voice excessively, such as 'The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, potential lack of blinding because participants may have known their treatment, and incomplete reporting of all outcomes of interest,' which could be rewritten as 'We found that the studies had small sample sizes, and some participants may have known which treatment they received, which limits the evidence.' The PLS evaluation results show that the text has good conformity with typical PLS patterns, but there are some deviations, such as a high rate of nominalization and complex words. To improve, the writer could reduce the use of nominalization and complex words, and rephrase sentences to make them clearer and more concise.",

However, there are some deviations, including a high rate of nominalization (22.0, P90) and complex words (219.0, P90). The text also has a high rate of passive voice (12.0, P50) and noun-heavy sentences. To improve, the writer could focus on reducing nominalization and complex words, and rephrasing sentences to make them clearer and more concise."
