Women undergoing IVF often receive daily doses of a medicine called gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve 5 to 15 eggs, as this is considered a normal response to stimulation. However, getting the dose of FSH right is crucial because too high or too low a dose can lead to problems. Too high a dose can cause a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), while too low a dose may result in fewer eggs being produced, reducing the chances of pregnancy.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of individualising the dose of FSH using markers of ovarian reserve in women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). They aimed to find out whether tailoring the FSH dose to a woman's individual characteristics, such as her age, antral follicle count (AFC), basal FSH (bFSH), and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, improves pregnancy rates and reduces the risk of OHSS compared to using a standard dose of FSH for all women.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing individualised gonadotropin doses using markers of ovarian reserve in women undergoing IVF/ICSI, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that involved 8520 women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The studies compared different doses of FSH in women with a defined ovarian reserve test (ORT) profile or an individualised dosing strategy versus uniform dosing or a different individualised dosing algorithm. The population characteristics included women with predicted low, normal, or high responders based on anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), and/or basal FSH (bFSH). The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not detailed. The interventions included different FSH doses and individualised dosing strategies based on ORT measures. We did not find information on the duration of the studies or the funding sources. It is unclear if individualising the dose of gonadotropin for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection affects the rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. However, using an ovarian reserve test-based algorithm may reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The current evidence does not provide a clear justification for adjusting the dose of gonadotropin in poor or normal responders.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, potential lack of blinding because participants may have known their treatment, and incomplete reporting of all outcomes of interest.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity and readability for patients. Firstly, the text contains sentences that are too long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. For instance, the sentence 'We found 26 studies that involved 8520 women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The studies compared different doses of FSH in women with a defined ovarian reserve test (ORT) profile or an individualised dosing strategy versus uniform dosing or a different individualised dosing algorithm.' could be broken down into simpler sentences for better comprehension. Additionally, there are instances of passive voice, such as 'The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, potential lack of blinding because participants may have known their treatment, and incomplete reporting of all outcomes of interest.' which could be rephrased in active voice for improved readability. Furthermore, the use of technical terms without clear explanations, like 'ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)', may confuse readers who are not familiar with these conditions. It is essential to define such terms or provide brief explanations to ensure that the text is accessible to all readers. The PLS evaluation results show significant deviations from typical patterns, particularly in the use of passive voice, nominalization, and complex words, which contribute to the text's lower readability. To address these issues, it is recommended to simplify sentence structures, reduce the use of passive voice, define technical terms, and limit the use of complex vocabulary. By implementing these changes, the draft can be made more concise, clear, and engaging for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft text deviates from typical patterns in several areas, including the use of passive voice, nominalization, and complex words. The results show that the text has a high number of passive voice constructions, nominalizations, and complex words, which contribute to its lower readability. The results also indicate that the text has a high Flesch-Kincaid grade level and a high SMOG index, which suggest that the text may be difficult for some readers to understand. Overall, the results suggest that the draft text needs to be revised to improve its clarity and readability."
