  "draft": "Does tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone (a hormone that helps eggs grow in the ovaries) based on a woman's ovarian reserve (the ability of her ovaries to produce eggs) improve the chances of having a baby with in vitro fertilization (IVF, a type of fertility treatment where an egg is fertilized outside the body)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We are unsure if tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone based on a woman's ovarian reserve improves the chances of having a baby with IVF.\n- Using markers of ovarian reserve to individualize the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone does not seem to increase the rate of live births, but it may reduce the incidence of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by over-stimulation of the ovaries).\n- Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of individualizing follicle-stimulating hormone doses based on ovarian reserve.\n\nWhat is in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and why is it important to get the dose of a fertility medicine right?\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a type of fertility treatment where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body. Women undergoing IVF often receive daily doses of a medicine called gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve 5 to 15 eggs, as this is considered a normal response to stimulation. However, getting the dose of FSH right is crucial because too high or too low a dose can lead to problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of individualising the dose of FSH using markers of ovarian reserve in women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). They aimed to find out whether tailoring the FSH dose to a woman's individual characteristics, such as her age, antral follicle count (AFC), basal FSH (bFSH), and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, improves pregnancy rates and reduces the risk of OHSS compared to using a standard dose of FSH for all women.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing individualised gonadotropin doses using markers of ovarian reserve in women undergoing IVF/ICSI. We summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that involved 8520 women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The studies compared different doses of FSH in women with a defined ovarian reserve test (ORT) profile or an individualised dosing strategy versus uniform dosing or a different individualised dosing algorithm. It is unclear if individualising the dose of gonadotropin for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection affects the rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. However, using an ovarian reserve test-based algorithm may reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, potential lack of blinding because participants may have known their treatment, and incomplete reporting of all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

For example, the sentence 'In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a type of fertility treatment where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body' could be simplified to 'IVF is a fertility treatment where an egg is fertilized outside the body.' Additionally, the text uses passive voice excessively, with 14 instances, which can make it harder to follow. The suggested rewrite for the sentence 'The review authors wanted to assess the effects of individualising the dose of FSH using markers of ovarian reserve in women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)' could be 'We wanted to see if tailoring the FSH dose to a woman's individual characteristics improves pregnancy rates and reduces the risk of OHSS.' The metrics also show that the text has a high number of nominalizations (25), which can make it less readable. A suggested rewrite for the sentence 'The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, potential lack of blinding because participants may have known their treatment, and incomplete reporting of all outcomes of interest' could be 'The evidence has limitations, including small study sizes and incomplete reporting.'.",
