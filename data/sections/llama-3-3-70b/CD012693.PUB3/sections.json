  "key_messages": [
    "Tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone (a hormone that helps eggs grow in the ovaries) based on a woman's ovarian reserve (the ability of her ovaries to produce eggs) may or may not improve the chances of having a baby with in vitro fertilization (IVF, a type of fertility treatment where an egg is fertilized outside the body), and it is unclear if this approach reduces the risk of unwanted effects such of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a potentially life‑threatening condition caused by over‑stimulation of the ovaries).",
    "Using markers of ovarian reserve to individualize the dose of follicle‑stimulating hormone does not seem to increase the rate of live births, but it may reduce the incidence of moderate or severe OHSS, although the size of this effect is unclear.",
    "Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of individualizing follicle‑stimulating hormone doses based on ovarian reserve, as the current evidence is limited by the lack of robust studies, and to address important unanswered questions, such as the potential benefits and harms of this approach in different subgroups of women undergoing IVF."

      "subheading": "What is in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and why is it important to get the dose of a fertility medicine right?",
      "content": "In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a type of fertility treatment where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body. Women undergoing IVF often receive daily doses of a medicine called gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve 5 to 15 eggs, as this is considered a normal response to stimulation. However, getting the dose of FSH right is crucial because too high or too low a dose can lead to problems. Too high a dose can cause a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), while too low a dose may result in fewer eggs being produced, reducing the chances of pregnancy."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of individualising the dose of FSH using markers of ovarian reserve in women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). They aimed to find out whether tailoring the FSH dose to a woman's individual characteristics, such as her age, antral follicle count (AFC), basal FSH (bFSH), and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, improves pregnancy rates and reduces the risk of OHSS compared to using a standard dose of FSH for all women."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 26 studies that involved 8520 women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The studies compared different doses of FSH in women with a defined ovarian reserve test (ORT) profile or an individualised dosing strategy versus uniform dosing or a different individualised dosing algorithm. The population characteristics included women with predicted low, normal, or high responders based on anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), and/or basal FSH (bFSH). The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not detailed. The interventions included different FSH doses and individualised dosing strategies based on ORT measures. We did not find information on the duration of the studies or the funding sources. It is unclear if individualising the dose of gonadotropin for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection affects the rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. However, using an ovarian reserve test-based algorithm may reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The current evidence does not provide a clear justification for adjusting the dose of gonadotropin in poor or normal responders."
