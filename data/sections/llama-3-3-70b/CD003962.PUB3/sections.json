  "key_messages": [
    "How blood-pressure medicines (medicines that help lower blood pressure) and tonsil removal (a surgical procedure to remove the tonsils) can help or harm people with IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease where the kidneys get damaged by an overactive immune system) is still not fully understood, but it seems that blood-pressure medicines, especially those that affect the renin-angiotensin system (a part of the body that controls blood pressure), may help reduce proteinuria (excess protein in the urine), which is a sign of kidney damage, without causing significant harm, although the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.",
    "Tonsillectomy (the surgical removal of the tonsils) may help increase remission of proteinuria and haematuria (blood in the urine) in people with IgAN, particularly in Japanese patients, but the evidence is limited and it's unclear if this applies to other populations or if it's safe in the long term.",
    "More research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments, especially in different populations, and to find the best approach for managing IgA nephropathy, as the current evidence is mostly based on short-term studies with small numbers of participants."

      "subheading": "What is IgA nephropathy and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "IgA nephropathy, also known as IgAN, is a type of kidney disease where the kidneys become inflamed due to an abnormal immune response. It is the most common primary glomerular disease, affecting approximately 20% to 40% of patients who? who may progress to kidney failure within 25 years. This condition can lead to serious health issues, including kidney failure, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant. Current treatments often involve immunosuppressive therapy, which can have significant side effects. Therefore, finding alternative, non-immunosuppressive treatments is crucial to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of long-term complications."

    {
      "subheading": "What are non-immunosuppressive treatments and how do they work?",
      "content": "Non-immunosuppressive treatments for IgAN include various therapies such as antihypertensives, anticoagulants, dietary restrictions, and herbal medicines. These treatments aim to manage the disease by improving blood pressure, reducing proteinuria (excess protein in the urine), and minimizing the risks associated with long-term immunosuppressive management. Unlike immunosuppressive treatments that suppress the immune system, non-immunosuppressive treatments focus on addressing the underlying causes of the disease and its symptoms without compromising the immune system."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of non-immunosuppressive treatments? for IgAN in adults and children. They examined various non-immunosuppressive therapies to determine their effectiveness in improving kidney function, reducing proteinuria, and minimizing the risk of kidney failure. The authors also investigated the potential adverse effects of these treatments to provide a comprehensive understanding of their safety and efficacy."

      "content": "We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials and observational studies evaluating non‑immunosuppressive therapies for IgA nephropathy up to the present date. Search terms combined MeSH headings and keywords for “IgA nephropathy”, “Berger disease”, “non‑immunosuppressive”, “renin‑angiotensin system”, “SGLT2 inhibitor”, “fish oil”, “dietary protein”, and related synonyms."

      "subheading": "Study Selection",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full‑text articles. Inclusion criteria were: (1) adult participants with biopsy‑proven IgA nephropathy, (2) intervention that was non‑immunosuppressive, (3) reported renal outcomes (eGFR change, proteinuria) and safety data, and (4) minimum follow‑up of 6 months. Disagreements were resolved by consensus."

Evidence was graded as high, moderate, low, or very low, and presented alongside the benefit‑harm balance for each treatment."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review includes 80 studies with a total of 4856 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries, although the specific settings and funding sources are not detailed in the abstract. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, are not explicitly mentioned. The studies examined a range of non-immunosuppressive therapies, including antihypertensive therapies, anticoagulants, dietary restrictions, tonsillectomy, and herbal medicines, with antihypertensive therapies being the most extensively studied. The duration of the studies is not specified, but it is noted that clinical trials for this condition are often underpowered due to output due to the slowly progressive nature of IgA nephropathy. No information is provided on the study settings or the severity of the condition in the included populations."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Effects of non-immunosuppressive therapies on IgA nephropathy",
      "content": "The review found that antihypertensive therapies, particularly renin-angiotensin system inhibition, probably decrease proteinuria and may have little to no difference in kidney failure or doubling of serum creatinine. Tonsillectomy may increase remission of proteinuria and microscopic haematuria, but the findings are based on low certainty evidence and have only been conducted in Japanese people with IgAN. Other non-immunosuppressive treatments, such as anticoagulant therapy, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines, exhibited small benefits to kidney function, but the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate efficacy."

  ],
  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, potentially unblinded (participants may have known their treatment), did not report all outcomes of interest, involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, and did not cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023."
