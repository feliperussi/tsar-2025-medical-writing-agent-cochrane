  "key_messages": [
    "Combining mechanical bowel preparation (a procedure to empty the bowel) with oral antibiotics (medicines taken by mouth to kill bacteria) is probably more effective than using either method alone in reducing complications, such as surgical site infections (infections that occur after surgery) and anastomotic leakages (leaks from the joined parts of the intestine), after elective colorectal surgery (a planned surgery to remove part of the colon or rectum).",
    "The review did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether using oral antibiotics alone is as effective as combining them with mechanical bowel preparation, or whether not using any bowel preparation at all increases the risk of complications.",
    "Future research should focus on comparing the combination of mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation with using oral antibiotics alone or no bowel preparation, and should include studies that report on side effects and long-term outcomes to help determine the most effective approach for preventing complications after elective colorectal surgery."

      "subheading": "What is elective colorectal surgery and what are its complications?",
      "content": "Elective colorectal surgery is a planned operation to remove part of the colon or rectum, often due to cancer or other diseases. This type of surgery can be risky, with serious complications including anastomotic leakages (when the joined parts of the colon or rectum do not heal properly) and surgical site infections (SSIs, when the wound becomes infected). These complications can lead to prolonged recovery, long-term health problems, and even death."

      "subheading": "Why is preoperative bowel preparation used in elective colorectal surgery?",
      "content": "Preoperative bowel preparation is used to clean the bowel before surgery, which can help reduce the risk of complications. This preparation can involve mechanical methods (such as enemas or laxatives) to remove feces from the bowel, and/or oral antibiotics to reduce bacterial colonization. The goal is to make the surgery safer and more successful."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation in preventing complications in elective colorectal surgery. They aimed to compare this approach with other methods, such as mechanical bowel preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation, to determine the best way to reduce the risk of surgical site infections, anastomotic leakages, and other complications."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 21 studies that involved 5264 participants who underwent elective colorectal surgery. The studies compared combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation (MBP+oAB) with either MBP alone, oral antibiotics alone (oAB), or no bowel preparation (nBP). Most included studies investigated both colon and rectal resections due to malignant and benign surgical indications. The included studies used different regimens in terms of agent(s), dosage, and timing for MBP as well as oAB. Seventeen trials compared MBP+oAB with sole MBP, three trials compared MBP+oAB with sole oAB, and one trial compared MBP+oAB versus nBP. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of MBP+oAB on the incidence of surgical site infections (SSI) as well as mortality when compared to oAB alone or nBP. No information was provided about the duration of the studies, study funding sources, population characteristics such as age and gender, or the countries in which the studies took place."

      "subheading": "Main results: Reducing surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage",
      "content": "The use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation probably reduces the risk of surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage compared to mechanical bowel preparation alone. However, it is unclear if this approach has an effect on mortality, postoperative ileus, or length of hospital stay. The evidence suggests that for every 100 people undergoing elective colorectal surgery, the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation may prevent 4 to 6 cases of surgical site infections and 2 to 4 cases of anastomotic leakage. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited certainty of the evidence."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment (lack of blinding), the studies were very small, and the findings do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.",
