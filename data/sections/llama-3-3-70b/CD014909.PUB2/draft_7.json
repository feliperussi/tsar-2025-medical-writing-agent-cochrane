  "draft": "Is combining mechanical bowel preparation (a procedure to empty the bowel) with oral antibiotics (medicines taken by mouth to kill bacteria) more effective than using either method alone in reducing complications after elective colorectal surgery (a planned surgery to remove part of the colon or rectum)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics is probably more effective than using either method alone in reducing complications, such as infections after surgery and leaks from the joined parts of the intestine, after elective colorectal surgery.\n- The review did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether using oral antibiotics alone is as effective as combining them with mechanical bowel preparation, or whether not using any bowel preparation at all increases the risk of complications.\n- Future research should focus on comparing the combination of mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation with using oral antibiotics alone or no bowel preparation, and should include studies that report on side effects and long-term outcomes to help determine the most effective approach for preventing complications after elective colorectal surgery.\n\nWhat is elective colorectal surgery and what are its complications?\nElective colorectal surgery is a planned operation to remove part of the colon or rectum, often due to cancer or other diseases. This type of surgery can be risky, with serious complications including leaks from the joined parts of the colon or rectum (when the joined parts do not heal properly) and infections after surgery (when the wound becomes infected). These complications can lead to prolonged recovery, long-term health problems, and even death.\n\nWhy is preoperative bowel preparation used in elective colorectal surgery?\nWe use preoperative bowel preparation to clean the bowel before surgery, which can help reduce the risk of complications. This preparation can involve mechanical methods (such as enemas or laxatives) to remove feces from the bowel, and/or oral antibiotics to reduce bacterial colonization. The goal is to make the surgery safer and more successful.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effectiveness of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation in preventing complications in elective colorectal surgery. We aimed to compare this approach with other methods, such as mechanical bowel preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation, to determine the best way to reduce the risk of infections after surgery and leaks from the joined parts of the intestine.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that involved 5264 participants who underwent elective colorectal surgery. The studies compared combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation with either mechanical bowel preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation. Most included studies investigated both colon and rectal resections due to malignant and benign surgical indications. The included studies used different regimens in terms of agent(s), dosage, and timing for mechanical bowel preparation as well as oral antibiotics.\n\nMain results: Reducing infections after surgery and leaks from the joined parts of the intestine\nThe use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation probably reduces the risk of infections after surgery and leaks from the joined parts of the intestine compared to mechanical bowel preparation alone. However, it is unclear if this approach has an effect on mortality, postoperative ileus, or length of hospital stay. The evidence suggests that for every 100 people undergoing elective colorectal surgery, the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation may prevent 4 to 6 cases of infections after surgery and 2 to 4 cases of leaks from the joined parts of the intestine.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment, the studies were very small, and the findings do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021.",
