  "draft": "# Do patient decision aids (tools that help people make informed choices about their healthcare) improve health decisions compared to usual care?\n**Key Messages**\n- Patient decision aids (tools that help people make informed choices about their healthcare, by making the decision explicit, providing evidence-based information, and helping clarify personal values) probably increase the likelihood of informed values-congruent choices compared to usual care, and they lead to better knowledge, more accurate risk perceptions, and a more active role in decision-making, without increasing decision regret (a feeling of remorse after making a decision).\n- The use of patient decision aids results in improved outcomes related to the decision-making process, including feeling informed and clear about personal values, but the quality of the evidence varies and more research is needed to fully understand their effects, especially regarding long-term outcomes and resource use.\n- Further studies are needed to assess the impact of patient decision aids on adherence to chosen options, downstream effects on healthcare costs, and to explore how decision aids can be best implemented in different healthcare settings to support informed decision-making.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is the problem of making health decisions?\nWhen people are faced with health treatment or screening decisions, they often need support to make informed choices. This is because health decisions can be complex and involve weighing up the potential benefits and harms of different options. Patient decision aids are tools designed to help people make health decisions by providing evidence-based information and clarifying their personal values.\nWhat are patient decision aids?\nPatient decision aids are interventions that provide people with the information and support they need to make informed health decisions. They can take many forms, including booklets, videos, and websites, and are designed to help people understand the potential benefits and harms of different health options. Patient decision aids can also help people to clarify their personal values and make decisions that are consistent with those values.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether patient decision aids are effective in supporting people to make informed health decisions. They also wanted to know whether patient decision aids can improve people's knowledge and understanding of their health options, and whether they can help people to feel more confident and informed when making health decisions. The authors searched for studies that compared patient decision aids with usual care, and they looked at a range of outcomes, including the quality of people's health decisions and their satisfaction with the decision-making process.\n**Methods**\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched for studies comparing patient decision aids to usual care.\nData Synthesis\nWe summarized and combined their results.\nConfidence Assessment\nWe evaluated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects of patient decision aids on health decisions.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 209 studies that involved 107,698 participants. The studies were conducted on 71 different health decisions, with the most common decisions being about cardiovascular treatments, cancer screening, cancer treatments, mental health treatments, and joint replacement surgery. The studies did not report on the duration of the interventions. There is no information available on the study funding sources. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The study settings, including the countries where the studies took place, were also not specified. The types of interventions and comparisons were patient decision aids compared to usual care. No information was found on the severity of the conditions or the number of studies conducted in specific countries. Patient decision aids probably help more adults make informed choices that align with their personal values. They likely lead to a better understanding of the options and their benefits and harms, and may increase the number of people who take an active role in decision-making. However, they may make little to no difference in the length of consultation or the risk of unwanted effects.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), incomplete reporting of outcomes (not all studies provided data on all outcomes of interest), and heterogeneity across studies (different participant populations and varied delivery methods for the intervention).\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several clarity issues, including unexplained jargon, long sentences, and missing context. For example, the sentence 'Patient decision aids are interventions that provide people with the information and support they need to make informed health decisions' is unclear because it does not define what 'informed health decisions' means. A suggested rewrite could be 'Patient decision aids help people make health choices by providing evidence-based information and clarifying their personal values.' Additionally, the text uses excessive passive voice, such as 'The evidence is limited by possible lack of the blinding,' which could be rephrased as 'We limited our evidence by not blinding participants.' The PLS evaluation results show significant deviations from typical patterns, including high rates of passive voice, nominalization, and complex words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 38.9% of features in the best quartile and 27.8% beyond the 90th percentile. The results highlight areas for improvement, including reducing passive voice, nominalization, and complex words to increase readability and clarity."
