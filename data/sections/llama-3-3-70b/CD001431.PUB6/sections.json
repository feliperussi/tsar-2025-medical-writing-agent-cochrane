  "key_messages": [
    "Patient decision aids (tools that help people make informed choices about their healthcare, by making the decision explicit, providing evidence-based information, and helping clarify personal values) probably increase the likelihood of informed values-congruent choices compared to usual care, and they lead to better knowledge, more accurate risk perceptions, and a more active role in decision-making, without increasing decision regret (a feeling of remorse after making a decision).",
    "The use of patient decision aids results in improved outcomes related to the decision-making process, including feeling informed and clear about personal values, but the quality of the evidence varies and more research is needed to fully understand their effects, especially regarding long-term outcomes and resource use.",
    "Further studies are needed to assess the impact of patient decision aids on adherence to chosen options, downstream effects on healthcare costs, and to explore how decision aids can be best implemented in different healthcare settings to support informed decision-making."

      "subheading": "What is the problem of making health decisions?",
      "content": "When people are faced with health treatment or screening decisions, they often need support to make informed choices. This is because health decisions can be complex and involve weighing up the potential benefits and harms of different options. Patient decision aids are tools designed to help people make health decisions by providing evidence-based information and clarifying their personal values."

      "subheading": "What are patient decision aids?",
      "content": "Patient decision aids are interventions that provide people with the information and support they need to make informed health decisions. They can take many forms, including booklets, videos, and websites, and are designed to help people understand the potential benefits and harms of different health options. Patient decision aids can also help people to clarify their personal values and make decisions that are consistent with those values."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out whether patient decision aids are effective in supporting people to make informed health decisions. They also wanted to know whether patient decision aids can improve people's knowledge and understanding of their health options, and whether they can help people to feel more confident and informed when making health decisions. The authors searched for studies that compared patient decision aids with usual care, and they looked at a range of outcomes, including the quality of people's health decisions and their satisfaction with the decision-making process."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 209 studies that involved 107,698 participants. The studies were conducted on 71 different health decisions, with the most common decisions being about cardiovascular treatments, cancer screening, cancer treatments, mental health treatments, and joint replacement surgery. The studies did not report on the duration of the interventions. There is no information available on the study funding sources. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The study settings, including the countries where the studies took place, were also not specified. The types of interventions and comparisons were patient decision aids compared to usual care. No information was found on the severity of the conditions or the number of studies conducted in specific countries. Patient decision aids probably help more adults make informed choices that align with their personal values. They likely lead to a better understanding of the options and their benefits and harms, and may increase the number of people who take an active role in decision-making. However, they may make little to no difference in the length of consultation or the risk of unwanted effects."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), incomplete reporting of outcomes (not all studies provided data on all outcomes of interest), and heterogeneity across studies (different participant populations and varied delivery methods for the intervention).",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022."
