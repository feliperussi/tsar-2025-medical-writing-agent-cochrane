  "draft": "Is home-based education effective for children with asthma compared to usual care or education delivered outside the home?\n\nWe looked at the effectiveness of home-based education for children with asthma. Asthma is a condition that makes it hard to breathe. It affects 262.4 million people worldwide.\n\n- Home-based education for children with asthma may have little to no difference in reducing asthma attacks that require emergency department visits or oral corticosteroids (medicines that reduce inflammation) compared to usual care or education delivered outside the home, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Home-based education may improve quality of life (overall well-being and ability to perform daily activities) for children with asthma, and a more intensive home-based education program may reduce hospitalizations due to asthma attacks, but the evidence is limited and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n- Further studies are needed to determine the most effective components and settings for asthma education programs, including the optimal content, duration, and frequency of education sessions.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is it a problem?\nAsthma is a condition that makes it hard to breathe. It causes symptoms like wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Asthma can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, respiratory infections, and air pollution.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to see if home-based education helps children with asthma and their caregivers manage the condition better. We aimed to determine whether home-based education is superior to usual care or the same education delivered elsewhere.\n\nWhat did we search for?\nWe searched for studies on home-based educational interventions for children with asthma. We looked for studies that compared home-based education to usual care, education delivered outside the home, or less-intensive education programs.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The studies varied in duration and were conducted in different settings, with participants ranging in age from 1 to 18 years old and having mild to severe asthma. Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if home-based education has an effect on asthma attacks leading to emergency department visits, asthma attacks requiring oral corticosteroids, or hospitalizations compared to control.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, possible lack of blinding, and very small sample sizes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
