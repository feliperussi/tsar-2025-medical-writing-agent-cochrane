  "key_messages": [
    "Home-based education for children with asthma (a chronic airway condition that causes breathing difficulties) may have little to no difference in reducing asthma attacks (exacerbations) that require emergency department visits or oral corticosteroids (medicines that reduce inflammation) compared to usual care or education delivered outside the home, but the evidence is uncertain.",
    "Home-based education may improve quality of life (overall well-being and ability to perform daily activities) for children with asthma, and a more intensive home-based education program may reduce hospitalizations due to asthma exacerbations, but the evidence is limited and more research is needed to confirm these findings.",
    "Further studies are needed to determine the most effective components and settings for asthma education programs, including the optimal content, duration, and frequency of education sessions, as well as the potential benefits and harms of different educational interventions, in order to provide clearer guidance for healthcare providers and families."

      "subheading": "What is asthma and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Asthma is a chronic airway condition that affects 262.4 million people worldwide. It is a condition where the airways in the lungs become inflamed and constricted, making it difficult to breathe. Asthma can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, and can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, respiratory infections, and air pollution. Asthma education is an essential component of management, which includes providing information on the disease process and self-management skills development, such as trigger avoidance."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of educational interventions for asthma, delivered in the home to children, their caregivers, or both, on asthma-related outcomes. They aimed to determine whether home-based education is superior to usual care or the same education delivered elsewhere, and to identify the most effective components of an education program for children with asthma."

      "content": "This review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The studies varied in duration and were conducted in different settings, with participants ranging in age from 1 to 18 years old and having mild to severe asthma. The context and content of educational interventions also varied, as did the aims of the studies and the control group event rates. The studies were at risk of bias due to the nature of the intervention, and all studies were judged at unclear risk for performance bias. The review did not provide information on the funding sources of the studies."

      "subheading": "Main results: Effects of Home-Based Education on Asthma Management",
      "content": "Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if home-based education has an effect on exacerbations leading to emergency department visits, exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids, mean symptom-free days, days missed from school or work, and exacerbations leading to hospitalisation compared to control. A more intensive home-based education intervention may reduce hospitalisation due to an asthma exacerbation compared to a less-intensive type of home-based education, but the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and very small sample sizes.",
