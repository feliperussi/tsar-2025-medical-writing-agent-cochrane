  "draft": "Is home-based education effective for children with asthma compared to usual care or education delivered outside the home?\n\nWe looked at the effectiveness of home-based education for children with asthma. Asthma affects 262.4 million people worldwide, causing breathing difficulties. It causes symptoms like wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Asthma can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, respiratory infections, and air pollution.\n\n- Home-based education for children with asthma may have little to no difference in reducing asthma attacks that require emergency department visits or oral corticosteroids (medicines that reduce inflammation) compared to usual care or education delivered outside the home, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Home-based education may improve quality of life (overall well-being and ability to perform daily activities) for children with asthma, and a more intensive home-based education program may reduce hospitalizations due to asthma attacks, but the evidence is limited and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n- Further studies are needed to determine the most effective components and settings for asthma education programs, including the optimal content, duration, and frequency of education sessions.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is it a problem?\nAsthma is a chronic airway condition that affects 262.4 million people worldwide. It is a condition where the airways in the lungs become inflamed and constricted, making it difficult to breathe. Asthma can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, and can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, respiratory infections, and air pollution.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of educational interventions for asthma, delivered in the home to children, their caregivers, or both, on asthma-related outcomes. We aimed to determine whether home-based education is superior to usual care or the same education delivered elsewhere.\n\nWhat did we search for?\nWe searched for studies on home-based educational interventions for children with asthma. We looked for studies that compared home-based education to usual care, education delivered outside the home, or less-intensive education programs.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The studies varied in duration and were conducted in different settings, with participants ranging in age from 1 to 18 years old and having mild to severe asthma. Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if home-based education has an effect on asthma attacks leading to emergency department visits, asthma attacks requiring oral corticosteroids, or hospitalizations compared to control.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, possible lack of blinding, and very small sample sizes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains some unexplained technical terms, such as \"exacerbations\" and \"oral corticosteroids\", which may confuse readers who are not familiar with medical terminology. For example, the sentence \"Home-based education for children with asthma may have little to no difference in reducing asthma attacks (exacerbations) that require emergency department visits or oral corticosteroids (medicines that reduce inflammation) compared to usual care or education delivered outside the home, but the evidence is uncertain.\" could be rephrased to \"Home-based education for children with asthma may have little to no difference in reducing severe asthma episodes that require hospital visits or steroid treatments compared to usual care or education delivered outside the home, but the evidence is uncertain.\" Secondly, some sentences are too long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For instance, the sentence \"The review authors wanted to assess the effects of educational interventions for asthma, delivered in the home to children, their caregivers, or both, on asthma-related outcomes, and to identify the most effective components of an education program for children with asthma.\" could be broken up into two simpler sentences: \"The review authors wanted to assess the effects of educational interventions for asthma on asthma-related outcomes.\" and \"They also aimed to identify the most effective components of an education program for children with asthma.\" Lastly, the text could benefit from more active voice constructions and fewer noun-heavy sentences. According to the PLS evaluation results, the draft text has a high number of passive voice constructions (28 instances) and noun-heavy sentences (162 nouns), which can make the text less engaging and more difficult to read. To address these issues, the writer could rephrase sentences like \"The evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, possible lack of blinding, and very small sample sizes.\" to \"We found that the evidence is limited by the diversity of study populations and intervention methods, the possible lack of blinding, and the small sample sizes.\" Overall, while the draft text provides a good overview of the topic, it requires some revisions to improve its clarity, readability, and engagement.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show that the draft text has a moderate level of conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 38.9% of features in the best quartile (P25/P75) and 22.2% in the P90 range. However, there are some significant deviations from typical patterns, including a high number of passive voice constructions (28 instances) and noun-heavy sentences (162 nouns). The results also indicate that the text could benefit from more active voice constructions and fewer complex words. Overall, the draft text requires some revisions to improve its clarity, readability, and engagement."
