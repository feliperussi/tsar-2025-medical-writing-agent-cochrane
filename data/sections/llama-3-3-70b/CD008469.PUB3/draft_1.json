It is a condition where the airways in the lungs become inflamed and constricted, making it difficult to breathe. Asthma can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, and can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, respiratory infections, and air pollution. Asthma education is an essential component of management, which includes providing information on the disease process and self-management skills development, such as trigger avoidance.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of educational interventions for asthma, delivered in the home to children, their caregivers, or both, on asthma-related outcomes. They aimed to determine whether home-based education is superior to usual care or the same education delivered elsewhere, and to identify the most effective components of an education program for children with asthma.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe searched for studies on home-based educational interventions for children with asthma.\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nWe summarized the results of the identified studies.\n### Confidence Assessment\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects on asthma-related outcomes.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nThis review includes 26 studies with 5122 participants. The studies varied in duration and were conducted in different settings, with participants ranging in age from 1 to 18 years old and having mild to severe asthma. The context and content of educational interventions also varied, as did the aims of the studies and the control group event rates. The studies were at risk of bias due to the nature of the intervention, and all studies were judged at unclear risk for performance bias. The review did not provide information on the funding sources of the studies.\n### Main results: Effects of Home-Based Education on Asthma Management\nHome-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if home-based education has an effect on exacerbations leading to emergency department visits, exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids, mean symptom-free days, days missed from school or work, and exacerbations leading to hospitalisation compared to control. A more intensive home-based education intervention may reduce hospitalisation due to an asthma exacerbation compared to a less-intensive type of home-based education, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and intervention delivery methods, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and very small sample sizes.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, the title and subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a requirement. For example, the title should be rephrased as \"What is the effectiveness of home-based education for children with asthma?\" Secondly, there are several instances of unexplained jargon and technical terms, such as \"exacerbations\" and \"oral corticosteroids\", which need to be defined for a general audience. Thirdly, some sentences are too long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For instance, the sentence \"Home-based education may improve quality of life compared to control, but the evidence is very uncertain\" could be broken up into two simpler sentences. Lastly, the draft uses excessive passive voice, which can make the text seem less engaging and less clear. According to the PLS evaluation results, the draft has a high number of passive voice constructions (32.0), which is beyond the typical range. The results also show that the draft has a low Flesch reading ease score (31.47), indicating that the text is difficult to read. Overall, while the draft provides some useful information, it needs significant revisions to improve its clarity, readability, and conformity to the typical PLS patterns.",
