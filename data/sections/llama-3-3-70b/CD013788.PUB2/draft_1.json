  "draft": "# Is removing the urinary catheter early or late better for preventing infections after a kidney transplant (a surgery where a person receives a new kidney)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is uncertain whether removing the urinary catheter early or late after a kidney transplant makes any difference in preventing infections, including urinary tract infections (infections of the system that produces, stores, and carries urine), as the current studies have significant limitations and do not provide clear answers.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the benefits and harms of early versus late removal of the urinary catheter, and the available studies did not report on harmful effects, highlighting the need for better research in this area.\n- Future research should focus on conducting high-quality, well-designed studies that compare early and late catheter removal after kidney transplantation, including assessing the incidence of urinary tract infections and other complications over longer periods, to provide clearer guidance for patients and healthcare providers.\n**Introduction**\n### What is kidney transplantation and why is it important?\nKidney transplantation is a surgical procedure that involves replacing a diseased or damaged kidney with a healthy one from a donor. It is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease, which is a condition where the kidneys are no longer able to function properly. During the operation, a catheter is introduced into the bladder to allow it to drain and promote healing. However, urinary catheters can pose an infection risk to patients, and the longer they remain in place, the greater the risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI).\n### What are the potential complications of urinary catheter use after kidney transplantation?\nThe use of urinary catheters after kidney transplantation can lead to complications such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), which can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Symptomatic UTIs can cause symptoms such as pain, fever, and discomfort, while asymptomatic bacteriuria refers to the presence of bacteria in the urine without any symptoms. Other potential complications include major urological complications, such as anastomotic breakdown, which can require intervention and treatment.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to compare the effectiveness of early versus late removal of urinary catheters after kidney transplantation. They aimed to find out whether removing the catheter early (less than 5 days after surgery) or late (5 days or more after surgery) made a difference in the incidence of symptomatic UTIs, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and major urological complications. They also wanted to determine the optimal timing for catheter removal to minimize the risk of complications and promote better outcomes for patients after kidney transplantation.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing early and late removal of urinary catheters after kidney transplantation, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 197 people who underwent kidney transplantation. The studies were conducted to compare the effectiveness of early versus late removal of urinary catheters post-transplant. The duration of the studies was short, with no patients being followed beyond one month. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not specified in the abstract. The studies did not provide information on the funding sources or the countries in which they took place. The interventions compared were early removal of the urinary catheter, defined as removal before 5 days post-transplant, and late removal, defined as removal 5 days or later post-transplant. It is uncertain whether removing the urinary catheter early or late after kidney transplantation has an effect on the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria. We do not know if early or late removal of the urinary catheter has an effect on the incidence of urinary tract infections or major urological complications.\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",
