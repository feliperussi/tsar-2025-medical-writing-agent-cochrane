It can lead to poor growth, impaired immune responses, increased risk of disease, and even blindness or death. Vitamin A deficiency is particularly common in individuals with limited access to nutrient-rich foods, such as those living in poverty or with certain medical conditions.\n### What are the common methods for assessing vitamin A deficiency?\nAssessing vitamin A status is crucial for its clinical management. Several methods have been developed to measure vitamin A levels in the body, including direct index measures and dose-response biomarkers. These methods aim to provide accurate assessments of vitamin A status, which is essential for diagnosing and treating vitamin A deficiency.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the accuracy of index tests used to diagnose subclinical vitamin A deficiency in individuals at risk. They also wanted to assess how different factors, such as the reference standard used and the cutoff values, affect the accuracy of these index tests. By evaluating the performance of these tests, the authors hoped to provide valuable information for healthcare professionals and researchers working to address vitamin A deficiency.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on vitamin A deficiency tests, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 40 studies that involved a total of 65 records. The studies were conducted in various countries around the world, with no specific information on the number of participants in each study. The duration of the studies was not reported, as they were not intervention reviews. There is no information on the funding sources of the studies. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The studies included cross-sectional or cohort-accuracy studies, longitudinal studies, and direct, indirect, and random comparison studies. The types of interventions and comparisons varied, including serum or plasma retinol, retinol-binding protein, relative dose response, and breast milk vitamin A, compared to reference standards such as retinol isotope dilution and liver vitamin A. No studies were found that evaluated modified relative dose response. The review found that methods to determine vitamin A deficiency had generally low sensitivity and high specificity in individuals at risk for vitamin A deficiency. It is unclear if these methods have an effect on outcome.\n**Limitations**\nThe studies were not designed to assess diagnostic accuracy, had very small sample sizes, and were likely unblinded, allowing participants to know their treatment allocation.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

For example, the sentence 'Vitamin A deficiency is a serious health condition that occurs when the body does not have enough vitamin A, an essential nutrient important for growth, immune function, and eye health.' could be simplified to 'Vitamin A deficiency is a serious health condition caused by a lack of vitamin A, which is crucial for growth, immune function, and eye health.' Additionally, the draft has high rates of nominalization, nouns, smog index, complex words, and long words, which deviate from typical PLS patterns. The suggested rewrites include using active voice, reducing sentence length, and avoiding jargon. The PLS evaluation results show moderate conformity with PLS patterns, but with significant deviations in certain metrics.",

However, there are significant deviations in metrics such as nominalization, nouns, smog index, complex words, and long words, which are beyond the 90th percentile. These deviations contribute to the clarity issues noted in the feedback."
