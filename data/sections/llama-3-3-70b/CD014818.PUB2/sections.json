  "key_messages": [
    "Regional analgesia techniques (methods to block pain in a specific area of the body) such as paravertebral block (a type of pain relief that involves injecting medication into the space near the spine), erector spinae plane block (a type of pain relief that involves injecting medication into the space near the muscles of the back), pectoral nerve block (a type of pain relief that involves injecting medication into the space near the nerves of the chest), and serratus anterior plane block (a type of pain relief that involves injecting medication into the space near the muscles of the side of the body) seem comparable in reducing postoperative pain (pain after surgery) and rates of complications (unwanted or harmful effects) after breast cancer surgery, but the evidence is not strong enough to confirm this.",
    "No harmful effects of these regional analgesia techniques were reported in the studies, but the quality of the evidence is limited, so we cannot be certain about the absence of harm.",
    "Future research should focus on comparing these techniques directly against each other, with larger studies that can provide more reliable results, and should investigate the long-term effects of these techniques to better understand their benefits and potential harms."

      "subheading": "What is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery?",
      "content": "Postoperative pain is a common problem for individuals undergoing breast cancer surgery. It can cause significant discomfort, distress, and affect a person's recovery and quality of life. Regional analgesia techniques, which involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas of the body, are often used to manage postoperative pain. These techniques can help reduce pain and the need for other pain medications, but they can also have risks and side effects."

      "subheading": "What are the common regional analgesia techniques used for postoperative pain management after breast cancer surgery?",
      "content": "There are several regional analgesia techniques that can be used to manage postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, including paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB). These techniques involve injecting pain-relieving medication into specific areas around the nerves that transmit pain signals from the breast area. The goal of these techniques is to reduce pain and discomfort, and to improve recovery and quality of life after surgery."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out which regional analgesia techniques are most effective in reducing postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery, and what the potential harms and risks of these techniques are. They also wanted to compare the effectiveness of different techniques, such as PVB, ESPB, PEC, and SAPB, in reducing postoperative pain and improving recovery. The authors aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence on regional analgesia techniques for postoperative pain management after breast cancer surgery, to help inform clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 39 studies that involved 2348 participants. The studies were conducted between 2013 and 2023 in several countries including Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, USA, and Thailand. Most studies used single-shot long-acting anaesthetics administered with ultrasound guidance, and in 35 studies, the surgery was modified radical mastectomy. All studies performed surgery under general anaesthesia in the hospital. The review had no dedicated funding. The regional analgesia techniques included in our analysis seem comparable in reducing postoperative pain and rates of complications. Intervention probably reduces outcome slightly. Intervention may reduce outcome slightly. It is unclear if intervention has an effect on outcome."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and there were too few studies to provide confidence in the outcome results.",
