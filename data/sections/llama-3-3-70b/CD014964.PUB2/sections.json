  "key_messages": [
    "Using ultrasound guidance (a technique that uses sound waves to create images of the body) for regional anesthesia (a type of pain relief that numbs a specific area of the body) in adults is better than using anatomical landmarks (physical features of the body) because it reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time, likely increasing the rate of first-attempt success, with no reported harmful effects.",
    "Ultrasound guidance may result in little to no difference in participant satisfaction (how happy patients are with the procedure) or technical failure (when the procedure does not work as planned), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about these findings.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the uncertainties in the current evidence, including the effect of ultrasound guidance on pain during the procedure and adverse events (unwanted effects), to provide clearer guidance for medical professionals and patients."

      "subheading": "What is neuraxial anaesthesia and why is it important?",
      "content": "Neuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief given to adults, where medicine is injected into the space surrounding the spinal cord or into the epidural space outside the sac that contains the spinal fluid. This type of anaesthesia can be difficult to administer successfully because the space imagined by feeling anatomical landmarks can be different from the actual position. Successful neuraxial anaesthesia with as few punctures as possible is crucial to reduce complications and increase patient satisfaction."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of using ultrasound guidance compared to anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. They aimed to find out if ultrasound guidance can increase the success rate of the procedure, reduce the number of attempts, and decrease the time it takes to perform the procedure, while also considering the impact on patient satisfaction and potential adverse effects."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 65 studies that involved 6823 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania, and were published between 2001 and 2023. The studies evaluated different types of neuraxial anaesthesia, including spinal anaesthesia, lumbar epidural anaesthesia, combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia, and thoracic epidural anaesthesia. Thirty-two studies evaluated obstetric populations undergoing labour epidural or caesarean section, while the remaining studies evaluated participants who received surgery under neuraxial anaesthesia. Four studies evaluated real-time ultrasound as an intervention arm. There was no mention of study funding sources. Ultrasound guidance probably reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time. It likely increases the rate of first-attempt success. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure. It is unclear if ultrasound guidance has an effect on pain during the procedure or adverse events."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sample sizes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to October 2022."
