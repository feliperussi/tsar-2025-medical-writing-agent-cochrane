  "draft": "Is using ultrasound guidance better than using anatomical landmarks for giving regional anesthesia to adults?\n\nWe compared two methods for giving regional anesthesia - ultrasound guidance and anatomical landmarks. Regional anesthesia is a type of pain relief that numbs a specific area of the body. \n\n- Ultrasound guidance is better than anatomical landmarks because it reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time. It likely increases the rate of first-attempt success, with no reported harmful effects.\n- Ultrasound guidance may result in little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about these findings.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the uncertainties in the current evidence, including the effect of ultrasound guidance on pain during the procedure and adverse events, to provide clearer guidance for medical professionals and patients.\n\nWhat is neuraxial anesthesia and why is it important?\nNeuraxial anesthesia is a type of pain relief given to adults, where medicine is injected into the space surrounding the spinal cord or into the epidural space outside the sac that contains the spinal fluid. This type of anesthesia can be difficult to administer successfully because the space imagined by feeling anatomical landmarks can be different from the actual position. Successful neuraxial anesthesia with as few punctures as possible is crucial to reduce complications and increase patient satisfaction.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of using ultrasound guidance compared to anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anesthesia in adults. They aimed to find out if ultrasound guidance can increase the success rate of the procedure, reduce the number of attempts, and decrease the time it takes to perform the procedure, while also considering the impact on patient satisfaction and potential adverse effects.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 6823 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania, and were published between 2001 and 2023. The studies evaluated different types of neuraxial anesthesia, including spinal anesthesia, lumbar epidural anesthesia, combined spinal and epidural anesthesia, and thoracic epidural anesthesia. Thirty-two studies evaluated obstetric populations undergoing labor epidural or caesarean section, while the remaining studies evaluated participants who received surgery under neuraxial anesthesia. Four studies evaluated real-time ultrasound as an intervention arm. Ultrasound guidance probably reduces the number of attempts required for success and reduces procedure time. It likely increases the rate of first-attempt success. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference in participant satisfaction or technical failure. It is unclear if ultrasound guidance has an effect on pain during the procedure or adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding, very small study sample sizes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
