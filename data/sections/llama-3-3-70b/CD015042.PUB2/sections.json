  "key_messages": [
    "Brief psychosocial interventions (counseling or therapy to help change behaviors and thoughts) may help pregnant women stop drinking alcohol during pregnancy, but the evidence is not very strong. No harmful effects of these interventions were reported in the studies.",
    "The studies did not find any benefits of medications for treating alcohol use disorder in pregnant women, possibly because no studies were found that tested medications.",
    "More research is needed to understand how to best help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol during pregnancy, including studies that look at the long-term effects of different treatments and that provide more detailed information about the womenâ€™s alcohol use before and during pregnancy."

      "subheading": "What is the problem of alcohol consumption during pregnancy?",
      "content": "Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant health concern. Despite the known harms, many pregnant women continue to drink alcohol, with rates varying between countries. Globally, it's estimated that 10% of pregnant women consume alcohol, with up to 25% doing so in Europe. This can lead to serious health problems for both the mother and the baby."

      "subheading": "What are the common interventions for reducing alcohol consumption during pregnancy?",
      "content": "To address this issue, various interventions have been implemented, including psychosocial interventions and medications. Psychosocial interventions typically involve counseling, advice, and support to help pregnant women reduce or stop their alcohol consumption. Medications may also be used to treat alcohol use disorder (AUD) in pregnant women."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions and medications in reducing or stopping alcohol consumption during pregnancy. They wanted to determine which interventions are most effective in promoting abstinence, reducing alcohol consumption, and improving treatment outcomes for pregnant women with AUD."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found eight studies that involved 1369 participants with alcohol use during pregnancy. The studies were conducted in three countries: the USA, Spain, and the Netherlands. Most studies evaluated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions, which were mainly brief interventions ranging from a single session of 10 to 60 minutes to five sessions of 10 minutes each. Pregnant women received the psychosocial intervention approximately at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, and the outcome of alcohol use was reassessed 8 to 24 weeks after the psychosocial intervention. Women in the control group received treatment as usual or similar treatments such as comprehensive assessment of alcohol use and advice to stop drinking during pregnancy. We did not find any study that evaluated the efficacy of medications for the treatment of alcohol use disorder during pregnancy. Psychosocial interventions may increase the rate of continuous abstinence among pregnant women who report alcohol use during pregnancy. Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on the number of drinks per day. Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on the number of women who completed treatment."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were likely unblinded (participants may have known which treatment they received) and the sample sizes were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2024."
