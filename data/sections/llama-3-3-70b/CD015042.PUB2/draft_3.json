  "draft": "What are the best ways to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol during pregnancy?\n\n- We found that brief counseling or therapy sessions may help pregnant women stop drinking alcohol during pregnancy. However, the evidence is not very strong. \n- No studies were found that tested medications for treating alcohol use disorder in pregnant women.\n- More research is needed to understand how to best help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol during pregnancy.\n\nWhat is the problem of alcohol consumption during pregnancy?\nAlcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant health concern. Despite the known harms, many pregnant women continue to drink alcohol. Globally, it's estimated that 10% of pregnant women consume alcohol, with up to 25% doing so in Europe. This can lead to serious health problems for both the mother and the baby.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for reducing alcohol consumption during pregnancy?\nTo address this issue, various interventions have been implemented. These include counseling or therapy sessions and medications. Counseling or therapy sessions typically involve advice and support to help pregnant women reduce or stop their alcohol consumption. \n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to determine which interventions are most effective in helping pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol during pregnancy. We looked at the effectiveness of counseling or therapy sessions and medications.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1369 participants with alcohol use during pregnancy. Most studies evaluated the efficacy of counseling or therapy sessions. These sessions were mainly brief interventions. Pregnant women received the counseling or therapy session approximately at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy. The outcome of alcohol use was reassessed 8 to 24 weeks after the counseling or therapy session. \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were likely unblinded and the sample sizes were very small.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",

For example, the sentence 'Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant health concern' could be rephrased as 'Why is alcohol consumption during pregnancy a health concern?' to make it clearer. Additionally, the sentence 'We found eight studies that involved 1369 participants with alcohol use during pregnancy' is a bit long and could be broken up for easier reading. The metrics also show a high number of passive voice constructions, which can make the text harder to follow. A suggested rewrite for the sentence 'The evidence is limited because the studies were likely unblinded and the sample sizes were very small' could be 'What are the limitations of the evidence?' to make it more concise and clear.",

The metrics show a high number of passive voice constructions and some long sentences, which can make the text harder to follow.
