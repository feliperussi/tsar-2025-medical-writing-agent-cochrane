  "draft": "What is the problem of establishing a secure airway in neonates?\nWe need to establish a secure airway in newborn babies during resuscitation. This is crucial because newborns often require endotracheal intubation to help them breathe. However, this procedure can be challenging and may lead to complications such as delayed airway stabilization, which can have serious consequences for the baby's health.\n\nWhat are the common methods for tracheal intubation in neonates?\nThere are two common methods for tracheal intubation in neonates: direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy. Direct laryngoscopy involves using a laryngoscope (a tool to visualize the vocal cords) to visualize the vocal cords and insert the endotracheal tube. Videolaryngoscopy, on the other hand, uses a video camera to provide a clearer view of the airway, which may facilitate successful endotracheal intubation and decrease adverse consequences.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy in decreasing the time and attempts required for endotracheal intubation and increasing the success rate on the first intubation attempt in neonates. We also aimed to investigate the potential benefits and harms of videolaryngoscopy in this context.\n\nWhat are the key messages from this review?\n- Videolaryngoscopy may increase the success of intubation on the first attempt and may result in fewer intubation attempts, but it may not reduce the time required for successful intubation.\n- Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a slight reduction in airway trauma during intubation attempts, which could be beneficial for newborn babies.\n- Future research should focus on well-designed studies to confirm the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation in newborn babies, including its potential benefits and harms.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and clinical trial registries for studies comparing videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy in neonates. No date or language restrictions were applied, and reference lists of relevant articles were screened for additional trials.\n\nWhat were the eligibility criteria for the studies?\nIncluded studies were randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental designs enrolling neonates (≤28 days old) who required tracheal intubation. Trials had to compare a videolaryngoscope with a conventional direct laryngoscope and report at least one clinical outcome such as intubation success, time to intubation, or adverse events.\n\nHow did we analyze the data?\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, participant demographics, device specifications, and outcomes. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Results were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis when appropriate, and heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 759 intubation attempts in neonates. The studies were conducted in international hospitals and included neonates of either sex, undergoing endotracheal intubation. Different videolaryngoscopy devices, including C-MAC, Airtraq, and Glidescope, were used in the studies. Videolaryngoscopy may increase the success of intubation on the first attempt and may result in fewer intubation attempts, but it may not reduce the time required for successful intubation. Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a reduced incidence of airway-related adverse effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation, by incomplete reporting of outcomes in some studies, and by the very small sample sizes of the trials, which reduces precision and generalizability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft text provided does not meet the requirements for approval due to several clarity and style issues. Critical checks such as completeness, title and subheadings format, factual accuracy, and word count have been verified, but specific clarity issues including unexplained jargon, long sentences, and missing context need to be addressed. Style issues like excessive passive voice, wordy phrases, and noun-heavy sentences also require attention. Furthermore, structure issues such as missing paragraph breaks and incorrect use of bullet points must be corrected. Metrics from the PLS evaluation results support these findings, indicating deviations from typical PLS patterns in areas like passive voice, nominalization, and readability indices. To improve, the writer should focus on simplifying language, reducing passive constructions, and enhancing sentence structure for better readability. The top improvements needed include rephrasing technical terms for clarity, breaking up long sentences, and ensuring consistent use of active voice. Supporting evidence from the metrics highlights the need for these adjustments to conform to typical PLS patterns and enhance overall readability.",
