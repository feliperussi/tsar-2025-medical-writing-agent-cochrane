Neonates, or newborns, often require endotracheal intubation to help them breathe. However, this procedure can be challenging and may lead to complications such as delayed airway stabilization, which can have serious consequences for the baby's health.\n### What are the common methods for tracheal intubation in neonates?\nThere are two common methods for tracheal intubation in neonates: direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy. Direct laryngoscopy involves using a laryngoscope to visualize the vocal cords and insert the endotracheal tube. Videolaryngoscopy, on the other hand, uses a video camera to provide a clearer view of the airway, which may facilitate successful endotracheal intubation and decrease adverse consequences.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy in decreasing the time and attempts required for endotracheal intubation and increasing the success rate on the first intubation attempt in neonates. They also aimed to investigate the potential benefits and harms of videolaryngoscopy in this context.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and clinical trial registries for studies comparing videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy in neonates. No date or language restrictions were applied, and reference lists of relevant articles were screened for additional trials.\n### Eligibility Criteria\nIncluded studies were randomized controlled trials or quasi‑experimental designs enrolling neonates (≤28 days old) who required tracheal intubation. Trials had to compare a videolaryngoscope with a conventional direct laryngoscope and report at least one clinical outcome such as intubation success, time to intubation, or adverse events.\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, participant demographics, device specifications, and outcomes. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Results were pooled using a random‑effects meta‑analysis when appropriate, and heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic.\n### Risk of Bias and Confidence Assessment\nRisk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for randomized trials. The overall certainty of evidence for each outcome was graded with the GRADE framework, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\n### Outcome Measures\nPrimary effectiveness outcomes included first‑attempt success rate and overall intubation success. Safety outcomes comprised desaturation episodes, bradycardia, airway trauma, and procedure‑related complications. Secondary outcomes such as time to successful intubation and operator satisfaction were also recorded.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 759 intubation attempts in neonates. The studies were conducted in international hospitals and included neonates of either sex, undergoing endotracheal intubation. Different videolaryngoscopy devices, including C-MAC, Airtraq, and Glidescope, were used in the studies. The population characteristics included neonates aged 0 to 28 days. The studies compared videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation in neonates. No information was available on the study funding sources or the duration of the studies. Videolaryngoscopy may increase the success of intubation on the first attempt and may result in fewer intubation attempts, but may not reduce the time required for successful intubation. Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a reduced incidence of airway-related adverse effects.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation, by incomplete reporting of outcomes in some studies, and by the very small sample sizes of the trials, which reduces precision and generalizability.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

Secondly, there are several instances of passive voice, such as \"The evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation\", which should be rephrased as \"We found that the evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation\". Thirdly, some sentences are too long and convoluted, such as \"The review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy in decreasing the time and attempts required for endotracheal intubation and increasing the success rate on the first intubation attempt in neonates\", which should be broken up into shorter sentences.

The PLS evaluation results show that the draft text has several metrics that deviate from typical PLS patterns, including high levels of passive voice, nominalization, and complex words.
