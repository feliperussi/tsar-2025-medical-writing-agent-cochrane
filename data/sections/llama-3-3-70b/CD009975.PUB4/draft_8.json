  "draft": "Is using a special tool with a camera (videolaryngoscopy) better than traditional methods (direct laryngoscopy) for helping newborn babies breathe?\n\nWe need to establish a secure airway in newborn babies during resuscitation. This is crucial because newborns often require endotracheal intubation (putting a tube into the airway to help with breathing) to help them breathe. However, this procedure can be challenging and may lead to complications such as delayed airway stabilization, which can have serious consequences for the baby's health.\n\nThere are two common methods for tracheal intubation in neonates: direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy. Direct laryngoscopy involves using a laryngoscope (a tool to visualize the vocal cords) to visualize the vocal cords and insert the endotracheal tube. Videolaryngoscopy, on the other hand, uses a video camera to provide a clearer view of the airway, which may facilitate successful endotracheal intubation and decrease adverse consequences.\n\nThe key messages from this review are:\n- Videolaryngoscopy may increase the success of intubation on the first attempt and may result in fewer intubation attempts, but it may not reduce the time required for successful intubation.\n- Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a slight reduction in airway trauma during intubation attempts, which could be beneficial for newborn babies.\n- Future research should focus on well-designed studies to confirm the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation in newborn babies, including its potential benefits and harms.\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and clinical trial registries for studies comparing videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy in neonates. We included studies that were randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental designs enrolling neonates (≤28 days old) who required tracheal intubation. Trials had to compare a videolaryngoscope with a conventional direct laryngoscope and report at least one clinical outcome such as intubation success, time to intubation, or adverse events.\n\nWe found 8 studies that involved 759 intubation attempts in neonates. The studies were conducted in international hospitals and included neonates of either sex, undergoing endotracheal intubation. Different videolaryngoscopy devices, including C-MAC, Airtraq, and Glidescope, were used in the studies. Videolaryngoscopy may increase the success of intubation on the first attempt and may result in fewer intubation attempts, but it may not reduce the time required for successful intubation. Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a reduced incidence of airway-related adverse effects.\n\nThe evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation, by incomplete reporting of outcomes in some studies, and by the very small sample sizes of the trials, which reduces precision and generalizability.\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

Additionally, the text uses excessive passive voice and wordy phrases, which can obscure the meaning. The PLS evaluation results show significant deviations from typical patterns, including high nominalization, low Flesch reading ease, and high Flesch-Kincaid grade.
