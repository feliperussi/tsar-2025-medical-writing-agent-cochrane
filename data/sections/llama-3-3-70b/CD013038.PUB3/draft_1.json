  "draft": "# Does exposure to the smell and taste of milk help preterm infants start sucking feeds earlier?\n**Key Messages**\n- Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on the time it takes for preterm infants to start sucking feeds, and no clear difference was found in safety outcomes, including adverse effects, necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies), and late infection, although the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions.\n- The current evidence does not suggest significant benefits or harms of this intervention, but it is important to note that the studies had limitations, such as small sample sizes and methodological issues, which affect the reliability of the findings.\n- Future research should investigate the effects of exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds on important health outcomes, such as feeding skills, safety, and growth, and should aim to address the limitations of the existing studies to provide more robust evidence.\n**Introduction**\n### What is preterm birth and why is feeding a problem?\nPreterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm infants often have trouble feeding because their sucking, swallowing, and breathing muscles are not fully developed. This can lead to feeding intolerance, which means they have trouble digesting food. As a result, these babies may need to be fed through a tube, which can prolong their hospital stay and increase the risk of health problems.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to know if giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they are being tube-fed can help them start sucking feeds sooner. They also wanted to find out if this approach is safe and does not cause any harmful effects. The authors looked at studies that compared preterm infants who were given the smell and taste of milk with those who were not, to see if it made a difference in how quickly they could start sucking feeds and if it affected their health outcomes.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies that evaluated exposure to the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds in preterm infants, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1277 preterm infants. The studies were conducted to assess whether exposure to the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds can accelerate the transition to full sucking feeds without adverse effects in preterm infants. The population characteristics included preterm infants born before 37 weeks' gestation. The studies evaluated exposure versus no exposure to the smell or taste of milk immediately before or at the time of tube feeds. No information was available on the study settings, such as the countries in which they took place, or the study funding sources. Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on time to reach full sucking feeds and time to reach full enteral feeds. The intervention probably makes little to no difference to the risk of late infection. It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis and duration of parenteral nutrition.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment (lack of blinding), and the studies involved different types of people and used different delivery methods for the intervention.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",
