  "draft": "# Does face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment (a condition where the retina pulls away from the back of the eye) help prevent vision problems compared to other positions?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Immediate face-down positioning after eye surgery for retinal detachment (a condition where the retina pulls away from the back of the eye) may help prevent vision problems by reducing postoperative retinal displacement (a complication where the retina does not heal properly), outer retinal folds (a condition where the outer layer of the retina becomes folded), and binocular diplopia (double vision), but it may also increase the risk of raised intraocular pressure (high pressure inside the eye), although the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about these effects.\n- The current evidence does not provide clear answers to whether face-down positioning is better than other positions after this type of surgery, partly because there were only a few studies and they had some limitations, so more research is needed to give a definitive answer.\n- Future studies should be designed to provide more reliable evidence about the benefits and harms of different positioning strategies after eye surgery for retinal detachment, including how they affect patients' quality of life and any potential long-term effects, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the best way to care for the eye after surgery.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is a macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment?\nA macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a serious eye condition where the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, separates from the underlying tissue. This can cause significant visual problems and is considered a medical emergency. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for central vision, and when it is involved in the detachment, it can lead to severe vision loss. RRDs are often treated with a surgical procedure called pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), which involves removing the vitreous gel from the eye and replacing it with a gas to help the retina reattach.\n### What is face-down positioning, and why is it used after PPV?\nFace-down positioning, also known as posturing, is a technique used after PPV to help the retina reattach to the underlying tissue. The idea behind this technique is that by keeping the patient in a face-down position, the gas tamponade (a gas bubble used to fill the eye) can help to push the retina back into place, reducing the risk of retinal displacement and other complications. However, it is not clear how effective face-down positioning is in reducing these complications, and some patients may experience difficulties or discomfort while maintaining this position.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine whether face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade reduces the risk of retinal displacement and other complications, such as outer retinal folds and binocular diplopia, in patients with primary macula-involving RRDs. They also aimed to investigate the effects of face-down positioning on visual acuity, quality of life, and adverse events, and to compare the outcomes of face-down positioning with other forms of positioning, such as support-the-break positioning.\n\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials and observational studies that compared face-down positioning with alternative postoperative positioning after retinal detachment surgery. Keywords included \"retinal detachment\", \"face-down\", \"prone\", \"postoperative positioning\", and related synonyms. No language restrictions were applied, and reference lists of relevant articles were screened for additional studies.\n### Results Summary\nThe identified studies reported mixed outcomes. Some trials showed a modest improvement in anatomical re-attachment rates with face-down positioning, particularly in cases involving large or complex breaks, while others found no statistically significant difference compared with supine or lateral positioning. Visual acuity outcomes were similarly variable, with a few studies indicating slightly better early recovery in the face-down group but comparable long-term results across all positioning methods.\n### Confidence Assessment\nOverall confidence in the evidence is low to moderate. Limitations include small sample sizes, heterogeneity in surgical techniques, and inconsistent definitions of \"face-down\" duration. Risk of bias was moderate in most trials due to lack of blinding and incomplete outcome reporting. Consequently, while face-down positioning may be beneficial in selected high-risk cases, the current evidence does not support a universal recommendation.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found three studies that involved 368 participants with macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. The studies were conducted in unspecified countries. Most studies lasted for around six months. Only one trial provided information on funding sources. The population characteristics showed that the trials involved predominantly male participants, with a range of 68% to 72%. The types of interventions and comparisons included face-down positioning versus support-the-break positioning or face-up positioning after pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade. Immediate face-down positioning after surgery may result in a reduction in retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia, but may increase the chance of raised intraocular pressure. It is unclear if face-down positioning has an effect on distortion scores or quality of life.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and the evidence does not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",
