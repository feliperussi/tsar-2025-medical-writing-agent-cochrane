  "draft": "Is adding ultrasonography to mammography better than mammography alone for finding breast cancer in women at average risk of breast cancer?\n\nKey messages:\n- Adding ultrasonography to mammography may lead to more breast cancer cases being detected in women at average risk, especially in those with dense breasts (breasts with more glandular and fibrous tissue), but it also increases false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.\n- The current evidence does not tell us whether adding ultrasonography to mammography reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer or other causes.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of combined mammography and ultrasonography screening on breast cancer mortality and other important outcomes.\n\nWhat is breast cancer and why is early detection important?\nBreast cancer is a common health problem that affects many women. It occurs when abnormal cells in the breast grow and multiply uncontrollably. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial because it can improve treatment outcomes and save lives. Mammography, which is an X-ray of the breast, is a common screening method used to detect breast cancer at an early stage.\n\nWhat are the current screening methods for breast cancer and their limitations?\nCurrently, mammography is the primary screening method for breast cancer. However, it has some limitations, such as false-negative results, particularly in women with dense breasts. False-negative results occur when the test fails to detect cancer that is actually present. To improve detection rates, some researchers suggest adding ultrasonography, a safe and non-invasive imaging method, to the screening regimen.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of combining mammography with breast ultrasonography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk of breast cancer. They aimed to determine whether this combined approach can detect more breast cancers than mammography alone and whether it can reduce false-negative results and improve treatment outcomes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 209,207 women at average risk of breast cancer. The studies were conducted over a follow-up duration of one to three years. Most of the studies were cohort studies, with only one randomized controlled trial. The population characteristics included women between the ages of 40 and 75, with a proportion of women with dense breasts ranging from 48% to 100%. The studies evaluated the effectiveness of mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography alone for breast cancer screening. The interventions used included digital mammography, breast tomosynthesis, and automated breast ultrasonography. None of the studies reported on the funding sources or the countries in which they took place. Overall, the included studies provided evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of mammography and ultrasonography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk. The addition of ultrasonography to mammography for breast cancer screening probably detects more breast cancer cases than mammography alone. However, it may also lead to more false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies. For women with dense breasts, the combination of mammography and ultrasonography probably detects more cancer cases than mammography alone.\n\nLimitations\nThe studies had very small sample sizes and participants were not randomly assigned to treatment groups, so observed differences could be due to pre-existing differences between people rather than the treatments.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021.",

These include breaking up long sentences, rephrasing passive voice constructions, explaining technical terms, and expanding the limitations section. For instance, the sentence 'The addition of ultrasonography to mammography for breast cancer screening probably detects more breast cancer cases than mammography alone, but it may also lead to more false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies' could be simplified. Additionally, using active voice instead of passive voice, such as changing 'The studies were conducted' to 'Researchers conducted the studies,' would enhance engagement. Providing definitions for terms like 'false-positive results' and 'interval carcinomas' would also improve accessibility. Lastly, discussing the implications of small sample sizes and lack of random assignment in the limitations section is necessary for understanding the findings' reliability and generalizability. Addressing these issues would improve the text's clarity and readability for a broader audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show good conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 44.4% of features in the best quartile (P25/P75) and no critical issues in terms of word count, factual accuracy, or title and subheadings format. However, there are some deviations in metrics such as nouns, smog index, complex words, and long words, which suggest areas for improvement in reducing complexity and enhancing readability. The results support the need for revisions to improve clarity and accessibility, as outlined in the feedback."
