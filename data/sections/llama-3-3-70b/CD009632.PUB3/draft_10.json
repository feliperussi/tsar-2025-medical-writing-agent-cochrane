  "draft": "Is adding ultrasonography to mammography better than mammography alone for finding breast cancer in women at average risk of breast cancer?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that adding ultrasonography to mammography may detect more breast cancer cases in women at average risk, especially in those with dense breasts (breasts with more glandular and fibrous tissue, which can make it harder to detect cancer on a mammogram). However, it also increases false-positive results (when a test incorrectly shows a problem) and unnecessary biopsies (a medical procedure where a sample of tissue is taken for examination).\n- The current evidence does not tell us whether adding ultrasonography to mammography reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer or other causes. We need more research in this area.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of combined mammography and ultrasonography screening on breast cancer mortality (deaths caused by breast cancer) and other important outcomes.\n\nWhat is breast cancer and why is early detection important?\nBreast cancer is a common health problem that affects many women. It occurs when abnormal cells in the breast grow and multiply uncontrollably. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial because it can improve treatment outcomes and save lives. Mammography (a type of breast x-ray) is a common screening method used to detect breast cancer at an early stage.\n\nWhat are the current screening methods for breast cancer and their limitations?\nCurrently, mammography is the primary screening method for breast cancer. However, it has some limitations, such as false-negative results (when the test fails to detect cancer that is actually present), particularly in women with dense breasts. To improve detection rates, some researchers suggest adding ultrasonography (a safe and non-invasive imaging method that uses sound waves) to the screening regimen.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of combining mammography with breast ultrasonography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk of breast cancer. We aimed to determine whether this combined approach can detect more breast cancers than mammography alone and whether it can reduce false-negative results and improve treatment outcomes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 209,207 women at average risk of breast cancer. The studies were conducted over a follow-up duration of 1 to 3 years. Most of the studies were cohort studies, with only 1 randomised controlled trial. The population characteristics included women between the ages of 40 and 75, with a proportion of women with dense breasts ranging from 48% to 100%. The studies evaluated the effectiveness of mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography alone for breast cancer screening. The addition of ultrasonography to mammography for breast cancer screening probably detects more breast cancer cases than mammography alone. However, it may also lead to more false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies. For women with dense breasts, the combination of mammography and ultrasonography probably detects more cancer cases than mammography alone.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies had small sample sizes and participants were not randomly assigned to treatment groups, so observed differences could be due to pre-existing differences between people rather than the treatments.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several clarity issues, including unexplained jargon, long sentences, and missing context. For example, the sentence 'The addition of ultrasonography to mammography for breast cancer screening probably detects more breast cancer cases than mammography alone' is unclear because it does not define what 'probably detects' means. A suggested rewrite could be 'Adding ultrasonography to mammography may find more breast cancer cases than mammography alone.' Another issue is the use of passive voice, such as 'The studies were conducted over a follow-up duration of one to three years,' which could be rewritten as 'We conducted the studies over one to three years.' The metrics support these findings, showing 7 instances of passive voice and 105 complex words, which are both higher than typical PLS patterns. To improve, the writer should simplify language, define technical terms, and use active voice.",

However, there are 2 features that deviate from typical patterns: nouns (190.0, P90) and complex_words_dc (243.0, P90). The writer should focus on reducing these deviations to improve the clarity and readability of the text."
