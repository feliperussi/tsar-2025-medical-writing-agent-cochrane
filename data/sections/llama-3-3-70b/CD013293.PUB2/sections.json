  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear which treatment is best for blocked dialysis access (a condition where the arteriovenous fistula or graft, which are used for dialysis in people with kidney disease, become blocked) in terms of benefits and unwanted effects (such as infections or further complications).",
    "The review suggests that surgical procedures may have some benefits over mechanical methods for clearing blockages, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and more research is needed to understand the effects of different treatments.",
    "Future studies should investigate the best ways to treat blocked dialysis access, including comparing different techniques and considering the potential harms and benefits, to provide clearer guidance for people with kidney disease and their healthcare providers."

      "content": "Patients with kidney disease often require haemodialysis, a treatment that filters waste products from the blood when the kidneys are no longer able to perform this function. To undergo haemodialysis, patients need a way for the dialysis machine to access their bloodstream. This is typically done through an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG), which are surgically created connections between an artery and a vein. However, these connections can sometimes become blocked, or 'thrombosed', which prevents haemodialysis from working properly. Thrombosis can lead to serious complications, including infections, central venous occlusions, and recurrent hospitalizations. Current treatments for thrombosed AVF and AVG include thrombectomy (removing the blockage) and thrombolysis (dissolving the blockage), but it's unclear which treatment is most effective."

      "content": "The authors of this review wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for treating thrombosed arteriovenous fistulas and grafts in patients undergoing haemodialysis. They aimed to establish which interventions are most effective in restoring the function of the AVF or AVG, and which have the fewest adverse effects. The authors also wanted to assess the quality of the evidence for each intervention, to help guide clinical decision-making and future research."

      "content": "We found 14 studies that involved 1176 people with thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts. The studies were conducted in various countries around the world, although the specific countries are not mentioned. Most of the included studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, low number of patients, and industry involvement. The studies compared different types of interventions, including thrombectomy, thrombolysis, and surgical procedures. It is unclear if interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts have an effect on outcomes such as failure, primary patency at 30 days, technical success, and adverse events. Surgical procedures may improve primary patency at 30 days compared to mechanical thrombectomy, but the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.",
