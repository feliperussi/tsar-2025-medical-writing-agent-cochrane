However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are not effective and can be harmful. Despite this, they are still widely used in care homes and other long-term care settings. This can lead to serious adverse events, such as death or serious injuries, and can also have a negative impact on the quality of life of older people.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effects of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who require long-term care. They aimed to find out which interventions are most effective in reducing the use of physical restraints, and whether these interventions can also improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of adverse events for older people in long-term care settings.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on preventing and reducing physical restraints in long-term care, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the effects of interventions.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 19,003 participants. All studies were conducted in long-term residential care facilities, and the mean age of the participants was approximately 85 years. The studies investigated various interventions, including organisational interventions aiming to implement a least-restraint policy, simple educational interventions, and an intervention that provided staff with information about residents' fall risk. The control groups received usual care only in most studies, although in two studies, additional information materials about physical restraint reduction were provided. We did not find any studies conducted in community settings. Organisational interventions probably reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings. These interventions may lead to a large reduction in the number of residents with physical restraints. Simple educational interventions may have little to no effect on the use of physical restraints, and interventions providing information about residents' fall risk may also have little to no effect.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sizes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant populations and intervention delivery methods.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.",
