  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings?\n\n- We found that organisational interventions, which involve changing how care is provided and managed, probably reduce the use of physical restraints without causing harm. \n- Simple educational interventions, which teach staff about the risks of restraints, may have little effect on reducing restraint use. \n- Future research should look at reducing physical restraint use in community settings and explore ways to reduce restraints that are tailored to individual residents' needs.\n\nWhat is the problem of physical restraints in long-term care settings?\nPhysical restraints, such as bedrails and belts in chairs or beds, are commonly used for older people receiving long-term care. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are not effective and can be harmful. \n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effects of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who require long-term care. \n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 19,003 participants. All studies were conducted in long-term residential care facilities. The studies investigated various interventions, including organisational interventions and simple educational interventions. \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding and very small study sizes. \n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.",
