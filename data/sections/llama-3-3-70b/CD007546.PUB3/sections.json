  "key_messages": [
    "Organisational interventions (changes in how care is provided and managed) aimed at reducing the use of physical restraints (such as bedrails or belts) in long-term care settings probably reduce the number of older people restrained, without causing harm, although the quality of the evidence is not strong.",
    "Simple educational interventions (teaching staff about the risks of restraints) may have little effect on reducing restraint use, and we are uncertain about their benefits and harms due to a lack of good-quality evidence.",
    "Future research should investigate the effects of interventions to reduce physical restraint use in community settings, and explore ways to reduce restraints that are tailored to individual residents' needs and circumstances, as the current evidence mainly applies to care homes and residential facilities."

      "subheading": "What is the problem of physical restraints in long-term care settings?",
      "content": "Physical restraints, such as bedrails and belts in chairs or beds, are commonly used for older people receiving long-term care. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are not effective and can be harmful. Despite this, they are still widely used in care homes and other long-term care settings. This can lead to serious adverse events, such as death or serious injuries, and can also have a negative impact on the quality of life of older people."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to evaluate the effects of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who require long-term care. They aimed to find out which interventions are most effective in reducing the use of physical restraints, and whether these interventions can also improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of adverse events for older people in long-term care settings."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 11 studies that involved 19,003 participants. All studies were conducted in long-term residential care facilities, and the mean age of the participants was approximately 85 years. The studies investigated various interventions, including organisational interventions aiming to implement a least-restraint policy, simple educational interventions, and an intervention that provided staff with information about residents' fall risk. The control groups received usual care only in most studies, although in two studies, additional information materials about physical restraint reduction were provided. We did not find any studies conducted in community settings. Organisational interventions probably reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings. These interventions may lead to a large reduction in the number of residents with physical restraints. Simple educational interventions may have little to no effect on the use of physical restraints, and interventions providing information about residents' fall risk may also have little to no effect."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sizes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant populations and intervention delivery methods.",
