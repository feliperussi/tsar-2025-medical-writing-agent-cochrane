  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers?\n\nWe looked at studies on individual-level stress interventions for healthcare workers. These interventions may help reduce stress symptoms, but the quality of the evidence is not strong. We need more research to confirm this.\n\nThe evidence is uncertain about which type of intervention is more effective. There is also a lack of information on the long-term effects of these interventions. This highlights the need for better-designed studies with larger sample sizes to increase the certainty of the evidence.\n\nFuture research should prioritize studying the long-term effects of individual-level stress management interventions. It should also focus on interventions that address work-related risk factors. This will provide more definitive answers to the question of what are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.\n\nWhat is occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers often experience work-related stress due to an imbalance of demands, skills, and social support at work. This can lead to stress, burnout, and psychosomatic problems, ultimately affecting the quality of service provision. Occupational stress is a significant concern in the healthcare industry. It's essential to address this issue to ensure the well-being of healthcare workers and the quality of care they provide.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nVarious interventions can help reduce occupational stress in healthcare workers. These interventions can be categorized into four main types: \n- focusing on the experience of stress (helping individuals understand and manage their stress)\n- focusing away from the experience of stress (helping individuals relax and disengage from stress)\n- altering work-related risk factors on an individual level\n- combining two or more of these approaches. \nExamples of interventions include stress management training, mindfulness-based programs, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of individual-level interventions in reducing stress symptoms in healthcare workers. They compared these interventions to no intervention, wait-list, placebo, or other types of stress-reduction interventions. The authors also investigated the effects of different types of interventions, such as focusing on the experience of stress, focusing away from the experience of stress, and combining multiple approaches. Additionally, they examined the short-term, medium-term, and long-term effects of these interventions on stress symptoms in healthcare workers.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 117 studies that involved 11,119 healthcare workers. The studies were conducted from 2013 up to February 2022. Most studies lasted for up to three months after the intervention ended, with some lasting up to 12 months after the intervention ended, and a few with long-term follow-up of more than 12 months after the intervention ended. Interventions that help individuals understand and manage their stress may reduce stress symptoms. Interventions that help individuals relax and disengage from stress may also reduce stress symptoms. Combining interventions may be beneficial in reducing stress symptoms. However, it is unclear if interventions focusing on work-related risk factors have an effect on stress symptoms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (risk of bias) and the studies were very small, reducing reliability and precision.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several clarity issues, including unexplained jargon, long sentences, and the missing context. For example, the sentence 'The evidence is uncertain about which type of intervention is more effective' is unclear because it does not define what 'evidence' refers to. A suggested rewrite could be 'The research findings are uncertain about which type of intervention is more effective.' Another issue is the use of passive voice, such as 'The studies were conducted from 2013 up to February 2022,' which could be rephrased as 'Researchers conducted the studies from 2013 to February 2022.' The metrics also show a high number of nominalizations (24.0) and nouns (191.0), which can make the text harder to read. A rewrite could involve using more verbs and simplifying sentences. For instance, 'The review authors aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of individual-level interventions' could be rephrased as 'We evaluated how well individual-level interventions work.'.",
