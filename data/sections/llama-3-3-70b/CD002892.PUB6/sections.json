  "key_messages": [
    "Individual-level stress interventions, such as those that focus on the experience of stress (thoughts, feelings, behaviour) or away from the experience of stress (e.g., relaxing, exercise), may reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers, although the quality of the evidence is not strong and more research is needed to confirm this.",
    "The evidence is uncertain about which type of intervention is more effective, and there is a lack of information on the long-term effects of these interventions, highlighting the need for better-designed studies with larger sample sizes to increase the certainty of the evidence.",
    "Future research should prioritize studying the long-term effects of individual-level stress management interventions, as well as interventions that focus on work-related risk factors, to provide more definitive answers to the question of what are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers."

      "subheading": "What is occupational stress in healthcare workers?",
      "content": "Healthcare workers often experience work-related stress due to an imbalance of demands, skills, and social support at work. This can lead to stress, burnout, and psychosomatic problems, ultimately affecting the quality of service provision. Occupational stress is a significant concern in the healthcare industry, and it's essential to address this issue to ensure the well-being of healthcare workers and the quality of care they provide."

      "subheading": "What are the common interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers?",
      "content": "Various interventions can help reduce occupational stress in healthcare workers. These interventions can be categorized into four main types: focusing on the experience of stress, focusing away from the experience of stress, altering work-related risk factors on an individual level, and combining two or more of these approaches. Examples of interventions include stress management training, mindfulness-based programs, and cognitive-behavioral therapy."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of individual-level interventions in reducing stress symptoms in healthcare workers. They compared these interventions to no intervention, wait-list, placebo, or other types of stress-reduction interventions. The authors also investigated the effects of different types of interventions, such as focusing on the experience of stress, focusing away from the experience of stress, and combining multiple approaches. Additionally, they examined the short-term, medium-term, and long-term effects of these interventions on stress symptoms in healthcare workers."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 117 studies that involved 11,119 healthcare workers. The studies were conducted from 2013 up to February 2022. Most studies lasted for up to three months after the intervention ended, with some lasting up to 12 months after the intervention ended, and a few with long-term follow-up of more than 12 months after the intervention ended. The review did not provide information on the funding sources of the studies. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific countries were not mentioned. The types of interventions included those that focus on the experience of stress, those that focus away from the experience of stress, those that alter work-related risk factors on an individual level, and combinations of these interventions. The comparisons included no intervention, wait list, placebo, no stress-reduction intervention, or another type of stress-reduction intervention. Interventions focusing on the experience of stress may reduce stress symptoms. Interventions focusing away from the experience of stress may also reduce stress symptoms. Combining interventions may be beneficial in reducing stress symptoms. However, it is unclear if interventions focusing on work-related risk factors have an effect on stress symptoms."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (risk of bias) and the studies were very small, reducing reliability and precision.",
