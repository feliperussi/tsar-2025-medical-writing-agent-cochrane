  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers?\n\nWe looked at studies on individual-level stress interventions for healthcare workers. These interventions may help reduce stress symptoms, but the quality of the evidence is not strong. We need more research to confirm this.\n\nWhat is occupational stress in healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers often feel overwhelmed and stressed at work because their jobs demand too much, their skills are not used effectively, and they do not receive enough support from their colleagues and managers. This can lead to stress, burnout, and psychosomatic problems, ultimately affecting the quality of service provision. Occupational stress is a significant concern in the healthcare industry, and it's essential to address this issue to ensure the well-being of healthcare workers and the quality of care they provide.\n\nWhat are the common interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers?\n- Focusing on the experience of stress (helping individuals understand and manage their stress)\n- Focusing away from the experience of stress (helping individuals relax and disengage from stress)\n- Altering work-related risk factors on an individual level\n- Combining two or more of these approaches\nExamples of interventions include stress management training, mindfulness-based programs, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe evaluated how well individual-level interventions work. We compared these interventions to no intervention, wait-list, placebo, or other types of stress-reduction interventions. We also investigated the effects of different types of interventions, such as focusing on the experience of stress, focusing away from the experience of stress, and combining multiple approaches. Additionally, we examined the short-term, medium-term, and long-term effects of these interventions on stress symptoms in healthcare workers.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 117 studies that involved 11,119 healthcare workers. Researchers conducted the studies from 2013 to February 2022. Most studies lasted for up to three months after the intervention ended, with some lasting up to 12 months after the intervention ended, and a few with long-term follow-up of more than 12 months after the intervention ended. Interventions that help individuals understand and manage their stress may reduce stress symptoms. Interventions that help individuals relax and disengage from stress may also reduce stress symptoms. Combining interventions may be beneficial in reducing stress symptoms. However, it is unclear if interventions focusing on work-related risk factors have an effect on stress symptoms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies were very small, reducing reliability and precision.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Individual-level stress interventions, such as those that focus on the experience of stress or away from the experience of stress, may reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers, although the quality of the evidence is not strong and more research is needed to confirm this.\n- The evidence is uncertain about which type of intervention is more effective, and there is a lack of information on the long-term effects of these interventions, highlighting the need for better-designed studies with larger sample sizes to increase the certainty of the evidence.\n- Future research should prioritize studying the long-term effects of individual-level stress management interventions, as well as interventions that focus on work-related risk factors, to provide more definitive answers to the question of what are the best ways to reduce stress in healthcare workers.",

For example, the sentence 'Healthcare workers often feel overwhelmed and stressed at work because their jobs demand too much, their skills are not used effectively, and they do not receive enough support from their colleagues and managers.' could be simplified. Additionally, the use of passive voice, such as 'The evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received,' should be converted to active voice. The draft could also benefit from more precise language and definitions for technical terms. The PLS evaluation results show good conformity with typical PLS patterns but highlight areas for improvement, particularly in reducing nominalization, noun usage, and improving certain readability indices.",

However, there are deviations in nominalization, noun usage, and certain readability indices, such as the smog index, complex words, and long words, which are above the typical ranges, suggesting a need for simplification and improvement in these areas to enhance readability and clarity."
