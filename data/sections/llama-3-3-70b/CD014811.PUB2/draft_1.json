  "draft": "# Is continuous infusion of loop diuretics (a type of medicine given through a vein to help remove excess fluid) more effective than bolus injection (a single dose of medicine given through a vein) for treating acute heart failure?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Continuous infusion of loop diuretics (a type of medicine given through a vein to help remove excess fluid) may result in slightly more weight loss compared to bolus injection (a single dose of medicine given through a vein) for treating acute heart failure, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and there is little to no difference in terms of mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission, or occurrence of acute kidney injury (a sudden loss of kidney function) between the two methods.\n- The current evidence does not show a clear advantage of one method over the other, and more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for acute heart failure, particularly in terms of long-term effects and potential harmful effects, such as ototoxicity (hearing loss due to medication) or hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure).\n- Future studies should aim to provide higher-quality evidence by including more participants, measuring outcomes over a longer period, and assessing the effects of these treatments in different patient populations, which would help healthcare providers make more informed decisions about the best treatment approach for acute heart failure.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is acute heart failure and why is it a problem?\nAcute heart failure (AHF) is a condition where the heart suddenly stops working properly, leading to a buildup of fluid in the body. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. AHF is a serious condition that requires urgent medical attention. Treatment often involves the use of diuretics, which are medicines that help remove excess fluid from the body.\n### What are the common treatments for acute heart failure?\nThe most common treatment for AHF is the use of loop diuretics, which are given through a vein (intravenously) to help remove excess fluid from the body. There are two main ways to give loop diuretics: as a continuous infusion, where the medicine is given slowly over a period of time, or as a bolus injection, where the medicine is given all at once.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether giving loop diuretics as a continuous infusion or as a bolus injection is more effective in treating AHF. They looked at the effects of these two different methods on outcomes such as weight loss, mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission to hospital, and the occurrence of acute kidney injury.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics for acute heart failure, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 7 studies that involved 681 people with acute heart failure. The studies were conducted in 32 hospitals across 7 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. The duration of the studies ranged from 8 months to 6 years. The population characteristics included adults with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification III or IV and fluid overload. The studies compared intravenous continuous infusion of loop diuretics with intermittent bolus injection in acute heart failure. No information was available on the funding sources of the studies. Continuous infusion of loop diuretics may result in a bit more weight loss than bolus injection, but it is unclear if this treatment has an effect on outcome. There may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission to hospital, and occurrence of acute kidney injury between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",
