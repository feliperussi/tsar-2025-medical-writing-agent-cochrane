  "draft": "Is continuous infusion of loop diuretics (a type of medicine given through a vein to help remove excess fluid) more effective than bolus injection (a single dose of medicine given through a vein) for treating acute heart failure?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that continuous infusion of loop diuretics may result in slightly more weight loss compared to bolus injection for treating acute heart failure. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- There is little to no difference in terms of mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission, or occurrence of acute kidney injury (a sudden loss of kidney function) between the two methods.\n- The current evidence does not show a clear advantage of one method over the other. More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for acute heart failure.\n\nWhat is acute heart failure and why is it a problem?\nAcute heart failure is a condition where the heart suddenly stops working properly, leading to a buildup of fluid in the body. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. Acute heart failure is a serious condition that requires urgent medical attention.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for acute heart failure?\nThe most common treatment for acute heart failure is the use of loop diuretics, which are given through a vein (intravenously) to help remove excess fluid from the body. There are two main ways to give loop diuretics: as a continuous infusion, where the medicine is given slowly over a period of time, or as a bolus injection, where the medicine is given all at once.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether continuous infusion or bolus injection of loop diuretics is more effective for treating acute heart failure. We looked at the effects of these two different methods on outcomes such as weight loss, mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission to hospital, and the occurrence of acute kidney injury.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics for acute heart failure, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWe found 7 studies that involved 681 people with acute heart failure. The studies were conducted in 32 hospitals across 7 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. Continuous infusion of loop diuretics may result in a bit more weight loss than bolus injection, but it is unclear if this treatment has an effect on outcome. There may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission to hospital, and occurrence of acute kidney injury between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",
