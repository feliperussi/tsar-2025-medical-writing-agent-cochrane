  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether exercise can help people with chronic venous insufficiency (a condition where veins have problems returning blood to the heart, which can lead to symptoms such as swelling, pain, and skin changes) manage their symptoms, and there is limited information available on potential harmful effects.",
    "The current evidence does not provide a clear answer to whether exercise improves symptoms or quality of life for people with chronic venous insufficiency, highlighting the need for further research in this area.",
    "Future research should focus on investigating the effects of different types of exercise (such as intensity, frequency, and duration) on chronic venous insufficiency symptoms, as well as considering factors like sample size, study design, and disease severity to provide more reliable and generalizable findings."

      "subheading": "What is chronic venous insufficiency?",
      "content": "Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition where the veins in the legs do not work properly, which can lead to symptoms such as pain, swelling, and skin changes. It can also increase the risk of developing venous leg ulcers. CVI is a common problem that can affect people's quality of life."

      "subheading": "Why is it important to find effective treatments for chronic venous insufficiency?",
      "content": "CVI can have a significant impact on a person's daily life, causing discomfort, pain, and mobility problems. Common treatments for CVI include compression stockings, elevation of the legs, and in some cases, surgery. However, these treatments may not be effective for everyone, and some people may experience side effects or complications."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out whether physical exercise programmes can help improve symptoms and quality of life for people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency. They also wanted to investigate the potential benefits and harms of physical exercise for this condition."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found five studies that involved 146 people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency. The studies compared a physical exercise group with a control group that did not perform a structured exercise programme. The exercise protocols differed between studies. The studies were conducted over various durations, with some reporting outcomes at six months and others at eight weeks. The population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources were not consistently reported across the studies. The interventions included physical exercise programmes, but the specific types and comparisons varied. It is unclear if physical exercise has an effect on the intensity of signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency. We do not know if physical exercise has an effect on ejection fraction. It is unclear if physical exercise improves venous refilling time. We are uncertain if physical exercise alters health-related quality of life. It is unclear if physical exercise has an effect on exercise capacity. We do not know if physical exercise increases muscle strength. It is unclear if physical exercise has an effect on ankle mobility."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.",
