  "draft": "What are the best dressings and securement devices to prevent complications in people with peripheral arterial catheters (small tubes used to monitor blood, inserted into an artery)?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the best dressings and securement devices for preventing complications in people with peripheral arterial catheters, including the risk of infection (when bacteria or other germs enter the body) or catheter failure (when the tube does not work properly).\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in the effectiveness of different types of dressings and securement devices, such as standard polyurethane (a type of plastic material), bordered polyurethane, or integrated securement dressings, in preventing complications.\n- Further research is needed to reduce uncertainty around the use of dressing and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters, including studies that compare different types of devices and measure important outcomes, such as catheter failure and infection rates, over longer periods of time.\n\nWhat are peripheral arterial catheters?\nPeripheral arterial catheters are small tubes used to collect blood samples or monitor blood pressure in critically ill patients or those undergoing surgery. They are commonly used in intensive care units and operating rooms. However, these catheters can sometimes fail or become dislodged, leading to complications such as infection, bleeding, or nerve damage. To prevent these complications, dressings and securement devices are used to keep the catheter in place and maintain its function.\n\nWhat problems do peripheral arterial catheters cause?\nDespite their importance, peripheral arterial catheters often fail, requiring reinsertion, which can be painful and increase the risk of complications. Infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), can also occur. Furthermore, the catheter can become dislodged or occluded, leading to inaccurate blood pressure readings or requiring additional medical procedures to correct. These complications can lead to longer hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and a higher risk of morbidity and mortality.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of dressings and securement devices in preventing complications, such as catheter failure, infection, and dislodgement, in people with peripheral arterial catheters. We aimed to determine which types of dressings and securement devices are most effective in maintaining catheter function and preventing complications, and to identify the best ways to secure and dress peripheral arterial catheters to minimize the risk of adverse events.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 5 studies that involved 1228 people with peripheral arterial catheters. The studies compared different dressing and securement devices, including standard polyurethane, bordered polyurethane, sutureless securement devices, and integrated securement dressings. Different dressing and securement devices may not significantly reduce the risk of catheter failure, infection, dislodgement, or occlusion. However, the current evidence is limited and further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the included studies were very small and do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.\n\nWe searched for studies comparing different dressing and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We included 5 studies with 1228 participants and found that the use of different dressing and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters may make little to no difference in the risk of catheter failure, infection, dislodgement, or occlusion. However, the current evidence is limited and further research is needed to confirm these findings.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains some unexplained technical terms, such as \"catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI)\" and \"nominalization\", which may confuse readers who are not familiar with these terms. Additionally, some sentences are too long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. For example, the sentence \"We found 5 studies that involved 1228 people with peripheral arterial catheters, and the studies were conducted in various settings and compared different dressing and securement devices, including standard polyurethane, bordered polyurethane, sutureless securement devices, and integrated securement dressings.\" could be broken up into simpler sentences. Furthermore, the text could benefit from more active voice constructions, as the current draft has 18 passive voice instances, which is higher than the typical PLS range. The metrics also show that the draft has a high number of complex words, long words, and nouns, which can make the text harder to understand. To improve the draft, I suggest rewriting problematic sentences, using more active voice constructions, and simplifying technical terms. For instance, the sentence \"The evidence is limited because the included studies were very small and do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\" could be rephrased as \"Our findings are limited by the small size of the included studies and the lack of diversity in the populations, interventions, and outcomes examined.\"",
