  "draft": "# What are the best dressings and securement devices to prevent complications in people with peripheral arterial catheters (small tubes used to monitor blood, inserted into an artery)?\n**Key Messages**\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the best dressings and securement devices for preventing complications in people with peripheral arterial catheters (small tubes used to monitor blood, inserted into an artery), including the risk of infection (when bacteria or other germs enter the body) or catheter failure (when the tube does not work properly).\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in the effectiveness of different types of dressings and securement devices, such as standard polyurethane (a type of plastic material), bordered polyurethane, or integrated securement dressings, in preventing complications.\n- Further research is needed to reduce uncertainty around the use of dressing and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters, including studies that compare different types of devices and measure important outcomes, such as catheter failure and infection rates, over longer periods of time.\n**Introduction**\n### What is peripheral arterial catheterisation and why is it important?\nPeripheral arterial catheters (ACs) are small tubes inserted into an artery in the arm or leg to collect blood samples or monitor blood pressure in people who are critically ill or undergoing surgery. They are commonly used in intensive care units and operating rooms. However, these catheters can sometimes fail or become dislodged, leading to complications such as infection, bleeding, or nerve damage. To prevent these complications, dressings and securement devices are used to keep the catheter in place and maintain its function.\n### What are the problems with peripheral arterial catheters?\nDespite their importance, peripheral arterial catheters often fail, requiring reinsertion, which can be painful and increase the risk of complications. Infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), can also occur. Furthermore, the catheter can become dislodged or occluded, leading to inaccurate blood pressure readings or requiring additional medical procedures to correct. These complications can lead to longer hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and a higher risk of morbidity and mortality.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of dressings and securement devices in preventing complications, such as catheter failure, infection, and dislodgement, in people with peripheral arterial catheters. They wanted to determine which types of dressings and securement devices are most effective in maintaining catheter function and preventing complications, and to identify the best ways to secure and dress peripheral arterial catheters to minimize the risk of adverse events.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing different dressing and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 5 studies that involved 1228 people with peripheral arterial catheters. The studies were conducted in various settings and compared different dressing and securement devices, including standard polyurethane, bordered polyurethane, sutureless securement devices, and integrated securement dressings. The total duration of the studies is not specified in the abstract. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, are not reported. The studies were likely conducted in different countries, but the specific locations are not mentioned. The funding sources for the studies are also not specified. The use of different dressing and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters may make little to no difference in the risk of catheter failure, infection, dislodgement, or occlusion. However, the current evidence is limited and further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the included studies were very small and do not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains many technical terms without definitions, such as \"peripheral arterial catheters\" and \"catheter-related bloodstream infections\", which may confuse readers who are not familiar with medical terminology. For example, the sentence \"Peripheral arterial catheters (ACs) are small tubes inserted into an artery in the arm or leg to collect blood samples or monitor blood pressure in people who are critically ill or undergoing surgery\" could be rewritten to include a brief explanation of what peripheral arterial catheters are and why they are used. Secondly, some sentences are too long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. For instance, the sentence \"The review authors aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of dressings and securement devices in preventing complications, such as catheter failure, infection, and dislodgement, in people with peripheral arterial catheters\" could be broken up into shorter sentences for better clarity. Thirdly, the text could benefit from more active voice constructions, as the current draft has 26 instances of passive voice, which can make the text seem less engaging and more difficult to read. Additionally, the text contains some wordy phrases, such as \"during the course of\", which could be simplified to \"during\". The metrics also show that the text has a high number of complex words, long words, and nominalizations, which can negatively impact readability. To address these issues, the writer could consider using simpler language, breaking up long sentences, and using more active voice constructions. Overall, while the draft provides a good overview of the topic, it needs significant revisions to improve its clarity, readability, and overall quality.",
