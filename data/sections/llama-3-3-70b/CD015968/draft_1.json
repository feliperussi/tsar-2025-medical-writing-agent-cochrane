  "draft": "# Can mobile apps and wearables help kids with obesity lose weight alongside regular care?\n**Key Messages**\n- Digital interventions, such as mobile apps and wearables (computer programs or devices that can be worn on the body to track activity or health), combined with regular care may have a small benefit in helping children and adolescents with obesity lose weight, although the effect on other important outcomes is unclear and no harmful effects were reported in the studies.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong enough to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of using digital health technology for obesity management in young people, partly because the studies were generally small and did not last very long.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of digital interventions, report results separately for different ages and groups of people, and assess important outcomes such as adverse events (unwanted or harmful effects) to better inform decisions about using these technologies to help children and adolescents with obesity.\n**Introduction**\n### What is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?\nChildhood obesity is a worldwide public health problem that increases the risk of chronic diseases. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were living with overweight or obesity. This condition can lead to various health issues, including an increased risk of developing conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. Common treatments for childhood obesity often involve a combination of dietary changes, increased physical activity, and behavioral support.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects and safety of digital health interventions, such as mobile phone applications, telehealth, and wearable devices, for the management of obesity in children and adolescents. They aimed to compare the effectiveness of these digital interventions when used alone or in combination with conventional care, compared to conventional care alone. The authors also sought to evaluate the effects of digital interventions on various outcomes, including body mass index, physical activity, and mental well-being.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on digital health interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects and safety of these interventions.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 15 studies that involved 911 participants with obesity. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including the USA, Sweden, Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland, and Thailand. Most studies involved participants aged 10 to 19 years old, with some also including younger children. The studies lasted for varying durations, with nine classified as short duration (less than six months) and six as long duration (six or more months). The interventions included digital health technologies such as wearable or implantable devices, web-based interventions, text messages, mobile phone or tablet applications, exergaming or active video gaming, and telehealth, often in combination with conventional care. Comparisons were made between digital health technology plus conventional care versus conventional care alone, and digital technology alone versus conventional care alone. No information was available on the funding sources of the studies. Digital interventions combined with conventional care may lead to a slight reduction in fat mass in children and adolescents. However, the effect on other outcomes is unclear. It is also unclear if digital interventions alone have any effect on the outcomes reported.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (risk of bias), and not all studies reported data on every outcome of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025.",
