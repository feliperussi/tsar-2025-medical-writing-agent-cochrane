  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\n- Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow) may prolong remission (a period where the disease is not getting worse) and survival, but it can also cause unwanted effects such as infections, fatigue (feeling extremely tired), and a higher risk of other health problems.\n- Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that helps the immune system fight cancer) and immunomodulatory drugs (medicines that help the immune system work better) may improve progression-free survival (the length of time during and after treatment that the disease does not get worse), but they may also increase the risk of serious side effects, highlighting the need for careful consideration of the benefits and risks for each individual.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, including the benefits and harms of different treatments, and to identify the most effective and safe options for people with this condition, particularly in the long term.\n\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why is it a problem?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of lymphoproliferative disease in adults and currently remains incurable. As the progression-free period shortens after each successive treatment, strategies such as maintenance therapy are needed to improve the degree and duration of response to previous therapies. People with CLL who achieve remission after previous therapy may choose to undergo medical observation or maintenance therapy to deepen the response.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects and safety of maintenance therapy, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, immunomodulatory drug therapy, anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and B-cell lymphoma-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for individuals with CLL. They aimed to determine the benefits and harms of these treatments, including their impact on overall survival, health-related quality of life, grade 3 and 4 adverse events, progression-free survival, treatment-related mortality, treatment discontinuation, and all adverse events.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing maintenance therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We conducted a comprehensive literature search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language or publication status restrictions. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three trials registers in January 2022 together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe identified 11 RCTs (2393 participants) that met the inclusion criteria, including seven trials comparing anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (rituximab or ofatumumab) with observation in 1679 participants; three trials comparing immunomodulatory drug (lenalidomide) with placebo/observation in 693 participants; and one trial comparing anti-CD 52 mAbs (alemtuzumab) with observation in 21 participants. Anti-CD20 mAbs maintenance likely results in little to no difference in overall survival (OS) and likely increases progression-free survival (PFS) significantly compared to observation alone. Anti-CD20 mAbs may result in an increase in grade 3/4 adverse events and all adverse events compared to the observation group.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest. The risk of selection bias in the included studies was unclear. We assessed overall risk of performance bias and detection bias as low risk for objective outcomes and high risk for subjective outcomes. Overall risk of attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias was low.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains some unexplained technical terms, such as \"anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies\" and \"immunomodulatory drugs\", which may confuse readers who are not familiar with these terms. Additionally, some sentences are too long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. For example, the sentence \"Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow) may prolong remission (a period where the disease is not getting worse) and survival, but it can also cause unwanted effects such as infections, fatigue (feeling extremely tired), and a higher risk of other health problems.\" could be broken up into simpler sentences. Furthermore, the text could benefit from more active voice constructions, as the current draft relies heavily on passive voice. The metrics also show that the text has a high number of complex words, long words, and nominalizations, which can make it harder to understand. To improve the text, I suggest rewriting problematic sentences, defining technical terms, and using more active voice constructions. For instance, the sentence \"The review authors wanted to assess the effects and safety of maintenance therapy, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, immunomodulatory drug therapy, anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and B-cell lymphoma-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for individuals with CLL.\" could be rephrased as \"We wanted to find out how well maintenance therapy works for people with CLL, including treatments like anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs.\"",
