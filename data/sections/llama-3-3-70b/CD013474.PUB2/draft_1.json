It is the most common type of lymphoproliferative disease in adults and currently remains incurable. As the progression-free period shortens after each successive treatment, strategies such as maintenance therapy are needed to improve the degree and duration of response to previous therapies. People with CLL who achieve remission after previous therapy may choose to undergo medical observation or maintenance therapy to deepen the response.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects and safety of maintenance therapy, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, immunomodulatory drug therapy, anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and B-cell lymphoma-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for individuals with CLL. They aimed to determine the benefits and harms of these treatments, including their impact on overall survival, health-related quality of life, grade 3 and 4 adverse events, progression-free survival, treatment-related mortality, treatment discontinuation, and all adverse events.\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing maintenance therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\nReason for Termination\nThe agent stopped because it reached the maximum number of iterations allowed by the system configuration. This limit prevents infinite loops and ensures resources are managed effectively.\nNext Steps\nTo continue, you can restart the process with a higher iteration limit, break the task into smaller parts, or adjust the logic to converge more quickly.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

For example, the title should be rephrased from \"Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia can prolong remission and survival, but may cause side effects like infections, fatigue, and higher risk of other health problems\" to \"What are the benefits and risks of maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\" Secondly, there are several instances of unexplained jargon and technical terms without definitions, such as \"anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies\" and \"immunomodulatory drugs\", which need to be defined for patients. Thirdly, some sentences are too long and the first sentence in the introduction should be broken up for better clarity. Lastly, the draft exceeds the recommended word count of 850 words. The PLS evaluation results show significant deviations from typical patterns, including high rates of passive voice, nominalization, and complex words, which contribute to the clarity issues. To improve, the writer should focus on using active voice, defining technical terms, breaking up long sentences, and reducing word count.",
