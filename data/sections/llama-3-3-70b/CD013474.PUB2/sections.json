  "key_messages": [
    "Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow) may prolong remission (a period where the disease is not getting worse) and survival, but it can also cause unwanted effects such as infections, fatigue (feeling extremely tired), and a higher risk of other health problems.",
    "Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that helps the immune system fight cancer) and immunomodulatory drugs (medicines that help the immune system work better) may improve progression-free survival (the length of time during and after treatment that the disease does not get worse), but they may also increase the risk of serious side effects, highlighting the need for careful consideration of the benefits and risks for each individual.",
    "Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, including the benefits and harms of different treatments, and to identify the most effective and safe options for people with this condition, particularly in the long term."

      "subheading": "What is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of lymphoproliferative disease in adults and currently remains incurable. As the progression-free period shortens after each successive treatment, strategies such as maintenance therapy are needed to improve the degree and duration of response to previous therapies. People with CLL who achieve remission after previous therapy may choose to undergo medical observation or maintenance therapy to deepen the response."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out about maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects and safety of maintenance therapy, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, immunomodulatory drug therapy, anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and B-cell lymphoma-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for individuals with CLL. They aimed to determine the benefits and harms of these treatments, including their impact on overall survival, health-related quality of life, grade 3 and 4 adverse events, progression-free survival, treatment-related mortality, treatment discontinuation, and all adverse events."
