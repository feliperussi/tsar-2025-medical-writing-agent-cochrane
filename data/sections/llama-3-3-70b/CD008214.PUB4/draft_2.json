  "draft": "Can anti-VEGF treatment before or during vitrectomy improve outcomes for diabetic retinopathy complications?\n\nKey messages:\n- Anti-VEGF treatment is a type of medicine that helps stop the growth of new blood vessels. It may improve outcomes for people with diabetic retinopathy when used before or during vitrectomy, a surgery that removes the vitreous gel from the eye.\n- The current evidence suggests that anti-VEGF treatment can reduce the risk of bleeding in the eye after surgery and may also reduce the need for further surgery, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the size of these effects, and more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand how anti-VEGF treatment works in different people and situations.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of anti-VEGF treatment for people with complications of diabetic retinopathy, including its effects on vision, quality of life, and the need for future surgeries, and to determine the best way to use this treatment in clinical practice, taking into account the potential benefits and risks for individual patients.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It occurs when high blood sugar levels cause the growth of new, fragile blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to bleeding, scarring, and vision loss. PDR can cause significant vision problems, including blindness, and is a major cause of vision loss in people with diabetes. Vitrectomy, a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous gel from the eye, is often used to treat PDR. However, vitrectomy can also lead to complications, such as bleeding, retinal detachment, and scarring.\n\nWhat are anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents and how might they help?\nAnti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents are medicines that can reduce the growth of new blood vessels and decrease bleeding. They have been proposed as a way to reduce the complications of vitrectomy for PDR. By injecting anti-VEGF agents into the eye before surgery, doctors hope to reduce the risk of bleeding and other complications, and improve outcomes for people with PDR.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether using anti-VEGF agents before or during vitrectomy surgery can improve outcomes for people with PDR. They looked at the effects of anti-VEGF agents on vision, bleeding, retinal detachment, and other complications, and compared the results to those of people who had vitrectomy surgery without anti-VEGF agents.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor use with no use or different treatments for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nThe current review includes 28 studies that looked at the pre- or intraoperative use of intravitreal anti-VEGFs to improve the outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy for complications of PDR. The studies were conducted in a variety of countries. The inclusion criteria for entry into the studies were the well-recognised complications of proliferative retinopathy: non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment involving the macula or combined tractional rhegmatogenous detachment. The included studies randomised a total of 1914 eyes.\n\nWe identified methodological issues in all of the included studies. Risk of bias was highest for masking of participants and investigators, and a number of studies were unclear when describing randomisation methods and sequence allocation.\n\nParticipants receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF in addition to pars plana vitrectomy achieved better vision at six months compared to people undergoing vitrectomy alone. Pre- or intraoperative anti-VEGF reduced the incidence of early bleeding in the eye after surgery. Perioperative anti-VEGF use was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of late bleeding in the eye after surgery.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding, very small sample sizes, and heterogeneity across studies.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

For example, the sentence 'Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes' could be rewritten as 'What is proliferative diabetic retinopathy?' to better follow the title and subheadings format. Additionally, the sentence 'The review authors wanted to find out whether using anti-VEGF agents before or during vitrectomy surgery can improve outcomes for people with PDR' is unclear and could be rewritten as 'What did the review authors want to find out about anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic retinopathy?' to provide more context. The metrics also show significant deviation from typical PLS patterns, including high rates of passive voice, nominalization, and complex words. To improve readability, it is suggested to reduce the number of passive constructions, use more active voice, and simplify complex sentences.",

However, there are significant deviations in metrics such as words per sentence, nominalization, nouns, smog index, complex words, and long words, which are beyond the 90th percentile. These deviations contribute to the clarity issues noted in the feedback."
