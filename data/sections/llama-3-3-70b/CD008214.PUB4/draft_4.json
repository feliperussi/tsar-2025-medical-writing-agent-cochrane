  "draft": "Can anti-VEGF treatment before or during vitrectomy improve outcomes for diabetic retinopathy complications?\n\nKey messages:\n- Anti-VEGF treatment is a type of medicine that helps stop the growth of new blood vessels (it blocks a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor). We found that it may improve outcomes for people with diabetic retinopathy when used before or during vitrectomy, a surgery that removes the vitreous gel from the eye.\n- The current evidence suggests that anti-VEGF treatment can reduce the risk of bleeding in the eye after surgery and may also reduce the need for further surgery. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the size of these effects, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of anti-VEGF treatment for people with complications of diabetic retinopathy, including its effects on vision, quality of life, and the need for future surgeries.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It occurs when high blood sugar levels cause the growth of new, fragile blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to bleeding, scarring, and vision loss. PDR can cause significant vision problems, including blindness, and is a major cause of vision loss in people with diabetes.\n\nWhat are anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents and how might they help?\nAnti-VEGF agents are medicines that can reduce the growth of new blood vessels and decrease bleeding. They have been proposed as a way to reduce the complications of vitrectomy for PDR. By injecting anti-VEGF agents into the eye before surgery, doctors hope to reduce the risk of bleeding and other complications, and improve outcomes for people with PDR.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic retinopathy?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether using anti-VEGF agents before or during vitrectomy surgery can improve outcomes for people with PDR. They looked at the effects of anti-VEGF agents on vision, bleeding, retinal detachment, and other complications.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor use with no use or different treatments for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nThe current review includes 28 studies that looked at the pre- or intraoperative use of intravitreal anti-VEGFs to improve the outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy for complications of PDR. Participants receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF in addition to pars plana vitrectomy achieved better vision at six months compared to people undergoing vitrectomy alone. Pre- or intraoperative anti-VEGF reduced the incidence of early bleeding in the eye after surgery. Perioperative anti-VEGF use was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of late bleeding in the eye after surgery.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding, very small sample sizes, and heterogeneity across studies.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",
