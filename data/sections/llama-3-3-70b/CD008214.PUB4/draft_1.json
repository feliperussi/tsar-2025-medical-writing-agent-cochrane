  "draft": "# Can anti‑VEGF treatment before or during vitrectomy improve outcomes for diabetic retinopathy complications?\n**Key Messages**\n- Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment, which is a type of medicine that blocks the action of a protein (vascular endothelial growth factor) involved in the growth of new blood vessels, before or during vitrectomy, a surgical procedure where the vitreous gel in the eye is removed, may improve outcomes for people with complications of diabetic retinopathy, a condition where high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the eye, by reducing the risk of bleeding in the eye and improving vision.\n- The current evidence suggests that anti-VEGF treatment can reduce the risk of bleeding in the eye after surgery and may also reduce the need for further surgery, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the size of these effects, and more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand how anti-VEGF treatment works in different people and situations.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of anti-VEGF treatment for people with complications of diabetic retinopathy, including its effects on vision, quality of life, and the need for future surgeries, and to determine the best way to use this treatment in clinical practice, taking into account the potential benefits and risks for individual patients.\n**Introduction**\n### What is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It occurs when high blood sugar levels cause the growth of new, fragile blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to bleeding, scarring, and vision loss. PDR can cause significant vision problems, including blindness, and is a major cause of vision loss in people with diabetes. Vitrectomy, a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous gel from the eye, is often used to treat PDR. However, vitrectomy can also lead to complications, such as bleeding, retinal detachment, and scarring.\n### What are anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents and how might they help?\nAnti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents are medicines that can reduce the growth of new blood vessels and decrease bleeding. They have been proposed as a way to reduce the complications of vitrectomy for PDR. By injecting anti-VEGF agents into the eye before surgery, doctors hope to reduce the risk of bleeding and other complications, and improve outcomes for people with PDR.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether using anti-VEGF agents before or during vitrectomy surgery can improve outcomes for people with PDR. They looked at the effects of anti-VEGF agents on vision, bleeding, retinal detachment, and other complications, and compared the results to those of people who had vitrectomy surgery without anti-VEGF agents.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor use with no use or different treatments for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### Agent Stopped Due to Max Iterations\nThe process was terminated because it reached the maximum allowed number of iterations without completing. This typically occurs when the task is too complex or the loop conditions are not met. To resolve, consider simplifying the request, breaking it into smaller steps, or adjusting the iteration limits if possible.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small sample sizes, and heterogeneity across studies (different participant populations and varied delivery methods of the intervention).\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

A suggested rewrite could be 'Anti-VEGF treatment is a type of medicine that helps stop the growth of new blood vessels. It may improve outcomes for people with diabetic retinopathy when used before or during vitrectomy, a surgery that removes the vitreous gel from the eye.' Additionally, the metrics show high rates of passive voice, noun-heavy sentences, and complex words, which contribute to the clarity issues. The word count is within the limit, but the text could benefit from simplification and reorganization to improve readability.",
