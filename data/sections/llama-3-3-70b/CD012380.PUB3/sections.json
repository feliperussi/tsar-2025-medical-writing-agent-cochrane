  "key_messages": [
    "We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the best treatments for preventing or reducing kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease (a genetic disorder that affects the blood), including the benefits and risks of interventions such as red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs, which are medicines that help lower blood pressure by blocking the action of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels).",
    "Hydroxyurea may improve the ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to serious adverse events such as acute chest syndrome (a serious condition that can cause fever, cough, and chest pain), painful crises (episodes of severe pain), and hospitalisations in children, but we are unsure of its effects on preventing or reducing kidney complications due to a lack of robust evidence.",
    "Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies to assess the effects of these interventions, particularly in older children and adults with sickle cell disease, and to determine the best approaches for preventing or reducing kidney complications in this population."

      "subheading": "What is sickle cell disease and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe monogenic disorder caused by the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta‐globin) genes. It can cause severe pain, significant end‐organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with SCD is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy. This can lead to poor outcomes, including the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency, with up to 12% of people developing end‐stage renal disease."

      "subheading": "What are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?",
      "content": "Common treatments for SCD include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). These treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. They looked at possible interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and ACEIs, either alone or in combination, to determine their effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in people with SCD."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found three studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations, with one study lasting six months and another lasting several months, but the exact duration of the third study was not specified. The population characteristics varied across the studies, with one study including children aged nine to 18 months, another including adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria, and the third including children aged one to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. The studies compared different interventions, including hydroxyurea versus placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) versus placebo, and ACEIs versus vitamin C. Unfortunately, no studies were found that assessed red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease. We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves kidney function or reduces kidney damage in children with sickle cell disease, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of serious complications. We are also unsure if a type of medication called ACE inhibitors has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with sickle cell disease."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and the results do not encompass all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to November 2021."
