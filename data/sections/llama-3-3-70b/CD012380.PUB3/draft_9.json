  "draft": "What are the best treatments to prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease (a genetic disorder that affects the blood)?\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the best treatments for preventing or reducing kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.\n- Treatments we looked at include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea (a medicine that can help reduce the frequency of sickle cell crises), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs, which are medicines that help lower blood pressure by blocking the action of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels).\n- Hydroxyurea may improve the ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to serious adverse events such as acute chest syndrome (a serious condition that can cause fever, cough, and chest pain), painful crises (episodes of severe pain), and hospitalisations in children.\n- Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies to assess the effects of these interventions, particularly in older children and adults with sickle cell disease.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and why is it a problem?\nSickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects the blood. It happens when you inherit two abnormal genes that produce haemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen). \n- It can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. \n- One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with sickle cell disease is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?\nCommon treatments for sickle cell disease include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). \n- These treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. \n- We looked at possible interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and ACEIs, either alone or in combination.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. \n- The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. \n- The population characteristics varied across the studies, with one study including children aged 9 to 18 months, another including adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria, and the third including children aged 1 to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the results do not encompass all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.\n\nWe need more research to determine the best treatments for preventing or reducing kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. Future studies should be well-designed and include older children and adults with sickle cell disease.",

For instance, the sentence 'Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects the blood' could be improved by adding a brief explanation of what genetic disorder means. The sentence 'The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the results do not encompass all relevant populations or outcomes of interest' is too long and should be broken down. Also, the use of passive voice in 'The results do not encompass all relevant populations or outcomes of interest' should be converted to active voice. The PLS evaluation results show good conformity with PLS patterns but highlight areas for improvement, such as the number of nouns and complex words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 50% of the features in the best quartile (P25/P75) and 38.9% in the median range (P50). However, there are deviations in the number of nouns and complex words, which are in the P90 range, suggesting a need for reduction to improve readability. The use of active voice and pronouns is commendable, with 56% and 33% respectively in the P75 range, indicating good practice in these areas."
