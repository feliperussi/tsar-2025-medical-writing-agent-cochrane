  "draft": "What are the best treatments to prevent or reduce kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease (a genetic disorder that affects the blood)?\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the best treatments for preventing or reducing kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.\n- Treatments we looked at include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea (a medicine that can help reduce the frequency of sickle cell crises), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs, which are medicines that help lower blood pressure by blocking the action of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels).\n- Hydroxyurea may improve the ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to serious adverse events such as acute chest syndrome (a serious condition that can cause fever, cough, and chest pain), painful crises (episodes of severe pain), and hospitalisations in children.\n- Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies to assess the effects of these interventions, particularly in older children and adults with sickle cell disease.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and why is it a problem?\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe genetic disorder caused by the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta‐globin) genes. \n- It can cause severe pain, significant end‐organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. \n- One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with SCD is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?\nCommon treatments for SCD include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). \n- These treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. \n- We looked at possible interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and ACEIs, either alone or in combination.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 3 studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. \n- The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations. \n- The population characteristics varied across the studies, with one study including children aged 9 to 18 months, another including adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria, and the third including children aged 1 to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the results do not encompass all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

For example, the sentence 'Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe monogenic disorder caused by the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta‐globin) genes' uses technical terms without definition. A suggested rewrite could be 'Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects the blood, caused by inheriting two abnormal genes that produce haemoglobin'. Additionally, the text has excessive passive voice and wordy phrases. The PLS evaluation results show that the text has 159 nouns, which is higher than the typical PLS pattern. To improve, the text should be rewritten to use more active voice, simplify wordy phrases, and reduce noun-heavy sentences.",
