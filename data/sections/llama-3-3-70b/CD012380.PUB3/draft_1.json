It can cause severe pain, significant end‐organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. One of the frequent and potentially severe complications in people with SCD is kidney disease, also known as sickle cell nephropathy. This can lead to poor outcomes, including the progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney insufficiency, with up to 12% of people developing end‐stage renal disease.\n### What are the common treatments for sickle cell disease and its complications?\nCommon treatments for SCD include red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). These treatments aim to prevent or reduce kidney complications, but their effectiveness is not well established.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. They looked at possible interventions, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and ACEIs, either alone or in combination, to determine their effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in people with SCD.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found three studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease. The studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations, with one study lasting six months and another lasting several months, but the exact duration of the third study was not specified. The population characteristics varied across the studies, with one study including children aged nine to 18 months, another including adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria, and the third including children aged one to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. The studies compared different interventions, including hydroxyurea versus placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) versus placebo, and ACEIs versus vitamin C. Unfortunately, no studies were found that assessed red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease. We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves kidney function or reduces kidney damage in children with sickle cell disease, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of serious complications. We are also unsure if a type of medication called ACE inhibitors has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with sickle cell disease.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and the results do not encompass all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains some unexplained technical terms, such as 'sickle cell nephropathy' and 'angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,' which may confuse readers who are not familiar with these terms. For example, the sentence 'Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe monogenic disorder caused by the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta‐globin) genes' contains the term 'monogenic disorder,' which should be explained or defined for non-expert readers. Additionally, some sentences are too long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. For instance, the sentence 'We found three studies that involved 385 people with sickle cell disease, and the studies were conducted in various countries and lasted for different durations, with one study lasting six months and another lasting several months, but the exact duration of the third study was not specified' is over 30 words long and contains multiple clauses, which can make it hard to understand. Furthermore, the text could benefit from more active voice constructions, as the current draft contains 15 passive voice instances, which can make the text seem less engaging and more difficult to read. To address these issues, the writer could consider adding definitions for technical terms, breaking up long sentences into shorter ones, and using more active voice constructions. For example, the sentence 'The review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease' could be rewritten in active voice as 'We wanted to assess the effectiveness of any intervention for preventing or reducing kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.' The PLS evaluation results show that the draft text has a flesch reading ease score of 37.07, which is within the typical range for PLS texts, but the text also has a high number of passive voice constructions, complex words, and long words, which contribute to its low readability. Overall, while the draft text provides some useful information, it needs to be revised to improve its clarity, readability, and engagement.",
