  "draft": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after surgery to remove part of the pancreas (an organ that helps with digestion and blood sugar control), and do they improve recovery?\n\nWe compared different methods of providing nutrients after pancreatic surgery. Enteral nutrition - giving nutrients directly into the gut - through a jejunostomy (a surgical opening in the small intestine), likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition (giving nutrients through a vein). However, it may have little to no difference in complications after surgery.\n\nHere are the key messages from our review:\n- Enteral nutrition by jejunostomy likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition, but may have little to no difference in complications.\n- Comparing different methods of nutritional support, such as nasojejunal tube feeding (where a tube is inserted through the nose into the small intestine) and eating by mouth, shows little to no difference in hospital stay or complications, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Further high-quality research is needed to understand the best nutritional support strategies after pancreatic surgery.\n\nWhat is pancreatic surgery and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?\nPancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas, usually due to cancer, benign tumors, or chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). After this major surgery, patients often face challenges in maintaining their nutritional status, which is crucial for recovery and long-term survival. Malnutrition (a condition that results from eating a diet in which one or more nutrients are either not enough or are too much) is a significant risk factor following pancreatic surgery, and providing appropriate nutritional support is essential to optimize outcomes and help patients resume a normal diet.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about nutritional support after pancreatic surgery?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreatic surgery. They wanted to compare the outcomes of various nutritional interventions, such as enteral feeding (through a tube into the intestine) and parenteral nutrition (intravenous nutrition), to determine which approach is most beneficial for patients after this surgery.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different nutritional support strategies after pancreatic surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 17 studies that involved 1897 people who underwent pancreatic surgery. The studies compared different routes and timings of postoperative nutritional support, including enteral feeding via jejunostomy, nasojejunal tube, or gastrojejunostomy (a surgical opening in the stomach and small intestine), parenteral nutrition, and oral intake.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nThe review found that enteral nutrition by jejunostomy likely results in a decreased length of hospital stay and may lead to no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications compared with parenteral nutrition. Enteral feeding by nasojejunal tube may result in no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or length of hospital stay compared with parenteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition by jejunostomy feeding may result in no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or length of hospital stay compared with oral nutrition, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they were receiving, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains some unexplained technical terms, such as \"pancreaticoduodenectomy\" and \"jejunostomy\", which may confuse readers who are not familiar with medical terminology. For example, the sentence \"Pancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas, usually due to cancer, benign tumors, or chronic pancreatitis.\" could be rephrased to include a brief explanation of what pancreaticoduodenectomy is. Secondly, some sentences are too long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. For instance, the sentence \"The review authors aimed to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy, and they wanted to compare the outcomes of various nutritional interventions, such as enteral feeding and parenteral nutrition, to determine which approach is most beneficial for patients after this surgery.\" could be broken up into shorter, simpler sentences. Additionally, the text could benefit from more active voice constructions, as the current draft relies heavily on passive voice. The metrics from the PLS evaluation results support these observations, showing high rates of passive voice, complex words, and long sentences. To improve the draft, the writer could focus on using simpler language, breaking up long sentences, and increasing the use of active voice. For example, the sentence \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they were receiving, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\" could be rephrased in active voice as \"We found that the evidence is limited because the studies were very small, the participants may have known which treatment they were receiving, the studies did not report all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\" Overall, while the draft provides a good overview of the topic, it needs significant revisions to make it more accessible and engaging for readers.",
