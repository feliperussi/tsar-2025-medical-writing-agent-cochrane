  "key_messages": [
    "Enteral nutrition (a way of providing nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract) by jejunostomy (a surgical opening in the jejunum, a part of the small intestine, through which nutrients can be delivered) likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition (intravenous nutrition, where nutrients are delivered through a vein), but may have little to no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications (unwanted effects that occur after surgery), although the evidence is not very strong.",
    "Comparing different methods of nutritional support, such as nasojejunal tube feeding (where a tube is inserted through the nose into the jejunum to deliver nutrients) and oral intake (eating by mouth), shows little to no difference in the length of hospital stay or the incidence of complications, but the evidence for these comparisons is uncertain and not robust.",
    "Further high-quality research is needed to better understand the best nutritional support strategies after pancreaticoduodenectomy (a surgical procedure to remove the head of the pancreas), including studies that compare different types of nutritional interventions and their effects on patient outcomes, to help guide clinical decisions and improve patient care."

      "subheading": "What is pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?",
      "content": "Pancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas, usually due to cancer, benign tumors, or chronic pancreatitis. After this major surgery, patients often face challenges in maintaining their nutritional status, which is crucial for recovery and long-term survival. Malnutrition is a significant risk factor following pancreaticoduodenectomy, and providing appropriate nutritional support is essential to optimize outcomes and help patients resume a normal diet."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out about nutritional support after pancreaticoduodenectomy?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. They wanted to compare the outcomes of various nutritional interventions, such as enteral feeding (through a tube into the intestine) and parenteral nutrition (intravenous nutrition), to determine which approach is most beneficial for patients after this surgery."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 17 studies that involved 1897 people who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. The studies compared different routes and timings of postoperative nutritional support, including enteral feeding via jejunostomy, nasojejunal tube, or gastrojejunostomy, parenteral nutrition, and oral intake. The studies were conducted in various settings, but the specific countries were not mentioned. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The study funding sources were also not mentioned. The interventions compared included jejunostomy feeding versus total parenteral nutrition, nasojejunal feeding versus total parenteral nutrition, and jejunostomy feeding versus oral intake. No information was available on the duration of the studies. The review found that enteral nutrition by jejunostomy likely results in a decreased length of hospital stay and may lead to no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications compared with parenteral nutrition. Enteral feeding by nasojejunal tube may result in no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or length of hospital stay compared with parenteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition by jejunostomy feeding may result in no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or length of hospital stay compared with oral nutrition, but the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they were receiving (risk of bias), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to October 2022"
