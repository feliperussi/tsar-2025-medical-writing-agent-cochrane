  "draft": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after surgery to remove part of the pancreas, and do they improve recovery?\n\nWe compared different methods of providing nutrients after pancreatic surgery. Enteral nutrition - giving nutrients directly into the gut - through a jejunostomy (a surgical opening in the small intestine), likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition (giving nutrients through a vein). However, it may have little to no difference in complications after surgery.\n\nHere are the key messages from our review:\n- Enteral nutrition by jejunostomy likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition, but may have little to no difference in complications.\n- Comparing different methods of nutritional support, such as nasojejunal tube feeding (where a tube is inserted through the nose into the small intestine) and eating by mouth, shows little to no difference in hospital stay or complications, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Further high-quality research is needed to understand the best nutritional support strategies after pancreatic surgery.\n\nWhat is pancreatic surgery and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?\nPancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure (a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas), is usually done due to cancer, benign tumors, or chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). After this major surgery, patients often face challenges in maintaining their nutritional status, which is crucial for recovery and long-term survival. Malnutrition (a condition that results from eating a diet in which one or more nutrients are either not enough or are too much) is a significant risk factor following pancreatic surgery, and providing appropriate nutritional support is essential to optimize outcomes and help patients resume a normal diet.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about nutritional support after pancreatic surgery?\nWe aimed to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreatic surgery. We wanted to compare the outcomes of various nutritional interventions, such as enteral feeding (through a tube into the intestine) and parenteral nutrition (intravenous nutrition), to determine which approach is most beneficial for patients after this surgery.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different nutritional support strategies after pancreatic surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 17 studies that involved 1897 people who underwent pancreatic surgery. The studies compared different routes and timings of postoperative nutritional support, including enteral feeding via jejunostomy, nasojejunal tube, or gastrojejunostomy (a surgical opening in the stomach and small intestine), parenteral nutrition, and oral intake.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found that enteral nutrition by jejunostomy likely results in a decreased length of hospital stay and may lead to no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications compared with parenteral nutrition. Enteral feeding by nasojejunal tube may result in no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or length of hospital stay compared with parenteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition by jejunostomy feeding may result in no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or length of hospital stay compared with oral nutrition, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the evidence is limited because the studies were very small, the participants may have known which treatment they were receiving, the studies did not report all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains unexplained jargon and technical terms without definitions, such as \"pancreaticoduodenectomy\" and \"jejunostomy\", which may confuse readers. For example, the sentence \"Pancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas\" could be rephrased to include a brief explanation of what pancreaticoduodenectomy is. Secondly, some sentences are longer than 30 words and are hard to follow, such as the sentence \"We compared different methods of providing nutrients after pancreatic surgery, including enteral nutrition through a jejunostomy, nasojejunal tube feeding, and oral intake, and found that enteral nutrition by jejunostomy likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to the parenteral nutrition, but may have little to no difference in complications after surgery.\" This sentence could be broken up into shorter sentences to improve clarity. Lastly, the text contains excessive passive voice, which can obscure who did what, such as the sentence \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, the participants may have known which treatment they were receiving, the studies did not report all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\" This sentence could be rephrased to use active voice, such as \"We found that the evidence is limited because the studies were very small, the participants may have known which treatment they were receiving, the studies did not report all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\" The PLS evaluation results show that the draft text has a high number of passive voice constructions, complex words, and long words, which contribute to its low readability score. Overall, the draft text needs significant revisions to improve its clarity, readability, and conformity to typical PLS patterns.",
