  "draft": "What are the best ways to support nutrition after surgery to remove part of the pancreas, and do they improve recovery?\n\nWe compared different methods of providing nutrients after pancreatic surgery. Enteral nutrition - a way of providing nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract - by jejunostomy, a surgical opening in the jejunum, a part of the small intestine, likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition, intravenous nutrition where nutrients are delivered through a vein. However, it may have little to no difference in complications after surgery.\n\nHere are the key messages from our review:\n- Enteral nutrition by jejunostomy likely results in a shorter hospital stay compared to parenteral nutrition, but may have little to no difference in complications.\n- Comparing different methods of nutritional support, such as nasojejunal tube feeding and eating by mouth, shows little to no difference in hospital stay or complications, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Further high-quality research is needed to understand the best nutritional support strategies after pancreatic surgery.\n\nWhat is pancreatic surgery and why is nutritional support important after this surgery?\nPancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas, usually due to cancer, benign tumors, or chronic pancreatitis. After this major surgery, patients often face challenges in maintaining their nutritional status, which is crucial for recovery and long-term survival. Malnutrition is a significant risk factor following pancreatic surgery, and providing appropriate nutritional support is essential to optimize outcomes and help patients resume a normal diet.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about nutritional support after pancreatic surgery?\nWe aimed to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreatic surgery. We wanted to compare the outcomes of various nutritional interventions, such as enteral feeding and parenteral nutrition, to determine which approach is most beneficial for patients after this surgery.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different nutritional support strategies after pancreatic surgery, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 17 studies that involved 1897 people who underwent pancreatic surgery. The studies compared different routes and timings of postoperative nutritional support, including enteral feeding via jejunostomy, nasojejunal tube, or gastrojejunostomy, parenteral nutrition, and oral intake.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found that enteral nutrition by jejunostomy likely results in a decreased length of hospital stay and may lead to no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications compared with parenteral nutrition. Enteral feeding by nasojejunal tube may result in no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or length of hospital stay compared with parenteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition by jejunostomy feeding may result in no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or length of hospital stay compared with oral nutrition, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they were receiving, the studies did not report all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "{\"grade\": \"NOT_APPROVED\", \"feedback\": \"The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains unexplained jargon and technical terms without definitions, such as \\\"pancreaticoduodenectomy\\\" and \\\"jejunostomy\\\", which may confuse readers who are not familiar with medical terminology. Secondly, some sentences are longer than 30 words and are hard to follow, making it difficult for readers to understand the content. Additionally, the text lacks context in some areas, leaving readers confused about certain topics. Furthermore, the text contains contradictory or unclear statements, such as the comparison between enteral nutrition and parenteral nutrition, which needs to be clarified. In terms of style, the text uses excessive passive voice, wordy phrases, and noun-heavy sentences, which can be simplified to improve readability. The text also contains numbers written as words instead of numerals, which is against the style guide. The structure of the text is also an issue, with missing paragraph breaks and bullet points not using dashes. To address these issues, the following rewrites are suggested: - \\\"Pancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a complex surgery to remove the head of the pancreas.\\\" should be rewritten as \\\"What is pancreaticoduodenectomy?\\\" to make it clearer and more concise. - \\\"The review authors aimed to assess the effects of different postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.\\\" should be rewritten as \\\"What did the review authors want to find out about nutritional support after pancreatic surgery?\\\" to make it more concise and easier to follow. - \\\"We found 17 studies that involved 1897 people who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy.\\\" should be rewritten as \\\"What did we find?\\\" to make it more concise and easier to follow.
