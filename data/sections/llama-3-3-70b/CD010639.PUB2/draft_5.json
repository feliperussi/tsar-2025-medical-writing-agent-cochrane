  "draft": "Can changing shift work schedules improve sleep quality, sleep duration, and reduce sleepiness in shift workers?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that changing shift work schedules may improve sleep quality, sleep duration, and reduce sleepiness in shift workers, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n- Forward and faster rotation of shifts may reduce sleepiness during work hours, but the impact on sleep quality and duration is unclear.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of different shift schedule adaptations on sleep and sleepiness in shift workers.\n\nWhat is shift work and why is it a problem?\nShift work refers to work schedules that fall outside the traditional daytime hours, often including night shifts, evening shifts, or rotating shifts. This type of work schedule can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to insufficient sleep, fatigue, and decreased alertness.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of adapting shift work schedules on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness among shift workers. They investigated various shift schedule components, such as the permanency of shifts, regularity of shift changes, direction of shift rotation, speed of rotation, shift duration, timing of start of shifts, distribution of shift schedule, time off between shifts, split shifts, protected sleep, and worker participation.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies evaluating adaptations to shift work schedules. We used keywords like \"shift work\", \"schedule adaptation\", \"rotating shifts\", \"sleep quality\", \"sleep duration\", and \"sleepiness\".\n\nHow did the review authors select studies for the review?\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts against predefined inclusion criteria. We included original research on adult shift workers, interventions involving a change to the shift schedule, and reported outcomes on sleep quality, sleep duration, or subjective sleepiness.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe included 11 studies with a total of 2125 participants. Forward and faster rotation of shifts may reduce sleepiness during work hours, but the evidence is uncertain. We found that forward rotation may reduce sleepiness during shifts, but the evidence is very uncertain. Very low-certainty evidence indicated that sleep duration off-shift decreases with faster rotation.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, reducing comparability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2020.\n\nWe hope this information helps you understand the effects of changing shift work schedules on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness in shift workers. More research is needed to confirm these findings and provide more definitive answers to these questions.",
