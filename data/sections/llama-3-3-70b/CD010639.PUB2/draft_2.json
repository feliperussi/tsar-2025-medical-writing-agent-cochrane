  "draft": "Can changing shift work schedules improve sleep quality, sleep duration, and reduce sleepiness in shift workers?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that changing shift work schedules may improve sleep quality, sleep duration, and reduce sleepiness in shift workers, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm these findings. Sleep quality refers to how well a person sleeps (e.g., having few sleep disruptions), and sleepiness means feeling tired during the day.\n- Forward and faster rotation of shifts may reduce sleepiness during work hours, but the impact on sleep quality and duration is unclear. Rotation refers to the schedule of when workers start and end their shifts, and sleep duration means the amount of time spent sleeping.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of different shift schedule adaptations on sleep and sleepiness in shift workers, including the potential benefits and harms of various scheduling strategies, to provide more definitive answers to these questions and help workers and employers make informed decisions.\n\nWhat is shift work and why is it a problem?\nShift work refers to work schedules that fall outside the traditional daytime hours, often including night shifts, evening shifts, or rotating shifts. This type of work schedule can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to insufficient sleep, fatigue, and decreased alertness. As a result, shift workers may experience negative effects on their occupational health and safety, including increased risk of accidents and errors. Common treatments for shift work disorders include behavioral therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, and pharmacological interventions, like melatonin or sleep aids.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of adapting shift work schedules on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness among shift workers. They investigated various shift schedule components, such as the permanency of shifts, regularity of shift changes, direction of shift rotation, speed of rotation, shift duration, timing of start of shifts, distribution of shift schedule, time off between shifts, split shifts, protected sleep, and worker participation. The authors sought to determine which adaptations to shift work schedules are most effective in improving sleep outcomes and reducing sleepiness in shift workers.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) for studies evaluating adaptations to shift work schedules. Keywords included combinations of \"shift work\", \"schedule adaptation\", \"rotating shifts\", \"sleep quality\", \"sleep duration\", and \"sleepiness\". No date or language restrictions were applied.\n\nHow did the review authors select studies for the review?\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts against predefined inclusion criteria: (1) original research on adult shift workers, (2) intervention involving a change to the shift schedule (e.g., forward rotation, reduced night frequency, fixed schedules), and (3) reported outcomes on sleep quality, sleep duration, or subjective sleepiness. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe included 11 studies with a total of 2125 participants. The studies investigated different and often multiple changes to shift schedules, and were heterogeneous with respect to outcome measurement. Forward and faster rotation may reduce sleepiness during shifts, but the evidence is very uncertain. Very low-certainty evidence indicated that sleep duration off-shift decreases with faster rotation. Low-certainty evidence indicated that on-duty workweeks with shift duration limited to 16 hours increases sleep duration, with moderate-certainty evidence for minimal reductions in sleepiness.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (risk of bias from lack of blinding), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, reducing comparability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2020.",

Firstly, the sentence \"Shift work refers to work schedules that fall outside the traditional daytime hours, often including night shifts, evening shifts, or rotating shifts.\" is somewhat unclear as it uses technical terms without explanation. A suggested rewrite could be \"Shift work means working hours that are not the usual daytime hours, such as night shifts, evening shifts, or rotating shifts.\" Secondly, the use of passive voice in sentences like \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received\" can obscure who did what. A rewrite to active voice, such as \"We found that the evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have known which treatment they received,\" improves clarity. Lastly, the draft could benefit from more paragraph breaks and the use of numerals instead of writing numbers out in words. For instance, instead of \"twelve studies,\" it should be \"12 studies.\" The PLS evaluation results show moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, but there are deviations in metrics such as nominalization, nouns, and complex words, indicating a need for simplification and clearer sentence structure. Overall, while the draft provides valuable information, these improvements are necessary to make it more accessible to patients.",
