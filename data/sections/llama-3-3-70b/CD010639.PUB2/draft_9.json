  "draft": "Can changing shift work schedules improve sleep quality, sleep duration, and reduce sleepiness in shift workers?\n\nWe found that changing shift work schedules may improve sleep quality, sleep duration, and reduce sleepiness in shift workers. However, the evidence is uncertain, and more research is needed to confirm these findings. \n\nWhat is shift work and why is it a problem?\nShift work refers to work schedules that fall outside the traditional daytime hours, often including night shifts, evening shifts, or rotating shifts. This type of work schedule can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to insufficient sleep, fatigue, and decreased alertness.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if changing shift work schedules can help shift workers sleep better, sleep more, and feel less tired during the day. We investigated various shift schedule components, such as the permanency of shifts, regularity of shift changes, direction of shift rotation, speed of rotation, shift duration, timing of start of shifts, distribution of shift schedule, time off between shifts, split shifts, protected sleep, and worker participation.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies evaluating adaptations to shift work schedules. We used keywords like \"shift work\", \"schedule adaptation\", \"rotating shifts\", \"sleep quality\", \"sleep duration\", and \"sleepiness\".\n\nHow did the review authors select studies for the review?\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts against predefined inclusion criteria. We included original research on adult shift workers, interventions involving a change to the shift schedule, and reported outcomes on sleep quality, sleep duration, or subjective sleepiness.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe included 11 studies with a total of 2125 participants. Forward and faster rotation of shifts may reduce sleepiness during work hours, but the impact on sleep quality and duration is unclear. \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the studies were very small, which limits the evidence. Participants may have known which treatment they received, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, reducing comparability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2020.\n\nWe hope this information helps you understand the effects of changing shift work schedules on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness in shift workers. More research is needed to confirm these findings and provide more definitive answers to these questions.",

For example, the sentence 'We found that changing shift work schedules may improve sleep quality, sleep duration, and reduce sleepiness in shift workers' is unclear because it does not define what 'sleep quality' and 'sleep duration' mean. A suggested rewrite could be 'We found that changing shift work schedules may help workers sleep better, sleep more, and feel less tired during the day.' Another issue is the use of passive voice, such as 'The evidence is limited because the studies were very small', which could be rewritten as 'We limited our analysis because the studies were very small.' The metrics show a high number of nominalizations (22.0) and nouns (172.0), which contributes to the clarity issues. To improve, the writer should reduce the use of nominalizations and nouns, and use more active voice and concise language.",

However, there are deviations in nominalization (22.0) and nouns (172.0), which are above the median. The writer should focus on reducing these deviations to improve the clarity and readability of the text."
