It is a leading cause of infertility, which is the inability to get pregnant after one year of trying. Women with PCOS often have trouble getting pregnant due to irregular ovulation, and they may need assisted reproductive technology such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to conceive.\n### What are the common treatments for PCOS-related infertility and what are their limitations?\nCommon treatments for PCOS-related infertility include IVF and ICSI. However, these treatments can have limitations. For example, women with PCOS may experience an exaggerated response to the hormones used to stimulate ovulation, which can lead to a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). This can be a serious and potentially life-threatening complication. Additionally, IVF and ICSI can be expensive and may not always be successful.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if a technique called in vitro maturation (IVM) is effective in helping women with PCOS get pregnant. IVM involves retrieving immature eggs from the ovaries and maturing them in a laboratory before fertilization. The authors compared the benefits and harms of IVM followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI in women with PCOS. They looked at outcomes such as live birth, miscarriage, and OHSS to determine if IVM is a viable treatment option for women with PCOS-related infertility.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing in vitro maturation (IVM) with conventional IVF or ICSI for women with PCOS, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 810 subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome undergoing assisted reproductive technology. The studies were conducted to compare in vitro maturation followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI. Two of the studies were at low risk of bias in all domains and in terms of all outcomes, while the other two were at high risk of bias. The population characteristics included subfertile women with PCOS, but specific details such as age and severity of condition were not provided. The studies did not report on the duration of the interventions. The funding sources for the studies were not mentioned. The interventions compared were IVM followed by IVF or ICSI versus conventional IVF or ICSI, with a focus on the use of a GnRH antagonist protocol. No information was available on the study settings, such as the countries in which they took place. In vitro maturation may make little to no difference to live birth and clinical pregnancy, but it probably increases miscarriage and reduces the incidence of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome compared to conventional in vitro fertilisation.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, narrow participant populations, and incomplete coverage of the relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes (live birth and clinical pregnancy) under a GnRH‑antagonist protocol, leading to imprecision and indirectness.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

The main issues include excessive use of passive voice, nominalization, and complex words, which contribute to lower readability. To address these issues, it is suggested to reduce passive voice constructions, use more active voice, and simplify complex sentences. Additionally, breaking up long sentences and using more concise language can improve clarity. The PLS evaluation results show moderate conformity with PLS patterns, but there are several features that deviate from typical patterns, including passive voice, nominalization, nouns, smog index, complex words, and long words. These deviations suggest that the draft text may benefit from revisions to improve readability and clarity.",
