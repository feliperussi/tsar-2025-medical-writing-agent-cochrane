    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of betahistine and other drugs for Ménière’s disease (a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus) are unclear.",
    "The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions (treatments using medicines) for Ménière’s disease is very uncertain, and there are few randomized controlled trials (studies that compare a treatment to a placebo or no treatment) that compare these interventions to placebo or no treatment.",
    "Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision‑makers, such as the potential benefits and harms of different interventions, and the development of a core outcome set (a set of standardized measures) to guide future studies."

      "content": "Ménière's disease is a condition that affects the inner ear, causing episodes of vertigo (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). These symptoms can be debilitating and disrupt daily life. While the exact cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, various treatments such as betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medications, and corticosteroids have been used to manage the condition. However, the effectiveness of these treatments in preventing vertigo attacks and associated symptoms is unclear."

      "content": "The review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic pharmacological interventions (medications) compared to placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease. They wanted to determine which treatments are most effective in improving vertigo, reducing symptoms, and enhancing quality of life, while also considering potential adverse effects."

      "content": "We found 10 studies that involved 848 people with Meniere’s disease. The studies evaluated the following interventions: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals and corticosteroids. We did not identify any evidence on antihistamines. The studies were conducted for a duration of 3 to 12 months or more, with some studies reporting outcomes at 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. Unfortunately, the abstract does not provide information on the funding sources, population characteristics such as age and gender, or the countries in which the studies took place. The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière ... (truncated for brevity) ... The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière’s disease is very uncertain. There are few randomised controlled trials that compare these interventions to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty."
