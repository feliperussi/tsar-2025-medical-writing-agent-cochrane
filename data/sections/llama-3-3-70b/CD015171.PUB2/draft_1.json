  "draft": "# Benefits and side effects of betahistine and other drugs for Ménière’s disease\n**Key Messages**\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of betahistine and other drugs for Ménière’s disease (a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus) are unclear.\n- The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions (treatments using medicines) for Ménière’s disease is very uncertain, and there are few randomized controlled trials (studies that compare a treatment to a placebo or no treatment) that compare these interventions to placebo or no treatment.\n- Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision‑makers, such as the potential benefits and harms of different interventions, and the development of a core outcome set (a set of standardized measures) to guide future studies.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is Ménière's disease and why is it a problem?\nMénière's disease is a condition that affects the inner ear, causing episodes of vertigo (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). These symptoms can be debilitating and disrupt daily life. While the exact cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, various treatments such as betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medications, and corticosteroids have been used to manage the condition. However, the effectiveness of these treatments in preventing vertigo attacks and associated symptoms is unclear.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic pharmacological interventions (medications) compared to placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease. They wanted to determine which treatments are most effective in improving vertigo, reducing symptoms, and enhancing quality of life, while also considering potential adverse effects.\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing systemic pharmacological interventions with placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 10 studies that involved 848 people with Meniere’s disease. The studies evaluated the following interventions: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals and corticosteroids. We did not identify any evidence on antihistamines. The studies were conducted for a duration of 3 to 12 months or more, with some studies reporting outcomes at 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. Unfortunately, the abstract does not provide information on the funding sources, population characteristics such as age and gender, or the countries in which the studies took place. The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière ... The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière’s disease is very uncertain. There are few randomised controlled trials that compare these interventions to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty.\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people/intervention/comparators/outcomes we were interested in.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft text provided has several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity and readability for patients. Firstly, the title and some subheadings do not follow the format of being phrased as questions, which could confuse readers. For instance, the subheading \"Introduction\" should be rephrased to \"What is this review about?\" to align with the guidelines. Additionally, sentences such as \"The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière’s disease is very uncertain\" are unclear and lack context, making it difficult for readers to understand the significance of the evidence uncertainty. Furthermore, the use of technical terms like \"systemic pharmacological interventions\" without clear explanations may alienate some readers. The PLS_EVALUATION_RESULTS show a high rate of nominalization, smog index, complex words, and long words, which contribute to the text's complexity. To improve, the writer should focus on simplifying sentences, explaining technical terms, and reducing the use of complex vocabulary. For example, the sentence \"The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière’s disease is very uncertain\" could be rewritten as \"We are not confident in the evidence about medicines used to treat Ménière’s disease because there are few high-quality studies.\" By addressing these issues, the draft can better conform to typical PLS patterns and improve reader understanding.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft has a high rate of nominalization (27 instances), smog index (14), complex words (119 instances), and long words (202 instances), which are beyond the typical ranges for PLS texts. These metrics suggest that the text may be too complex for some readers and could benefit from simplification. The results also show that the draft has a good conformity with PLS patterns in terms of word count, sentence length, and use of active voice. However, the high rates of nominalization, smog index, complex words, and long words need to be addressed to improve the clarity and readability of the text."
