This process has been shown to protect tissues from damage caused by lack of blood flow, which can occur during vascular surgery. Vascular surgery, such as operations on the arteries, can be risky and may lead to serious complications, including death. RIPC has the potential to reduce the risk of these complications by protecting the tissues from damage.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about remote ischaemic preconditioning?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if RIPC is effective in reducing the risk of complications, such as death, heart attack, kidney damage, and stroke, in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery. They also wanted to know if RIPC has any effect on the length of hospital stay and operating time. The authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of RIPC compared to no RIPC in people undergoing these types of surgery.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing remote ischaemic preconditioning with no remote ischaemic preconditioning, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the benefits and harms in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1295 participants with a range of ages from 64.5 to 76 years and 84% of them were male. The studies were conducted from 2003 to 2019. The included studies were at low to unclear risk of bias for most risk of bias domains. The types of interventions and comparisons made were remote ischaemic preconditioning versus no remote ischaemic preconditioning for vascular and endovascular surgical procedures. Remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little to no difference in outcomes such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, and hospital stay for people undergoing major vascular and endovascular surgery. It may also make little to no difference in the risk of limb loss.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, heterogeneity in participant populations and intervention delivery methods, and a high risk of exaggerating benefits because only a small, possibly selective subset of studies was included in the review.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.",
