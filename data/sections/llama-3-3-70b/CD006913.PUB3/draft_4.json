  "draft": "Can psychological interventions, such as therapy or counseling (talking treatments that help people understand and manage their thoughts and feelings), help improve quality of life (overall well-being), depression (a mental health condition characterized by persistent sadness), and anxiety (a feeling of worry or fear) in people with inflammatory bowel disease (a condition where the digestive tract is inflamed)?\n\nWe found that psychological interventions may slightly improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety in people with inflammatory bowel disease. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. Patient education (teaching patients about their condition and how to manage it) and relaxation techniques (methods to reduce stress and promote relaxation) may also have small positive effects on quality of life, depression, and anxiety. But more research is needed to confirm this.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why is it a problem?\nInflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, is a condition where the digestive tract becomes inflamed, causing symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People with IBD are also at a higher risk of developing psychological problems like depression and anxiety. Treatments like medication and surgery can help manage the physical symptoms of IBD. But they may not address the psychological aspects of the condition. As a result, many people with IBD experience a reduced quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to investigate the effects of psychological interventions on the quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people with IBD. We aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve symptoms, reduce stress and anxiety, and enhance overall well-being for individuals with IBD.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies on psychological interventions for inflammatory bowel disease. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence. This helped us assess their effects on quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6141 people with inflammatory bowel disease. Most studies used multimodular approaches, including psychotherapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques. These interventions were compared to care-as-usual or other active treatments. Psychological interventions in adults are likely to improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety slightly. Psychotherapy is probably also effective for improving quality of life in children and adolescents. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may have little to no effect on disease activity.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. The studies were conducted in heterogeneous populations and used varied delivery methods for the intervention. The trials were very small, increasing the risk of random error. Participants were likely aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential performance bias. Moreover, the evidence does not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest. This limits its generalizability.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.\n\nKey messages:\n- Psychological interventions, such as therapy or counseling, may slightly improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety in people with inflammatory bowel disease, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Patient education and relaxation techniques may also have small positive effects on quality of life, depression, and anxiety, although the evidence is limited and more research is needed to confirm this.\n- Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of psychological interventions on inflammatory bowel disease, particularly to address the limitations of current studies, such as the variability in the types of interventions used and the lack of long-term follow-up, and to explore the potential benefits and harms of these interventions in different populations.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several clarity issues, including unexplained jargon, long sentences, and missing context. For example, the sentence 'Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss' is unclear because it does not define what 'inflammation' means. A suggested rewrite could be 'Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition where the digestive tract becomes inflamed, causing symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Inflammation refers to the body's natural response to injury or infection, which can cause redness, swelling, and pain.' Another issue is the use of passive voice, such as 'The studies were conducted in various countries and included adults and children with the condition.' A suggested rewrite could be 'Researchers conducted studies in various countries, including adults and children with the condition.' The metrics also show a high number of nominalizations (30.0), nouns (198.0), and complex words (160.0), which can make the text harder to read. To improve clarity, it is suggested to reduce these features to more typical PLS pattern ranges.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 33.3% of features in the best quartile (P25/P75) and 27.8% in the median (P50) range. However, there are significant deviations in 7 features, including nominalization, nouns, coleman_liau_index, smog_index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words, which are beyond the typical P90 range. These deviations contribute to the clarity issues noted in the feedback."
