  "key_messages": [
    "Psychological interventions, such as therapy or counseling (talking treatments that help people understand and manage their thoughts and feelings), may slightly improve quality of life (overall well-being), depression (a mental health condition characterized by persistent sadness), and anxiety (a feeling of worry or fear) in people with inflammatory bowel disease (a condition where the digestive tract is inflamed), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.",
    "Patient education (teaching patients about their condition and how to manage it) and relaxation techniques (methods to reduce stress and promote relaxation) may also have small positive effects on quality of life, depression, and anxiety, although the evidence is limited and more research is needed to confirm this.",
    "Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of psychological interventions on inflammatory bowel disease, particularly to address the limitations of current studies, such as the variability in the types of interventions used and the lack of long-term follow-up, and to explore the potential benefits and harms of these interventions in different populations."

      "subheading": "What is inflammatory bowel disease and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. People with IBD are also at a higher risk of developing psychological problems like depression and anxiety. While treatments like medication and surgery can help manage the physical symptoms of IBD, they may not address the psychological aspects of the condition. As a result, many people with IBD experience a reduced quality of life."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The authors of this review wanted to investigate the effects of psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy and relaxation techniques, on the quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people with IBD. They aimed to determine whether these interventions can improve symptoms, reduce stress and anxiety, and enhance overall well-being for individuals with IBD."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 68 studies that involved 6141 people with inflammatory bowel disease. The studies were conducted in various countries and included adults and children with the condition. Most studies used multimodular approaches, including psychotherapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques, and compared these interventions to care-as-usual or other active treatments. The studies lasted for at least two months, with some lasting up to a year or more. The population characteristics varied, but most studies included adults, with a few focusing on children and adolescents. The studies were conducted in different settings, including hospitals and outpatient clinics, and were funded by various sources, although the specific funding sources were not detailed. Psychological interventions in adults are likely to improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety slightly. Psychotherapy is probably also effective for improving quality of life in children and adolescents. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may have little to no effect on disease activity."

  "limitations": "Our confidence in the evidence is moderate because the studies were conducted in heterogeneous populations and used varied delivery methods for the intervention. The trials were very small, increasing the risk of random error, and participants were likely aware of their assigned treatment, introducing potential performance bias. Moreover, the evidence does not encompass all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest, limiting its generalizability.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2023."
