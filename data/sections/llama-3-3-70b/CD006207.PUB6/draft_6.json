  "draft": "What are the effects of wearing masks, washing hands, and other physical measures to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and influenza?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out. Here are the key messages:\n- Physical measures like wearing masks, washing hands, and other interventions may have a small effect on preventing the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and influenza. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness. This means cleaning your hands regularly can help prevent the spread of illness.\n- We need more research to understand how well these measures work, especially in vulnerable groups like the elderly and young children.\n\nWhat is the problem of respiratory viruses?\nRespiratory viruses, such as influenza (a type of flu) and coronavirus, pose a significant threat to global health. They can cause widespread illness and death. For example, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2003 SARS outbreak, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are all caused by respiratory viruses. While antiviral drugs and vaccines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these viruses.\n\nWhat are physical interventions and why are they important?\nPhysical interventions, such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, and implementing physical distancing measures, are crucial in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. These interventions can be used in various settings, including communities, healthcare facilities, and schools. The effectiveness of these interventions is critical in reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses and mitigating the impact of outbreaks.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions in interrupting or reducing the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We investigated various physical interventions, including medical/surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators, hand hygiene, and physical distancing measures. We sought to determine the impact of these interventions on the transmission of respiratory viruses, including influenza and COVID-19.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 78 studies that involved 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various settings, including suburban schools, hospital wards in high-income countries, crowded inner city settings in low-income countries, and an immigrant neighborhood in a high-income country. We found that wearing masks in the community probably makes little to no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness. There is uncertainty about the effects of face masks, and the use of N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks probably makes little to no difference for the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were conducted in different populations and used different delivery methods, the sample sizes were very small, participants were likely aware of their treatment, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWe need more research to understand how well these measures work, especially in vulnerable groups like the elderly and young children. The current evidence suggests that hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness, although the effect may vary depending on the setting and population. Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current evidence, including the need for large, well-designed studies to investigate the effectiveness of physical interventions in multiple settings and populations, and to better understand the potential harms and benefits of these measures, particularly in vulnerable groups such as the elderly and young children.",

      "feedback": "The draft text provided has several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity and readability for patients. Firstly, the sentence \"Respiratory viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus, pose a significant threat to global health.\" could be rephrased for better understanding. The use of technical terms like \"respiratory viruses\" without explanation might confuse some readers. A suggested rewrite could be: \"Viruses like the flu and COVID-19 can cause serious global health issues.\" Secondly, the draft contains some long sentences that are hard to follow, such as \"We found 78 studies that involved 610,872 people.\" While this sentence is not excessively long, the draft could benefit from shorter sentences for easier comprehension. Lastly, the metrics show a high number of nouns, complex words, and long words, which can make the text difficult to read. For instance, the smog_index is beyond P90, indicating a need to simplify the language used. A concrete suggestion would be to replace complex words with simpler alternatives and break down long sentences into shorter ones. The PLS evaluation results support these suggestions, showing that the draft has areas where it deviates from typical PLS patterns, particularly in the use of complex language and sentence structure. Overall, the draft requires revisions to improve its clarity and readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft has a good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns but shows significant deviation in certain metrics, such as the smog_index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words, which are all beyond the typical P90 range. This suggests that simplifying the language and reducing the complexity of sentences would improve the readability of the draft."
