  "draft": "What are the effects of wearing masks, washing hands, and other physical measures to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and influenza?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out. Here are the key messages:\n- Physical measures like wearing masks (which cover the nose and mouth to prevent the spread of viruses), washing hands (cleaning hands to prevent the spread of illness), and other interventions may have a small effect on preventing the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and influenza. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness. This means cleaning your hands regularly can help prevent the spread of illness.\n- We need more research to understand how well these measures work, especially in vulnerable groups like the elderly and young children.\n\nWhat is the problem of respiratory viruses?\nRespiratory viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus, pose a significant threat to global health. These viruses can cause epidemics and pandemics, leading to widespread illness and death. Examples of such outbreaks include the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2003 SARS outbreak, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While antiviral drugs and vaccines are available, they may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of these viruses.\n\nWhat are physical interventions and why are they important?\nPhysical interventions, such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, and implementing physical distancing measures, are crucial in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. These interventions can be used in various settings, including communities, healthcare facilities, and schools. The effectiveness of these interventions is critical in reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses and mitigating the impact of outbreaks.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions in interrupting or reducing the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We investigated various physical interventions, including medical/surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators, hand hygiene, and physical distancing measures. We sought to determine the impact of these interventions on the transmission of respiratory viruses, including influenza and COVID-19.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 78 studies that involved 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various settings, including suburban schools, hospital wards in high-income countries, crowded inner city settings in low-income countries, and an immigrant neighborhood in a high-income country. We found that wearing masks in the community probably makes little to no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness. There is uncertainty about the effects of face masks, and the use of N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks probably makes little to no difference for the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were conducted in different populations and used different delivery methods, the sample sizes were very small, participants were likely aware of their treatment, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWe need more research to understand how well these measures work, especially in vulnerable groups like the elderly and young children. The current evidence suggests that hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness, although the effect may vary depending on the setting and population. Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current evidence, including the need for large, well-designed studies to investigate the effectiveness of physical interventions in multiple settings and populations, and to better understand the potential harms and benefits of these measures, particularly in vulnerable groups such as the elderly and young children.",

For example, the sentence 'Respiratory viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus, pose a significant threat to global health.' could be rephrased for better understanding. Additionally, sentences like 'The evidence is limited because the studies were conducted in different populations and used different ...' should be converted to active voice. The PLS evaluation results show deviations from typical patterns, including a high number of nouns, complex words, and long words. To improve, the writer should reduce the number of nouns, use simpler vocabulary, and shorten sentences.",

The results also show a high smog index (16.27, beyond P90) and a high number of complex words according to the Dale-Chall readability test (297.00, beyond P90). These metrics suggest that the draft requires revisions to enhance clarity, readability, and conformity to PLS patterns."
