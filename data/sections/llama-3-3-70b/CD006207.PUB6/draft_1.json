These viruses can cause epidemics and pandemics, leading to widespread illness and death. Examples of such outbreaks include the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2003 SARS outbreak, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While antiviral drugs and vaccines are available, they may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of these viruses.\nWhat are physical interventions and why are they important?\nPhysical interventions, such as wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene, and implementing physical distancing measures, are crucial in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. These interventions can be used in various settings, including communities, healthcare facilities, and schools. The effectiveness of these interventions is critical in reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses and mitigating the impact of outbreaks.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of physical interventions in interrupting or reducing the spread of acute respiratory viruses. They investigated various physical interventions, including medical/surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators, hand hygiene, and physical distancing measures. The authors sought to determine the impact of these interventions on the transmission of respiratory viruses, including influenza and COVID-19, and to identify the most effective strategies for preventing the spread of these viruses.\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies on physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 78 studies that involved 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various settings, including suburban schools, hospital wards in high-income countries, crowded inner city settings in low-income countries, and an immigrant neighbourhood in a high-income country. The included studies were conducted in heterogeneous settings and populations, with some studies conducted during non-epidemic influenza periods, while others were conducted during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic or epidemic influenza seasons up to 2016. Six of the new trials were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with two from Mexico, and one each from Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway. The studies compared various physical interventions, including medical/surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators, hand hygiene, and others, to prevent respiratory virus transmission. We found no RCTs on gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports.\nMain results: Effectiveness of interventions\nWearing masks in the community probably makes little to no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness or COVID-19-like illness compared to not wearing masks. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness. There is uncertainty about the effects of face masks, and the use of N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks probably makes little to no difference for the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were conducted in different populations and used different delivery methods, the sample sizes were very small, participants were likely aware of their treatment (lack of blinding), and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains some technical terms without definitions, such as \"respiratory viruses\" and \"physical interventions\", which may confuse readers who are not familiar with these terms. For example, the sentence \"Respiratory viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus, pose a significant threat to global health\" could be rephrased to \"Viruses that affect the lungs, like the flu and coronavirus, are a major threat to global health\" to make it more accessible to a general audience. Secondly, some sentences are too long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For instance, the sentence \"The review...\" could be broken up into shorter sentences for better clarity. Additionally, the text could benefit from more active voice constructions and fewer noun-heavy sentences. The metrics from the PLS evaluation results support these observations, showing a high number of passive voice constructions and noun counts. To improve the text, the writer could consider simplifying technical terms, breaking up long sentences, and using more active voice constructions.",

The text also has a high smog index (17.04, BEYOND_P90) and a high number of long words (285.00, BEYOND_P90), indicating that it may be difficult for readers to understand.
