  "key_messages": [
    "Audit and feedback (a process where healthcare professionals receive information about their performance, or 'audit', and subsequent feedback on how to improve) can improve the quality of care provided by healthcare professionals, with benefits seen in areas such as prescribing (the act of giving patients medicines) and test-ordering (requesting medical tests), although the size of the improvement varies.",
    "The effectiveness of audit and feedback is influenced by several factors, including the way the feedback is delivered (for example, comparing an individual's performance to that of their peers, or using interactive methods), the involvement of a local champion (someone who supports and promotes the improvement), and the provision of actionable plans (specific steps to take to improve performance) for improvement.",
    "Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to identify the best ways to design and deliver audit and feedback interventions, particularly in terms of optimising their effectiveness and addressing key limitations, such as the potential for variation in how feedback is received and acted upon by different healthcare professionals."

      "subheading": "What is audit and feedback in healthcare?",
      "content": "Audit and feedback (A&F) is a strategy used to improve professional practice in healthcare. It involves measuring clinical performance over a specified period of time (audit) and providing the resulting data to clinicians or clinical teams (feedback). The goal of A&F is to prompt healthcare professionals to modify their practice when it is inconsistent with a desirable target, ultimately leading to better patient care."

    {
      "subheading": "Why is improving professional practice in healthcare important?",
      "content": "Improving professional practice in healthcare is crucial because it can lead to better patient outcomes, reduced errors, and more efficient use of resources. However, there remains uncertainty regarding the effects of A&F on improving healthcare practice and the characteristics of A&F that lead to a greater impact."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of A&F on the practice of healthcare professionals and to examine factors that may explain variation in the effectiveness of A&F. They aimed to identify the characteristics of A&F that lead to a greater impact and to determine whether A&F can be effective in improving professional practice."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 292 studies with 678 arms. The studies were conducted in various countries, with 26 studies conducted in low- or middle-income countries. Most studies (237, 81%) targeted physicians as the recipients of audit and feedback. The professional practices most commonly targeted in the studies were prescribing (138 studies, 47%) and test-ordering (103 studies, 35%). The studies featured multifaceted interventions, with clinician education (377 study arms, 56%) and reminders (100 study arms, 15%) being the most common co-interventions. Audit and feedback probably causes a moderate increase in desired healthcare practice. For every 100 healthcare professionals, 6 more may improve their practice. Audit and feedback may be most effective when it targets important performance metrics, measures individual practice, involves a local champion, includes multiple interactive modalities, compares performance to top peers or a benchmark, facilitates engagement, and features an actionable plan."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes and heterogeneity in participant populations and intervention delivery methods, which reduce precision and increase indirectness.",
