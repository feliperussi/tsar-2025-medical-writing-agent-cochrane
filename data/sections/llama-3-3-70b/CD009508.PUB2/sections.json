  "plain_title": "What are the best approaches to pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen muscles in the pelvic area) for treating urinary incontinence in women?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen muscles in the pelvic area) may slightly improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine), but the evidence is not very strong, and it is unclear which approach to this training is best, with benefits and unwanted effects varying depending on the type of exercise, how often it is done, and how it is supervised.",
    "Direct pelvic floor muscle training (repeated, isolated, voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles) may be more effective than indirect training (exercises that do not directly contract the pelvic floor muscles), but more research is needed to understand the differences between various training methods and their impact on incontinence quality of life.",
    "Future studies should investigate the best approaches to pelvic floor muscle training, including the type of exercises, frequency, and supervision method, to provide clearer guidance for women with urinary incontinence and to address the current limitations in the evidence, such as the small size and poor quality of many existing trials."

      "subheading": "What is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Urinary incontinence is a condition where people leak urine involuntarily, which can be embarrassing and affect their quality of life. It is common in women and can be caused by stress, urgency, or a mix of both. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is a recommended treatment for female urinary incontinence, which involves exercising the muscles in the pelvic floor to improve bladder control. However, there are different approaches to PFMT, and it is unclear which ones are most effective."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on urinary incontinence in women. They compared the effectiveness of various exercise types, doses, and delivery methods, such as supervised versus unsupervised training, to determine which ones work best to improve incontinence quality of life. They also looked at the evidence for adverse events associated with PFMT."

      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase) for randomized controlled trials that compared different pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) approaches for urinary incontinence in women. Search terms combined synonyms for \"pelvic floor muscle training\", \"urinary incontinence\", and \"women\" and were limited to studies published in English."

      "subheading": "Study Selection",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts against predefined inclusion criteria: (1) female participants with stress, urge, or mixed urinary incontinence; (2) comparison of at least two distinct PFMT protocols; (3) reported outcomes on continence or symptom severity; and (4) randomized design. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer."

      "content": "Data on participant characteristics, intervention details (frequency, duration, supervision), comparator details, outcome measures, and follow‑up periods were extracted using a standardized form. Results were summarized qualitatively and, where appropriate, pooled using random‑effects meta‑analysis to estimate mean differences or risk ratios."

      "content": "The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool was applied to each trial to evaluate randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selective reporting. Studies were classified as low, some concerns, or high risk of bias."

      "content": "The GRADE framework was used to rate the overall certainty of the evidence for each primary outcome, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Findings were presented with corresponding GRADE ratings (high, moderate, low, or very low)."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. The studies were conducted in countries around the world, mostly in middle- or high-income settings. Overall, study participants were mid-age parous women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence, who had no prior incontinence treatment or pelvic surgery, or appreciable pelvic floor dysfunction. The types of interventions and comparisons included exercise type, dose, and delivery, with some studies comparing direct pelvic floor muscle training to co-ordinated training, indirect training, or combinations of these. Pelvic floor muscle training may improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence. Co-ordinated training may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct pelvic floor muscle training. Direct pelvic floor muscle training may moderately improve quality of life compared to indirect training. The evidence suggests that individually supervised pelvic floor muscle training probably makes little to no difference in quality of life compared to group supervision. However, the certainty of the evidence is generally low, and more research is needed to confirm these findings."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because many studies may not have blinded participants to their treatment, not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, the study populations and intervention delivery methods varied, and the sample sizes were generally very small.",
