  "plain_title": "Can taking zinc supplements help prevent diarrhea, illness, and growth problems in children aged 6 months to 12 years?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Taking zinc supplements may help prevent episodes of diarrhea and slightly improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years, particularly in regions where zinc deficiency is common, although the overall effect on mortality is unclear (mortality refers to death rates).",
    "Zinc supplementation is associated with some unwanted effects, such as vomiting, and its benefits may be decreased when taken with iron supplements (iron supplements refer to additional iron intake, often in the form of pills or syrups, to increase iron levels in the body).",
    "Future research should focus on the long-term effects of zinc supplementation, its benefits and harms in different populations, and the optimal dosage and duration of treatment to better inform decision-making for children's health."

      "subheading": "What is zinc deficiency and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Zinc deficiency is a condition where the body does not have enough zinc, an essential nutrient. It is prevalent in low- and middle-income countries and can lead to various health problems, including increased risk of morbidity, mortality, and linear growth failure in children. Zinc plays a crucial role in many bodily functions, such as immune function, wound healing, and protein synthesis. Without enough zinc, children may experience stunted growth, weakened immune systems, and increased susceptibility to illnesses like diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections, and malaria."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the effects of zinc supplementation on preventing mortality, morbidity, and growth failure in children aged 6 months to 12 years. They wanted to determine whether zinc supplementation can reduce the risk of death, illness, and growth problems in children, and if it can promote healthy growth and development. The authors also investigated the potential benefits and harms of zinc supplementation, including its impact on diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections, and malaria, as well as its effects on growth outcomes and serum levels of micronutrients."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We systematically searched electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase) for studies on zinc supplementation in children. The search combined terms related to zinc, supplementation, children, mortality, morbidity, and growth, without language or date restrictions. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened against predefined inclusion criteria."

    {
      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "From each eligible study we extracted information on study design, population characteristics, zinc dosage, duration, and outcomes (mortality, morbidity, height/weight gain). Results were tabulated and, where appropriate, pooled using random‑effects meta‑analysis to generate summary effect estimates for each outcome."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Confidence Assessment",
      "content": "We evaluated the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. The overall confidence was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low, guiding the interpretation of the findings."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 96 studies that involved 219,584 eligible participants. The studies were conducted in 34 countries, with 87 of them in low- or middle-income countries. Most of the children included in this review were under five years of age. The intervention was delivered most commonly in the form of syrup as zinc sulfate, and the most common dose was between 10 mg and 15 mg daily. The median duration of follow-up was 26 weeks."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Zinc supplementation in children",
      "content": "Zinc supplementation probably reduces the incidence of diarrhea and slightly improves growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. However, it makes little to no difference in mortality due to all causes, diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection, or malaria. For every 100 children who receive zinc supplementation, 9 may experience vomiting episodes. The benefits of zinc supplementation may outweigh the harms in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by small study sizes, heterogeneity in participant populations and delivery methods, and incomplete coverage of the full range of people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022."
