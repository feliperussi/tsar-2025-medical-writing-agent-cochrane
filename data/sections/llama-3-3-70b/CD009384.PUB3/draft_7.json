  "draft": "Can taking zinc supplements help prevent diarrhea, illness, and growth problems in children aged 6 months to 12 years?\n\nWe found that taking zinc supplements may help prevent episodes of diarrhea and slightly improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years, particularly in regions where zinc deficiency (a condition where the body lacks sufficient zinc, a vital nutrient necessary for various bodily functions, such as immune function, wound healing, and protein synthesis) is common. Zinc supplementation is associated with some unwanted effects, such as vomiting, and its benefits may be decreased when taken with iron supplements (additional iron intake, often in the form of pills or syrups, to increase iron levels in the body). Future research should focus on the long-term effects of zinc supplementation, its benefits and harms in different populations, and the optimal dosage and duration of treatment to better inform decision-making for children's health.\n\nWhat is zinc deficiency and why is it a problem?\nZinc deficiency occurs when the body lacks sufficient zinc, a vital nutrient necessary for various bodily functions, such as immune function (the body's ability to fight infection), wound healing, and protein synthesis (the process of creating proteins). It is prevalent in low- and middle-income countries and can lead to various health problems, including increased risk of morbidity (the state of being diseased), mortality (death rates), and linear growth failure in children.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe assessed the effects of zinc supplementation on preventing mortality, morbidity, and growth failure in children aged 6 months to 12 years. We wanted to determine whether zinc supplementation can reduce the risk of death, illness, and growth problems in children, and if it can promote healthy growth and development. We also investigated the potential benefits and harms of zinc supplementation, including its impact on diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections, and malaria, as well as its effects on growth outcomes and serum levels of micronutrients (essential nutrients required in small amounts).\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe systematically searched electronic databases for studies on zinc supplementation in children. The search combined terms related to zinc, supplementation, children, mortality, morbidity, and growth, without language or date restrictions. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened against predefined inclusion criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 96 studies that involved 219,584 eligible participants. The studies were conducted in 34 countries, with 87 of them in low- or middle-income countries. Most of the children included in this review were under five years of age. The intervention was delivered most commonly in the form of syrup as zinc sulfate, and the most common dose was between 10 mg and 15 mg daily. The median duration of follow-up was 26 weeks.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nZinc supplementation probably reduces the incidence of diarrhea and slightly improves growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years. However, it makes little to no difference in mortality due to all causes, diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection, or malaria. For every 100 children who receive zinc supplementation, 9 may experience vomiting episodes. The benefits of zinc supplementation may outweigh the harms in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the evidence is limited by small study sizes, heterogeneity in participant populations and delivery methods, and incomplete coverage of the full range of people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Taking zinc supplements may help prevent episodes of diarrhea and slightly improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years, particularly in regions where zinc deficiency is common.\n- Zinc supplementation is associated with some unwanted effects, such as vomiting, and its benefits may be decreased when taken with iron supplements.\n- Future research should focus on the long-term effects of zinc supplementation, its benefits and harms in different populations, and the optimal dosage and duration of treatment to better inform decision-making for children's health.",

For example, the sentence 'Zinc deficiency is a condition where the body does not have enough zinc, an essential nutrient.' could be rephrased as 'What is zinc deficiency?' to improve clarity. Additionally, the text uses excessive passive voice, with 20 instances, which can make it harder to follow. The suggested rewrite for the sentence 'The review authors aimed to assess the effects of zinc supplementation on preventing mortality, morbidity, and growth failure in children aged 6 months to 12 years.' could be 'We wanted to find out if zinc supplements can help prevent death, illness, and growth problems in children.'.",
