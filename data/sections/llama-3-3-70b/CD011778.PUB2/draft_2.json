  "draft": "Is using light therapy (photodynamic therapy) in addition to deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation) effective for treating gum disease (periodontitis) and infections around dental implants (peri-implant diseases)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Using light therapy (photodynamic therapy, a treatment that uses light energy to kill micro-organisms) in addition to deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation, a procedure to remove plaque and bacteria from teeth or dental implants) for treating gum disease (periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory condition that destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus) and infections around dental implants (peri-implant diseases, conditions characterized by inflammation and loss of supporting bone) may have some benefits, but due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear if it leads to improved clinical outcomes.\n- The current evidence does not show significant differences between using light therapy with deep cleaning and using deep cleaning alone for these conditions, suggesting that any benefits from adding light therapy may be too small to be clinically important.\n- Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more reliable estimates of the benefits and potential harms of using light therapy in addition to deep cleaning for gum disease and infections around dental implants.\n\nWhat are periodontal and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontal and peri-implant diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions that occur in the mouth. Periodontitis progressively destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus if left untreated, while peri-implant diseases occur in tissues around dental implants, characterized by inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa and subsequent progressive loss of supporting bone. Common treatments for these conditions include cleaning the pockets around teeth or dental implants, improving oral hygiene, controlling risk factors such as smoking, and surgical interventions.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of using antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as an adjunctive treatment to subgingival instrumentation (SI) for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults. They aimed to compare the outcomes of SI with adjunctive aPDT versus SI alone or with placebo aPDT, focusing on clinical outcomes such as probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and adverse effects related to aPDT.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) with standard treatment for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases. We used established criteria to assess the overall certainty of the conclusions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 50 studies that involved 1407 people with periodontitis or peri-implant diseases. Most studies used a split-mouth study design, while only 18 studies used a parallel-group design. The studies were small, ranging from 10 participants to 88. Adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) was given in a single session in 39 studies, in multiple sessions in 11 studies, and one study included both single and multiple sessions. The use of adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy for treating periodontal and peri-implant diseases may have little to no effect on outcome, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), the studies were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and used varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains some technical terms without clear definitions, such as \"antimicrobial photodynamic therapy\" and \"subgingival instrumentation\", which may confuse readers who are not familiar with these terms. For example, the sentence \"Adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) was given in a single session in 39 studies, in multiple sessions in 11 studies, and one study included both single and multiple sessions\" contains the term \"aPDT\" without explaining what it means. To improve this, the draft could include a brief explanation of these terms when they are first introduced. Additionally, some sentences are quite long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For instance, the sentence \"The review authors wanted to assess the effects of using antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as an adjunctive treatment to subgingival instrumentation (SI) for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults\" could be broken up into shorter sentences for better clarity. Furthermore, the text could benefit from more active voice constructions, as the current draft has a high number of passive voice instances, which can make the text seem less engaging and more difficult to understand. The PLS evaluation results support these observations, showing a high number of passive voice constructions and a low Flesch reading ease score, indicating that the text may be difficult for some readers to understand. Overall, while the draft provides a good overview of the topic, it needs some revisions to improve its clarity, readability, and engagement.",
