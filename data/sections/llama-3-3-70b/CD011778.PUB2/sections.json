  "key_messages": [
    "Using light therapy (photodynamic therapy, a treatment that uses light energy to kill micro-organisms) in addition to deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation, a procedure to remove plaque and bacteria from teeth or dental implants) for treating gum disease (periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory condition that destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus) and infections around dental implants (peri-implant diseases, conditions characterized by inflammation and loss of supporting bone) may have some benefits, but due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear if it leads to improved clinical outcomes; harmful effects were rarely reported, but when they were, they seemed minor.",
    "The current evidence does not show significant differences between using light therapy with deep cleaning and using deep cleaning alone for these conditions, suggesting that any benefits from adding light therapy may be too small to be clinically important.",
    "Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more reliable estimates of the benefits and potential harms of using light therapy in addition to deep cleaning for gum disease and infections around dental implants, including its effects on patient satisfaction and quality of life."

      "subheading": "What are periodontal and peri-implant diseases?",
      "content": "Periodontal and peri-implant diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions that occur in the mouth. Periodontitis progressively destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus if left untreated, while peri-implant diseases occur in tissues around dental implants, characterized by inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa and subsequent progressive loss of supporting bone. Common treatments for these conditions include cleaning the pockets around teeth or dental implants, improving oral hygiene, controlling risk factors such as smoking, and surgical interventions."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of using antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as an adjunctive treatment to subgingival instrumentation (SI) for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults. They aimed to compare the outcomes of SI with adjunctive aPDT versus SI alone or with placebo aPDT, focusing on clinical outcomes such as probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and adverse effects related to aPDT."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 50 studies that involved 1407 people with periodontitis or peri-implant diseases. Most studies used a split-mouth study design, while only 18 studies used a parallel-group design. The studies were small, ranging from 10 participants to 88. Adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) was given in a single session in 39 studies, in multiple sessions in 11 studies, and one study included both single and multiple sessions. The population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources were not explicitly reported in the abstract. The types of interventions and comparisons included subgingival instrumentation (SI) with adjunctive aPDT versus SI alone or with placebo aPDT. No studies reported on people with peri-implantitis, and only one study included people with peri-implant mucositis, but this very small study reported no data at six months. The use of adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy for treating periodontal and peri-implant diseases may have little to no effect on outcome, but we are very uncertain about the results. It is unclear if this intervention has an effect on clinical outcomes such as probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and gingival recession."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), the studies were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and used varied methods of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2024."
