  "draft": "Is using light therapy (photodynamic therapy, a treatment that uses light energy to kill micro-organisms) in addition to deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation, a procedure to remove plaque and bacteria from teeth or dental implants) effective for treating gum disease (periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory condition that destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus) and infections around dental implants (peri-implant diseases, conditions characterized by inflammation and loss of supporting bone)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that using light therapy in addition to deep cleaning for treating gum disease and infections around dental implants may have some benefits, but due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear if it leads to improved clinical outcomes.\n- The current evidence does not show significant differences between using light therapy with deep cleaning and using deep cleaning alone for these conditions, suggesting that any benefits from adding light therapy may be too small to be clinically important.\n- We think future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies that can provide more reliable estimates of the benefits and potential harms of using light therapy in addition to deep cleaning for gum disease and infections around dental implants.\n\nWhat are periodontal and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontal and peri-implant diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions that occur in the mouth. Periodontitis progressively destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus if left untreated, while peri-implant diseases occur in tissues around dental implants, characterized by inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa and subsequent progressive loss of supporting bone. Common treatments for these conditions include cleaning the pockets around teeth or dental implants, improving oral hygiene, controlling risk factors such as smoking, and surgical interventions.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of using antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT, a treatment that uses light energy to kill micro-organisms) as an adjunctive treatment to subgingival instrumentation (SI, a procedure to remove plaque and bacteria from teeth or dental implants) for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults. We aimed to compare the outcomes of SI with adjunctive aPDT versus SI alone or with placebo aPDT, focusing on clinical outcomes such as probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and adverse effects related to aPDT.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) with standard treatment for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases. We used established criteria to assess the overall certainty of the conclusions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 50 studies that involved 1407 people with periodontitis or peri-implant diseases. Most studies used a split-mouth study design, while only 18 studies used a parallel-group design. The studies were small, ranging from 10 participants to 88. Adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) was given in a single session in 39 studies, in multiple sessions in 11 studies, and one study included both single and multiple sessions. We are very uncertain about the results, but they suggest that using light therapy in addition to deep cleaning may have little to no effect on outcome.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), the studies were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and used varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

For example, the sentence 'Periodontal and peri-implant diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions that occur in the mouth' could be rephrased as 'What are periodontal and peri-implant diseases?' to improve clarity. Additionally, the text exceeds the recommended word count and has high levels of nominalization, nouns, and complex words, which can make it difficult for readers to understand. To improve readability, it is suggested to reduce the word count, use simpler language, and break up long sentences into shorter ones.",

The results also show that the text has a high number of long words and complex words, which can make it harder for readers to follow.
