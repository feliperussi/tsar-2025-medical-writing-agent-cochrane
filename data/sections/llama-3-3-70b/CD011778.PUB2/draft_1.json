Periodontitis progressively destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus if left untreated, while peri-implant diseases occur in tissues around dental implants, characterized by inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa and subsequent progressive loss of supporting bone. Common treatments for these conditions include cleaning the pockets around teeth or dental implants, improving oral hygiene, controlling risk factors such as smoking, and surgical interventions.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of using antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as an adjunctive treatment to subgingival instrumentation (SI) for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults. They aimed to compare the outcomes of SI with adjunctive aPDT versus SI alone or with placebo aPDT, focusing on clinical outcomes such as probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and adverse effects related to aPDT.\n\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe searched for studies comparing adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) with standard treatment for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases.\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nWe extracted relevant outcomes from each eligible study, summarized the results, and performed a qualitative synthesis of the findings.\n### Confidence Assessment\nWe evaluated our confidence in the evidence using established criteria (e.g., GRADE) to assess the overall certainty of the conclusions.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 50 studies that involved 1407 people with periodontitis or peri-implant diseases. Most studies used a split-mouth study design, while only 18 studies used a parallel-group design. The studies were small, ranging from 10 participants to 88. Adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) was given in a single session in 39 studies, in multiple sessions in 11 studies, and one study included both single and multiple sessions. The population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources were not explicitly reported in the abstract. The types of interventions and comparisons included subgingival instrumentation (SI) with adjunctive aPDT versus SI alone or with placebo aPDT. No studies reported on people with peri-implantitis, and only one study included people with peri-implant mucositis, but this very small study reported no data at six months. The use of adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy for treating periodontal and peri-implant diseases may have little to no effect on outcome, but we are very uncertain about the results. It is unclear if this intervention has an effect on clinical outcomes such as probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and gingival recession.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), the studies were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and used varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains many long sentences that are hard to follow, such as the first sentence in the introduction, which has more than 30 words. Additionally, there are instances of unexplained jargon, like \"antimicrobial photodynamic therapy\" and \"subgingival instrumentation\", which may confuse readers who are not familiar with these terms. Furthermore, the text could benefit from more active voice constructions, as the current draft has a high number of passive voice instances, which can make the text seem less engaging. Lastly, the draft exceeds the recommended word count, which may deter some readers. To address these issues, the writer could break up long sentences into shorter ones, define technical terms, use more active voice constructions, and edit the text to be more concise. The PLS evaluation results support these suggestions, showing that the draft has high scores for metrics like words per sentence, nominalization, and nouns, and low scores for metrics like flesch reading ease. Overall, with some revisions to address these issues, the draft could be more effective in communicating its message to readers.",
