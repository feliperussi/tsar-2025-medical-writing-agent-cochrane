    "Cognitive rehabilitation (a personalized approach to help people manage everyday activities) is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage the everyday activities targeted in the intervention (everyday activities include tasks such as bathing, cooking, and managing personal care), with no reported harmful effects.",
    "Future research should focus on: identifying avenues to maximize the effects of cognitive rehabilitation and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing, including process evaluation studies to understand how cognitive rehabilitation works and for whom it is most effective."

      "content": "Dementia is a condition that affects a person's memory, thinking, and behavior. It can make everyday activities difficult, affecting a person's independence and quality of life. People with dementia may have trouble with memory, communication, problem-solving, and other cognitive skills. There are different types of dementia, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common. While there are some treatments available to manage the symptoms of dementia, there is currently no cure."

      "subheading": "What is cognitive rehabilitation and how can it help people with dementia?",
      "content": "Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalized approach that aims to help people with dementia manage their everyday activities and maintain their independence. It involves working with a healthcare professional to identify specific goals and develop strategies to achieve them. Cognitive rehabilitation can help people with dementia to improve their memory, problem-solving skills, and communication, and to adapt to any changes in their cognitive abilities."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to evaluate the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia. They also wanted to identify and explore factors that may be associated with the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation. Specifically, they looked at the impact of cognitive rehabilitation on goal attainment, self-efficacy, immediate recall, and other outcomes, as well as its effects on care partners."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found six eligible randomised controlled trials that involved 1702 participants with mild to moderate dementia. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80 and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants had a diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The studies were conducted over a period of time, with the most recent search completed on 19 October 2022. The interventions compared cognitive rehabilitation with control conditions, and the primary outcome of interest was everyday functioning, operationalised as goal attainment in relation to activities targeted in the intervention. Cognitive rehabilitation is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage everyday activities. It probably causes a large improvement in goal attainment and may cause a small improvement in self-efficacy and immediate recall. However, it may have little to no effect on anxiety, quality of life, and general functional ability."

  "limitations": "The studies may lack blinding because participants could know which treatment they received, and they are very small, limiting confidence in the evidence.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to October 2022."
