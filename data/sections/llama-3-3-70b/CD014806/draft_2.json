  "draft": "Is sucrose (a type of sugar) effective in reducing pain for newborn babies undergoing a heel prick (a minor surgical procedure)?\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if sucrose helps reduce pain in newborn babies during a heel prick. \n- Sucrose probably helps reduce pain in newborn babies undergoing a heel prick, compared to not using any form of pain relief. \n- The quality of the evidence about the effectiveness of sucrose for pain relief in newborn babies is generally moderate. \n- Future research should focus on comparing sucrose to other pain relief methods and studying the long-term effects of using sucrose for pain relief in newborn babies.\n\nWhat is sucrose analgesia and why is it used for heel-lance procedures in neonates?\nSucrose analgesia refers to the use of sucrose (a type of sugar) to help relieve pain in newborn babies (neonates) during medical procedures, such as heel-lance procedures. Heel-lance procedures involve pricking the heel of a newborn baby to collect a blood sample, which can be painful for the baby. \n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about sucrose analgesia for heel-lance procedures in neonates?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness of sucrose analgesia in relieving pain from heel-lance procedures in neonates, both in the short-term (immediately after the procedure) and long-term. They also wanted to compare the effectiveness of sucrose analgesia with other methods of pain relief, such as water, non-nutritive sucking (when a baby sucks on something but does not get any nutrition from it), glucose (a type of sugar), breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin care (when a baby is held against their parent's bare chest).\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and clinical trial registries for randomized and quasi-randomized trials that compared oral sucrose with any alternative analgesic intervention for procedural pain in neonates. No language or date restrictions were applied.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nThe evidence suggests that sucrose probably results in a reduction in pain scores compared to the control group at 30 seconds and 60 seconds after lancing. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of sucrose on pain scores compared to other methods of pain relief, such as non-nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they were receiving (lack of blinding), and the studies were conducted in different populations and used different methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",
