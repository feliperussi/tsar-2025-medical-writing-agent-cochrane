  "draft": "# Is sucrose (a type of sugar) effective in reducing pain for newborn babies undergoing a heel prick (a minor surgical procedure)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Sucrose probably helps reduce pain in newborn babies undergoing a heel prick, a minor surgical procedure (a medical operation), compared to not using any form of pain relief, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about its effectiveness compared to other methods of pain relief, such as non-nutritive sucking (when a baby sucks on something but does not get any nutrition from it) or breastfeeding.\n- The quality of the evidence about the effectiveness of sucrose for pain relief in newborn babies is generally moderate, meaning that while there is some evidence to support its use, it is not conclusive and more research is needed to fully understand its benefits and potential harms.\n- Future research should focus on comparing sucrose to other pain relief methods, such as glucose (a type of sugar) or skin-to-skin care (when a baby is held against their parent's bare chest), and on studying the long-term effects of using sucrose for pain relief in newborn babies, to provide clearer guidance for healthcare professionals and parents.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is sucrose analgesia and why is it used for heel-lance procedures in neonates?\nSucrose analgesia refers to the use of sucrose (a type of sugar) to help relieve pain in newborn babies (neonates) during medical procedures, such as heel-lance procedures. Heel-lance procedures involve pricking the heel of a newborn baby to collect a blood sample, which can be painful for the baby. Sucrose analgesia is used to help calm and comfort the baby during this procedure.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about sucrose analgesia for heel-lance procedures in neonates?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness of sucrose analgesia in relieving pain from heel-lance procedures in neonates, both in the short-term (immediately after the procedure) and long-term. They also wanted to compare the effectiveness of sucrose analgesia with other methods of pain relief, such as water, non-nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin care.\n**Methods**\nSearch Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and clinical trial registries for randomized and quasi‑randomized trials that compared oral sucrose with any alternative analgesic intervention for procedural pain in neonates. No language or date restrictions were applied.\nStudy Selection\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts. Eligible studies enrolled neonates (≤28 days old) undergoing painful procedures and reported pain outcomes using validated scales (e.g., PIPP, NIPS). Trials comparing sucrose to placebo, non‑pharmacologic comfort measures, or other pharmacologic agents were included.\nData Extraction and Synthesis\nData on participant characteristics, intervention details (dose, timing), comparator, pain assessment tool, and results were extracted into a predefined spreadsheet. When possible, we calculated mean differences or risk ratios with 95 % confidence intervals and pooled them using a random‑effects meta‑analysis.\nRisk of Bias Assessment\nRisk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool, examining randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. Each study was classified as low, some concerns, or high risk of bias.\nConfidence in the Evidence\nThe overall certainty of each outcome was graded with the GRADE approach, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Evidence was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low confidence.\n**Results**\nReason for Termination\nThe agent stopped because it reached the maximum allowed number of iterations without producing a final answer. This limit prevents infinite loops and ensures the system remains responsive.\nNext Steps\nYou can try simplifying the request, breaking it into smaller parts, or increasing the iteration limit if you have control over the system settings.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they were receiving (lack of blinding), and the studies were conducted in different populations and used different methods of delivering the intervention.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",

The PLS evaluation results show that the draft text has a high number of passive voice constructions, nominalizations, nouns, and complex words, which contribute to the clarity issues. Overall, the draft text needs significant revisions to improve its clarity, readability, and conformity to typical PLS patterns.",
