  "plain_title": "Can exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a program that includes exercise and sometimes education and counseling to help people with heart conditions) help adults with heart failure (a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should) live longer, stay out of the hospital, and improve their quality of life?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a program that includes exercise and sometimes education and counseling to help people with heart conditions) likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life (the ability to perform daily activities and enjoy life, which is influenced by a person's health) in adults with heart failure (a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should), but there is no clear evidence of a difference in mortality (death) rates.",
    "Participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may have benefits regardless of the type of heart failure (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)), and the program can be delivered in different settings, such as at home or in a hospital, which could make it more accessible to different groups of people.",
    "Future research should focus on recruiting more diverse groups of people with heart failure, including older adults, women, and those with HFpEF, to better understand how exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation can help these individuals, and to address the limitations of current evidence, such as the lack of long-term follow-up data."

      "subheading": "What is heart failure and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should, which can lead to low energy, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs. It affects many people worldwide and can greatly impact their quality of life, increasing the risk of death and hospitalization. Common treatments for heart failure include medications, lifestyle changes, and in some cases, surgery or devices to support the heart."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out about exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for heart failure?",
      "content": "The authors of this review wanted to find out if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) can improve the health and well-being of adults with heart failure. Specifically, they looked at whether ExCR can reduce the risk of death, hospital admissions, and improve health-related quality of life compared to usual care without exercise. They also examined if different types of ExCR programs, such as those based at home or in a center, and various exercise routines, could achieve these benefits."

      "subheading": "Methods Overview",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search for studies that compared exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation with a no‑exercise control in adults with heart failure. Data were extracted on mortality, hospital admission, and health‑related quality of life, and the confidence in the evidence was assessed."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure. The studies were conducted with a median follow-up of six months. Most existing evidence includes patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), specifically those with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II and III, who received centre-based exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) programmes. However, there is a growing body of trials that includes patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) undertaking ExCR in a home-based setting "

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment (risk of bias), the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021."
