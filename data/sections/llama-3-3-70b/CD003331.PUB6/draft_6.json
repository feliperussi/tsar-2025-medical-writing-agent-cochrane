  "draft": "Can exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation help adults with heart failure live longer, stay out of the hospital, and improve their quality of life?\n\nWe found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces the risk of hospital admissions and may improve health-related quality of life in adults with heart failure. However, there is no clear evidence of a difference in mortality rates.\n\n- Participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may have benefits regardless of the type of heart failure.\n- The program can be delivered in different settings, such as at home or in a hospital.\n- Future research should focus on recruiting more diverse groups of people with heart failure, including older adults, women, and those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\n\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should. This can lead to low energy, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs. It affects many people worldwide and can greatly impact their quality of life, increasing the risk of death and hospitalization. Common treatments for heart failure include medications, lifestyle changes, and in some cases, surgery or devices to support the heart.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for heart failure?\nThe authors of this review wanted to find out if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation can improve the health and well-being of adults with heart failure. Specifically, they looked at whether exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation can reduce the risk of death, hospital admissions, and improve health-related quality of life compared to usual care without exercise.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies that compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation with a no-exercise control in adults with heart failure. We extracted data on mortality, hospital admission, and health-related quality of life, and assessed the confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure. The studies were conducted with a median follow-up of six months. Most existing evidence includes patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, specifically those with New York Heart Association classes II and III, who received centre-based exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs. However, there is a growing body of trials that includes patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction undertaking exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in a home-based setting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains some technical terms without definitions, such as 'heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)' and 'heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)', which may confuse readers who are not familiar with these terms. Additionally, some sentences are too long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For example, the sentence 'We found 60 studies that involved 8728 people with heart failure, and the studies were conducted with a median follow-up of six months' could be broken up into two simpler sentences. Furthermore, the text could benefit from more active voice constructions, as the current draft has 23 instances of passive voice, which can make the text seem less engaging and more difficult to read. To address these issues, the writer could provide definitions for technical terms, break up long sentences, and use more active voice constructions. For instance, the sentence 'The evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment' could be rephrased as 'We limited the evidence because participants knew their treatment'. The PLS evaluation results show that the draft has a high rate of conformity to typical PLS patterns, with 61.1% of features in the best quartile. However, there are some areas that need improvement, such as reducing the number of passive voice constructions and nominalizations. Overall, with some revisions to address these issues, the draft could be more effective in communicating its message to readers.",
