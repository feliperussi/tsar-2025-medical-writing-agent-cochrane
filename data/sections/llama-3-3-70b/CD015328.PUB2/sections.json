  "key_messages": [
    "Interventions to prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old, such as those focusing on diet (what we eat) or activity (physical activity, sedentary behavior, and/or sleep), may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up, with little to no difference found in dietary interventions alone, and no significant harmful effects reported.",
    "Dietary and activity interventions combined may result in a slight reduction in body mass index (BMI, a measure of body fat) and zBMI score (a measure of BMI that takes into account age and sex) at short- and medium-term follow-up, but the evidence is not strong enough to confirm this, highlighting the need for more research in this area.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as the lack of evidence on the effect of interventions on severe adverse events, health inequalities, and the needs of children living with disabilities, as well as exploring the long-term effects of these interventions to provide more definitive answers to the question of how best to prevent obesity in children."

      "subheading": "What is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Childhood obesity is a condition where a child's weight is well above what is considered healthy for their height and age. It's a major public health concern because obesity can lead to various health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues, and can also affect a child's development and well-being."

      "subheading": "What are the common approaches to preventing childhood obesity?",
      "content": "Common approaches to preventing childhood obesity include promoting healthy eating habits and increasing physical activity levels. This can involve changing dietary intake, such as reducing sugar and fat consumption, and encouraging more physical activity, such as playing sports or simply playing outside."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out which interventions, such as dietary changes or physical activity programs, are most effective in preventing obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old. They also wanted to know whether these interventions have any adverse effects and whether they can reduce the risk of serious health problems."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review includes 172 studies with a total of 189,707 participants. The studies were conducted in various settings, with the majority (111 studies) taking place in schools, followed by community (15 studies), home (8 studies), and clinical settings (7 studies). One study was conducted via telehealth, and 31 studies were conducted in multiple settings. The duration of the interventions varied, with 86 interventions lasting less than nine months, and the longest intervention lasting four years. Non-industry funding was declared by 132 studies, while 24 studies were funded in part or wholly by industry. The studies involved children aged 5 to 11 years, with a mean age of 5 years and above but less than 12 years. Most studies (146) were based in high-income countries. The interventions aimed to prevent obesity by modifying dietary intake or 'activity' levels, or a combination of both, and were compared to no intervention, usual care, or another eligible intervention. The review found that school-based activity interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up. Dietary interventions alone may result in little to no difference. It is unclear if these interventions have an effect on severe adverse events and health inequalities."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes, involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods, may have lacked blinding of participants, and do not comprehensively cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2023."
