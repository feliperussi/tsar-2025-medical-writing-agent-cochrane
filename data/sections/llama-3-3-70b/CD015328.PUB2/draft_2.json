  "draft": "What are the best ways to prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old?\n\n- Interventions to prevent obesity in children, such as those focusing on diet or activity, may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up. \n- Dietary and activity interventions combined may result in a slight reduction in body mass index (BMI - a measure of body fat) and zBMI score (a measure of BMI that takes into account age and sex) at short- and medium-term follow-up. \n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as the lack of evidence on the effect of interventions on severe adverse events, health inequalities, and the needs of children living with disabilities.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?\nChildhood obesity is a condition where a child's weight is well above what is considered healthy for their height and age. It's a major public health concern because obesity can lead to various health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues.\n\nWhat are the common approaches to preventing childhood obesity?\nCommon approaches to preventing childhood obesity include promoting healthy eating habits and increasing physical activity levels. This can involve changing dietary intake, such as reducing sugar and fat consumption, and encouraging more physical activity.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out which interventions, such as dietary changes or physical activity programs, are most effective in preventing obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years old. They also wanted to know whether these interventions have any adverse effects and whether they can reduce the risk of serious health problems.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review includes 172 studies with a total of 189,707 participants. The studies were conducted in various settings, with the majority taking place in schools. The review found that school-based activity interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes, involved heterogeneous populations, and varied delivery methods. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several clarity issues, including unexplained jargon, long sentences, and missing context. For example, the sentence 'Interventions to prevent obesity in children, such as those focusing on diet or activity, may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity at short- and medium-term, but not at long-term follow-up' is unclear because it does not define what 'modest beneficial effect' means. A suggested rewrite could be 'Some studies suggest that programs to help children eat healthier or be more active may slightly reduce obesity in the short-term, but we are not sure if this effect lasts.' Additionally, the draft uses passive voice in several instances, which can make it harder to understand who is doing what. The metrics show 8 instances of passive voice, which is within the typical range for PLS texts, but still worth addressing for clarity. The word count is within the limit, but the text could benefit from more paragraph breaks and simpler language to improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show good conformity with the typical PLS patterns, with 72.2% of features at the median level and 27.8% in the best quartile. However, some metrics, such as the Coleman-Liau Index and the Automated Readability Index, suggest that the text could be simplified further to improve readability."
