  "draft": "Preparing the uterus for a frozen embryo transfer: top strategies and the most effective method\n\nKey messages:\n- We compared different methods to prepare the uterus for a frozen embryo transfer (a procedure where an embryo that has been previously frozen is thawed and transferred into a woman's uterus) and found that they may have similar outcomes in terms of live birth rates (the number of babies born alive) and miscarriage rates (the number of pregnancies that end in miscarriage).\n- However, the evidence is often of low certainty, and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of these different methods.\n- We suggest that future research should focus on comparing the different methods for frozen embryo transfer, including their benefits and potential harms, and prioritize studies that are well-designed and large enough to provide reliable results.\n\nWhat is frozen-thawed embryo transfer and why is it important?\nFrozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) is a technique used in fertility treatment where an embryo that has been frozen is thawed and transferred into a woman's uterus. FET has become increasingly popular as it can increase the cumulative pregnancy rate, reduce costs, and is relatively simple to undertake. However, there are different ways to prepare the uterus for FET, and it's essential to determine the most effective and safest method.\n\nWhat are the different methods used to prepare the uterus for FET?\nThere are several methods to prepare the uterus for FET, including:\n- Natural cycles – this is when the transfer is done during a woman's natural menstrual cycle\n- Hormone therapy cycles – this is when hormones are used to prepare the uterus\n- Cycles that induce ovulation – this is when drugs are used to induce ovulation\nEach of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it's crucial to understand the differences between them to make informed decisions.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of different methods for FET, including natural cycle FET, hormone therapy FET, and ovulation induction FET. We also wanted to investigate the subtypes of these methods to determine which one is the most effective and safest for women undergoing FET.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different methods for frozen embryo transfer, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine the most effective and safest approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 32 studies comparing different methods for FET in 6352 women. The certainty of the evidence was moderate to very low. The main limitations were failure to report important clinical outcomes, poor reporting of study methods, and imprecision due to low event rates.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes and incomplete reporting of data for many outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022.\n\nWe hope this information helps subfertile women and their healthcare providers make informed decisions about the best approach for preparing the uterus for a frozen embryo transfer.",
