  "key_messages": [
    "Preparing the uterus for a frozen embryo transfer (a procedure where an embryo that has been previously frozen is thawed and transferred into a woman's uterus) using different cycle regimens (methods to prepare the uterus) may have benefits and unwanted effects, but due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear which method is the most effective and safest for subfertile women (women who have difficulty getting pregnant).",
    "The review found that natural cycle frozen embryo transfer (where the transfer is done during a woman's natural menstrual cycle), hormone therapy frozen embryo transfer (where hormones are used to prepare the uterus), and other methods may have similar outcomes in terms of live birth rates (the number of babies born alive) and miscarriage rates (the number of pregnancies that end in miscarriage), but the evidence is often of low certainty, and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of these different methods.",
    "Future research should focus on comparing the different cycle regimens for frozen embryo transfer, including their benefits and potential harms, and should prioritize studies that are well-designed and large enough to provide reliable results, in order to help subfertile women and their healthcare providers make informed decisions about the best approach for preparing the uterus for a frozen embryo transfer."

      "subheading": "What is frozen-thawed embryo transfer and why is it important?",
      "content": "Frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) is a technique used in fertility treatment where an embryo that has been frozen is thawed and transferred into a woman's uterus. FET has become increasingly popular as it can increase the cumulative pregnancy rate, reduce costs, and is relatively simple to undertake. However, there are different ways to prepare the uterus for FET, and it's essential to determine the most effective and safest method."

      "subheading": "What are the different cycle regimens used for endometrial preparation prior to FET?",
      "content": "There are several cycle regimens used to prepare the uterus for FET, including spontaneous ovulatory (natural) cycles, cycles using hormone therapy (HT) with or without a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa), and cycles using ovulation induction. Each of these regimens has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it's crucial to understand the differences between them to make informed decisions."

      "content": "The review authors aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of different cycle regimens for FET, including natural cycle FET, HT cycle FET, and ovulation induction cycle FET. They also wanted to investigate the subtypes of these regimens, such as the use of GnRHa, to determine which method is the most effective and safest for women undergoing FET."
