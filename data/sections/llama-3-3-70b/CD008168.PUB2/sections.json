  "key_messages": [
    "Intermittent phototherapy (stopping and starting light treatment) may be as effective as continuous phototherapy (constant light treatment) for treating jaundice (a condition that causes yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies, with little to no difference in the rate of decline of bilirubin (a yellow pigment that can build up in the blood), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.",
    "It is unclear whether intermittent or continuous phototherapy reduces the risk of bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction (a condition that can cause brain damage), as there is not enough good-quality evidence to answer this question.",
    "More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of intermittent and continuous phototherapy, particularly in preterm infants, and to determine whether one method is better than the other in the long term."

      "subheading": "What is neonatal jaundice and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Neonatal jaundice is a common health condition in newborn babies, where a yellow pigment called bilirubin builds up in the blood. High levels of bilirubin can cause brain damage, so it's essential to treat jaundice promptly. Phototherapy, which involves exposing the baby to special lights, is a widely accepted and effective treatment for neonatal jaundice."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to compare the safety and effectiveness of two different types of phototherapy: intermittent phototherapy, where the lights are turned on and off at regular intervals, and continuous phototherapy, where the lights are left on all the time. They aimed to determine whether intermittent phototherapy is as effective as continuous phototherapy in reducing bilirubin levels and preventing brain damage in jaundiced newborn babies."

      "content": "We searched for studies comparing intermittent and continuous phototherapy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess their safety and effectiveness for treating neonatal jaundice."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 12 studies that involved 1600 infants with neonatal jaundice. The studies compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy in jaundiced infants, both term and preterm, up to the age of 30 days. The population characteristics included infants with jaundice, with no specific information on gender or severity of condition. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not mentioned. The interventions compared were intermittent phototherapy and continuous phototherapy, with no information on the funding sources or the duration of the studies. The total number of people who took part in the studies was 1600 infants. Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to the rate of decline of bilirubin in jaundiced newborn infants. It is unclear if intermittent phototherapy has an effect on bilirubin induced brain dysfunction. Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to treatment failure or infant mortality."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the studies were very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2022."
