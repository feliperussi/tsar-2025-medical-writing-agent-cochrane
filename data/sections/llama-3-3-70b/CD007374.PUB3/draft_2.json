  "draft": "Do education programs help people with chronic kidney disease (a condition where the kidneys do not work properly) and diabetes manage their condition and improve their health?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Education programs for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes probably improve their blood sugar control, as measured by a blood test called HbA1c (a test that measures the average level of blood sugar over the past 2 to 3 months), but the effects on other important health outcomes are unclear, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Education programs may also improve knowledge of diabetes care and some self-management practices, such as diet and exercise, in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, although the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and potential harms of education programs for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, particularly in the long term, and to identify the most effective components of these programs, as the current evidence is based on a small number of studies with limited follow-up.\n\n**What is chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and why is it a problem?**\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to function properly, and diabetes is a condition where the body is unable to regulate blood sugar levels. Both conditions can lead to serious health problems if not managed properly. People with CKD and diabetes often have to follow complex treatment regimens, including strict diets, regular blood sugar monitoring, and medication. However, many people struggle to adhere to these regimens, which can lead to poor health outcomes.\n\n**What are education programs for people with CKD and diabetes, and how can they help?**\nEducation programs for people with CKD and diabetes aim to teach individuals about their condition, how to manage it, and how to make lifestyle changes to improve their health. These programs can include information and behavioral instructions, advice, and support from healthcare providers, and can be delivered through various methods such as verbal, written, audio-recording, or computer-aided modalities. The goal of these programs is to improve individuals' knowledge, skills, and confidence in managing their condition, which can lead to better health outcomes and improved quality of life.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of education programs for people with CKD and diabetes. They aimed to find out whether these programs can improve health outcomes, such as blood sugar control, kidney function, and quality of life, and whether they can reduce the risk of complications and improve adherence to treatment regimens. The authors also wanted to assess the certainty of the evidence and identify any gaps in the current research.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 8 studies that involved 840 people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes. The studies were conducted over a follow-up period of up to 18 months. The population characteristics included people 18 years and older with CKD and diabetes. The studies took place in various countries, although the specific countries were not mentioned. The types of interventions included education programs, which were compared to routine care alone. The education programs were delivered through various modalities, including verbal, written, audio-recording, or computer-aided methods. No information was available on the funding sources of the studies.\n\n**Main results: Education programs for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes**\nEducation programs may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programs probably decrease a measure of blood sugar control in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. However, the effect of education programs on other important clinical outcomes, such as death, serious hypoglycaemia, and kidney failure, is unclear.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (potential lack of blinding), and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search.",

For example, the sentence 'Education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes aim to teach individuals about their condition, how to manage it, and how to make lifestyle changes to improve their health' is unclear because it does not define what 'CKD' and 'diabetes' are. A suggested rewrite could be 'Education programs for people with chronic kidney disease (a condition where the kidneys do not work properly) and diabetes aim to teach individuals about their condition, how to manage it, and how to make lifestyle changes to improve their health.' Additionally, the metrics show high nominalization (37.0), noun usage (237.0), and complex words (140.0), which contribute to the clarity issues. The smog index (14.7) also indicates that the text may be too complex for some readers.",
