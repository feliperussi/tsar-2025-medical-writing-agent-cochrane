  "draft": "# Do education programs help people with chronic kidney disease (a condition where the kidneys do not work properly) and diabetes manage their condition and improve their health?\n**Key Messages**\n- Education programmes for people with chronic kidney disease (a condition where the kidneys do not work properly) and diabetes probably improve their blood sugar control, as measured by a blood test called HbA1c (a test that measures the average level of blood sugar over the past 2 to 3 months), but the effects on other important health outcomes are unclear, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Education programmes may also improve knowledge of diabetes care and some self-management practices, such as diet and exercise, in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, although the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and potential harms of education programmes for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, particularly in the long term, and to identify the most effective components of these programmes, as the current evidence is based on a small number of studies with limited follow-up.\n**Introduction**\n### What is chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and why is it a problem?\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to function properly, and diabetes is a condition where the body is unable to regulate blood sugar levels. Both conditions can lead to serious health problems if not managed properly. People with CKD and diabetes often have to follow complex treatment regimens, including strict diets, regular blood sugar monitoring, and medication. However, many people struggle to adhere to these regimens, which can lead to poor health outcomes.\n### What are education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes, and how can they help?\nEducation programmes for people with CKD and diabetes aim to teach individuals about their condition, how to manage it, and how to make lifestyle changes to improve their health. These programmes can include information and behavioural instructions, advice, and support from healthcare providers, and can be delivered through various methods such as verbal, written, audio-recording, or computer-aided modalities. The goal of these programmes is to improve individuals' knowledge, skills, and confidence in managing their condition, which can lead to better health outcomes and improved quality of life.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes. They aimed to find out whether these programmes can improve health outcomes, such as blood sugar control, kidney function, and quality of life, and whether they can reduce the risk of complications and improve adherence to treatment regimens. The authors also wanted to assess the certainty of the evidence and identify any gaps in the current research.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search for studies evaluating education programmes for individuals with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, using relevant databases, predefined keywords, and inclusion criteria.\n### Data Summarization\nFor each eligible study, we extracted key information on programme components, participant characteristics, outcomes, and reported benefits and harms, then synthesized the results across studies.\n### Confidence Assessment\nWe rated our confidence in the body of evidence for each outcome using a structured approach, considering study limitations, consistency, directness, and precision of the findings.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 840 people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes. The studies were conducted over a follow-up period of up to 18 months. The population characteristics included people 18 years and older with CKD and diabetes. The studies took place in various countries, although the specific countries were not mentioned. The types of interventions included education programmes, which were compared to routine care alone. The education programmes were delivered through various modalities, including verbal, written, audio-recording, or computer-aided methods. No information was available on the funding sources of the studies.\n### Main results: Education programmes for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes\nEducation programmes may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programmes probably decrease a measure of blood sugar control in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. However, the effect of education programmes on other important clinical outcomes, such as death, serious hypoglycaemia, and kidney failure, is unclear.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (potential lack of blinding), and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search.",
