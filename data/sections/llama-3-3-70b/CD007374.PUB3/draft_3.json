  "draft": "Do education programs help people with chronic kidney disease (a condition where the kidneys do not work properly) and diabetes manage their condition and improve their health?\n\n- Education programs for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes probably improve their blood sugar control, as measured by a blood test called HbA1c (a test that measures the average level of blood sugar over the past 2 to 3 months).\n- Education programs may also improve knowledge of diabetes care and some self-management practices, such as diet and exercise, in people with CKD and diabetes.\n- More research is needed to understand the benefits and potential harms of education programs for people with CKD and diabetes, particularly in the long term.\n\nWhat is chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and why is it a problem?\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to function properly. Diabetes is a condition where the body is unable to regulate blood sugar levels. Both conditions can lead to serious health problems if not managed properly. People with CKD and diabetes often have to follow complex treatment regimens, including strict diets, regular blood sugar monitoring, and medication.\n\nWhat are education programs for people with CKD and diabetes, and how can they help?\nEducation programs for people with CKD and diabetes aim to teach individuals about their condition, how to manage it, and how to make lifestyle changes to improve their health. These programs can include information and behavioral instructions, advice, and support from healthcare providers. The goal of these programs is to improve individuals' knowledge, skills, and confidence in managing their condition.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of education programs for people with CKD and diabetes. They aimed to find out whether these programs can improve health outcomes, such as blood sugar control, kidney function, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 840 people with CKD and diabetes. The studies were conducted over a follow-up period of up to 18 months. Education programs may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self-management practices. Education programs probably decrease a measure of blood sugar control in people with CKD and diabetes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest. More research is needed to understand the benefits and potential harms of education programs for people with CKD and diabetes.\n\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024. We will continue to monitor new research in this area and update the summary as necessary.",

For example, the sentence 'Education programmes for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes probably improve their blood sugar control, as measured by a blood test called HbA1c (a test that measures the average level of blood sugar over the past 2 to 3 months)' is unclear because it assumes the reader is familiar with the term 'HbA1c'. A suggested rewrite could be 'Education programmes for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes probably improve their blood sugar control, as shown by a blood test that measures average blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months.' Additionally, the draft text has a high number of nominalizations (27) and nouns (163), which can make the text harder to read. The PLS evaluation results show that the draft text has a high level of conformity to typical PLS patterns, but there are some areas that need improvement.",
