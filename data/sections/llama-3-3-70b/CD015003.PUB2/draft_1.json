  "draft": "# Can colchicine (a medicine with anti-inflammatory properties) help prevent heart attacks and strokes in people who have not had a heart problem before?\n**Key Messages**\n- Colchicine (a medicine with anti-inflammatory properties) may help reduce the risk of death from any cause (all-cause mortality) in people who have not had a heart problem before, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and it may increase the risk of diarrhoea (a condition characterized by loose, watery stools).\n- The current evidence does not clearly show whether colchicine can prevent heart attacks or strokes in people without prior heart problems, highlighting the need for more research in this area to provide clearer answers.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of colchicine on heart health in a more rigorous and unbiased manner, including its potential benefits and harms, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about its use for preventing cardiovascular events.\n**Introduction**\n## What is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and why is it a problem?\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) is a condition where the arteries become clogged with fatty substances, leading to chronic inflammation and potentially life-threatening complications. It is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, resulting in significant healthcare burdens and impacting the quality of life for millions of people. Common treatments for ACVD often focus on managing symptoms and reducing risk factors, but there is a need for effective preventive measures.\n## What is colchicine and how might it help with ACVD prevention?\nColchicine is an inexpensive drug with anti-inflammatory properties that has been used for centuries. Its potential role in preventing ACVD is of interest due to its ability to reduce inflammation, a key factor in the development of the disease. However, the effectiveness of colchicine in preventing cardiovascular events in the general population remains unknown, highlighting the need for rigorous research to determine its clinical benefits and harms.\n## What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the clinical benefits and harms of using colchicine for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in the general population. They compared colchicine to placebo, immunomodulating medications, or usual care to determine its effectiveness in reducing the risk of cardiovascular outcomes such as all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and adverse events.\n**Methods**\n## Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing colchicine to other treatments for preventing cardiovascular events, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n## What did we find?\nWe found 15 studies that involved 1721 people who were randomised and 1412 participants were analysed. The studies were conducted with follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 728 weeks. The intervention was oral colchicine compared with placebo, immunomodulating drugs, or usual care or no treatment. Most of the included trials focused on liver disease, rather than the general population. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not specified in the abstract. The study settings, including countries, were also not mentioned. The types of interventions and comparisons included colchicine versus placebo, immunomodulating drugs, or usual care. No information was provided about the funding sources of the studies.\n## Main results: Colchicine for primary prevention of cardiovascular events\nColchicine may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality, but it is unclear if it has an effect on non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke. Colchicine may increase the incidence of diarrhoea. The evidence is very uncertain for all outcomes, and more robust clinical trials are needed to determine the clinical benefits and harms of colchicine for primary prevention of cardiovascular events.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their assigned treatment (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and the available data do not cover all relevant populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",
