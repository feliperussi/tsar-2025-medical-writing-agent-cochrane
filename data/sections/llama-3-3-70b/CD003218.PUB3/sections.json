  "key_messages": [
    "Psychostimulants may reduce daytime sleepiness (a condition where a person feels extremely tired during the day) in people with myotonic dystrophy (a type of muscular disorder), but the evidence is limited and more research is needed to confirm this.",
    "The current evidence does not provide clear information on the long-term effects of psychostimulants on daytime sleepiness or quality of life in people with myotonic dystrophy, highlighting the need for more studies.",
    "Future research should focus on evaluating the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants in both the short and long term, as well as their effects on quality of life, to provide more definitive answers to the question of whether psychostimulants can help reduce daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy."

      "subheading": "What is myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Myotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects muscle tone and leads to excessive daytime sleepiness, also known as hypersomnia. This condition can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities. While there are treatments available, such as psychostimulants, it's essential to understand their effectiveness in managing hypersomnia."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the effects of psychostimulants on hypersomnia in patients with myotonic dystrophy. They wanted to determine whether psychostimulants can improve excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and other related outcomes, as well as evaluate the potential risks of adverse events associated with these medications."

      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and clinical trial registries for studies evaluating psychostimulants in myotonic dystrophy patients with hypersomnia. Search terms combined disease identifiers (\"myotonic dystrophy\", \"DM1\", \"DM2\") with hypersomnia descriptors (\"excessive daytime sleepiness\", \"EDS\") and psychostimulant agents (\"modafinil\", \"armodafinil\", \"methylphenidate\", \"amphetamine\"). No language or date restrictions were applied, and reference lists of relevant articles were screened for additional reports."

    {
      "subheading": "Data Synthesis",
      "content": "Eligible studies reporting quantitative outcomes on daytime sleepiness (e.g., Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Multiple Sleep Latency Test) were extracted. When possible, mean differences between treatment and control/placebo groups were pooled using a random‑effects meta‑analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic, and sensitivity analyses excluded studies at high risk of bias."

    {
      "subheading": "Confidence Assessment",
      "content": "The overall certainty of the evidence was appraised using the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Evidence was downgraded for small sample sizes, lack of blinding, and variability in outcome measures, resulting in a moderate to low confidence rating for the effect of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness in this patient population."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found six studies that involved 136 people with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. All studies included only adult outpatients, aged from 18 to 70 years old, and followed them only in the short term, up to four weeks. Five trials had a cross-over design. The studies evaluated the effects of psychostimulants, such as modafinil, compared to a placebo or no treatment. No information on study funding sources or the countries in which they took place was available. The population characteristics and study settings were not fully described, but it was noted that all participants were adults with myotonic dystrophy confirmed by clinical and electromyographic diagnostic, or genetic testing, and hypersomnia. Psychostimulants may improve excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy, but the evidence is uncertain. They may also increase the risk of adverse events. More research is needed to fully understand their effects."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and were conducted in heterogeneous populations with different methods of delivering the intervention, which reduces confidence in the findings.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2023."
