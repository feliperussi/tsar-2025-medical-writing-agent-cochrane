  "draft": "# Is receiving hospital care at home as effective as being in the hospital for older adults who need acute care?\n**Key Messages**\n- Receiving hospital care at home (where healthcare professionals provide active treatment in the patient's home for a condition that would otherwise require acute hospital inpatient care) probably makes little or no difference in mortality (death rate) or the likelihood of being readmitted to hospital for older adults who need acute care, compared to being in the hospital, although harmful effects were not commonly reported in the studies.\n- Admission avoidance hospital at home may improve satisfaction with healthcare and probably reduces the likelihood of living in residential care, as well as decreasing costs to the health service, but the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be very confident in these findings.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations of current studies, including the need for longer-term follow-up and more diverse patient populations, to better understand the effectiveness and potential harms of hospital at home care for older adults with different conditions and needs.\n**Introduction**\n### What is admission avoidance hospital at home?\nAdmission avoidance hospital at home is a type of care where patients receive active treatment by healthcare professionals in their own homes for conditions that would otherwise require hospitalization. This care is typically provided for a limited time period and can be an alternative to traditional inpatient hospital care.\n### Why is admission avoidance hospital at home important?\nAdmission avoidance hospital at home is important because it can help reduce the need for hospitalization, which can be beneficial for patients who prefer to receive care in the comfort of their own homes. It can also help reduce healthcare costs and improve patient satisfaction.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and cost of managing patients with admission avoidance hospital at home compared to traditional inpatient hospital care. They aimed to find out whether this type of care can improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patient satisfaction.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing admission avoidance hospital at home with inpatient hospital care, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine the effectiveness and cost of managing patients with these approaches.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that involved 3100 participants. The studies were conducted to compare admission avoidance hospital at home with acute hospital inpatient care. Most studies recruited participants with a mix of conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recovering from a stroke, and acute medical conditions, mainly in older populations. The studies lasted for a limited time period, providing active treatment by healthcare professionals in the patient's home. The review did not provide information on the study funding sources or the countries in which the studies took place. Admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little to no difference to patient health outcomes, may improve satisfaction, probably reduces the likelihood of relocating to residential care, and probably decreases costs. For older people, hospital at home may provide an effective alternative to inpatient care.\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the studies were very small. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

Specifically, it requires clarifying technical terms, reducing passive voice, and enhancing the structure for better patient understanding. For instance, the sentence 'Admission avoidance hospital at home is a type of care where patients receive active treatment by healthcare professionals in their own homes for conditions that would otherwise require hospitalization.' could be rewritten as 'What is hospital at home care? Hospital at home care is when healthcare professionals treat you at home for conditions that would normally need hospital care.' Additionally, converting passive voice to active voice, such as changing 'The review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and cost of managing patients with admission avoidance hospital at home compared to traditional inpatient hospital care' to 'We wanted to find out if hospital at home care is as effective and cost-efficient as traditional hospital care,' would improve readability. Furthermore, the draft would benefit from shorter paragraphs and more blank lines between sections to improve the overall structure and flow. The PLS evaluation results support these suggestions, indicating high rates of passive voice, complex words, and long sentences that deviate from typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show significant deviation from typical patterns in several metrics, including high rates of passive voice, complex words, and long sentences. Specifically, the results indicate 7 instances of passive voice, a Flesch reading ease score of 37.50, and a Coleman-Liau index of 13.04, all of which contribute to the clarity issues noted in the feedback. These findings suggest that the draft text could be improved by addressing these areas to enhance readability and understanding for patients."
