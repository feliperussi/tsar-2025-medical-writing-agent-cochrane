  "draft": "# Is infliximab (a medication that helps reduce inflammation) effective in preventing Crohn's disease (a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract) relapse?\n**Key Messages**\n- Infliximab (a medication that helps reduce inflammation) is probably more effective in preventing Crohn's disease (a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract) relapse compared to placebo (an inactive treatment), but the evidence about its effects on preventing loss of clinical response (when the treatment stops working) and serious unwanted effects is not clear due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- Infliximab may be as effective as a biosimilar (a similar version of the medication) in preventing clinical relapse, but may lead to more loss of clinical response, and there is not enough good-quality evidence to draw conclusions about its comparison to other treatments like adalimumab (another medication used to treat Crohn's disease).\n- Future research should focus on comparing infliximab to other active treatments for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease, ensuring adequate power calculations, and reporting methods to provide more reliable estimates of benefits and potential harms, which would help decision-makers make informed choices about the best treatment options.\n**Introduction**\n### What is Crohn's disease and why is it a problem?\nCrohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and irritation in the digestive tract. It can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to an abnormal immune response, genetics, and environmental factors. Current treatments for Crohn's disease include medications such as aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators, as well as surgery in some cases. However, these treatments do not always work and can have significant side effects.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about infliximab for Crohn's disease?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the efficacy and safety of infliximab, a monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. They aimed to find out whether infliximab is effective in preventing clinical relapse, loss of clinical response, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawal due to adverse events, compared to placebo or other active comparators.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing infliximab to other treatments for Crohn's disease, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that involved 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies were conducted between 1999 and 2022, with seven studies including biologically-naive patients and two including a mix of naive and non-naive patients. Three studies included patients in clinical remission, five included patients with a mix of activity scores, and one study included biologic responders with active disease at baseline. All studies allowed some form of concomitant medication during their duration. One study exclusively included patients with fistulating disease. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 69 years old. All but one single-centre RCT were multicentre RCTs. Four studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, two had a mix of commercial and public funding, and two had public funding. The interventions compared were infliximab versus placebo, infliximab combined with purine analogues versus purine analogues alone, and infliximab versus biosimilar or adalimumab.\n### Main results: Infliximab for Crohn's disease\nInfliximab is probably more effective in preventing clinical relapse than placebo. Infliximab in combination with purine analogues is probably more effective in preventing clinical and endoscopic relapse than purine analogues alone. There may be little or no difference in prevention of clinical relapse, withdrawal due to adverse events or total adverse events between infliximab and a biosimilar. Infliximab may lead to more loss of clinical response than a biosimilar.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, many were unblinded (participants may have known their treatment), and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest. Additionally, the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied delivery methods for the intervention, and the evidence does not encompass all relevant people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021.",
