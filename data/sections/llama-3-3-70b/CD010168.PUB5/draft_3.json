  "draft": "Does using a surgical drain after an operation to remove the appendix help prevent infection and other complications in people with complicated appendicitis - a serious condition where the appendix is gangrenous or has a hole in it?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if using a surgical drain after an operation to remove the appendix helps prevent infection and other complications in people with complicated appendicitis. Complicated appendicitis is a serious condition where the appendix dies or gets a hole in it, making it more likely to have problems after surgery.\n\nKey messages:\n- Using a surgical drain after an operation to remove the appendix for complicated appendicitis may not prevent infection or other complications, but the evidence is very uncertain and does not clearly show benefits or harms.\n- The current evidence does not support the use of abdominal drainage in preventing intraperitoneal abscess (a collection of pus in the abdominal cavity), wound infection, or morbidity (complications) in people undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy (surgical removal of the appendix) for complicated appendicitis.\n- Future research should focus on conducting larger studies to more reliably determine the effects of abdominal drainage on important outcomes, including mortality (death), and to address the significant uncertainty surrounding the use of surgical drains in people with complicated appendicitis undergoing appendectomy.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis and why is it a problem?\nComplicated appendicitis is a serious health condition where the appendix becomes gangrenous or perforated, leading to a higher risk of postoperative complications compared to uncomplicated appendicitis. Appendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is the primary treatment for acute appendicitis. However, people who undergo appendectomy for complicated appendicitis are more likely to suffer from postoperative complications, such as intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, and morbidity.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of abdominal drainage in reducing intraperitoneal abscess after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. They also aimed to compare the effects of different types of surgical drains and to determine the optimal time for drain removal. Additionally, they sought to investigate whether abdominal drainage can prevent intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity in people undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, and trial registries for randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that compared abdominal drainage with no drainage after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. No language restrictions were applied, and the search was updated to June 2024.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 739 people with complicated appendicitis. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia, and Africa and published between 1973 and 2023. The majority of participants had perforated appendicitis with local or general peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal cavity). All participants received antibiotic regimens after open or laparoscopic appendectomy. The studies compared the use of abdominal drainage versus no drainage, but no studies compared open drain versus closed drain or early versus late drain removal.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and the studies involved different types of participants and varied delivery methods, creating heterogeneity.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence is very uncertain whether abdominal drainage prevents intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, or morbidity in people undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Abdominal drainage may increase hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain. Consequently, there is no evidence for any clinical improvement with the use of abdominal drainage in people undergoing open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Larger studies are needed to more reliably determine the effects of drainage on mortality outcomes.",
