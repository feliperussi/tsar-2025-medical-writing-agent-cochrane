  "draft": "What are the best treatments for oral submucous fibrosis (a chronic disease of the mouth that causes pain and limits mouth opening)?\n\nWe found that antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) may help improve mouth opening and reduce pain in people with oral submucous fibrosis. However, more research is needed to confirm this. No harmful effects of antioxidants were reported, but there was not enough information to know if other treatments have harmful effects.\n\nAnother significant finding is that there is not enough good-quality evidence to know if other interventions, such as physiotherapy (a type of therapy that helps improve movement and function) or surgical procedures, are effective for treating oral submucous fibrosis.\n\nFuture research should focus on conducting high-quality studies that compare different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis and measure outcomes that are important to patients, such as improvement in eating, chewing, and speech, as well as potential harmful effects, to help determine the best course of treatment for this condition.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease of the mouth that causes progressive constriction of the cheeks and mouth, accompanied by severe pain and reduced mouth opening. This condition affects eating and swallowing, impacting quality of life, and increases the risk of oral malignancy. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing (chewing areca nuts, which can cause damage to the mouth).\n\nWhat are the current treatments for oral submucous fibrosis?\nThe mainstay of treatment for OSF has been behavioral interventions to support habit cessation, such as stopping areca nut chewing. Other treatments may include systemic, locally delivered, or topical drugs, as well as surgical procedures and alternative therapies like physiotherapy or ultrasound.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis. We wanted to assess the effectiveness of various treatments in improving symptoms such as mouth opening, burning sensation, and quality of life, as well as their potential adverse effects.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies on managing oral submucous fibrosis using standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 5 September 2022.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe included 30 studies with 2176 participants in this updated review. We found that antioxidants may increase mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. We also found that there is not enough good-quality evidence to know if other interventions, such as physiotherapy or surgical procedures, are effective for treating oral submucous fibrosis.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the findings do not apply to all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nWe used standard Cochrane methods to summarize the results. Our primary outcomes were - \n- participant-reported resumption of normal eating, chewing, and speech\n- change or improvement in maximal mouth opening\n- improvement in range of jaw movement\n- change in severity of oral/mucosal burning pain/sensation\n- adverse effects\n\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for this condition. We found moderate-certainty evidence that antioxidants administered systemically probably improve mouth opening slightly and improve burning sensation. We found only low/very low-certainty evidence for all other comparisons and outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to make an informed judgment about potential adverse effects associated with any of these treatments. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of the other interventions tested.\n\nHigh-quality, adequately powered intervention trials with a low risk of bias that compare biologically plausible treatments for OSF are needed. It is essential that relevant participant-reported outcomes are evaluated.",

For example, the sentence 'We found that antioxidants may increase mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis' is unclear because it does not define what antioxidants are. A suggested rewrite could be 'We found that substances called antioxidants, which can prevent or slow damage to cells, may help improve mouth opening and reduce pain in people with oral submucous fibrosis.' Additionally, the metrics show a high number of nominalizations (36.0), nouns (197.0), and complex words (168.0), which can make the text harder to read. The smog index (16.2) and gunning fog index (17.38) also indicate that the text may be too complex for some readers.",
