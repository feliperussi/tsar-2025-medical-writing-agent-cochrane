  "key_messages": [
    "We found that antioxidants (substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in people with oral submucous fibrosis (a chronic disease of the mouth that causes pain and limits mouth opening), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. No harmful effects of antioxidants were reported, but there was not enough information to know if other treatments have harmful effects.",
    "Another significant finding is that there is not enough good-quality evidence to know if other interventions, such as physiotherapy (a type of therapy that helps improve movement and function) or surgical procedures, are effective for treating oral submucous fibrosis.",
    "Future research should focus on conducting high-quality studies that compare different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis and measure outcomes that are important to patients, such as improvement in eating, chewing, and speech, as well as potential harmful effects, to help determine the best course of treatment for this condition."

      "subheading": "What is oral submucous fibrosis?",
      "content": "Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease of the oral cavity that causes progressive constriction of the cheeks and mouth, accompanied by severe pain and reduced mouth opening. This condition affects eating and swallowing, impacting quality of life, and increases the risk of oral malignancy. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing."

    {
      "subheading": "What are the current treatments for oral submucous fibrosis?",
      "content": "The mainstay of treatment for OSF has been behavioral interventions to support habit cessation, such as stopping areca nut chewing. Other treatments may include systemic, locally delivered, or topical drugs, as well as surgical procedures and alternative therapies like physiotherapy or ultrasound."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions for managing oral submucous fibrosis. They wanted to assess the effectiveness of various treatments in improving symptoms such as mouth opening, burning sensation, and quality of life, as well as their potential adverse effects."
