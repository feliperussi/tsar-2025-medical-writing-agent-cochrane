  "key_messages": [
    "Single-incision sling operations (a minimally-invasive surgical procedure using a synthetic device to support the urethra) may be as effective as other surgical methods, such as retropubic slings and transobturator slings, for treating stress urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine, often during physical activity) in women, with similar benefits in terms of subjective cure or improvement of incontinence.",
    "The evidence suggests that single-incision slings probably have a reduced risk of patient-reported pain at 24 months post-surgery compared with transobturator slings, but there are still uncertainties regarding adverse events (unwanted or harmful effects) and longer-term outcomes, such as the risk of mesh exposure, extrusion or erosion (when the synthetic material used in the sling causes complications).",
    "Future research should focus on providing longer-term data to clarify the safety and long-term effectiveness of single-incision slings compared to other mid-urethral slings, including their potential benefits and harms, to help inform decision-making for women with stress urinary incontinence."

      "subheading": "What is stress urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Stress urinary incontinence is a condition where women leak urine when they cough, sneeze, or exert themselves. It imposes a significant health and economic burden on individuals and society. Common treatments for stress urinary incontinence include pelvic floor exercises, bladder training, and surgery. One type of surgical treatment is the single-incision sling operation, which involves passing a short synthetic device through the anterior vaginal wall to support the mid-urethra."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of single-incision sling operations for treating urinary incontinence in women and to summarize the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations. They aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of single-incision slings with other types of sling operations, such as retropubic and transobturator slings, and to identify any uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 62 studies that involved 8051 women with stress urinary incontinence. The studies compared single-incision slings to other types of slings, including autologous fascial slings, retropubic slings, and transobturator slings. Most studies were conducted in various countries around the world, with the search date up to 20 September 2022. The duration of the studies was not consistently reported, but the primary outcome was subjective cure or improvement of urinary incontinence at 12 months. The population characteristics were not detailed, but all studies involved women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. There was no overview of study funding sources provided. The types of interventions and comparisons varied, but single-incision slings were the primary focus. No studies compared single-incision slings to no treatment, conservative treatment, colposuspension, or laparoscopic procedures. Single-incision sling operations may be as effective as retropubic slings and are as effective as transobturator slings for treating stress urinary incontinence in women. However, there are still uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes. Single-incision slings probably have a reduced risk of patient-reported pain at 24 months post-surgery compared with transobturator slings. The effect of single-incision slings on the risk of dyspareunia is uncertain compared with transobturator slings. Single-incision slings may make little to no difference to the risk of mesh exposure, extrusion, or erosion compared with retropubic slings."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by potential bias from lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes, heterogeneity in populations, interventions, and comparators, and a narrow focus that does not cover all relevant groups or outcomes. Additionally, many studies are small, involve few cases, or are insufficient in number, reducing confidence in the overall findings.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022."
