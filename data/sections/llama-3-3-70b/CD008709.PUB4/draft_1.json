It imposes a significant health and economic burden on individuals and society. Common treatments for stress urinary incontinence include pelvic floor exercises, bladder training, and surgery. One type of surgical treatment is the single-incision sling operation, which involves passing a short synthetic device through the anterior vaginal wall to support the mid-urethra.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of single-incision sling operations for treating urinary incontinence in women and to summarize the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations. They aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of single-incision slings with other types of sling operations, such as retropubic and transobturator slings, and to identify any uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women, summarized and combined their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effectiveness and safety of this treatment.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 62 studies that involved 8051 women with stress urinary incontinence. The studies compared single-incision slings to other types of slings, including autologous fascial slings, retropubic slings, and transobturator slings. Most studies were conducted in various countries around the world, with the search date up to 20 September 2022. The duration of the studies was not consistently reported, but the primary outcome was subjective cure or improvement of urinary incontinence at 12 months. The population characteristics were not detailed, but all studies involved women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. There was no overview of study funding sources provided. The types of interventions and comparisons varied, but single-incision slings were the primary focus. No studies compared single-incision slings to no treatment, conservative treatment, colposuspension, or laparoscopic procedures. Single-incision sling operations may be as effective as retropubic slings and are as effective as transobturator slings for treating stress urinary incontinence in women. However, there are still uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes. Single-incision slings probably have a reduced risk of patient-reported pain at 24 months post-surgery compared with transobturator slings. The effect of single-incision slings on the risk of dyspareunia is uncertain compared with transobturator slings. Single-incision slings may make little to no difference to the risk of mesh exposure, extrusion, or erosion compared with retropubic slings.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by potential bias from lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes, heterogeneity in populations, interventions, and comparators, and a narrow focus that does not cover all relevant groups or outcomes. Additionally, many studies are small, involve few cases, or are insufficient in number, reducing confidence in the overall findings.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

The text exceeds the recommended range in several metrics, including nominalization, nouns, smog index, dale-chall readability, complex words, and long words. To improve clarity and readability, it is suggested to reduce the use of complex words and phrases, break up long sentences, and use more active voice constructions. Additionally, the text could benefit from more concise language and the use of numerals instead of writing numbers as words. The PLS evaluation results show significant deviation from typical patterns, with 14 features deviating from the recommended ranges. The overall pattern conformity is rated as DEVIATES FROM TYPICAL PLS PATTERNS, with a best quartile rate of 22.2%. To address these issues, the writer should focus on simplifying the language, reducing the use of technical terms, and improving sentence structure to enhance readability and understanding for patients.",
