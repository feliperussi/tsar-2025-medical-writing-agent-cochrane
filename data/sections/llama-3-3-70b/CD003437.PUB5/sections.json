  "key_messages": [
    "Very low-certainty evidence suggests that pharmacological, psychological and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression after a stroke, while non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on the prevalence of depression, with pharmacological intervention being associated with adverse events related to the central nervous system (the part of the body that includes the brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal tract (the part of the body that includes the stomach and intestines).",
    "The current evidence does not allow us to fully understand the benefits and harms of these treatments, and more research is needed to determine their effectiveness and safety, particularly in terms of long-term effects and potential harms.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the short duration of treatment, to provide more reliable estimates of the benefits and potential harms of these therapies, and to inform decision-making for people with depression after a stroke."

      "content": "Depression is a common condition that can occur after someone has a stroke. It can impact a person's recovery and quality of life. Depression after stroke can be hard to detect and may not be treated properly. Common treatments for depression include medications, therapies, and other interventions."

      "content": "The authors of this review wanted to find out which treatments are most effective for depression after stroke. They looked at different types of treatments, including medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapies, and combinations of these. They aimed to determine the benefits and harms of these treatments and to identify the most effective approaches for managing depression after stroke."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 65 studies that involved 5831 people with depression after stroke. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, with a focus on evaluating the benefits and harms of pharmacological intervention, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these to treat depression after stroke. The included studies compared different types of interventions, including pharmacological interventions with placebo, non-invasive brain stimulation with sham stimulation or usual care, and psychological therapy with usual care or attention control. The studies also explored combinations of these interventions, such as pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy, or pharmacological intervention and non-invasive brain stimulation. However, we found no trials that reported on certain combinations, such as non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus non-invasive brain stimulation and usual care or attention control. The population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources were not consistently reported across the included studies, limiting our ability to provide a more detailed overview of these aspects. The review found that pharmacological interventions, psychological therapy, and combination therapies may reduce the prevalence of depression, while non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect. Pharmacological interventions were associated with adverse events related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. It is unclear if non-invasive brain stimulation has an effect on outcome. The effects of these treatments vary, so it is possible that they may make little or no difference."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and heterogeneity in the populations studied and the ways the intervention was delivered.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2022."
