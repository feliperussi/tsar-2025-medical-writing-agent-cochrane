  "draft": "What are the best treatments for depression after a stroke, and how well do they work?\n\n- We looked at different treatments for depression after a stroke, including medications, therapies, and combinations of these. \n- We found that medications, therapies, and combination treatments can reduce depression after a stroke. \n- However, a treatment called non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on depression. \n- Medications can cause side effects, such as problems with the central nervous system (the part of the body that includes the brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal tract (the part of the body that includes the stomach and intestines).\n\nWhat is depression after stroke and why is it a problem?\nDepression is a common condition that can occur after someone has a stroke. \nIt can impact a person's recovery and quality of life. \nDepression after stroke can be hard to detect and may not be treated properly. \nCommon treatments for depression include medications, therapies, and other interventions.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to find out which treatments are most effective for depression after stroke. \nThey looked at different types of treatments, including medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapies, and combinations of these. \nThey aimed to determine the benefits and harms of these treatments and to identify the most effective approaches for managing depression after stroke.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 5831 people with depression after stroke. \nThe studies were conducted in various countries and settings, with a focus on evaluating the benefits and harms of medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these to treat depression after stroke. \nThe included studies compared different types of interventions, including medications with placebo, non-invasive brain stimulation with sham stimulation or usual care, and psychological therapy with usual care or attention control. \nThe review found that medications, psychological therapy, and combination therapies may reduce the prevalence of depression, while non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect. \nMedications were associated with adverse events related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies had some limitations, including small sample sizes and differences in how the treatments were given. \nThis means that we cannot be very confident in the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Very low-certainty evidence suggests that medications, psychological therapy, and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression after a stroke, while non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on the prevalence of depression. \n- The current evidence does not allow us to fully understand the benefits and harms of these treatments, and more research is needed to determine their effectiveness and safety, particularly in terms of long-term effects and potential harms. \n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the short duration of treatment, to provide more reliable estimates of the benefits and potential harms of these therapies, and to inform decision-making for people with depression after a stroke.",

Issues include the use of passive voice, lengthy sentences, and high complexity in features like nominalization, nouns, smog index, complex words, and long words. Rewrite problematic sentences, reduce complexity, and improve sentence structure. For example, convert passive voice to active voice and break down long sentences. The PLS evaluation results support these suggestions, showing moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns but deviations in several key metrics.",
