  "draft": "What are the best treatments for depression after a stroke, and how well do they work?\n\n- Very low-certainty evidence suggests that medications, therapies, and combination treatments can reduce depression after a stroke. However, non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on depression. Medications were associated with adverse events related to the central nervous system (the part of the body that includes the brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal tract (the part of the body that includes the stomach and intestines).\n- The current evidence does not allow us to fully understand the benefits and harms of these treatments. More research is needed to determine their effectiveness and safety, particularly in terms of long-term effects and potential harms.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the short duration of treatment. This will provide more reliable estimates of the benefits and potential harms of these therapies and inform decision-making for people with depression after a stroke.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke and why is it a problem?\nDepression is a common condition that can occur after someone has a stroke. It can impact a person's recovery and quality of life. Depression after stroke can be hard to detect and may not be treated properly. Common treatments for depression include medications, therapies, and other interventions.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to find out which treatments are most effective for depression after stroke. They looked at different types of treatments, including medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapies, and combinations of these. They aimed to determine the benefits and harms of these treatments and to identify the most effective approaches for managing depression after stroke.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 5831 people with depression after stroke. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, with a focus on evaluating the benefits and harms of medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these to treat depression after stroke. The included studies compared different types of interventions, including medications with placebo, non-invasive brain stimulation with sham stimulation or usual care, and psychological therapy with usual care or attention control. The studies also explored combinations of these interventions, such as medication and psychological therapy, or medication and non-invasive brain stimulation. However, we found no trials that reported on certain combinations, such as non-invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus non-invasive brain stimulation and usual care or attention control. The review found that medications, psychological therapy, and combination therapies may reduce the prevalence of depression, while non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect. Medications were associated with adverse events related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and heterogeneity in the populations studied and the ways the intervention was delivered.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

For example, the sentence 'The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and heterogeneity in the populations studied and the ways the intervention was delivered' is hard to follow and contains technical terms without definitions. A suggested rewrite could be 'The studies had some limitations, including small sample sizes and differences in how the treatments were given.' Additionally, the metrics show a high number of nominalizations, nouns, and complex words, which can make the text harder to read. To improve, the writer could reduce the use of these features and use more active voice and pronouns.",

The draft text has a high number of nominalizations, nouns, and complex words, which contributes to the clarity issues noted above."
