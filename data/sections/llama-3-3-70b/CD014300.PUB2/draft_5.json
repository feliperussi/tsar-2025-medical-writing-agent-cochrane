  "draft": "Can psychological and social interventions help improve mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by wars, conflicts, or humanitarian crises?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether psychological and social interventions can help improve mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by wars, conflicts, or humanitarian crises. \n- Psychosocial interventions may have a slight positive effect on mental well-being in adults, but the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to confirm this finding. \n- Future research should focus on addressing the significant gaps in knowledge, including the efficacy of interventions on positive mental health outcomes.\n\nWhat is the impact of humanitarian crises on mental health? \nHumanitarian crises, such as wars, conflicts, and natural disasters, can have a devastating impact on the mental health of individuals living in low- and middle-income countries. About 84 million people are forcibly displaced worldwide, with the majority living in these countries. The stressors associated with humanitarian crises can threaten mental health, making it essential to promote positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well-being, psychosocial functioning (how well someone functions in social situations), coping (dealing with stress), and quality of life.\n\nWhat are psychosocial interventions, and how can they help? \nPsychosocial interventions are activities that help people manage stress and improve their mental health. These interventions can be particularly helpful for people affected by humanitarian crises, as they aim to enhance positive aspects of mental health. Previous reviews have focused on treatment and mixed promotion and prevention interventions, but this review concentrates on the promotion of positive mental health aspects.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions on promoting mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. They wanted to determine whether these interventions can improve mental well-being, functioning, quality of life, resilience (ability to cope with stress), coping, hope, and prosocial behavior (behavior that benefits others) in adults and children. The authors also sought to evaluate the acceptability of these interventions and the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes.\n\nHow did we search for evidence? \nWe searched for studies comparing psychosocial interventions to control conditions in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. We also searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished or ongoing studies.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 13 studies that involved 7917 participants. The studies were conducted in several countries, including Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania. Most of the interventions were delivered to groups of participants, mainly by paraprofessionals (individuals who are not mental health professionals but work with people seeking mental health care). The mean study duration was 18 weeks, with a range of 10 to 32 weeks. The studies were generally funded by grants from academic institutions or non-governmental organizations. Nine of the studies were conducted on children and adolescents, while four were conducted on adults. The interventions were compared to control conditions, such as no intervention, intervention as usual, or waiting list. Psychosocial interventions may improve mental well-being slightly in adults, but they may have little to no effect on children and adolescents. It is unclear if these interventions have an effect on functioning and prosocial behavior in adults. The evidence is uncertain, and future studies might either confirm or disallow these findings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small, potentially unblinded, did not report all outcomes of interest, and were heterogeneous in participant types and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

For example, the sentence 'Psychosocial interventions are activities that help people manage stress and improve their mental health' could be rewritten as 'Psychosocial interventions are programs designed to help people cope with stress and improve their mental wellbeing.' Additionally, the text uses passive voice excessively, with 18 instances, which can make it harder to understand who is performing the actions. The metrics also show significant deviations from typical PLS patterns, including high numbers of nouns, complex words, and long words. To improve, the writer should focus on using simpler language, breaking up long sentences, and providing more context for readers. The PLS evaluation results show moderate conformity with PLS patterns, but with several features deviating from typical patterns, including nouns, coleman_liau_index, smog_index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words.",
