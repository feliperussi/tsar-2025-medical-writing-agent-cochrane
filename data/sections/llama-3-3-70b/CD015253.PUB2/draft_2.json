  "draft": "Can autoinflation help children with fluid buildup in their ears?\nWe looked at the evidence on using a nasal balloon to clear fluid from the middle ear. \n\n- Autoinflation may help improve quality of life for children with otitis media with effusion (a condition where fluid builds up in the middle ear) and may slightly reduce how long the condition lasts. However, we are not sure about the effects because the evidence is uncertain.\n- We do not know if autoinflation helps children return to normal hearing or what its long-term benefits and harms might be. More research is needed to answer these questions.\n- Future studies should look at the long-term effects of autoinflation, its benefits and harms, and how it affects important outcomes like hearing loss, language development, and quality of life.\n\nWhat is otitis media with effusion (OME) and why is it a problem?\nOtitis media with effusion (OME) is a condition where fluid accumulates in the middle ear cavity. This is common in young children and can cause hearing loss, leading to behavioral problems and delays in language skills. OME can be persistent and may require different management strategies.\n\nWhat is autoinflation and how does it relate to OME treatment?\nAutoinflation is a simple technique that helps clear fluid from the middle ear by blowing air into the nose. It can be done using a nasal balloon or other handheld devices. The goal of autoinflation is to help open the Eustachian tube and ventilate the middle ear, potentially alleviating OME symptoms.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about autoinflation for OME in children?\nThe authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of autoinflation for treating OME in children. They looked at whether autoinflation can improve hearing, quality of life, and other outcomes, and considered potential harms like ear pain.\n\nWe searched for studies comparing autoinflation with other treatments for OME in children. We found 11 studies involving 1036 children. Most studies included children aged 3 to 11 years and were conducted in Europe or North America. The studies compared autoinflation to no treatment and required children to do autoinflation 2 to 3 times a day.\n\nAutoinflation may result in a moderate improvement in quality of life related to OME. It may also slightly reduce how long OME lasts. However, it is unclear if autoinflation affects return to normal hearing. Autoinflation may increase the risk of ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nThe evidence is limited by small study sizes and incomplete reporting of outcomes. The evidence is up to date to January 2023.",
