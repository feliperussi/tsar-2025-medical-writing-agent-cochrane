  "key_messages": [
    "Autoinflation (a technique using a nasal balloon to help clear fluid from the middle ear) may have a beneficial effect on the quality of life related to otitis media with effusion (a condition where fluid builds up in the middle ear, also known as 'glue ear') and may slightly reduce the persistence of this condition in the short term, but the evidence is uncertain and we have little confidence in the estimated effects, and it may also result in an increased risk of ear pain.",
    "The current evidence does not provide clear answers about the effectiveness of autoinflation for returning to normal hearing or its potential long-term benefits and harms, highlighting the need for more research in this area.",
    "Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of autoinflation, its potential benefits and harms, and the impact on important outcomes such as hearing loss, language development, and quality of life, to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making."

      "subheading": "What is otitis media with effusion (OME) and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a condition where fluid accumulates in the middle ear cavity, which is common in young children. This fluid can cause hearing loss, leading to behavioral problems and delays in expressive language skills. OME can be persistent and may require various management strategies, including watchful waiting, medical treatment, surgery, or mechanical treatment."

      "subheading": "What is autoinflation and how does it relate to OME treatment?",
      "content": "Autoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to ventilate the middle ear and encourage fluid clearance by providing positive pressure in the nose and nasopharynx. This can be done using a nasal balloon or other handheld devices, sometimes combined with swallowing. The goal of autoinflation is to help open the Eustachian tube and ventilate the middle ear, potentially alleviating the symptoms of OME."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out about autoinflation for OME in children?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of autoinflation as a treatment for otitis media with effusion in children. They wanted to determine whether autoinflation can improve hearing, quality of life, and other outcomes, while also considering potential harms, such as ear pain or other adverse effects. The authors sought to evaluate the effectiveness of autoinflation compared to other treatments, including watchful waiting, non-surgical treatments, or ventilation tubes."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with otitis media with effusion. The studies were conducted in Europe or North America, and they were carried out in both hospital and community settings. Most studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. The studies lasted for between 2 and 12 weeks, with the outcomes predominantly assessed just after the treatment phase had been completed. All studies compared autoinflation to no treatment, using a variety of different methods and devices, and required children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day."

      "subheading": "Main results: Autoinflation for otitis media with effusion",
      "content": "Autoinflation may result in a moderate improvement in quality of life related to otitis media. It may also slightly reduce the persistence of otitis media with effusion. However, it is unclear if autoinflation has an effect on return to normal hearing. Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of all outcomes of interest.",
