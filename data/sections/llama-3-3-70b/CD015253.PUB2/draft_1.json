This fluid can cause hearing loss, leading to behavioral problems and delays in expressive language skills. OME can be persistent and may require various management strategies, including watchful waiting, medical treatment, surgery, or mechanical treatment.\n### What is autoinflation and how does it relate to OME treatment?\nAutoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to ventilate the middle ear and encourage fluid clearance by providing positive pressure in the nose and nasopharynx. This can be done using a nasal balloon or other handheld devices, sometimes combined with swallowing. The goal of autoinflation is to help open the Eustachian tube and ventilate the middle ear, potentially alleviating the symptoms of OME.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about autoinflation for OME in children?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of autoinflation as a treatment for otitis media with effusion in children. They wanted to determine whether autoinflation can improve hearing, quality of life, and other outcomes, while also considering potential harms, such as ear pain or other adverse effects. The authors sought to evaluate the effectiveness of autoinflation compared to other treatments, including watchful waiting, non-surgical treatments, or ventilation tubes.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing autoinflation with other treatments for otitis media with effusion in children, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1036 children with otitis media with effusion. The studies were conducted in Europe or North America, and they were carried out in both hospital and community settings. Most studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. The studies lasted for between 2 and 12 weeks, with the outcomes predominantly assessed just after the treatment phase had been completed. All studies compared autoinflation to no treatment, using a variety of different methods and devices, and required children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day.\n### Main results: Autoinflation for otitis media with effusion\nAutoinflation may result in a moderate improvement in quality of life related to otitis media. It may also slightly reduce the persistence of otitis media with effusion. However, it is unclear if autoinflation has an effect on return to normal hearing. Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

For example, the sentence 'Autoinflation is a self-administered technique that aims to ventilate the middle ear and encourage fluid clearance by providing positive pressure in the nose and nasopharynx' is hard to follow due to its length and technical terms. A suggested rewrite could be 'Autoinflation is a simple technique that helps clear fluid from the middle ear by blowing air into the nose.' Additionally, the metrics show high rates of passive voice, nominalization, and complex words, which contribute to the clarity issues. The smog index and complex words dc are also beyond the typical PLS patterns, indicating a need for simplification.",
