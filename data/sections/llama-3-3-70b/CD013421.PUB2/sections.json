  "key_messages": [
    "Sealants (special liquids or materials used to stop bleeding) may help stop bleeding faster during vascular surgery (operations on blood vessels), but the evidence is not very strong, and it is unclear if they reduce complications, such as bleeding after the operation or the need to return to the operating room.",
    "Sealants did not seem to reduce the amount of blood lost during surgery, the time it takes to perform the surgery, or the risk of bleeding after the operation, although the evidence is limited, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.",
    "Future research should focus on providing more reliable evidence about the benefits and potential harms of using sealants in vascular surgery, including their cost-effectiveness and potential adverse effects, to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about their use."

      "subheading": "What is anastomotic hemostasis in vascular surgery?",
      "content": "During vascular surgery, connections between arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts, known as anastomoses, may be necessary. However, these anastomoses can bleed from the needle holes created during the procedure. Achieving hemostasis, or stopping the bleeding, is crucial in vascular surgery. Various surgical options are available to achieve hemostasis, including the application of sealants directly onto the bleeding vessels or tissues."

      "subheading": "What are sealants and how are they used in vascular surgery?",
      "content": "Sealants are designed for use in vascular surgery as adjuncts to conventional interventions when they are ineffective. They are applied directly by the surgeon to seal bleeding anastomoses. Despite the availability of several types of sealants, the evidence for their clinical efficacy in vascular surgery patients has not been definitively established."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of using sealants as adjuncts for achieving anastomotic site hemostasis in patients undergoing vascular surgery. They aimed to compare the outcomes of sealant use with alternative interventions, such as manual compression or reversal of anticoagulation, and to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 24 studies that involved 2376 participants who underwent vascular surgery. The studies compared sealant use with standard care controls, including oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, and manual compression. All trials were at high risk of performance bias, detection bias, and other sources of bias. The population characteristics, study settings, and funding sources were not explicitly reported in the abstract. The types of interventions and comparisons were sealant use versus standard care controls. No information was available on the duration of the studies. Sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop bleeding and the rate at which bleeding stops, but it is unclear if they have an effect on the amount of blood lost during surgery, the time it takes to complete the operation, or the risk of bleeding after surgery. For every 100 people who receive sealants, 10 to 20 more may have their bleeding stopped quickly compared to those who do not receive sealants."

  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that participants were aware of which treatment they were receiving (risk of performance bias). Not all studies reported data for all outcomes of interest, leading to incomplete information. The studies were conducted in heterogeneous populations and used different delivery methods for the intervention, reducing comparability. Sample sizes were very small, limiting statistical power. Moreover, the studies that did provide results for our review likely overestimate the benefits of the intervention because they represent only a small, possibly selective subset of the available research.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2023."
