  "key_messages": [
    "Community health workers may help prevent mental health problems and improve well-being in low- and middle-income countries, with some evidence suggesting they can slightly reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and distress, although the quality of this evidence is not strong (quality of evidence refers to how reliable and trustworthy the research findings are).",
    "No major harmful effects were reported in the studies, but the evidence did not provide clear answers to all questions, particularly regarding long-term effects and the best ways to deliver these interventions (interventions refer to actions or programs aimed at preventing or treating health issues).",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as exploring the long-term impacts of community health worker interventions, reducing the risk of bias in studies, and examining the cost-effectiveness of these programs to better understand their potential benefits and challenges (cost-effectiveness refers to the analysis of the costs and benefits of a health intervention to determine its value)."

      "subheading": "What is the problem of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries?",
      "content": "Mental disorders are a significant health problem worldwide, and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face unique challenges in addressing this issue. The scarcity of skilled human resources, large inequities in resource distribution and utilization, and stigma surrounding mental health all contribute to a significant research gap in the field of mental health promotion and prevention. As a result, many people in LMICs lack access to effective interventions for preventing mental disorders and promoting well-being."

      "subheading": "What are primary-level and community worker interventions for mental health?",
      "content": "Primary-level and community worker interventions involve trained primary care health workers or community workers delivering interventions to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders. These interventions can be universal, selective, or indicated, targeting different populations and aiming to prevent mental health issues or reduce symptoms. The goal of these interventions is to provide accessible and effective support for mental health in LMICs, where resources may be limited."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the effectiveness of primary-level and community worker interventions in promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders in LMICs. They wanted to examine the impact of these interventions on resource use and costs, as well as their effects on various mental health outcomes, such as anxiety, depression, and distress. By evaluating the available evidence, the authors sought to determine the potential benefits and limitations of these interventions in addressing the mental health needs of populations in LMICs."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 113 studies that involved 32,992 participants. The studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries, with 19 studies in low-income countries, 27 in low-middle-income countries, 2 in middle-income countries, 58 in upper-middle-income countries, and 7 in mixed settings. Most studies included adults, with 83 studies focusing on this population, while 30 studies focused on children. The interventions were delivered by primary-level workers, including primary care health workers, community workers, or both. The studies examined universal prevention, selective prevention, and indicated prevention interventions. The duration of the studies was not explicitly stated, but the outcomes were analyzed at 0 to 1, 1 to 6, and 7 to 24 months post-intervention. The funding sources for the studies were not specified. The evidence suggests that interventions delivered by primary workers may improve mental health outcomes, probably reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults, and may improve quality of life in children. However, the certainty of the evidence is influenced by the risk of bias and substantial levels of heterogeneity."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because many studies may not have been blinded, leading to potential bias; several studies did not report all outcomes of interest; the populations, interventions, and delivery methods varied across studies, reducing comparability; and the sample sizes were generally small, limiting statistical power.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to November 2021."
