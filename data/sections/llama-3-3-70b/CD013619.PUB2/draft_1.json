  "draft": "# Does having family members present during resuscitation (when medical staff are trying to save a patient's life) help reduce stress and anxiety in the family members?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Having family members present during resuscitation (when medical staff are trying to save a patient's life) may help reduce stress and anxiety in the family members, but the current evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the benefits and potential harms, including the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (a condition that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event) and other psychological outcomes.\n- The available studies had significant limitations, and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of family presence during resuscitation on relatives' psychological outcomes, as well as on patient care and healthcare professionals' experiences.\n- Future studies should investigate the impact of family presence during resuscitation with more robust methods and larger participant groups to provide clearer answers about its benefits and potential harms, and to guide healthcare practices and policies in this area.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is family presence during resuscitation?\nFamily presence during resuscitation (FPDR) refers to the practice of allowing relatives to be present during the resuscitation of a patient, typically in emergency departments or pre-hospital settings. This practice involves a triangular relationship between the healthcare professionals, the relatives, and the patient, where the presence of relatives can impact all three groups. FPDR is based on the principle that patients and their relatives often want to be actively involved in treatment decisions, even during critical care situations like resuscitation.\n### Why is family presence during resuscitation important?\nFPDR is important because it addresses the emotional and psychological needs of both the patients and their relatives during a critical and potentially traumatic event. The presence of relatives can provide emotional support to the patient and help relatives cope with the situation, potentially reducing stress and anxiety. However, it also raises concerns about the impact on healthcare professionals, patient care, and the relatives' own psychological well-being.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to investigate how offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation affects the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms in the relatives. They also wanted to explore the impact of FPDR on other psychological outcomes in relatives, patient morbidity and mortality, medical treatment and care during resuscitation, and the personal stress experienced by healthcare professionals. Additionally, they sought to understand healthcare professionals' attitudes towards the FPDR initiative.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on family presence during resuscitation, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to understand its effects on relatives' psychological outcomes and patient care.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 595 people who were relatives of patients undergoing resuscitation. The studies were conducted in France and the UK. Most participants were between 19 and 78 years old, and between 56% and 64% were women. The studies lasted for different durations, with one study having a 1-year assessment. There is no information available on the funding sources of the studies. The interventions compared were the systematic offer for a relative to witness cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with the traditional practice, and family presence during resuscitation (FPDR) in an emergency department. No information is available on the severity of the patients' conditions. It is unclear if family presence during resuscitation has an effect on relatives' psychological outcomes. Family presence during resuscitation may reduce the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder-related symptoms in relatives, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, may have been unblinded (participants knew their treatment), and did not report all outcomes of interest.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

Firstly, the sentence 'Family presence during resuscitation (FPDR) refers to the practice of allowing relatives to be present during the resuscitation of a patient, typically in emergency departments or pre-hospital settings.' is too long and contains technical terms without definitions. A suggested rewrite could be 'What is family presence during resuscitation? It means allowing relatives to be with the patient during emergency care.' Secondly, the use of passive voice in sentences like 'The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, may have been unblinded (participants knew their treatment), and did not report all outcomes of interest.' can be improved by using active voice, for example, 'We found that the evidence is limited because the studies were small and had methodological flaws.' Lastly, the draft text exceeds the recommended word count and contains complex words and sentences that may confuse readers. According to the PLS evaluation results, the draft text has a high number of passive voice constructions, complex words, and long sentences, which contribute to its low readability score. To improve the draft, it is essential to address these issues and provide a clear, concise, and readable text that follows the Master Style Guide.",
