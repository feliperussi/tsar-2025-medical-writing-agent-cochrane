  "draft": "Can therapy using psychedelic drugs help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair) in people with life-threatening diseases - but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy, including its effects on quality of life and spirituality (a person's sense of connection to something larger than themselves), and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the difficulty in keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment is being used.\n- Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should aim to reduce bias and increase the precision of their findings to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making.\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy and how can it help people with life-threatening diseases?\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy is a treatment that uses certain drugs, like psilocybin or LSD, along with support from healthcare professionals to help patients. This approach has been explored as a potential way to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people facing life-threatening diseases, such as cancer. Existential distress refers to feelings of hopelessness, meaninglessness, and despair that can occur when people are confronted with their own mortality.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about psychedelic-assisted therapy?\nWe aimed to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other active treatments for reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We wanted to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in improving mental health outcomes, and whether it is safe and well-tolerated.\n\nHow did the authors search for studies and select them for the review?\nWe performed systematic searches of databases for studies investigating psychedelic-assisted therapy targeting anxiety, depression, and existential distress in individuals with life-threatening illnesses. We included studies that involved participants with a life-threatening disease, reported outcomes on anxiety, depression, or existential distress, and used a psychedelic-assisted therapeutic intervention.\n\nWhat did the authors find?\nWe found 6 studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, with 140 participants analyzed. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about these results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the evidence is limited due to small study sizes and potential participant bias. The studies were very small, and participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.\n\nWe hope this summary has been helpful.

For example, the sentence 'Psychedelic-assisted therapy is a type of treatment that combines psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin or LSD, with therapeutic support from healthcare professionals' could be simplified to 'Psychedelic-assisted therapy combines psychedelic drugs like psilocybin or LSD with therapy from healthcare professionals.' Additionally, the text uses excessive passive voice, with 22 instances, which can make it harder to understand who is performing the actions. The metrics also show significant deviation from typical PLS patterns, including high rates of complex words, long words, and noun-heavy sentences.",

The text has a flesch reading ease score of 35.68, which is in the 25th percentile, indicating that the text is relatively easy to read. However, the high rates of complex words and long words, with 137 and 210 instances respectively, contribute to the clarity issues noted above."
