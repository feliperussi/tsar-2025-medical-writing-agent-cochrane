  "key_messages": [
    "Psychedelic-assisted therapy (a treatment that uses psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin or LSD, under the supervision of a therapist) may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair) in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.",
    "More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy, including its effects on quality of life and spirituality (a person's sense of connection to something larger than themselves), and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the difficulty in keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment is being used.",
    "Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should aim to reduce bias and increase the precision of their findings to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making."

      "subheading": "What is psychedelic-assisted therapy and how can it help people with life-threatening diseases?",
      "content": "Psychedelic-assisted therapy is a type of treatment that combines psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin or LSD, with therapeutic support from healthcare professionals. This approach has been explored as a potential way to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people facing life-threatening diseases, such as cancer. Existential distress refers to feelings of hopelessness, meaninglessness, and despair that can occur when people are confronted with their own mortality. Common treatments for anxiety and depression in people with life-threatening diseases often include medications like antidepressants, as well as psychological therapies like counseling or cognitive-behavioral therapy. However, these treatments may not always be effective, and some people may experience significant side effects."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out about psychedelic-assisted therapy?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other active treatments for reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. They wanted to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in improving mental health outcomes, and whether it is safe and well-tolerated. The authors also sought to explore the potential benefits and risks of using different types of psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin or LSD, and to identify areas for further research."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, with 140 participants analyzed. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. The studies were funded by organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy, with no involvement from drug companies. The interventions included psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy'), compared to active placebo or low-dose psychedelic. Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about these results. The treatment seems to be well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported."
