  "draft": "Can therapy using psychedelic drugs help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases?\n\nKey messages:\n- Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy.\n- Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers.\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy and how can it help people with life-threatening diseases?\nWe use psychedelic-assisted therapy to combine psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin or LSD, with therapeutic support from healthcare professionals. This approach helps reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people facing life-threatening diseases, such as cancer. Existential distress refers to feelings of hopelessness, meaninglessness, and despair that occur when people are confronted with their own mortality.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about psychedelic-assisted therapy?\nWe aimed to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other active treatments for reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We wanted to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in improving mental health outcomes and whether it is safe and well-tolerated.\n\nHow did the authors search for studies and select them for the review?\nWe performed systematic searches of databases for studies investigating psychedelic-assisted therapy targeting anxiety, depression, and existential distress in individuals with life-threatening illnesses. We included studies that involved participants with a life-threatening disease, reported outcomes on anxiety, depression, or existential distress, and used a psychedelic-assisted therapeutic intervention.\n\nWhat did the authors find?\nWe found 6 studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, with 140 participants analyzed. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about these results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.\n\nWe hope this summary has been helpful.

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft text has several clarity issues, including unexplained jargon, long sentences, and missing context. For example, the sentence 'Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases' is unclear because it does not define what 'existential distress' means. A suggested rewrite could be 'Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and feelings of hopelessness and despair in people with life-threatening diseases.' Another issue is the use of passive voice, with 19 instances found in the metrics. A rewrite of the sentence 'The evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of which treatment they received' to 'We found that the evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of which treatment they received' can improve clarity. The metrics also show a high number of complex words and long words, which can make the text harder to read. Simplifying these words and using more active voice can improve the overall readability of the draft.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show that the draft text has good conformity with typical PLS patterns in some areas, such as word count and sentence length, but deviates significantly in others, including passive voice, complex words, and long words. The results indicate that the text is written at a level that may be difficult for some readers to understand, with a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 12.5 and a Gunning-Fog index of 17.62. To improve the text, it is suggested to reduce the use of passive voice, simplify complex words, and use more active voice."
