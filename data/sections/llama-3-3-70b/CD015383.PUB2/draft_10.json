  "draft": "Can therapy using psychedelic drugs help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life-threatening diseases?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair) in people with life-threatening diseases - but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy, including its effects on quality of life and spirituality (a person's sense of connection to something larger than themselves), and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the difficulty in keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment is being used.\n- Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should aim to reduce bias and increase the precision of their findings to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making.\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy and how can it help people with life-threatening diseases?\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy combines psychedelic drugs like psilocybin or LSD with therapy from healthcare professionals. This approach has been explored as a potential way to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people facing life-threatening diseases, such as cancer. Existential distress refers to feelings of hopelessness, meaninglessness, and despair that can occur when people are confronted with their own mortality.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about psychedelic-assisted therapy?\nWe aimed to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other active treatments for reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We wanted to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in improving mental health outcomes, and whether it is safe and well-tolerated.\n\nHow did the authors search for studies and select them for the review?\nWe performed systematic searches of databases for studies investigating psychedelic-assisted therapy targeting anxiety, depression, and existential distress in individuals with life-threatening illnesses. We included studies that involved participants with a life-threatening disease, reported outcomes on anxiety, depression, or existential distress, and used a psychedelic-assisted therapeutic intervention.\n\nWhat did the authors find?\nWe found 6 studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, with 140 participants analyzed. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about these results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the evidence is limited due to small study sizes and potential participant bias. The studies were very small, and participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.\n\nWe hope this summary has been helpful.

For example, the sentence 'Psychedelic-assisted therapy combines psychedelic drugs like psilocybin or LSD with therapy from healthcare professionals' could be rephrased as 'What is psychedelic-assisted therapy?' with a clear definition provided. Additionally, the text exceeds the recommended 850-word limit and has high rates of passive voice, noun-heavy sentences, and complex words. Metrics show 22 instances of passive voice, 160 nouns, and 140 complex words, which contribute to the clarity issues. To improve, the writer should reduce passive voice, use simpler language, and break up long sentences.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 33.3% of features in the best quartile and 38.9% in the P90 range. However, 9 features deviate from typical patterns, including passive voice, nouns, and complex words. The text has a Flesch reading ease score of 34.92, indicating that it may be difficult for some readers to understand. To improve readability, the writer should aim to reduce the number of complex words, increase the use of active voice, and break up long sentences."
