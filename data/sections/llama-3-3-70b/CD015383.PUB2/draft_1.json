  "draft": "# Can therapy using psychedelic drugs (such as a treatment) help reduce anxiety, depression, and distress in people with life‑threatening diseases?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Psychedelic-assisted therapy (a treatment that uses psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin or LSD, under the supervision of a therapist) may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress (feelings of hopelessness and despair) in people with life-threatening diseases, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy, including its effects on quality of life and spirituality (a person's sense of connection to something larger than themselves), and to address the limitations of current studies, such as the small number of participants and the difficulty in keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment is being used.\n- Future studies should prioritize measuring outcomes that are important to patients and healthcare providers, such as long-term effects and potential unwanted effects, and should aim to reduce bias and increase the precision of their findings to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is psychedelic-assisted therapy and how can it help people with life-threatening diseases?\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy is a type of treatment that combines psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin or LSD, with therapeutic support from healthcare professionals. This approach has been explored as a potential way to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people facing life-threatening diseases, such as cancer. Existential distress refers to feelings of hopelessness, meaninglessness, and despair that can occur when people are confronted with their own mortality. Common treatments for anxiety and depression in people with life-threatening diseases often include medications like antidepressants, as well as psychological therapies like counseling or cognitive-behavioral therapy. However, these treatments may not always be effective, and some people may experience significant side effects.\n\n### What did the review authors want to find out about psychedelic-assisted therapy?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo or other active treatments for reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. They wanted to determine whether psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective in improving mental health outcomes, and whether it is safe and well-tolerated. The authors also sought to explore the potential benefits and risks of using different types of psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin or LSD, and to identify areas for further research.\n\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed systematic searches of databases for studies investigating psychedelic‑assisted therapy targeting anxiety, depression, and existential distress in individuals with life‑threatening illnesses.\n\n### Eligibility Criteria\nIncluded studies had to involve participants with a life‑threatening disease, report outcomes on anxiety, depression, or existential distress, and use a psychedelic‑assisted therapeutic intervention.\n\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study design, sample size, intervention details, outcomes, and results. Findings were summarized qualitatively.\n\n### Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment\nEach study was appraised using appropriate tools (e.g., Cochrane RoB 2 for RCTs) to evaluate methodological quality and potential bias.\n\n### Confidence in the Evidence\nThe overall confidence in the body of evidence was assessed using the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 149 people with life-threatening diseases, with 140 participants analyzed. The age range of participants was 36 to 64 years. The studies lasted between 6 and 12 months and were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. The studies were funded by organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy, with no involvement from drug companies. The interventions included psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy'), compared to active placebo or low-dose psychedelic. Psychedelic-assisted therapy may help reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about these results. The treatment seems to be well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed before it can be approved. Firstly, the text exceeds the recommended word count of 850 words. Additionally, there are multiple instances of passive voice, complex sentences, and technical jargon without proper explanations. The text also lacks clarity and readability, with some sentences being too long and convoluted. Furthermore, the use of active voice is not consistent throughout the text, and there are instances of noun-heavy sentences that could be improved with more verbs. The metrics provided in the PLS_EVALUATION_RESULTS support these observations, showing high rates of passive voice, complex words, and long sentences. To improve the text, it is suggested that the author reduce the word count, use more active voice, and break up complex sentences into simpler ones. The author should also define technical terms and use more concise language to improve readability. Overall, while the draft text shows promise, it requires significant revisions to meet the standards of a Plain Language Summary.",
