  "draft": "# Is dexmedetomidine (a medicine that helps with pain and sedation) safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation (a machine that helps them breathe)?\n**Key Messages**\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if dexmedetomidine (a medicine that helps with pain and sedation) is safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation (a machine that helps them breathe), due to a lack of eligible studies.\n- Although dexmedetomidine is increasingly being used in children and infants, there is currently no information available on its long-term effects, and data on its safety are scarce.\n- Future studies should investigate the efficacy, safety, and long-term effects of dexmedetomidine as a single drug therapy for sedation and analgesia (pain relief) in newborn infants, to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is the problem of sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation?\nNewborn infants who require mechanical ventilation often need sedation and analgesia to reduce their discomfort and stress. Currently, morphine or stronger opioids are commonly used for this purpose, but they can have significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 agonist that has been increasingly used in children and infants due to its minimal impact on the haemodynamic profile, making it a potentially safer alternative.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the overall effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation compared to other non-opioids, opioids, or placebo. They wanted to assess the level of sedation and analgesia, as well as secondary outcomes such as the number of days on mechanical ventilation, the need for additional medication, and potential side effects like hypotension and neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n**Methods**\nSearch Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomized and quasi‑randomized trials that compared dexmedetomidine with other sedatives or placebo in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation.\nEligibility Criteria\nIncluded studies enrolled neonates (≤28 days old) on invasive ventilation, compared dexmedetomidine to any other sedative agent or to placebo, and reported at least one clinical outcome such as duration of ventilation, sedation scores, or adverse events.\nData Extraction and Synthesis\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study design, participants, interventions, outcomes, and results. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Results were summarized qualitatively and, when appropriate, pooled using a random‑effects meta‑analysis.\nRisk of Bias and Confidence in Evidence\nRisk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. The overall confidence in the body of evidence for each outcome was graded using the GRADE framework, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible studies for inclusion. However, we identified four ongoing studies, two of which appear to be eligible for inclusion, comparing dexmedetomidine with fentanyl in newborn infants requiring surgery, and the other two studies are awaiting classification. The planned sample size of these studies ranges from 40 to 200 neonates. The studies will provide information on the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. There is not enough evidence to support the routine use of dexmedetomidine for analgesia and sedation in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, there is a lack of data on the safety of dexmedetomidine, and no information is available on its long-term effects.\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people/intervention/comparators/outcomes we were interested in.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

For example, the sentence 'Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 agonist that has been increasingly used in children and infants due to its minimal impact on the haemodynamic profile, making it a potentially safer alternative' is unclear for non-expert readers. A suggested rewrite could be 'Dexmedetomidine is a type of medicine that helps with pain and sedation. It's been used more often in children and infants because it doesn't affect heart rate and blood pressure as much as other medicines, which might make it a safer choice.' Additionally, the metrics show high rates of nominalization, complex words, and long words, which contribute to the clarity issues. The flesch_reading_ease score is also low, indicating that the text is difficult to read. To improve, the author should simplify technical terms, break up long sentences, and reduce the use of complex vocabulary.",
