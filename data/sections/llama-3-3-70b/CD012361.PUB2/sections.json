  "key_messages": [
    "We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if dexmedetomidine (a medicine that helps with pain and sedation) is safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation (a machine that helps them breathe), due to a lack of eligible studies.",
    "Although dexmedetomidine is increasingly being used in children and infants, there is currently no information available on its long-term effects, and data on its safety are scarce.",
    "Future studies should investigate the efficacy, safety, and long-term effects of dexmedetomidine as a single drug therapy for sedation and analgesia (pain relief) in newborn infants, to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making."

      "subheading": "What is the problem of sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation?",
      "content": "Newborn infants who require mechanical ventilation often need sedation and analgesia to reduce their discomfort and stress. Currently, morphine or stronger opioids are commonly used for this purpose, but they can have significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 agonist that has been increasingly used in children and infants due to its minimal impact on the haemodynamic profile, making it a potentially safer alternative."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out about dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to determine the overall effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation compared to other non-opioids, opioids, or placebo. They wanted to assess the level of sedation and analgesia, as well as secondary outcomes such as the number of days on mechanical ventilation, the need for additional medication, and potential side effects like hypotension and neurodevelopmental outcomes."

      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomized and quasi‑randomized trials that compared dexmedetomidine with other sedatives or placebo in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation."

      "subheading": "Eligibility Criteria",
      "content": "Included studies enrolled neonates (≤28 days old) on invasive ventilation, compared dexmedetomidine to any other sedative agent or to placebo, and reported at least one clinical outcome such as duration of ventilation, sedation scores, or adverse events."

    {
      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently extracted data on study design, participants, interventions, outcomes, and results. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Results were summarized qualitatively and, when appropriate, pooled using a random‑effects meta‑analysis."

      "subheading": "Risk of Bias and Confidence in Evidence",
      "content": "Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. The overall confidence in the body of evidence for each outcome was graded using the GRADE framework, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found no eligible studies for inclusion. However, we identified four ongoing studies, two of which appear to be eligible for inclusion, comparing dexmedetomidine with fentanyl in newborn infants requiring surgery, and the other two studies are awaiting classification. The planned sample size of these studies ranges from 40 to 200 neonates. The studies will provide information on the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. There is not enough evidence to support the routine use of dexmedetomidine for analgesia and sedation in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, there is a lack of data on the safety of dexmedetomidine, and no information is available on its long-term effects."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people/intervention/comparators/outcomes we were interested in.",
