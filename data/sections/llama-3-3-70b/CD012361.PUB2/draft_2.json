  "draft": "Is dexmedetomidine (a medicine that helps with pain and sedation) safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation (a machine that helps them breathe)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if dexmedetomidine is safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation, due to a lack of eligible studies.\n- Although dexmedetomidine is increasingly being used in children and infants, there is currently no information available on its long-term effects, and data on its safety are scarce.\n- Future studies should investigate the efficacy, safety, and long-term effects of dexmedetomidine as a single drug therapy for sedation and analgesia (pain relief) in newborn infants, to provide more reliable evidence for decision-making.\n\nWhat is the problem of sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation?\nNewborn infants who require mechanical ventilation often need sedation and analgesia to reduce their discomfort and stress. Currently, morphine or stronger opioids are commonly used for this purpose, but they can have significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine is a type of medicine that helps with pain and sedation. It's been used more often in children and infants because it doesn't affect heart rate and blood pressure as much as other medicines, which might make it a safer choice.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the overall effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation compared to other non-opioids, opioids, or placebo. They wanted to assess the level of sedation and analgesia, as well as secondary outcomes such as the number of days on mechanical ventilation, the need for additional medication, and potential side effects like hypotension (low blood pressure) and neurodevelopmental outcomes (how the baby's brain and nervous system develop).\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomized and quasi-randomized trials that compared dexmedetomidine with other sedatives or placebo in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation.\n\nWhat were the inclusion criteria for the studies?\nIncluded studies enrolled neonates (babies 28 days old or less) on invasive ventilation, compared dexmedetomidine to any other sedative agent or to placebo, and reported at least one clinical outcome such as duration of ventilation, sedation scores, or adverse events.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found no eligible studies for inclusion. However, we identified four ongoing studies, two of which appear to be eligible for inclusion, comparing dexmedetomidine with fentanyl (another type of pain and sedation medicine) in newborn infants requiring surgery, and the other two studies are awaiting classification. The planned sample size of these studies ranges from 40 to 200 neonates. The studies will provide information on the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. There is not enough evidence to support the routine use of dexmedetomidine for analgesia and sedation in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, there is a lack of data on the safety of dexmedetomidine, and no information is available on its long-term effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people/intervention/comparators/outcomes we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

Additionally, the draft should be revised to reduce complex words, long words, and smog index to improve readability. The use of active voice, pronouns, and concise language should also be encouraged.
