  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether surgery to remove nasal polyps (abnormal growths in the nose) is helpful for people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs and other organs), in terms of improving nasal symptoms or reducing complications such as bacterial colonization and pulmonary exacerbations (worsening of lung symptoms).",
    "The current evidence does not provide enough information to determine the benefits and harms of this surgical intervention, and no significant harmful effects were reported, but the available study was small and had limited information.",
    "Future research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed studies that follow participants for at least 12 months to evaluate the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyposis and pulmonary function, as well as its impact on mortality and the potential effects of new treatments for cystic fibrosis."

      "subheading": "What is cystic fibrosis and how does it affect the sinuses?",
      "content": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening, genetic disease that affects the secretions in the body, leading to abnormal electrolyte concentrations. This results in secretion stasis in the paranasal sinuses, causing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and nasal polyposis. Nasal polyposis is a condition where growths called polyps develop in the nasal passages, making it difficult to breathe and increasing the risk of infections."

      "subheading": "What are the common treatments for nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis?",
      "content": "Common treatments for nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis include medical treatments such as nasal irrigation and the use of antibiotics to manage infections. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the polyps and open up the sinuses, allowing for better drainage and reducing the risk of further complications."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to determine the effects of sinus surgery alone or in combination with medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone on both nasal and pulmonary function in people with cystic fibrosis diagnosed with CRS with nasal polyposis. They also aimed to evaluate the impact of sinus surgery on hospitalization rates, use of antibiotics, and pulmonary exacerbation rates."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found one study that involved 28 people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. The study lasted for an unspecified duration and was conducted in an unknown setting. The study compared nasal irrigation alone to nasal irrigation with surgery, specifically endoscopic polypectomy with extended sinusotomy. The participants were aged 19 to 28 years, but no information was available on the gender distribution or severity of condition. There was no information on the funding sources of the study. We did not find any other studies that met our inclusion criteria, highlighting a significant gap in the evidence base for this intervention. It is unclear if endoscopic sinus surgery to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis is effective. We do not know if the addition of surgical intervention improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial colonization, the use of antibiotics, and pulmonary exacerbations, or leads to changes in pulmonary function."
