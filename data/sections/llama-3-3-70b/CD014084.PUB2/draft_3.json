  "draft": "Is surgery to remove nasal polyps helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\n\nWe do not know if surgery to remove nasal polyps helps people with cystic fibrosis because there is not enough strong evidence. This is important for understanding if the surgery can improve symptoms like difficulty breathing or reduce complications like infections. We found one small study, but it did not provide enough information to determine the benefits and harms of this surgical intervention. No significant harmful effects were reported, but we need more research to be sure.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and how does it affect the sinuses?\nCystic fibrosis (a genetic disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs and other organs) disrupts the body's secretions, causing an imbalance in electrolyte levels. This results in secretion stasis in the paranasal sinuses, causing chronic rhinosinusitis (a condition where the sinuses are inflamed for a long time) and nasal polyposis (a condition where growths called polyps develop in the nasal passages). Nasal polyposis makes it difficult to breathe and increases the risk of infections.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis?\nCommon treatments for nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis include medical treatments such as nasal irrigation (rinsing the nasal passages with a saline solution) and the use of antibiotics (medicines that kill bacteria) to manage infections. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the polyps and open up the sinuses, allowing for better drainage and reducing the risk of further complications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe compared the effects of surgery alone, surgery with medical treatment, and medical treatment alone on how well the nose and lungs work in people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. We also wanted to know if surgery affects hospitalization rates, use of antibiotics, and pulmonary exacerbation rates.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases for studies that directly compared sinus surgery with medical treatment alone in individuals with cystic fibrosis. We looked for studies that reported nasal or pulmonary function outcomes after sinus surgery versus medical management. Only peer-reviewed comparative trials were included.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found one study that involved 28 people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. The study compared nasal irrigation alone to nasal irrigation with surgery, specifically endoscopic polypectomy (a procedure to remove polyps using a special tool) with extended sinusotomy (a procedure to open up the sinuses). The participants were aged 19 to 28 years. We did not find any other studies that met our inclusion criteria, highlighting a significant gap in the evidence base for this intervention.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the evidence is limited because the study sizes were very small and there were not enough studies, which makes the results uncertain.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2022.\n\nFuture research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed studies that follow participants for at least 12 months to evaluate the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyposis and pulmonary function, as well as its impact on mortality and the potential effects of new treatments for cystic fibrosis.",
