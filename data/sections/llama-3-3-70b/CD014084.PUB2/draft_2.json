  "draft": "Is surgery to remove nasal polyps helpful for people with cystic fibrosis?\n\nWe looked at whether surgery to remove nasal polyps (abnormal growths in the nose) is helpful for people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs and other organs). \n\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether surgery to remove nasal polyps is helpful for people with cystic fibrosis, in terms of improving nasal symptoms or reducing complications such as bacterial colonization and pulmonary exacerbations (worsening of lung symptoms).\n- The current evidence does not provide enough information to determine the benefits and harms of this surgical intervention, and no significant harmful effects were reported, but the available study was small and had limited information.\n- Future research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed studies that follow participants for at least 12 months to evaluate the long-term effects of surgery on nasal polyposis and pulmonary function, as well as its impact on mortality and the potential effects of new treatments for cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and how does it affect the sinuses?\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that disrupts the body's secretions, causing an imbalance in electrolyte levels. This results in secretion stasis in the paranasal sinuses, causing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) (a condition where the sinuses are inflamed for a long time) and nasal polyposis (a condition where growths called polyps develop in the nasal passages). Nasal polyposis makes it difficult to breathe and increases the risk of infections.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis?\nCommon treatments for nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis include medical treatments such as nasal irrigation (rinsing the nasal passages with a saline solution) and the use of antibiotics (medicines that kill bacteria) to manage infections. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the polyps and open up the sinuses, allowing for better drainage and reducing the risk of further complications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effects of sinus surgery alone or in combination with medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone on both nasal and pulmonary function in people with cystic fibrosis diagnosed with CRS with nasal polyposis. They also aimed to evaluate the impact of sinus surgery on hospitalization rates, use of antibiotics, and pulmonary exacerbation rates.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases for studies that directly compared sinus surgery with medical treatment alone in individuals with cystic fibrosis. We looked for studies that reported nasal or pulmonary function outcomes after sinus surgery versus medical management. Only peer-reviewed comparative trials were included.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found one study that involved 28 people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. The study compared nasal irrigation alone to nasal irrigation with surgery, specifically endoscopic polypectomy (a procedure to remove polyps using a special tool) with extended sinusotomy (a procedure to open up the sinuses). The participants were aged 19 to 28 years, but no information was available on the gender distribution or severity of condition. We did not find any other studies that met our inclusion criteria, highlighting a significant gap in the evidence base for this intervention. It is unclear if endoscopic sinus surgery to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis in cystic fibrosis is effective.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes and an insufficient number of studies, making the results uncertain.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2022.",

Firstly, the sentence 'Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether surgery to remove nasal polyps (abnormal growths in the nose) is helpful for people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs and other organs), in terms of improving nasal symptoms or reducing complications such as bacterial colonization and pulmonary exacerbations (worsening of lung symptoms).' is too long and contains technical terms without clear explanations. A suggested rewrite could be: 'We do not know if surgery to remove nasal polyps helps people with cystic fibrosis because there is not enough strong evidence. This is important for understanding if the surgery can improve symptoms like difficulty breathing or reduce complications like infections.' Secondly, the use of passive voice in several instances, such as 'The evidence is limited by very small study sizes and an insufficient number of studies, making the results uncertain,' should be converted to active voice for better clarity, e.g., 'We found that the evidence is limited because the study sizes were very small and there were not enough studies, which makes the results uncertain.' Lastly, the metrics show a high rate of nominalization and complex words, which can make the text harder to understand. For example, 'The review authors wanted to determine the effects of sinus surgery alone or in combination with medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone on both nasal and pulmonary function in people with cystic fibrosis diagnosed with CRS with nasal polyposis.' could be simplified to: 'We compared the effects of surgery alone, surgery with medical treatment, and medical treatment alone on how well the nose and lungs work in people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps.' The PLS evaluation results support these observations, indicating deviations from typical patterns in readability indices and sentence structure.",
