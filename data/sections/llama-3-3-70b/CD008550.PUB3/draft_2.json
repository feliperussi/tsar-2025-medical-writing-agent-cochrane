  "draft": "How medicines for acid reflux affect children: benefits, side effects, and what to watch for\n\nKey Messages\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the benefits and harms of medicines for acid reflux in children.\n- Medicines like proton pump inhibitors (proton pump inhibitors are a type of medicine that reduces the amount of acid made by the stomach) may or may not improve symptoms of acid reflux in older children.\n- Future research should focus on studying the effects of these medicines in different groups of children.\n\nWhat is gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux is when stomach contents flow back up into the food pipe, causing symptoms like regurgitation. It affects about 50% of infants under three months old and can also occur in older children. While it often improves with age, some children may experience more persistent symptoms, especially if they have other medical conditions.\n\nWhy is gastro-oesophageal reflux a problem?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux can be a self-limiting condition, but for some children, it can lead to more severe symptoms and complications. The distinction between gastro-oesophageal reflux and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is important, as GORD is defined by symptoms severe enough to require treatment.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in infants and children. They wanted to determine which treatments are most effective in reducing symptoms and improving outcomes for children with gastro-oesophageal reflux.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing pharmacological treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWe found 36 studies that involved 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings. The population characteristics included infants and children up to 16 years old. The types of interventions and comparisons included pharmacological treatments like omeprazole, esomeprazole, and proton pump inhibitors, often compared to placebo or other medications.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, conducted in heterogeneous populations with varying delivery methods, and did not cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

For example, the sentence 'Gastro-oesophageal reflux is when stomach contents flow back up into the food pipe, causing symptoms like regurgitation' could be simplified to 'What is gastro-oesophageal reflux?' with a clear definition. Additionally, the sentence 'We found 36 studies that involved 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux' is a bit long and could be broken up for easier reading. The metrics show a high number of nouns (128.00) and complex words (169.00), which contributes to the clarity issues. To improve, the writer could use more active voice, break up long sentences, and define technical terms.",

The draft text has a high number of nouns and complex words, which can make it harder to read.

To improve, the writer could aim to simplify the language and use more active voice."
