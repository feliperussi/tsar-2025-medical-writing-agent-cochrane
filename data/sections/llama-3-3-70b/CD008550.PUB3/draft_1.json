  "draft": "# How medicines for acid reflux affect children: benefits, side effects, and what to watch for\n**Key Messages**\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the benefits and harms of medicines for acid reflux in children, including their effects on symptoms and potential unwanted effects (unwanted effects are problems that can occur when taking a medicine, such as headaches or stomachaches).\n- Medicines like proton pump inhibitors (proton pump inhibitors are a type of medicine that reduces the amount of acid made by the stomach) may or may not improve symptoms of acid reflux in older children, but we need more research to be sure.\n- Future research should focus on studying the effects of these medicines in different groups of children, such as infants and children with other health conditions, and should investigate their long-term effects to help doctors and parents make informed decisions about treatment.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is gastro‐oesophageal reflux in children?\nGastro‐oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a condition where the stomach contents flow back up into the oesophagus, causing symptoms such as regurgitation. It is a common problem in infants, affecting approximately 50% of those under three months old, and can also occur in older children. While GOR often improves with age, some children may experience more persistent symptoms, especially if they have other medical conditions.\nWhy is gastro‐oesophageal reflux a problem?\nGOR can be a self-limiting condition, but for some children, it can lead to more severe symptoms and complications. The distinction between GOR and gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is important, as GORD is defined by symptoms severe enough to require treatment. Current treatments for GOR include pharmacological interventions, but the effectiveness of these treatments is not well understood.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological treatments for GOR in infants and children. They wanted to determine which treatments are most effective in reducing symptoms and improving outcomes for children with GOR, and to identify any potential benefits or harms associated with these treatments.\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing pharmacological treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 36 studies that involved 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, although specific details about the locations and funding sources were not provided. The population characteristics included infants and children up to 16 years old, with some studies focusing on specific age groups such as infants up to 12 months old and children aged 12 months to 16 years old. The types of interventions and comparisons included pharmacological treatments like omeprazole, esomeprazole, and proton pump inhibitors, often compared to placebo or other medications. Unfortunately, there were insufficient summary data to assess other medications, and the duration of the studies was not consistently reported. The review found that medications may or may not provide a benefit for infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux, and there is no clear evidence to support the use of specific medications such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, or proton pump inhibitors. In older children, proton pump inhibitors may or may not improve symptoms, but there is very low certainty about the effects of these medications. Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, conducted in heterogeneous populations with varying delivery methods, and did not cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

For example, the sentence 'Gastro‐oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a condition where the stomach contents flow back up into the oesophagus, causing symptoms such as regurgitation' could be simplified to 'Gastro‐oesophageal reflux is when stomach contents flow back up into the food pipe, causing symptoms like regurgitation.' Additionally, the text uses excessive passive voice, with 13 instances, which can make it harder to understand who is performing the actions. The metrics also show that the text has a high number of nouns (196) and complex words (125), which can make it less readable. To improve, the writer could reduce the use of jargon, break up long sentences, and use more active voice constructions.",

The text is within the 850-word limit and has a good readability score, but could be improved with revisions to address the clarity issues and reduce the complexity of the language."
