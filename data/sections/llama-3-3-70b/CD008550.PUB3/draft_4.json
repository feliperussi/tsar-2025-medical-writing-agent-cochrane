  "draft": "How medicines for acid reflux affect children: benefits, side effects, and what to watch for\n\nKey messages:\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the benefits and harms of medicines for acid reflux in children.\n- Medicines like proton pump inhibitors (these are medicines that reduce the amount of acid made by the stomach) may or may not improve symptoms of acid reflux in older children.\n- Future research should focus on studying the effects of these medicines in different groups of children.\n\nWhat is gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux is when stomach contents flow back up into the food pipe, causing symptoms like regurgitation (this means food or liquid coming back up into the mouth). It affects about 50% of infants under three months old and can also occur in older children. While it often improves with age, some children may experience more persistent symptoms, especially if they have other medical conditions.\n\nWhy is gastro-oesophageal reflux a problem?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux often improves on its own, but in some cases, it can cause more serious problems. The distinction between gastro-oesophageal reflux and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is important, as GORD is defined by symptoms severe enough to require treatment.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of pharmacological treatments (these are treatments using medicines) for gastro-oesophageal reflux in infants and children. We aimed to determine which treatments are most effective in reducing symptoms and improving outcomes for children with gastro-oesophageal reflux.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing pharmacological treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWe found 36 studies that involved 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings. The population characteristics included infants and children up to 16 years old. The types of interventions and comparisons included pharmacological treatments like omeprazole, esomeprazole, and proton pump inhibitors, often compared to placebo (a dummy treatment) or other medications.\n\nLimitations\nWe found that the evidence is limited because the studies were small and diverse, and they did not include all the relevant information.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nWe hope this information helps you understand how medicines for acid reflux affect children. If you have any concerns, talk to your doctor or a healthcare professional.",
