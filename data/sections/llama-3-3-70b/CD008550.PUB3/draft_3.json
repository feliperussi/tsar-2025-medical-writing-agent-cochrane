  "draft": "How medicines for acid reflux affect children: benefits, side effects, and what to watch for\n\nKey Messages\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the benefits and harms of medicines for acid reflux in children.\n- Medicines like proton pump inhibitors (these are medicines that reduce the amount of acid made by the stomach) may or may not improve symptoms of acid reflux in older children.\n- Future research should focus on studying the effects of these medicines in different groups of children.\n\nWhat is gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux is when stomach contents flow back up into the food pipe, causing symptoms like regurgitation (this means food or liquid coming back up into the mouth). It affects about 50% of infants under three months old and can also occur in older children. While it often improves with age, some children may experience more persistent symptoms, especially if they have other medical conditions.\n\nWhy is gastro-oesophageal reflux a problem?\nGastro-oesophageal reflux can be a self-limiting condition (this means it can get better on its own), but for some children, it can lead to more severe symptoms and complications. The distinction between gastro-oesophageal reflux and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is important, as GORD is defined by symptoms severe enough to require treatment.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological treatments (these are treatments using medicines) for gastro-oesophageal reflux in infants and children. They wanted to determine which treatments are most effective in reducing symptoms and improving outcomes for children with gastro-oesophageal reflux.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing pharmacological treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWe found 36 studies that involved 2251 children and infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings. The population characteristics included infants and children up to 16 years old. The types of interventions and comparisons included pharmacological treatments like omeprazole, esomeprazole, and proton pump inhibitors, often compared to placebo (a dummy treatment) or other medications.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, conducted in heterogeneous populations (this means the groups of people studied were very different) with varying delivery methods, and did not cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.\n\nWe hope this information helps you understand how medicines for acid reflux affect children. If you have any concerns, talk to your doctor or a healthcare professional.",

For example, the sentence 'Gastro-oesophageal reflux can be a self-limiting condition, but for some children, it can lead to more severe symptoms and complications' is unclear because it does not define what 'self-limiting' means. A suggested rewrite could be 'Gastro-oesophageal reflux often improves on its own, but in some cases, it can cause more serious problems.' Another issue is the use of passive voice, such as in the sentence 'The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, conducted in heterogeneous populations with varying delivery methods, and did not cover all relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.' A suggested rewrite could be 'We found that the evidence is limited because the studies were small and diverse, and they did not include all the relevant information.' The PLS evaluation results show that the draft text has a high number of passive voice constructions and complex words, which contributes to the clarity issues. The results also show that the text has a good readability score, but there are areas for improvement in terms of sentence length and word choice.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft text has a mix of strengths and weaknesses. The text has a good readability score, with a Flesch Reading Ease score of 41.57, which is in the 50th percentile. However, the text also has a high number of passive voice constructions, with 8 instances, which is in the 25th percentile. The text also has a high number of complex words, with 194 instances, which is in the 75th percentile. The results suggest that the text could be improved by reducing the use of passive voice and complex words, and by varying sentence length and structure."
