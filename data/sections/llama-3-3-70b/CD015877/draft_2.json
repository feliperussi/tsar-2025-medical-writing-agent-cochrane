  "draft": "Can personalized nutrition plans help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their overall health compared to standard one-size-fits-all diets?\n\n- We do not know if personalized nutrition plans are beneficial for treating obesity in children and teenagers because there is not enough robust evidence.\n- The current evidence does not provide sufficient information to determine whether personalized nutrition plans are more effective than standard one-size-fits-all diets for improving weight or body mass index (BMI - a measure of body fat based on height and weight) in children and teenagers.\n- Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies that report participant outcome data, including outcomes related to mental, emotional, and functional well-being, to better inform practice and global guidelines.\n\nWhat is the problem of obesity in children and adolescents?\nObesity is a significant health problem in children and adolescents, affecting their physical and mental well-being. It can lead to various health issues, such as diabetes, heart disease, and low self-esteem. Common treatments for obesity include diet and exercise, but these may not be effective for everyone. Precision nutrition-based interventions, which take into account individual characteristics like genetics, dietary habits, and lifestyle, may offer a more tailored approach to managing obesity.\n\nWhat are precision nutrition-based interventions?\nPrecision nutrition-based interventions involve developing personalized diet recommendations based on an individual's unique characteristics, such as their genetic profile, dietary habits, and lifestyle. These interventions use advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze data and provide tailored advice. The goal is to help individuals make informed food choices that meet their specific needs and promote healthy weight management.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to examine the effectiveness of precision nutrition-based interventions in managing obesity in children and adolescents. We investigated whether these interventions can lead to significant weight loss, improvements in body mass index (BMI), and enhanced overall health and well-being. We also sought to identify the most effective components of precision nutrition-based interventions and explore their potential benefits and limitations.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies investigating precision nutrition-based interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents. We searched multiple databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and CINAHL, and did not apply any language restrictions. We last searched the databases on July 23, 2024.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 105 participants with overweight or obesity. The studies were conducted in Ukraine and Greece. Precision nutrition-based interventions may have little to no effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents, but the results are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not provide data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
