  "draft": "# Can personalized nutrition plans (tailored diets based on individual characteristics such as genetics, eating habits, and health status) help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their overall health compared to standard one-size-fits-all diets?\n**Key Messages**\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of personalized nutrition plans (diets tailored to individual characteristics such as genetics, eating habits, and health status) for treating obesity in children and teenagers are unclear.\n- The current evidence does not provide sufficient information to determine whether personalized nutrition plans are more effective than standard one-size-fits-all diets for improving weight or body mass index (BMI, a measure of body fat based on height and weight) in children and teenagers.\n- Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies that report participant outcome data, including outcomes related to mental, emotional, and functional well-being, to better inform practice and global guidelines.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of obesity in children and adolescents?\nObesity is a significant health problem in children and adolescents, affecting their physical and mental well-being. It can lead to various health issues, such as diabetes, heart disease, and low self-esteem. Common treatments for obesity include diet and exercise, but these may not be effective for everyone. Precision nutrition-based interventions, which take into account individual characteristics like genetics, dietary habits, and lifestyle, may offer a more tailored approach to managing obesity.\n### What are precision nutrition-based interventions?\nPrecision nutrition-based interventions involve developing personalized diet recommendations based on an individual's unique characteristics, such as their genetic profile, dietary habits, and lifestyle. These interventions use advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze data and provide tailored advice. The goal is to help individuals make informed food choices that meet their specific needs and promote healthy weight management.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to examine the effectiveness of precision nutrition-based interventions in managing obesity in children and adolescents. They wanted to investigate whether these interventions can lead to significant weight loss, improvements in body mass index (BMI), and enhanced overall health and well-being. The authors also sought to identify the most effective components of precision nutrition-based interventions and explore their potential benefits and limitations.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search for studies investigating precision nutrition-based interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents.\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nRelevant study characteristics and outcomes were extracted, and the results were summarized qualitatively.\n### Evidence Confidence Assessment\nThe confidence in the body of evidence was evaluated using appropriate criteria to inform future research priorities and global guideline development.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 105 participants with overweight or obesity. The studies were conducted in Ukraine and Greece. The content includes the age range of participants (0 to 19 years), funding sources (one study reported nonprofit funding, the other did not report funding), and details of the precision nutrition-based interventions (a computerised Decision Support Tool using participant data and decision‑tree algorithms to provide personalised diet recommendations compared with one‑size‑fits‑all or standard care). Precision nutrition‑based interventions may have little to no effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents, but the results are very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not provide data on all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
