  "draft": "Does controlling blood pressure help prevent or slow down diabetic retinopathy (a complication of diabetes that can cause blindness)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that controlling blood pressure may help prevent diabetic retinopathy, especially in people with high blood pressure (hypertension) and type 2 diabetes. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about slowing down the progression of the disease or its effects on vision.\n- The benefits of blood pressure control for preventing diabetic retinopathy seem to be greater for people with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. But more research is needed to understand how blood pressure control affects people with normal blood pressure and diabetes.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy and other related outcomes. They should also explore the potential benefits and harms of different blood pressure management strategies for people with diabetes.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nDiabetic retinopathy, a diabetes complication, can cause vision loss and blindness. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, causing them to bleed or leak fluid. This can lead to vision loss and even blindness if left untreated. Diabetic retinopathy is a significant problem because it can severely impact a person's quality of life, making everyday activities difficult or impossible.\n\nWhat are the current treatments for diabetic retinopathy and how can blood pressure control help?\nCurrent treatments for diabetic retinopathy include laser surgery, injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications, and vitreoretinal surgery. However, preventing or slowing the progression of diabetic retinopathy is crucial. Controlling blood pressure has been shown to be important in preventing the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy. By managing blood pressure, individuals with diabetes can reduce their risk of developing diabetic retinopathy and slow its progression if it has already occurred.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if controlling blood pressure helps prevent or slow diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes. We aimed to summarize the existing evidence on the effects of blood pressure control on the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy, as well as its impact on visual acuity, adverse events, quality of life, and costs. Specifically, we looked at the effects of more intense versus less intense blood pressure control, and the use of different classes of antihypertensive medications.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 29 studies that involved 27,185 people with diabetic retinopathy. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The lengths of follow-up ranged from less than one year to nine years. Eight trials were sponsored entirely and 10 trials partially by pharmaceutical companies, while nine studies received support from other sources. The studies included type 1 and type 2 diabetic participants, with or without hypertension, and compared more intense versus less intense blood pressure control, blood pressure control versus usual care or no intervention, or one class of antihypertensive medication versus another or placebo. Intervention to reduce blood pressure probably reduces the risk of diabetic retinopathy slightly. For every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. However, it is unclear if this intervention has an effect on the progression of diabetic retinopathy or other outcomes such as visual acuity, quality of life, and costs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and delivery methods, very small sample sizes, and incomplete coverage of the relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021.",
