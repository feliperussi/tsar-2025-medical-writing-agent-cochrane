  "draft": "# Does controlling blood pressure help prevent or slow down diabetic retinopathy (a complication of diabetes that can cause blindness)?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Controlling blood pressure (the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteries) may help prevent diabetic retinopathy (a complication of diabetes that can cause blindness), especially in people with high blood pressure (hypertension) and type 2 diabetes, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about slowing down the progression of the disease or its effects on vision.\n- The benefits of blood pressure control for preventing diabetic retinopathy seem to be greater for people with hypertension and type 2 diabetes, but more research is needed to understand how blood pressure control affects people with normal blood pressure and diabetes.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy and other related outcomes, and explore the potential benefits and harms of different blood pressure management strategies for people with diabetes.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nDiabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that can lead to visual impairment and blindness. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, causing them to bleed or leak fluid. This can lead to vision loss and even blindness if left untreated. Diabetic retinopathy is a significant problem because it can severely impact a person's quality of life, making everyday activities difficult or impossible.\n\n### What are the current treatments for diabetic retinopathy and how can blood pressure control help?\nCurrent treatments for diabetic retinopathy include laser surgery, injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications, and vitreoretinal surgery. However, preventing or slowing the progression of diabetic retinopathy is crucial. Controlling blood pressure has been shown to be important in preventing the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy. By managing blood pressure, individuals with diabetes can reduce their risk of developing diabetic retinopathy and slow its progression if it has already occurred.\n\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether controlling blood pressure can help prevent or slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes. They aimed to summarize the existing evidence on the effects of blood pressure control on the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy, as well as its impact on visual acuity, adverse events, quality of life, and costs. Specifically, they looked at the effects of more intense versus less intense blood pressure control, and the use of different classes of antihypertensive medications.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing blood pressure control methods, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to understand its effect on diabetic retinopathy.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 29 studies that involved 27,185 people with diabetic retinopathy. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The lengths of follow-up ranged from less than one year to nine years. Eight trials were sponsored entirely and 10 trials partially by pharmaceutical companies, while nine studies received support from other sources. The studies included type 1 and type 2 diabetic participants, with or without hypertension, and compared more intense versus less intense blood pressure control, blood pressure control versus usual care or no intervention, or one class of antihypertensive medication versus another or placebo. Intervention to reduce blood pressure probably reduces the risk of diabetic retinopathy slightly. For every 100 people with diabetes, intense blood pressure control may prevent 2 to 5 cases of diabetic retinopathy over five years. However, it is unclear if this intervention has an effect on the progression of diabetic retinopathy or other outcomes such as visual acuity, quality of life, and costs.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and delivery methods, very small sample sizes, and incomplete coverage of the relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021.",

      "feedback": "The provided draft text has several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity and readability for patients. Firstly, the sentence \"Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that can lead to visual impairment and blindness.\" is problematic because it uses technical terms without explanation. A suggested rewrite could be \"Diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes, can cause vision problems and blindness.\" Secondly, the use of passive voice in sentences like \"The studies were conducted in several countries around the world\" should be converted to active voice, such as \"Researchers conducted studies in several countries worldwide.\" Lastly, the draft exceeds the recommended number of nouns per sentence, which can make it hard to follow. For instance, the sentence \"The evidence is limited by heterogeneity of study populations and delivery methods, very small sample sizes, and incomplete coverage of the relevant people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest\" could be broken down for better readability. The PLS evaluation results support these suggestions, showing high numbers of complex words, long words, and nouns, which deviate from typical PLS patterns. Thus, the draft is NOT_APPROVED due to these clarity and style issues.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft has high numbers of complex words, long words, and nouns, which deviate from typical PLS patterns. The results show that the draft has 229 nouns, 159 complex words, and 257 long words, exceeding the recommended ranges. Additionally, the results indicate a high smog index and lix score, suggesting that the draft may be difficult for patients to understand. The use of passive voice and noun-heavy sentences also contributes to the clarity issues. Overall, the draft needs significant revisions to improve its clarity and readability."
