  "key_messages": [
    "Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula may have little or no effect on undernutrition (a condition where the body gets too few calories or nutrients), overweight (having more body fat than is healthy), or obesity (a condition where a person has too much body fat), although the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.",
    "The current evidence does not show a clear difference in the risk of adverse effects (unwanted or harmful effects), such as diarrhea (frequent and loose bowel movements), vomiting, or milk hypersensitivity (an adverse reaction to milk), between infants fed high-protein formula and those fed standard-protein formula.",
    "Future research should investigate the long-term effects of different protein levels in infant formula to better understand their impact on infant health and development, and to address the uncertainties and limitations of the current evidence base."

      "subheading": "What is the health problem that this review addresses?",
      "content": "Many infants are fed infant formulas to promote growth, and some of these formulas have a high protein content. The health problem that this review addresses is the uncertainty surrounding the risk-benefit balance of these high-protein formulas for healthy, formula-fed term infants."

    {
      "subheading": "What are the common treatments or interventions for this health problem?",
      "content": " Infant formulas with varying protein contents are commonly used to feed infants. The review focuses on comparing the effects of higher protein intake versus lower protein intake in healthy, formula-fed term infants."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of higher protein intake versus lower protein intake in healthy, formula-fed term infants. They wanted to determine if feeding infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein or low-protein formula has any effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity, and if there are any differences in the risk of adverse effects between these formulas."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that compared higher versus lower protein intake in formula‑fed term infants. The search terms combined concepts of infant formula, protein content, and randomized or controlled trials."

    {
      "subheading": "Study Selection and Data Extraction",
      "content": "Eligible studies were those enrolling healthy term infants receiving formula, reporting at least one outcome related to growth, metabolic markers, or adverse events, and comparing a higher protein formula with a lower protein formula. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, extracted data, and resolved disagreements by consensus."

      "subheading": "Evidence Synthesis and Confidence Assessment",
      "content": "Results from the included trials were pooled using a random‑effects meta‑analysis. Effect sizes were expressed as mean differences or risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The GRADE approach was applied to rate the certainty of the evidence for each outcome, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 11 studies that involved 1185 infants with a comparison of high-protein formula versus standard-protein formula or standard-protein formula versus low-protein formula. The studies were conducted in high-income countries and lasted for up to 11 years. The population characteristics included healthy, formula-fed term infants of any sex or ethnicity. The types of interventions and comparisons included high-protein formula, standard-protein formula, and low-protein formula. No studies reported on all-cause mortality, and there was no mention of study funding sources. Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula may have little to no effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity. There may be little to no difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with high-protein formula versus those fed with standard-protein formula. Feeding healthy infants standard-protein formula compared to low-protein formula may have little to no effect on undernutrition. There may be little to no difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with standard-protein formula versus those fed with low-protein formula."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by heterogeneity (different participant types and varied delivery methods), very small study sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to October 2022."
