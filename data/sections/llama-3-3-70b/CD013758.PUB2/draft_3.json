  "draft": "Is a high-protein baby formula better than a standard-protein baby formula for healthy infants?\n\nKey messages:\n- Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula may have little or no effect on undernutrition (a condition where the body gets too few calories or nutrients), overweight (having more body fat than is healthy), or obesity (a condition where a person has too much body fat).\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in the risk of adverse effects (unwanted or harmful effects), such as diarrhea (frequent and loose bowel movements), vomiting, or milk hypersensitivity (an adverse reaction to milk), between infants fed high-protein formula and those fed standard-protein formula.\n- Future research should investigate the long-term effects of different protein levels in infant formula to better understand their impact on infant health and development.\n\nWhat is the health problem that this review addresses?\nMany infants are fed infant formulas to promote growth. Some formulas have a high protein content. We want to know if these high-protein formulas are good or bad for healthy infants.\n\nWhat are the common treatments or interventions for this health problem?\nInfant formulas with varying protein contents are used to feed infants. We compared the effects of higher protein intake versus lower protein intake in healthy infants.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know if feeding infants high-protein formula is better or worse than feeding them standard-protein or low-protein formula. We looked at undernutrition, overweight, obesity, and adverse effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched electronic databases for studies that compared higher versus lower protein intake in formula-fed term infants. We included studies that enrolled healthy term infants and reported outcomes related to growth, metabolic markers, or adverse events.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1185 infants. The studies compared high-protein formula versus standard-protein formula or standard-protein formula versus low-protein formula. Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula may have little to no effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity. There may be little to no difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed high-protein formula and those fed standard-protein formula.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity (different participant types and delivery methods), small study sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWe are unsure if feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula has an effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity. There may be little or no difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with high-protein formula versus those fed with standard-protein formula. Future research should investigate the long-term effects of different protein levels in infant formula.",

However, there are a few areas that could be improved for better clarity and readability. Firstly, some sentences are quite long and contain complex terminology that may confuse readers. For example, the sentence 'Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula may have little to no effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity' could be broken down into simpler terms. Additionally, the use of passive voice in certain sections, such as 'The evidence is limited by heterogeneity', could be rephrased for better understanding. Furthermore, the draft could benefit from more concise language and shorter paragraphs to enhance readability. The PLS evaluation results show that the draft is within the acceptable range for most metrics, but there are some deviations in terms of noun usage and complex words that could be addressed. Overall, with some revisions to address these issues, the draft could be even more effective in communicating the information to readers.",

However, there are some deviations in terms of noun usage, complex words, and long words, which could be improved for better readability."
