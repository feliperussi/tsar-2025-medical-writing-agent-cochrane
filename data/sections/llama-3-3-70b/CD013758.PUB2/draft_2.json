  "draft": "Is a high-protein baby formula better than a standard-protein baby formula for healthy infants?\n\nKey messages:\n- Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula may have little or no effect on undernutrition (a condition where the body gets too few calories or nutrients), overweight (having more body fat than is healthy), or obesity (a condition where a person has too much body fat).\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in the risk of adverse effects (unwanted or harmful effects), such as diarrhea (frequent and loose bowel movements), vomiting, or milk hypersensitivity (an adverse reaction to milk), between infants fed high-protein formula and those fed standard-protein formula.\n- Future research should investigate the long-term effects of different protein levels in infant formula to better understand their impact on infant health and development.\n\nWhat is the health problem that this review addresses?\nMany infants are fed infant formulas to promote growth, and some of these formulas have a high protein content. The health problem that this review addresses is the uncertainty surrounding the risk-benefit balance of these high-protein formulas for healthy, formula-fed term infants.\n\nWhat are the common treatments or interventions for this health problem?\nInfant formulas with varying protein contents are commonly used to feed infants. We focused on comparing the effects of higher protein intake versus lower protein intake in healthy, formula-fed term infants.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving infants more protein in their formula is better or worse than giving them less protein. We aimed to determine if feeding infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein or low-protein formula has any effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity, and if there are any differences in the risk of adverse effects between these formulas.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that compared higher versus lower protein intake in formula-fed term infants. We included eligible studies that enrolled healthy term infants receiving formula, reported at least one outcome related to growth, metabolic markers, or adverse events, and compared a higher protein formula with a lower protein formula.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 1185 infants with a comparison of high-protein formula versus standard-protein formula or standard-protein formula versus low-protein formula. The studies were conducted in high-income countries and lasted for up to 11 years. Feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula may have little to no effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity. There may be little to no difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with high-protein formula versus those fed with standard-protein formula.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by heterogeneity (different participant types and varied delivery methods), very small study sizes, potential lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",
