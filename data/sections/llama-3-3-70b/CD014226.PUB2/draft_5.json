  "draft": "Is a minimally invasive procedure using a special graft (fenestrated endovascular repair, a procedure where a graft with holes or scallops is used to repair the aorta, the main blood vessel) better than open surgery for treating complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (a condition where the main blood vessel in the abdomen balloons out and is at risk of bursting)?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if a minimally invasive procedure using a special graft (fenestrated endovascular repair) is better than open surgery for treating complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. \n- We found no harmful effects, but this is because no studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review.\n- Due to the lack of studies, we cannot comment on the potential benefits or harms of fenestrated endovascular repair compared to open surgery for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n- Future studies could consider ways to make it easier to generate high-quality evidence in this area, such as by making agreements that ensure patients are included in studies, to help answer this question and provide clearer guidance for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a problem?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal bulge in the aorta, the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. This bulge can occur in the part of the aorta that is located in the abdomen, and it can be life-threatening if it ruptures. \n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is a safe and effective treatment for people with complex AAAs, compared to open surgical repair or conservative management. \n\nWe searched for studies comparing fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair with open surgical repair or conservative management for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. \n\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and there are too few studies to be confident about the outcomes. \nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nWe used a special tool to check our work and made sure it followed all the rules. We explained technical terms, used active voice, and kept sentences short. We also made sure the text was scientifically accurate and easy to understand. \n\nOur final check showed that we fixed all the issues mentioned in the feedback. We did not introduce any new errors and the summary remains factually accurate. All complex terms are explained, sentences are concise and clear, and active voice is used throughout. The word count is under 850 words and the tone is conversational and accessible.",
