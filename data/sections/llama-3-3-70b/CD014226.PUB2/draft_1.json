  "draft": "# Is a minimally invasive procedure using a special graft (fenestrated endovascular repair) better than open surgery for treating complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (a condition where the main blood vessel in the abdomen balloons out and is at risk of bursting)?\n**Key Messages**\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if a minimally invasive procedure using a special graft (fenestrated endovascular repair, a procedure where a graft with holes or scallops is used to repair the aorta, the main blood vessel) is better than open surgery for treating complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (a condition where the main blood vessel in the abdomen balloons out and is at risk of bursting). No harmful effects were reported, but this is because no studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review.\n- Due to the lack of studies, we cannot comment on the potential benefits or harms of fenestrated endovascular repair compared to open surgery for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n- Future studies could consider ways to make it easier to generate high-quality evidence in this area, such as by making agreements that ensure patients are included in studies, to help answer this question and provide clearer guidance for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n**Introduction**\n### What is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a problem?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal bulge in the aorta, the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. This bulge can occur in the part of the aorta that is located in the abdomen, and it can be life-threatening if it ruptures. AAAs are more common in older adults and can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, smoking, and a family history of the condition. If left untreated, an AAA can rupture, leading to severe bleeding and potentially death. Common treatments for AAAs include open surgical repair and endovascular aneurysm repair, which involves using a stent-graft to reinforce the aorta.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is a safe and effective treatment for people with complex AAAs, compared to open surgical repair or conservative management. They aimed to assess the benefits and harms of FEVAR in terms of outcomes such as all-cause mortality, aneurysm-related mortality, length of hospital stay, and quality of life.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair with open surgical repair or conservative management for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms, summarized their results, and evaluated the evidence to assess benefits and harms.\n**Results**\n### Reason for Termination\nThe agent stopped because it reached the maximum allowed number of iterations without producing a final answer. This limit prevents infinite loops and ensures the system remains responsive.\n### Next Steps\nYou can try simplifying the request, breaking it into smaller parts, or increasing the iteration limit if you have control over the system settings.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and there are too few studies to be confident about the outcomes.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",
