  "key_messages": [
    "Hormone treatments (gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues) may help reduce pain in women with endometriosis (a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows outside the womb), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and they may cause unwanted effects such as hot flushes (a feeling of warmth spreading through the body, often accompanied by sweating and a flushed face).",
    "The current evidence does not provide clear answers about the effectiveness and safety of hormone treatments compared to other treatments for endometriosis, such as danazol (a synthetic hormone used to treat endometriosis) or progestogens (hormones that help prepare the uterus for pregnancy), due to a lack of good-quality studies.",
    "More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of hormone treatments for endometriosis, including their effects on bone health (the strength and density of bones) and quality of life (a person's overall sense of well-being and satisfaction with life), and to find the best treatment options for women with this condition."

      "subheading": "What is endometriosis and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition that affects 6 to 11% of women of reproductive age. It can cause painful symptoms such as dyspareunia (painful intercourse), dysmenorrhoea (painful menstruation), and infertility. Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, leading to inflammation, scarring, and adhesions. The exact cause of endometriosis is unknown, but it is thought to be related to hormonal and genetic factors. Common treatments for endometriosis include medical therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas), which can help reduce pain and improve quality of life."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effectiveness and safety of GnRH analogues (GnRHas) in the treatment of painful symptoms associated with endometriosis. They also aimed to determine the effects of GnRHas on bone mineral density in women with endometriosis. The authors compared GnRHas with other treatment options, including placebo, danazol, analgesics, and intra-uterine progestogens, to evaluate their effectiveness in relieving pain and improving quality of life. They also examined the risk of adverse effects associated with GnRHas treatment."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 72 studies that involved 7355 people with endometriosis. The studies compared gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) with other treatment options, including placebo, danazol, analgesics, intra-uterine progestogens, oral or injectable progestogens, and gestrinone. Some studies also compared GnRHas with GnRHas in conjunction with add-back therapy or calcium-regulating agents. The duration of the studies varied, with some lasting three months and others lasting six or 12 months. The population characteristics were not well-described, but the studies likely involved reproductive-age women with endometriosis. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not detailed. We did not find any studies comparing GnRHas with no treatment, analgesics, or intra-uterine progestogens that met our inclusion criteria. The funding sources for the studies were not explicitly stated."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: GnRHas for endometriosis",
      "content": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues may reduce overall pain in women with endometriosis, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They may also cause more hot flushes. The treatment may have little to no effect on bone mineral density when compared to some other treatments, but it is unclear. For every 100 women treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, 10 to 20 may experience a reduction in pain, compared to 5 to 10 women who receive no treatment or a placebo."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and not all studies reported data on every outcome of interest.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2022 of search."
