  "draft": "# What are the best ways to use nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT, which is a type of treatment that helps people stop smoking by giving them nicotine without the tar and carbon monoxide found in cigarettes) to help people quit smoking?\n**Key Messages**\n- There is evidence that using combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (a type of treatment that helps people stop smoking by giving them nicotine without the tar and carbon monoxide found in cigarettes), which includes a fast-acting form like gum or lozenge plus a patch, results in higher long-term quit rates than using a single form of NRT, with no clear evidence of serious unwanted effects, although more research is needed to fully understand the safety and effectiveness of different NRT products.\n- Using NRT before quitting smoking (preloading) may improve quit rates compared to starting NRT on the quit day, but further research is needed to confirm this finding and to understand how different types of NRT, such as patches or gum, work for different people.\n- Future research should focus on answering questions about the best ways to use NRT, including the most effective doses and durations of treatment, as well as comparing the safety and effectiveness of different NRT products, to help people quit smoking and stay smoke-free.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is nicotine replacement therapy and why is a important for smoking cessation?\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that helps people stop smoking by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It works by replacing the nicotine from cigarettes with a safer alternative, making it easier for people to transition from smoking to complete abstinence. NRT is available in various forms, including patches, gum, lozenges, and nasal sprays. Although NRT has been shown to be effective in achieving long-term smoking abstinence, there is uncertainty about the best way to use it, including the type, dose, duration, and timing of treatment.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations, and schedules of NRT for achieving long-term smoking cessation. They wanted to find out which types of NRT work best, whether using NRT before quitting is more effective than using it from quit day onward, and whether there are any differences in safety and tolerability between different types of NRT. By answering these questions, the authors hoped to provide guidance for people trying to quit smoking and for healthcare professionals advising them.\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing different forms, doses, and durations of nicotine replacement therapy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine its effectiveness for smoking cessation.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 43,327 participants. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. The studies compared different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for achieving long-term smoking cessation. The types of interventions and comparisons included combination NRT, single-form NRT, fast-acting forms, and different doses of nicotine patches and gum. We did not find any information on the duration of the studies or the funding sources. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not specified. The study settings were not described in detail, but it was mentioned that the studies were conducted in various countries.\nMain results: Nicotine Replacement Therapy for Smoking Cessation\nUsing a combination of fast-acting and slow-acting nicotine replacement therapy probably increases the chances of quitting smoking compared to using a single type of therapy. Nicotine replacement therapy probably reduces the chances of smoking when used before quitting. For every 100 people trying to quit smoking, using a combination of therapies may help 10 more people quit successfully compared to using a single therapy. Using a fast-acting form of nicotine replacement therapy, such as gum or lozenge, probably makes little to no difference in quit rates compared to using a slow-acting form like a patch.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment (risk of bias from lack of blinding), the studies were very small (low statistical power), and the evidence does not encompass all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

Specific issues include: 1) the title and some subheadings not being phrased as questions, 2) overly long and convoluted sentences, 3) excessive use of passive voice, and 4) high usage of complex words, nouns, and long words. For example, the sentence \"Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that helps people stop smoking by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms, making it easier for people to transition from smoking to complete abstinence,\" could be broken down for better understanding. Additionally, the phrase \"nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), which is a type of treatment that helps people stop smoking by giving them nicotine without the tar and carbon monoxide found in cigarettes,\" could be simplified. The PLS evaluation results show moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns but highlight significant deviations in passive voice, nominalization, and the use of complex and long words, which need improvement.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 55.6% of features falling within the best quartile (P25/P75) and 33.3% of features deviating from typical patterns, particularly in passive voice, nominalization, nouns, smog index, complex words, and long words. These deviations suggest the need for revisions to enhance readability and clarity."
