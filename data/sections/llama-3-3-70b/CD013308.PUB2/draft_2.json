  "draft": "What are the best ways to use nicotine replacement therapy to help people quit smoking?\nWe looked at the evidence on different ways to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to help people quit smoking. NRT is a type of treatment that helps people stop smoking by giving them nicotine without the tar and carbon monoxide found in cigarettes.\n\n- Using a combination of fast-acting and slow-acting NRT, such as gum or lozenge plus a patch, probably increases the chances of quitting smoking compared to using a single type of therapy.\n- Using NRT before quitting smoking (preloading) may improve quit rates compared to starting NRT on the quit day, but further research is needed to confirm this finding.\n- Future research should focus on answering questions about the best ways to use NRT, including the most effective doses and durations of treatment, as well as comparing the safety and effectiveness of different NRT products.\n\nWhat is nicotine replacement therapy and why is it important for smoking cessation?\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that helps people stop smoking by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It works by replacing the nicotine from cigarettes with a safer alternative, making it easier for people to transition from smoking to complete abstinence. NRT is available in various forms, including patches, gum, lozenges, and nasal sprays.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations, and schedules of NRT for achieving long-term smoking cessation. They wanted to find out which types of NRT work best, whether using NRT before quitting is more effective than using it from quit day onward, and whether there are any differences in safety and tolerability between different types of NRT.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different forms, doses, and durations of nicotine replacement therapy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine its effectiveness for smoking cessation.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 43,327 participants. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. The studies compared different forms, deliveries, doses, durations, and schedules of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for achieving long-term smoking cessation.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not encompass all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

For example, the sentence 'Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that helps people stop smoking by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms' could be simplified to 'NRT helps people quit smoking by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms.' Another issue is the use of passive voice, such as 'The evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment,' which could be rewritten as 'We found that the evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment.' The metrics show a high number of nominalizations (27), which contributes to the clarity issues. To improve, the writer should focus on using active voice, simplifying sentences, and providing clear definitions for technical terms.",

However, there are some deviations, including a high number of nominalizations (27), which is in the P90 range. The results also show that the text has a good balance of active and passive voice, with 63% of sentences in active voice. To improve, the writer should focus on reducing nominalizations and using more active voice."
