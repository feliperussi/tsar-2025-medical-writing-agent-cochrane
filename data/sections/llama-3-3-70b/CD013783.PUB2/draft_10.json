  "draft": "What is the accuracy of toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease?\nWe found that toe-brachial index (TBI) - a test comparing blood pressure in toes to blood pressure in arms - and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) - the pressure of blood in toes when the heart beats - may be useful for detecting peripheral arterial disease (PAD), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. \nThe studies included in the review were generally of low quality, which means we cannot be confident in the results. \nMore research is needed to determine the accuracy of TBI and TSBP for diagnosing PAD.\n\nWhat is peripheral arterial disease?\nPAD is a condition that affects the arteries in the legs, reducing blood flow. This happens when plaque builds up in the arteries. PAD can cause symptoms like claudication pain - pain in the legs when walking - rest pain, wounds, and gangrene, and increase the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PAD is estimated to affect 236 million people worldwide, with advanced age, smoking, hypertension - high blood pressure - diabetes, and concomitant cardiovascular disease being common risk factors.\n\nWhy is it important to diagnose peripheral arterial disease?\nWe need to diagnose PAD accurately and on time to implement appropriate risk management strategies, prevent complications, slow disease progression, or intervene when necessary. Diagnostic tests like TBI and TSBP are used to detect PAD, but their accuracy and effectiveness need to be evaluated.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to estimate the accuracy of TSBP and TBI for diagnosing PAD in the lower extremities. We also wanted to compare the accuracy of TBI and TSBP and investigate sources of heterogeneity in test accuracy, including patient group, equipment used, positivity threshold, and reference standard.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases - like PubMed and Embase - for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of TBI and TSBP in detecting PAD. The search combined keywords, MeSH terms, and synonyms related to TBI, TSBP, PAD, and diagnostic accuracy, without language or date restrictions.\n\nWhat were the eligibility criteria for the studies?\nWe included studies that enrolled adult participants with suspected or known PAD, reported TBI or TSBP measurements compared with a reference standard - like angiography or duplex ultrasound - and provided sufficient data to construct 2 × 2 tables. We excluded case reports, reviews, and studies lacking a reference standard.\n\nHow did we extract and synthesize the data?\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, index test thresholds, reference standards, and diagnostic 2 × 2 counts. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. We calculated pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios using a bivariate random-effects model.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that involved 2631 participants with PAD. Researchers conducted the studies in various countries and settings, with most using colour duplex ultrasound as a reference standard. The evidence base to support the use of TBI and TSBP to identify PAD is limited. While both TBI and TSBP are used extensively clinically, the overall diagnostic performance of these tests remains uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe found that the included studies were generally of low methodological quality, with poor reporting of participant recruitment, inadequate blinding between the index test and reference standard, unclear timing between test and standard, very small sample sizes, possible awareness of treatment allocation, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.\n\nKey messages:\n- The review found that TBI and TSBP may be useful for detecting PAD, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- The studies included in the review were generally of low quality, which means we cannot be confident in the results.\n- More research is needed to determine the accuracy of TBI and TSBP for diagnosing PAD.",

For example, the sentence 'Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition where the arteries in the lower limbs become narrowed due to atherosclerotic occlusive disease, reducing blood flow to the legs' is hard to follow and contains technical terms without definitions. A suggested rewrite could be 'PAD is a condition that affects the arteries in the legs, reducing blood flow. This happens when plaque builds up in the arteries.' Additionally, the draft has high rates of nominalization, nouns, and complex words, which contribute to its low readability. Metrics show 21 instances of nominalization, 199 nouns, and 167 complex words, which are beyond the typical PLS ranges. To improve, the writer should reduce these features and use more active voice, pronouns, and simpler language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 22.2% of features in the best quartile and 44.4% in the median range. However, 6 features deviate significantly from typical patterns, including nominalization, nouns, smog index, complex words, and long words. These deviations contribute to the clarity issues and low readability of the draft text."
