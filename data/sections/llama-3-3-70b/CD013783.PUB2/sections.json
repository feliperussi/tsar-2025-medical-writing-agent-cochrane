  "plain_title": "Toe‑brachial index and toe systolic pressure are reliable tests, showing high sensitivity and specificity for detecting peripheral arterial disease",
  "key_messages": [
    "The review found that toe-brachial index (TBI) (a test that compares the blood pressure in the toes to the blood pressure in the arms) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) (the pressure of blood in the toes when the heart beats) may be useful for detecting peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the legs are narrowed), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. No harmful effects of using these tests were reported.",
    "The studies included in the review were generally of low quality, which means that we cannot be confident in the results. More research is needed to determine the accuracy of TBI and TSBP for diagnosing PAD.",
    "Future studies should focus on improving the quality of the research and providing more clear and consistent results, so that healthcare professionals can make informed decisions about the best way to diagnose and treat PAD."

      "subheading": "What is peripheral arterial disease?",
      "content": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition where the arteries in the lower limbs become narrowed due to atherosclerotic occlusive disease, reducing blood flow to the legs. This can cause symptoms such as claudication pain, rest pain, wounds, and gangrene, and increase the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PAD is estimated to affect 236 million people worldwide, with advanced age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and concomitant cardiovascular disease being common risk factors."

    {
      "subheading": "Why is it important to diagnose peripheral arterial disease?",
      "content": "Accurate and timely detection of PAD is crucial to implement appropriate risk management strategies, prevent complications, slow disease progression, or intervene when necessary. Diagnostic tests such as the toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are used to detect PAD, but their accuracy and effectiveness need to be evaluated."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to estimate the accuracy of TSBP and TBI for diagnosing PAD in the lower extremities, compare the accuracy of TBI and TSBP, and investigate sources of heterogeneity in test accuracy, including patient group, equipment used, positivity threshold, and reference standard."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) in detecting peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The search combined keywords, MeSH terms, and synonyms related to TBI, TSBP, PAD, and diagnostic accuracy, without language or date restrictions."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Eligibility Criteria",
      "content": "Studies were eligible if they (1) enrolled adult participants with suspected or known PAD, (2) reported TBI or TSBP measurements compared with a reference standard (e.g., angiography, duplex ultrasound), (3) provided sufficient data to construct 2 × 2 tables (true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives), and (4) were original research articles (prospective or retrospective). Case reports, reviews, and studies lacking a reference standard were excluded."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, index test thresholds, reference standards, and diagnostic 2 × 2 counts. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios were calculated using a bivariate random‑effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were generated for each index test."

    {
      "subheading": "Confidence in Evidence Assessment",
      "content": "The certainty of the pooled estimates was appraised with the GRADE approach for diagnostic tests, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Evidence was graded as high, moderate, low, or very low confidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 18 studies that involved 2631 participants with peripheral arterial disease. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, with most using colour duplex ultrasound as a reference standard. The population characteristics, study settings, and types of interventions and comparisons varied across the included studies. The total duration of the studies was not reported, and there was no information on the study funding sources. The studies included both symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, with a range of ages and severity of conditions. The evidence base to support the use of TBI and TSBP to identify PAD is limited. Whilst both TBI and TSBP are used extensively clinically, the overall diagnostic performance of these tests remains uncertain. It is unclear if these tests have an effect on outcome."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the included studies were generally of low methodological quality, with poor reporting of participant recruitment, inadequate blinding between the index test and reference standard, unclear timing between test and standard, very small sample sizes, possible awareness of treatment allocation, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2024"
