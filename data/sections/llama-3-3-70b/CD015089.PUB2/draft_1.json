It is a common reason for people to seek medical care. AVS can be caused by either peripheral (related to the inner ear) or central (related to the brain) causes. Determining the cause of AVS is crucial because the treatment and outcomes differ significantly depending on whether it is peripheral or central. For example, peripheral causes might be treated with vestibular rehabilitation or medications to alleviate symptoms, while central causes, which could be due to serious conditions like strokes, may require immediate medical intervention.\n### What are the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations?\nThe HINTS (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) examination is a three-part test used by clinicians to determine if AVS is due to a peripheral or central cause. It involves assessing how the eyes move in response to rapidly turning the patient's head (head impulse), the direction of involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned (test of skew). The HINTS Plus examination includes an additional assessment of auditory function. These examinations are important tools for clinicians to quickly and accurately diagnose the cause of AVS.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central cause of AVS. They wanted to determine how well these examinations can correctly identify patients with central causes of AVS, which is critical for ensuring appropriate treatment and improving patient outcomes. By evaluating the sensitivity, specificity, and other diagnostic accuracy measures of these tests, the authors sought to provide evidence on their effectiveness in clinical practice.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for diagnosing central causes of acute vestibular syndrome, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 16 studies that involved 2024 participants with acute vestibular syndrome. The mean age of the participants was 60 years, with 981 women and 1043 men. Most studies were conducted in the emergency department, with half performed by neurologists. The studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central etiology for AVS. No information was available on the duration of the studies or the funding sources. The population characteristics, study settings, and types of interventions and comparisons are described in the included studies. The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations may help doctors diagnose the cause of dizziness ... These examinations seem to be good at finding out if the dizziness is due to a problem in the central part of the body, but we are not very sure about the results. For every 100 people who have these examinations, between 85 and 100 might be correctly diagnosed with a central cause of dizziness, but between 6 and 38 people might be incorrectly diagnosed. More research is needed to confirm these findings.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
