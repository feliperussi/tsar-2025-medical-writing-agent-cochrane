  "draft": "How accurate are the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew examinations for diagnosing the cause of sudden dizziness?\nWe looked at how well these tests work to identify if sudden dizziness is caused by a central problem (related to the brain or spinal cord).\n\n- The HINTS examination checks eye movements and alignment to identify central causes of dizziness. It seems effective, but the evidence is not strong, and more research is needed on its use with video assistance and in different settings.\n- The HINTS Plus examination includes an additional assessment of hearing. It also appears to be useful, but again, the evidence is not very strong, and more research is needed to understand how well it works in different situations and with different types of healthcare providers.\n- Future studies should investigate the use of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations in more detail to provide clearer answers for people experiencing sudden dizziness and for healthcare providers trying to diagnose and treat them.\n\nWhat is acute vestibular syndrome and why is it a problem?\nAcute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a type of dizziness that can include severe vertigo (a spinning sensation), nausea and vomiting, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), or unsteadiness. It is a common reason for people to seek medical care. AVS can be caused by either peripheral (related to the inner ear) or central (related to the brain) causes. Determining the cause of AVS is crucial because the treatment and outcomes differ significantly depending on whether it is peripheral or central.\n\nWhat are the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations?\nThe HINTS examination is a three-part test that helps doctors figure out if dizziness is caused by a problem in the inner ear (peripheral) or the brain (central). It involves assessing how the eyes move in response to rapidly turning the patient's head (head impulse), the direction of involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned (test of skew). The HINTS Plus examination includes an additional assessment of auditory function. These examinations are important tools for clinicians to quickly and accurately diagnose the cause of AVS.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central cause of AVS. They wanted to determine how well these examinations can correctly identify patients with central causes of AVS, which is critical for ensuring appropriate treatment and improving patient outcomes.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 16 studies that involved 2024 participants with acute vestibular syndrome. The mean age of the participants was 60 years, with 981 women and 1043 men. Most studies were conducted in the emergency department, with half performed by neurologists. The studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central etiology for AVS. The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations may help doctors diagnose the cause of dizziness. These examinations seem to be good at finding out if the dizziness is due to a problem in the central part of the body, but we are not very sure about the results. For every 100 people who have these examinations, between 85 and 100 might be correctly diagnosed with a central cause of dizziness, but between 6 and 38 people might be incorrectly diagnosed. More research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022.",
