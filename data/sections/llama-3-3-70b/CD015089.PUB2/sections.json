  "key_messages": [
    "The HINTS (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, and Test of Skew) examination, which checks how the eyes move and are aligned, seems to be good at identifying if sudden dizziness is caused by a central (related to the brain or spinal cord) problem, but the evidence is not very strong, and there is limited information about its use with video assistance or in different settings.",
    "The HINTS Plus examination, which includes an additional assessment of hearing, also appears to be useful, but again, the evidence is not very strong, and more research is needed to understand how well it works in different situations and with different types of healthcare providers.",
    "Future studies should investigate the use of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations in more detail, including how well they work when used by different types of healthcare providers, in various settings, and with the help of video assistance, to provide clearer answers for people experiencing sudden dizziness and for the healthcare providers who are trying to diagnose and treat them."

      "subheading": "What is acute vestibular syndrome and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a type of dizziness that can include severe vertigo, nausea and vomiting, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), or unsteadiness. It is a common reason for people to seek medical care. AVS can be caused by either peripheral (related to the inner ear) or central (related to the brain) causes. Determining the cause of AVS is crucial because the treatment and outcomes differ significantly depending on whether it is peripheral or central. For example, peripheral causes might be treated with vestibular rehabilitation or medications to alleviate symptoms, while central causes, which could be due to serious conditions like strokes, may require immediate medical intervention."

      "subheading": "What are the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations?",
      "content": "The HINTS (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) examination is a three-part test used by clinicians to determine if AVS is due to a peripheral or central cause. It involves assessing how the eyes move in response to rapidly turning the patient's head (head impulse), the direction of involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and whether the eyes are aligned or misaligned (test of skew). The HINTS Plus examination includes an additional assessment of auditory function. These examinations are important tools for clinicians to quickly and accurately diagnose the cause of AVS."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central cause of AVS. They wanted to determine how well these examinations can correctly identify patients with central causes of AVS, which is critical for ensuring appropriate treatment and improving patient outcomes. By evaluating the sensitivity, specificity, and other diagnostic accuracy measures of these tests, the authors sought to provide evidence on their effectiveness in clinical practice."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 16 studies that involved 2024 participants with acute vestibular syndrome. The mean age of the participants was 60 years, with 981 women and 1043 men. Most studies were conducted in the emergency department, with half performed by neurologists. The studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations, with or without video assistance, for identifying a central etiology for AVS. No information was available on the duration of the studies or the funding sources. The population characteristics, study settings, and types of interventions and comparisons are described in the included studies. The HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations may help doctors diagnose the cause of dizziness ... These examinations seem to be good at finding out if the dizziness is due to a problem in the central part of the body, but we are not very sure about the results. For every 100 people who have these examinations, between 85 and 100 might be correctly diagnosed with a central cause of dizziness, but between 6 and 38 people might be incorrectly diagnosed. More research is needed to confirm these findings."
