  "draft": "Hormone replacement therapy does not effectively treat pelvic organ prolapse in post-menopausal women\n\n- Hormone replacement therapy, also known as oestrogen therapy (a treatment that replaces the female hormone oestrogen), does not effectively treat pelvic organ prolapse in post-menopausal women. We found insufficient evidence to draw solid conclusions on its benefits or harms.\n- Topical oestrogen (a type of hormone replacement therapy applied directly to the vagina) in conjunction with pessaries (devices inserted into the vagina to support the pelvic organs) or surgery may have some benefits. These benefits include fewer adverse vaginal events or reduced postoperative urinary tract infections. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the varying design of the studies.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse is a health condition. It happens when a woman's uterus, bladder, or rectum descends into the vagina. This condition affects about 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child. Risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse include older age, having had multiple births, and being overweight.\n\nWhy is pelvic organ prolapse a problem?\nPelvic organ prolapse can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with daily activities. Common treatments for pelvic organ prolapse include pelvic floor muscle training, devices such as vaginal pessaries, and surgery. However, these treatments may not be effective for all women, and some may experience adverse effects.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, for managing pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women. They also aimed to summarize the findings of relevant economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1002 postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse. The studies were conducted to assess the effects of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, on pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. Most studies compared oestrogen therapy in conjunction with vaginal pessaries or surgery versus vaginal pessaries alone or surgery alone.\n\nMain results: Oestrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse\nThe review found that there was not enough evidence to determine the benefits or harms of oestrogen therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women. However, the use of topical oestrogen in conjunction with pessaries may be associated with fewer adverse vaginal events compared to pessaries alone. The use of topical oestrogen in conjunction with surgery may be associated with reduced postoperative urinary tract infections compared to surgery alone. These findings should be interpreted with caution due to the varying design of the studies that contributed to the data.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

Additionally, there are instances of passive voice, such as 'The review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, for managing pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women.'",

However, some metrics show significant deviation from typical patterns, including a high number of nouns (171.0, P90), complex words (121.0, P90), and long words (183.0, P90). These deviations suggest that the draft text could benefit from simplification and rephrasing to improve readability."
