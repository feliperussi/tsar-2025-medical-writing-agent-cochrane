  "draft": "Hormone replacement therapy does not effectively treat pelvic organ prolapse in post-menopausal women\n\n- We found that hormone replacement therapy (a treatment that replaces the female hormone oestrogen) does not effectively treat pelvic organ prolapse in post-menopausal women. There is not enough evidence to draw solid conclusions on its benefits or harms.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse is a health condition where a woman's uterus (the womb), bladder, or rectum (the last part of the bowel) descends into the vagina. It affects about 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child. Risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse include older age, having had multiple births, and being overweight.\n\nWhy is pelvic organ prolapse a problem?\nPelvic organ prolapse can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with daily activities. Common treatments for pelvic organ prolapse include pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen the muscles that support the bladder, uterus, and bowels), devices such as vaginal pessaries (a device inserted into the vagina to support the organs), and surgery. However, these treatments may not be effective for all women, and some may experience adverse effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, for managing pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women. We also aimed to summarize the findings of relevant economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1002 postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse. Most studies compared oestrogen therapy in conjunction with vaginal pessaries or surgery versus vaginal pessaries alone or surgery alone. We found that there was not enough evidence to determine the benefits or harms of oestrogen therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women. However, the use of topical oestrogen (a cream or gel applied directly to the vagina) in conjunction with pessaries may be associated with fewer adverse vaginal events compared to pessaries alone, and the use of topical oestrogen in conjunction with surgery may be associated with reduced postoperative urinary tract infections compared to surgery alone.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Hormone replacement therapy does not effectively treat pelvic organ prolapse in post-menopausal women, and there is insufficient evidence to draw solid conclusions on its benefits or harms, with no reported harmful effects.\n- Topical oestrogen in conjunction with pessaries or surgery may have some benefits, such as fewer adverse vaginal events or reduced postoperative urinary tract infections, but these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the varying design of the studies.\n- Future research should focus on conducting larger studies to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy, used alone or in conjunction with other treatments, for the management of pelvic organ prolapse, including measuring outcomes in the medium and long term.",
