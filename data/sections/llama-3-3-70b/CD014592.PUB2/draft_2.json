  "draft": "Hormone replacement therapy does not effectively treat pelvic organ prolapse in post-menopausal women\n\n- Hormone replacement therapy does not effectively treat pelvic organ prolapse in post-menopausal women. We found insufficient evidence to draw solid conclusions on its benefits or harms. \n- Topical oestrogen (a type of hormone replacement therapy applied directly to the vagina) in conjunction with pessaries (devices inserted into the vagina to support the pelvic organs) or surgery may have some benefits. These benefits include fewer adverse vaginal events or reduced postoperative urinary tract infections. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the varying design of the studies.\n- Future research should focus on conducting larger studies to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy. This includes using it alone or in conjunction with other treatments for the management of pelvic organ prolapse. These studies should measure outcomes in the medium and long term.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a health condition where a woman's uterus (womb), bladder, or rectum descends into the vagina. It affects about 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child. Risk factors for POP include older age, having had multiple births, and being overweight.\n\nWhy is pelvic organ prolapse a problem?\nPelvic organ prolapse can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with daily activities. Common treatments for POP include pelvic floor muscle training, devices such as vaginal pessaries, and surgery. However, these treatments may not be effective for all women, and some may experience adverse effects.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, for managing pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women. They also aimed to summarize the findings of relevant economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy for POP.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1002 postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse. The studies were conducted to assess the effects of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, on pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. Most studies compared oestrogen therapy in conjunction with vaginal pessaries or surgery versus vaginal pessaries alone or surgery alone.\n\nMain results: Oestrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse\nThe review found that there was not enough evidence to determine the benefits or harms of oestrogen therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women. However, the use of topical oestrogen in conjunction with pessaries may be associated with fewer adverse vaginal events compared to pessaries alone. The use of topical oestrogen in conjunction with surgery may be associated with reduced postoperative urinary tract infections compared to surgery alone. These findings should be interpreted with caution due to the varying design of the studies that contributed to the data.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

Firstly, the title and subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a requirement. For example, the subheading \"What is pelvic organ prolapse?\" should be rephrased to \"What is pelvic organ prolapse?\" to make it a question. Secondly, there are several sentences that are longer than 30 words and are hard to follow, such as \"Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a health condition where a woman's uterus, bladder, or rectum descends into the vagina.\" This sentence can be broken down into two simpler sentences to improve clarity. Thirdly, there are some technical terms that are not defined, such as \"oestrogen therapy\". A brief definition of this term should be provided to help readers understand the context. Lastly, the draft text exceeds the recommended word count of 850 words. The writer should consider condensing the information to make it more concise. The PLS evaluation results show that the draft text has a high number of nouns, complex words, and long words, which can make it difficult to read. The results also indicate that the text has a moderate level of conformity with typical PLS patterns. To improve the draft text, the writer should focus on simplifying the language, breaking up long sentences, and providing definitions for technical terms. Additionally, the writer should consider using more active voice and reducing the number of nouns and complex words.",
