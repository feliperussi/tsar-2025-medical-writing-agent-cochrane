  "draft": "# Hormone replacement therapy does not effectively treat pelvic organ prolapse in post‑menopausal women\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Hormone replacement therapy does not effectively treat pelvic organ prolapse in post-menopausal women, and there is insufficient evidence to draw solid conclusions on its benefits or harms, with no reported harmful effects.\n- Topical oestrogen in conjunction with pessaries or surgery may have some benefits, such as fewer adverse vaginal events or reduced postoperative urinary tract infections, but these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the varying design of the studies.\n- Future research should focus on conducting larger studies to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy, used alone or in conjunction with other treatments, for the management of pelvic organ prolapse, including measuring outcomes in the medium and long term.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is pelvic organ prolapse?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a health condition where a woman's uterus, bladder, or rectum descends into the vagina. It affects about 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child. Risk factors for POP include older age, having had multiple births, and being overweight.\n### Why is pelvic organ prolapse a problem?\nPelvic organ prolapse can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with daily activities. Common treatments for POP include pelvic floor muscle training, devices such as vaginal pessaries, and surgery. However, these treatments may not be effective for all women, and some may experience adverse effects.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the benefits and harms of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, for managing pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women. They also aimed to summarize the findings of relevant economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy for POP.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on oestrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 14 studies that involved 1002 postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse. The studies were conducted to assess the effects of oestrogen therapy, alone or in combination with other treatments, on pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. Most studies compared oestrogen therapy in conjunction with vaginal pessaries or surgery versus vaginal pessaries alone or surgery alone. Unfortunately, there is limited information on the duration of the studies, funding sources, and specific population characteristics such as age and severity of condition. The studies did not assess the effects of oestrogen therapy alone versus no treatment, placebo, pelvic floor muscle training, devices such as vaginal pessaries, or surgery.\n### Main results: Oestrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse\nThe review found that there was not enough evidence to determine the benefits or harms of oestrogen therapy for managing pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women. However, the use of topical oestrogen in conjunction with pessaries may be associated with fewer adverse vaginal events compared to pessaries alone, and the use of topical oestrogen in conjunction with surgery may be associated with reduced postoperative urinary tract infections compared to surgery alone. These findings should be interpreted with caution due to the varying design of the studies that contributed to the data.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",
