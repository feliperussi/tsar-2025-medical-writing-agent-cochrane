  "draft": "Do topical repellents help prevent malaria in people living in areas where malaria is common?\n\nWe looked at the evidence to find out if topical repellents can help prevent malaria. Here are the key messages:\n- Topical repellents may slightly reduce the risk of getting malaria and its symptoms, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. They are considered safe with very few mild side effects, such as skin reactions.\n- The potential benefits of topical repellents are more likely to be seen in people at high risk of malaria, such as refugees or those who do not have access to other ways of preventing mosquito bites, like bed nets or indoor spraying.\n- More research is needed, especially studies that are well-designed and include a large number of participants, to understand how well topical repellents work in different situations and to find out if they can be used effectively alongside other methods of preventing malaria.\n\nWhat is malaria and why is it a problem?\nMalaria is a serious disease spread by infected mosquitoes. It is a major health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Common treatments for malaria include medications such as artemisinin-based combination therapies (a type of antimalarial drug), as well as preventive measures like insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying. However, these measures may not be effective in all situations, such as in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to insecticides or where people are outdoors during peak mosquito hours.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether topical repellents, which are applied directly to the skin or clothing, can help prevent malaria infection in people living in areas where the disease is common. We also wanted to know whether topical repellents are effective when used alone or in combination with other preventive measures, and whether they are safe to use. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of topical repellents in reducing the incidence of malaria in high- and non-high-risk populations, and to evaluate the certainty of the evidence for their use.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies on topical repellents to prevent malaria, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We found 13 studies that involved 61,651 people with malaria infection. The studies were conducted in countries around the world and most were done in low-endemicity areas. Most studies lasted for around several months. Pharmaceutical companies funded some of the studies. The average age of participants was not reported. There was some suggestion that studies in the review included more severely ill populations, such as refugees, the military, or forest goers.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found that topical repellents may slightly reduce the risk of malaria infection and clinical incidence when both outcomes are considered together. Topical repellents are considered safe, with a very low prevalence of adverse events among participants who used them. The potential additional benefits of topical repellents are most likely limited in contexts where other interventions are available.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has limitations. These include participants possibly knowing their treatment, incomplete outcome reporting, and small sample sizes, which reduce precision.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nOur evidence is current up to 2023.",
