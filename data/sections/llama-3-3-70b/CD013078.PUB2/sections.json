  "key_messages": [
    "We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy (a condition that causes knee pain due to tendon problems), and the quality of the evidence is not robust enough to make firm conclusions.",
    "Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function compared to no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, or surgery, but the current evidence does not allow us to say this with confidence, partly because most studies were in athletes and not the general public.",
    "Future research should focus on comparing exercise to other treatments with longer follow-up periods and in more diverse groups of people, including non-athletes, to better understand the benefits and potential harms of different treatments for patellar tendinopathy."

      "subheading": "What is patellar tendinopathy and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Patellar tendinopathy is a common condition that affects the tendon at the front of the knee, causing pain. It is a prevalent problem, particularly among athletes, and can impact daily activities and sports performance. The main treatment for patellar tendinopathy involves different types of exercise, such as strengthening and stretching, as well as other treatments like surgery and glucocorticoid injections."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of exercise for the treatment of patellar tendinopathy. They wanted to find out whether strengthening exercise reduces pain and improves function compared to no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, or surgery, and to assess the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found seven studies that involved 211 people with chronic patellar tendinopathy. The studies were conducted in various settings and included athletes with a mean age of 26 years and a mean duration of symptoms of 41.6 months. Most studies compared strengthening exercises with no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, surgery, stretching exercise, or pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction. The studies did not report on the duration of the interventions or the funding sources. The population characteristics included a majority of males (88%) and athletes with chronic patellar tendinopathy. We did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to pain and function compared to no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, or surgery. It is unclear if strengthening exercise has an effect on treatment success and return to sport. We do not know if strengthening exercise has an effect on quality of life and adverse events."

  "limitations": "The evidence is very uncertain because all trials were small, resulting in imprecise effect estimates, and participants were likely aware of their assigned treatment, introducing performance bias. These limitations apply to comparisons of strengthening exercise versus no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, and surgery.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to September 2023."
