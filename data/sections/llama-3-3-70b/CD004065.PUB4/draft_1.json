  "draft": "# How steroids and biologic medicines can help or harm people with eosinophilic esophagitis\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Corticosteroids (medicines that reduce inflammation, a natural response of the body) may lead to improvement in symptoms and histological (tissue) improvement in people with eosinophilic esophagitis (a condition where the esophagus becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction), but may have little to no effect on endoscopic (visual examination of the esophagus) improvement.\n- Biologics (medicines that target specific parts of the immune system) may lead to histological improvement, but their effect on clinical symptoms and endoscopic improvement is uncertain; harmful effects were not clearly reported, but the review notes that there may be no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (unwanted effects) when compared to placebo (a dummy treatment).\n- Future research should focus on long-term effects, direct comparisons between different treatments, and the needs of specific subgroups of people with eosinophilic esophagitis, as the current evidence has limitations and uncertainties, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the best treatment options.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is eosinophilic esophagitis and why is it a problem?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus, which is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It occurs when a type of white blood cell called an eosinophil builds up in the esophagus in response to an allergen or irritant. This can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, and vomiting. EoE can significantly impact a person's quality of life, and there is currently no cure. Common treatments include dietary modifications, medications to reduce inflammation, and dilation of the esophagus to improve swallowing.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different medical interventions for treating eosinophilic esophagitis. They aimed to compare the benefits and harms of various treatments, including corticosteroids, biologics, and other medications, to determine which ones work best for improving symptoms, reducing inflammation, and enhancing quality of life. The authors also sought to identify the most effective treatment strategies for inducing and maintaining remission in people with EoE.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing medical interventions for eosinophilic esophagitis, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these treatments.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 41 studies that involved 3253 people with eosinophilic esophagitis. The studies were conducted in various countries and included both pediatric and adult patients, with some studies focusing on patients with inactive disease and others on patients with active disease. The studies compared different medical interventions, including corticosteroids and biologics, to placebo or other interventions. Eleven studies included pediatric patients, while the rest recruited both children and adults. Four studies were in patients with inactive disease, while the rest were in patients with active disease. We identified 19 intervention comparisons, with 14 studies comparing corticosteroids to placebo and nine studies comparing biologics to placebo. Corticosteroids may lead to clinical symptom improvement and a large increase in histological improvement, but may make little to no difference to endoscopic improvement. Biologics may not lead to clinical symptom improvement, but may lead a large increase in histological improvement. Corticosteroids and biologics may have different effects on outcomes, and the certainty of the evidence varies.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (potential lack of blinding), and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains some technical terms without clear definitions, such as \"eosinophilic esophagitis\" and \"biologics\", which may confuse readers who are not familiar with these terms. For example, the sentence \"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus, which is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.\" could be rephrased to include a brief explanation of what eosinophilic esophagitis is. Additionally, some sentences are too long and convoluted, making them hard to follow. For instance, the sentence \"The review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different medical interventions for treating eosinophilic esophagitis, including corticosteroids, biologics, and other medications, to determine which ones work best for improving symptoms, reducing inflammation, and enhancing quality of life.\" could be broken up into shorter sentences for better clarity. Furthermore, the text could benefit from more active voice constructions, as the current draft relies heavily on passive voice, which can make the text seem less engaging and more difficult to read. The PLS evaluation results show that the draft has a high number of passive voice constructions (27 instances), which supports the need for revision. Overall, while the draft provides a good overview of the topic, it requires significant revisions to improve its clarity, readability, and engagement.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft text deviates from typical PLS patterns in several areas, including a high number of passive voice constructions, long sentences, and technical terms without clear definitions. The results also show that the draft has a low Flesch reading ease score, indicating that the text may be difficult for readers to understand. To improve the clarity and readability of the draft, revisions should focus on breaking up long sentences, using more active voice constructions, and providing clear definitions for technical terms."
