  "draft": "Is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones) better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones) for treating kidney stones in adults?\n\nKey messages:\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy may be better than retrograde intrarenal surgery for treating kidney stones in adults. It may improve stone-free rates (the rate at which patients become free of kidney stones) and reduce the need for secondary interventions (additional treatments). However, it probably has little or no effect on major complications (serious unwanted effects) and may increase the length of hospital stay (the time a patient spends in the hospital).\n- The evidence for most outcomes was not of high quality. This means the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution, and more research is needed to confirm these results.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of the current evidence. This includes the lack of reporting on unplanned medical visits (unexpected visits to the doctor or hospital) and quality of life (a patient's overall well-being).\n\nWhat are kidney stones and why are they a problem?\nKidney stones, also known as renal stones, are a source of pain, obstruction, and infection. They can vary in size, location, composition, and other patient factors, making treatment challenging. Common treatments for kidney stones include observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. They aimed to compare the two treatments in terms of stone-free rate, major complications, need for secondary interventions, and other outcomes to inform shared decision-making about management choices for individuals with renal stones.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for treating renal stones. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 studies that involved 4571 people with renal stones. The studies compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. Most studies did not report sources of funding or conflicts of interest. The average size of stones ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm.\n\nMain results: Treatment outcomes for renal stones\nPercutaneous nephrolithotomy may improve the rate of people becoming stone-free and may reduce the need for additional procedures. However, it probably has little to no effect on major complications. It may have little to no effect on the occurrence of ureteral strictures and may increase the length of hospital stay. For every 100 people who have percutaneous nephrolithotomy, 10 more may become stone-free compared to those who have retrograde intrarenal surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

However, it likely has little effect on serious complications.' Additionally, the sentence 'The evidence is limited by very small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest.' could be rewritten in active voice as 'We found that the evidence is limited due to small study sizes, possible lack of blinding, and incomplete reporting of outcomes.'.",
