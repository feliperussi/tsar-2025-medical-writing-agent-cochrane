  "draft": "# Is silver diamine fluoride (a treatment that helps prevent tooth decay) effective in preventing and managing tooth decay in children and adults?\n**Key Messages**\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a treatment that helps prevent tooth decay) may help prevent new caries (tooth decay) in children and adults, but the evidence is uncertain, and it is unclear if it has any unwanted effects, such as staining of teeth (a change in tooth color).\n- The evidence is uncertain about whether silver diamine fluoride is better or worse than other treatments, like fluoride varnish (a coating applied to teeth to prevent decay), for preventing or managing tooth decay, and more research is needed to compare these treatments directly.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of silver diamine fluoride, measure the impact of tooth staining, and address the limitations of current research, such as the small number of participants and the short duration of the studies, to provide more reliable answers about its benefits and potential harms.\n**Introduction**\n## What is dental caries and why is it a problem?\nDental caries, also known as tooth decay, is the most prevalent disease worldwide. If left untreated, it can cause pain, negatively impact psychosocial health, functioning, and nutrition. Dental caries can affect both children and adults, and it is essential to find cost-effective and easy-to-use methods to prevent or arrest the disease. Common treatments for dental caries include fillings, crowns, and root canals, but these can be expensive and may not always be accessible to everyone.\n## What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for preventing and managing dental caries in primary and permanent teeth, compared to other interventions, including placebo or no treatment. They aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of SDF in preventing new caries, arresting existing caries, and preventing the progression of caries, as well as its potential adverse effects and impact on aesthetics.\n**Methods**\n## Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase) for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with other interventions for preventing and managing dental caries. The search included keywords and MeSH terms related to \"silver diamine fluoride\", \"dental caries\", \"prevention\", and \"management\" without language or date restrictions.\n## Eligibility Criteria\nStudies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, or cohort studies that directly compared silver diamine fluoride to another preventive or therapeutic dental caries intervention, reported relevant outcomes (e.g., caries incidence, arrest rates, adverse events), and provided sufficient data for extraction.\n## Study Selection and Data Extraction\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts against the eligibility criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Data extracted included study design, participant characteristics, intervention details, comparator details, follow‑up duration, and outcome measures.\n## Evidence Synthesis and Confidence Rating\nResults from included studies were summarized qualitatively and, where appropriate, pooled using random‑effects meta‑analysis. The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE approach, rating confidence as and when the evidence was high, moderate, low, or very low.\n**Results**\n## What did we find?\nWe found 29 studies that involved 13,036 people, including 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific locations were not detailed. Most studies compared silver diamine fluoride (SDF) with placebo or no treatment, while others compared different frequencies, concentrations, or durations of SDF, or SDF with other interventions like fluoride varnish, sealants, and resin infiltration, or atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) with glass ionomer cement (GIC) or GI material. The duration of the studies was not specified. The funding sources for the studies were not mentioned. The population characteristics included children and older adults, with or without carious lesions. The studies took place in different settings, but the specific details were not provided. We did not find any information on the comparison of SDF with other treatments for certain outcomes, and the evidence for adverse effects and aesthetics was very uncertain. Silver diamine fluoride may help prevent new caries in children and adults, but the evidence is uncertain. It probably helps prevent new root caries. Compared to fluoride varnish, silver diamine fluoride may offer little to no benefit in preventing new caries in children, but the evidence is very uncertain. The impact of silver diamine fluoride staining of teeth was poorly reported and the evidence for adverse effects is very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), incomplete reporting of outcomes of interest, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and methods of delivering the intervention.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft text has several issues that need to be addressed to improve its clarity and readability. Firstly, the text contains some unexplained jargon and technical terms without definitions, such as 'silver diamine fluoride' and 'dental caries', which may confuse readers who are not familiar with these terms. Secondly, there are some sentences that are longer than 30 words and are hard to follow, such as the first sentence in the introduction. Thirdly, the text lacks context in some places, leaving readers confused, for example the sentence 'The review authors wanted to assess the effects of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for preventing and managing dental caries in primary and permanent teeth, compared to other interventions, including placebo or no treatment.' does not provide enough information about what 'primary and permanent teeth' refers to. Lastly, the text contains some contradictory or unclear statements, such as 'Silver diamine fluoride may help prevent new caries in children and adults, but the evidence is uncertain.' which is unclear about what 'uncertain' means in this context. To address these issues, I suggest the following rewrites: 'Silver diamine fluoride is a treatment that helps prevent tooth decay.', 'Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, is a disease that affects both children and adults.', 'The review authors wanted to assess the effects of silver diamine fluoride for preventing and managing tooth decay in children and adults, compared to other treatments.', and 'The evidence suggests that silver diamine fluoride may help prevent new tooth decay in children and adults, but more research is needed to confirm this.' Additionally, the metrics show that the draft has 27 passive constructions, which contributes to the clarity issues noted above. The word count is within the limit, but some sentences are too long and need to be broken up. Overall, the draft needs significant revisions to improve its clarity and readability.",
