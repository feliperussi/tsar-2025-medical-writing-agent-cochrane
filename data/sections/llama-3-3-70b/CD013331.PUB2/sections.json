  "plain_title": "Can a treatment called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which uses electrical currents to relieve pain, help reduce menstrual cramps in women?",
  "key_messages": [
    "High-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (a non-pharmacological treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain) and low-frequency TENS may reduce menstrual cramp pain compared to placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no significant harmful effects were reported.",
    "The current evidence does not clearly show whether high-frequency TENS or low-frequency TENS is more effective for pain relief, or how they compare to other treatments like acupuncture or pain-relieving medications, highlighting the need for more research in this area.",
    "Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of TENS, compare different types of TENS, and examine outcomes such as the need for additional pain relief medications, impact on daily activities, and overall quality of life, to provide clearer guidance for women with menstrual cramps."

      "subheading": "What is primary dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Primary dysmenorrhoea, also known as period pain or menstrual cramps, is a common health condition that affects many women. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. The condition is usually treated with pharmacological treatments, but some women may prefer alternative, non-pharmacological treatments. One such alternative is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which works by delivering electrical currents via electrodes attached to the skin at the site of pain."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TENS in comparison with placebo, no treatment, and other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. They aimed to find out whether high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, or other treatments can reduce pain and improve outcomes for women with primary dysmenorrhoea, and to assess the certainty of the evidence for these comparisons."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 20 studies that involved 585 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies were conducted in various countries, with no specific information on the duration of the studies. The population characteristics included women aged 12 to 49 years. The studies compared high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, placebo, or no treatment, as well as other treatments such be acupressure, acetaminophen, and interferential current therapy. No information was available on the study funding sources or the settings in which the studies took place. High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. Low-frequency TENS may also reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. However, it is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared to low-frequency TENS or other treatments. The occurrence of adverse effects may not differ significantly between high-frequency TENS and other treatments."

  "limitations": "The studies may have suffered from lack of blinding, as participants could have known which treatment they received, and they were very small, limiting statistical power and generalizability.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024."
