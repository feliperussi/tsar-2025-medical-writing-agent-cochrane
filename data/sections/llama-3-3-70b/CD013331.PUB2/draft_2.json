  "draft": "Can a treatment called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which uses electrical currents to relieve pain, help reduce menstrual cramps in women?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- High-frequency TENS and low-frequency TENS may reduce menstrual cramp pain compared to a dummy treatment or no treatment. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. \n- We do not know if high-frequency TENS or low-frequency TENS is more effective for pain relief, or how they compare to other treatments like acupuncture or pain-relieving medications.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of TENS, compare different types of TENS, and examine outcomes such as the need for additional pain relief medications, impact on daily activities, and overall quality of life.\n\n**What is period pain?**\nPeriod pain, also known as menstrual cramps, is a common health condition that affects many women. It causes painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Women usually treat it with pharmacological treatments, but some may prefer alternative, non-pharmacological treatments. One such alternative is TENS, which works by delivering electrical currents via electrodes attached to the skin at the site of pain.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nWe wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TENS compared to a dummy treatment, no treatment, and other treatments for period pain. We aimed to find out if high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, or other treatments can reduce pain and improve outcomes for women with period pain. We also wanted to assess the certainty of the evidence for these comparisons.\n\n**How did we find the evidence?**\nWe searched for studies comparing TENS with other treatments for period pain. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 20 studies that involved 585 women with period pain. The studies compared high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, a dummy treatment, or no treatment, as well as other treatments like acupressure, acetaminophen, and interferential current therapy. High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared to a dummy treatment or no treatment. Low-frequency TENS may also reduce pain compared to a dummy treatment or no treatment. However, it is uncertain if high-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared to low-frequency TENS or other treatments.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nThe studies may have suffered from lack of blinding, as participants could have known which treatment they received. They were also very small, limiting statistical power and generalizability.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",
