  "draft": "# Can a treatment called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which uses electrical currents to relieve pain, help reduce menstrual cramps in women?\n**Key Messages**\n- High-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (a non-pharmacological treatment that uses electrical currents to relieve pain) and low-frequency TENS may reduce menstrual cramp pain compared to placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no significant harmful effects were reported.\n- The current evidence does not clearly show whether high-frequency TENS or low-frequency TENS is more effective for pain relief, or how they compare to other treatments like acupuncture or pain-relieving medications, highlighting the need for more research in this area.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of TENS, compare different types of TENS, and examine outcomes such as the need for additional pain relief medications, impact on daily activities, and overall quality of life, to provide clearer guidance for women with menstrual cramps.\n**Introduction**\n### What is primary dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea, also known as period pain or menstrual cramps, is a common health condition that affects many women. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. The condition is usually treated with pharmacological treatments, but some women may prefer alternative, non-pharmacological treatments. One such alternative is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which works by delivering electrical currents via electrodes attached to the skin at the site of pain.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TENS in comparison with placebo, no treatment, and other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea. They aimed to find out whether high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, or other treatments can reduce pain and improve outcomes for women with primary dysmenorrhoea, and to assess the certainty of the evidence for these comparisons.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing TENS with other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that involved 585 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies were conducted in various countries, with no specific information on the duration of the studies. The population characteristics included women aged 12 to 49 years. The studies compared high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS, placebo, or no treatment, as well as other treatments such as acupressure, acetaminophen, and interferential current therapy. No information was available on the study funding sources or the settings in which the studies took place. High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. Low-frequency TENS may also reduce pain compared to placebo or no treatment. However, it is uncertain whether high-frequency TENS has an effect on pain relief compared to low-frequency TENS or other treatments. The occurrence of adverse effects may not differ significantly between high-frequency TENS and other treatments.\n**Limitations**\nThe studies may have suffered from lack of blinding, as participants could have known which treatment they received, and they were very small, limiting statistical power and generalizability.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024.",

For example, the sentence 'Primary dysmenorrhoea, also known as period pain or menstrual cramps, is a common health condition that affects many women' could be simplified to 'What is period pain?' to better follow the subheadings format. Additionally, the sentence 'The review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TENS in comparison with placebo, no treatment, and other treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea' is hard to follow due to its length and could be broken up for better readability. The PLS evaluation results show significant deviations from typical patterns, including high nominalization, noun usage, and complex words, which contribute to the clarity issues. To improve, consider reducing nominalization from 27.0 to <13.0, nouns from 173.0 to <116.0, and complex words from 119.0 to <84.0.",
