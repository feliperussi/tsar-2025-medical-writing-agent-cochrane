  "draft": "For children with glue ear (fluid in the middle ear), what are the effects of using a special balloon to clear the ears (autoinflation)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is uncertain how much using a special balloon to clear the ears (a technique called autoinflation) helps children with glue ear (fluid in the middle ear). The treatment may improve quality of life and help the fluid to clear in the short term, but it may also cause some ear pain.\n- Better and larger studies are needed to understand the longer-term effects of this treatment on hearing, and to be more certain about its benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is 'glue ear' (otitis media with effusion)?\nOtitis media with effusion (OME), often called 'glue ear', is a common childhood condition where fluid collects in the middle ear behind the eardrum. This fluid can cause hearing loss. If the problem persists, it may lead to issues with a child's behaviour and language development. One possible treatment is 'autoinflation'. This is a technique where a child uses a special device, such as a nasal balloon, to blow air through their nose. The aim is to create pressure that helps open the tube connecting the middle ear to the back of the throat (the Eustachian tube), allowing the fluid to drain away.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective autoinflation is for treating glue ear in children. We were interested in both the benefits (such as improved hearing) and any potential harms (such as ear pain).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared autoinflation with no treatment or other treatments in children with fluid in the middle ear. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 11 studies with a total of 1036 children who had otitis media with effusion. The children were mostly between 3 and 11 years old. The studies were mainly conducted in Europe and North America, in both hospital and community settings. All studies compared various methods of autoinflation against no treatment. The treatment period in most studies lasted between 2 and 12 weeks, with outcomes assessed shortly after. The available evidence is not strong, so we have little confidence in the results. Autoinflation may improve a child's quality of life related to their ear problems and may slightly reduce the number of children with persistent fluid in the ear after 3 months. For every 1000 children with persistent fluid, about 89 fewer might have it if they used autoinflation. However, we do not know if autoinflation helps a child's hearing return to normal. Although pain was uncommon, it is also unclear if autoinflation increases the risk of ear pain. Families should weigh the possible benefits against the trouble of doing the procedure regularly.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

The 'NOT_APPROVED' grade is based on a consistent pattern of minor style issues that, if addressed, would make an already good summary even better for readers. There are no critical errors. My top three suggestions focus on making the language more direct and active.\n\n1. **Use more active verbs instead of noun forms (nominalizations).** The analysis shows a high number of noun-form verbs, which can make sentences feel abstract. Using the verb form is more direct.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"If the problem persists, it may lead to issues with a child's behaviour and language development.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"If the problem persists, it may affect a child's behaviour and how they develop language skills.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the finding on ear pain.** The current wording could seem contradictory to a reader.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"Although pain was uncommon, it is also unclear if autoinflation increases the risk of ear pain.\"\n   - **Problem:** This phrasing can be confusing. It's clearer to separate the low overall rate of pain from the uncertain *additional* risk from the treatment.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Overall, very few children in the studies had ear pain. However, the evidence was not clear enough for us to know if autoinflation adds to this risk.\"\n\n3. **Make the key statistic more direct.** The phrasing for the main finding on persistent fluid is slightly awkward.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"For every 1000 children with persistent fluid, about 89 fewer might have it if they used autoinflation.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This means that for every 1000 children with persistent fluid, treatment with autoinflation may result in 89 fewer children having the condition.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are excellent, with 15 of 18 metrics (83%) falling into the best quartile for readability and style, indicating high conformity with typical PLS patterns. However, one metric, 'nominalization' (the use of noun-form verbs), deviates significantly, scoring beyond the 90th percentile. This statistical outlier supports the editorial feedback to make the text more direct by using more active verbs where possible."
