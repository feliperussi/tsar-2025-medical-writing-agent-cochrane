  "draft": "For children with glue ear (fluid in the middle ear), what are the effects of using a special balloon to clear the ears (autoinflation)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is uncertain how much using a special balloon to clear the ears (a technique called autoinflation) helps children with glue ear (fluid in the middle ear). The treatment may improve quality of life and help the fluid to clear in the short term, but it may also cause some ear pain.\n- Better and larger studies are needed to understand the longer-term effects of this treatment on hearing, and to be more certain about its benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is 'glue ear' (otitis media with effusion)?\nOtitis media with effusion (OME), often called 'glue ear', is a common childhood condition where fluid collects in the middle ear behind the eardrum. This fluid can cause hearing loss. If the problem persists, it may affect a child's behaviour and how they develop language skills. One possible treatment is 'autoinflation'. This is a technique where a child uses a special device, such as a nasal balloon, to blow air through their nose. This technique creates pressure that helps open the tube connecting the middle ear to the back of the throat (the Eustachian tube), allowing the fluid to drain away.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective autoinflation is for treating glue ear in children. We were interested in both the benefits (such as improved hearing) and any potential harms (such as ear pain).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared autoinflation with no treatment or other treatments in children with fluid in the middle ear. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 11 studies with a total of 1036 children who had otitis media with effusion. The children were mostly between 3 and 11 years old. The studies were mainly conducted in Europe and North America, in both hospital and community settings. All studies compared various methods of autoinflation against no treatment. The treatment period in most studies lasted between 2 and 12 weeks, with outcomes assessed shortly after. The available evidence is not strong, so we have little confidence in the results. Autoinflation may improve a child's quality of life related to their ear problems and may slightly reduce the number of children with persistent fluid in the ear after 3 months. For every 1000 children with persistent fluid, autoinflation may lead to 89 fewer children having the condition. However, we do not know if autoinflation helps a child's hearing return to normal. Overall, very few children in the studies had ear pain. However, the evidence was not clear enough for us to know if autoinflation adds to this risk. Families should weigh the possible benefits against the trouble of doing the procedure regularly.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and meets most of our guidelines. However, a few key improvements will make it even easier for readers to understand. The main issue is the frequent use of noun phrases where direct verbs would be simpler and more active. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which shows a very high number of 'nominalizations'.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** The text often uses noun forms of verbs (e.g., 'assessment of outcomes' instead of 'assessing outcomes'), which can make sentences feel dense and less direct.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"The treatment period in most studies lasted between 2 and 12 weeks, with outcomes assessed shortly after.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** This is a bit abstract and uses passive voice. It's clearer to state who did the action.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"In most studies, researchers checked the results shortly after the 2- to 12-week treatment period ended.\"\n\n2.  **Clarify the potential risk of ear pain.** The current phrasing about ear pain is slightly vague and may downplay a potential harm mentioned in the original abstract.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"However, the evidence was not clear enough for us to know if autoinflation adds to this risk.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The original abstract notes a potential increased risk (RR 3.50), even if the evidence is very uncertain. The current wording softens this a little too much.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"While few children in the studies had ear pain, the evidence suggested autoinflation might increase this risk. However, we cannot be certain because the evidence was not strong.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify wordy phrasing for better flow.** Some sentences can be made more concise, which helps readers to process information more easily.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"For every 1000 children with persistent fluid, autoinflation may lead to 89 fewer children having the condition.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The ending, \"having the condition,\" is slightly clunky and could be more direct.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"This means that for every 1000 children with persistent fluid, 89 fewer might have it if they use autoinflation.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability, sentence length, and active voice. However, the analysis identified two significant deviations: the count of 'nouns' is high (P90 range), and the use of 'nominalization' (noun-form verbs) is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90). The recommendation to reduce nominalizations from 29 to a typical level below 13 supports the editorial feedback to use more direct, active verbs."
