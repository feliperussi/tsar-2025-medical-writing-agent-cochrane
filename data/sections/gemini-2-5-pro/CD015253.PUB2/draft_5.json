  "draft": "For children with glue ear (fluid in the middle ear), what are the effects of using a special balloon to clear the ears (autoinflation)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is uncertain how much using a special balloon to clear the ears (a technique called autoinflation) helps children with glue ear (fluid in the middle ear). The treatment may improve quality of life and help the fluid to clear in the short term, but it may also cause some ear pain.\n- Better and larger studies are needed to understand the longer-term effects of this treatment on hearing, and to be more certain about its benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is 'glue ear' (otitis media with effusion)?\nOtitis media with effusion (OME), often called 'glue ear', is a common childhood condition where fluid collects in the middle ear behind the eardrum. This fluid can cause hearing loss. If the problem persists, it may affect a child's behaviour and how they develop language skills. One possible treatment is 'autoinflation'. This is a technique where a child uses a special device, such as a nasal balloon, to blow air through their nose. This technique creates pressure that helps open the tube connecting the middle ear to the back of the throat (the Eustachian tube), allowing the fluid to drain away.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective autoinflation is for treating glue ear in children. We were interested in both the benefits (such as improved hearing) and any potential harms (such as ear pain).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared autoinflation with no treatment or other treatments in children with fluid in the middle ear. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 11 studies with a total of 1036 children who had otitis media with effusion. The children were mostly between 3 and 11 years old. The studies were mainly conducted in Europe and North America, in both hospital and community settings. All studies compared various methods of autoinflation against no treatment. In most studies, children used the treatment for 2 to 12 weeks, and researchers checked the results shortly after.\n\nAutoinflation may improve a child's quality of life related to their ear problems and may slightly reduce the number of children with persistent fluid in the ear after 3 months. This means that for every 1000 children with persistent fluid, 89 fewer might have it if they use autoinflation. However, we do not know if autoinflation helps a child's hearing return to normal.\n\nAlthough ear pain was uncommon, it may be more likely with autoinflation. About 4 in 100 children using it reported ear pain, compared to about 1 in 100 children who had no treatment. However, we cannot be certain because the evidence was not strong. Families should weigh the possible benefits against the inconvenience of performing the treatment regularly.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and factually accurate. The readability scores are excellent. I am recommending 'NOT_APPROVED' not because of major flaws, but to encourage a few final refinements that will make it even more direct and accessible for readers. Here are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Clarify the uncertainty around ear pain.** The current wording slightly downplays the very low certainty of this specific finding.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"However, we cannot be certain because the evidence was not strong.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The original abstract describes the evidence for this specific harm as 'very low-certainty'. Simply saying it was 'not strong' doesn't fully convey this high level of uncertainty to the reader.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"However, this evidence is very uncertain, so we cannot be sure of this effect.\"\n\n2. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases (nominalizations).** The text sometimes uses formal noun constructions where a simple verb would be clearer and more direct. This is reflected in the high nominalization score.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"Families should weigh the possible benefits against the inconvenience of performing the treatment regularly.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** Phrases like \"inconvenience of performing\" are abstract and less engaging than active verbs. They make the text feel more academic.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Families should weigh the possible benefits against the trouble of doing the treatment regularly.\"\n\n3. **Simplify the description of the methods.** The language in the methods section could be made slightly more accessible for a lay audience.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"rated our confidence in the evidence\" is jargon. A simpler description of the process would be more helpful for readers.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We compared and summarized the results from the studies. We also assessed how reliable the evidence was.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. Sentence length, use of active voice, and readability scores are all excellent. The single significant deviation is in 'nominalization' (the use of noun forms of verbs), which is beyond the 90th percentile. This suggests that while the text is easy to read, it could be made more direct by converting some noun phrases back into simple verbs, as highlighted in the feedback."
