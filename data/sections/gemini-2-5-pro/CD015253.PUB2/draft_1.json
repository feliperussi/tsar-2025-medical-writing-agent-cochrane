  "draft": "For children with glue ear (fluid in the middle ear), what are the effects of using a special balloon to clear the ears (autoinflation)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is uncertain how much using a special balloon to clear the ears (a technique called autoinflation) helps children with glue ear (fluid in the middle ear). The treatment may improve quality of life and help the fluid to clear in the short term, but it may also cause some ear pain.\n- Better and larger studies are needed to understand the longer-term effects of this treatment on hearing, and to be more certain about its benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is 'glue ear' (otitis media with effusion)?\nOtitis media with effusion (OME), often called 'glue ear', is a common childhood condition where fluid collects in the middle ear behind the eardrum. This fluid can cause hearing loss. If the problem persists, it may lead to issues with a child's behaviour and language development. One possible treatment is 'autoinflation'. This is a technique where a child uses a special device, such as a nasal balloon, to blow air through their nose. The aim is to create pressure that helps open the tube connecting the middle ear to the back of the throat (the Eustachian tube), allowing the fluid to drain away.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective autoinflation is for treating glue ear in children. We were interested in both the benefits (such as improved hearing) and any potential harms (such as ear pain).\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared autoinflation with no treatment or other treatments in children with fluid in the middle ear. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 11 studies with a total of 1036 children who had otitis media with effusion. The children were mostly between 3 and 11 years old. The studies were mainly conducted in Europe and North America, in both hospital and community settings. All studies compared various methods of autoinflation against no treatment. The treatment period in most studies lasted between 2 and 12 weeks, with outcomes assessed shortly after. The available evidence is not strong, so we have little confidence in the results. Autoinflation may improve a child's quality of life related to their ear problems and may slightly reduce the number of children with persistent fluid in the ear after three months. For every 1000 children with persistent fluid, about 89 fewer might have it if they used autoinflation. However, we do not know if autoinflation helps a child's hearing return to normal. Although the overall occurrence of pain was low, it is also unclear if autoinflation increases the risk of ear pain. Any potential benefits should be weighed against the inconvenience of regularly carrying out the procedure.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search.",

However, it is not approved because it requires a few important revisions to meet Cochrane style guidelines and improve clarity for readers.\n\n**1.

This makes the summary harder for readers to scan and understand the purpose of each section.\n- **Current:** \"Methods\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\"\n- **Suggestion:** \"How did we conduct this review?\", \"How reliable is this evidence?\", \"How up to date is this evidence?\"\n\n**2. Replace noun-heavy phrases with verbs (reduce nominalizations):** The summary often uses noun forms of verbs, which can make sentences less direct and more abstract for readers. The linguistic analysis confirms this is a key area for improvement.\n- **Example 1:** \"Although the overall **occurrence** of pain was low...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"Occurrence\" is a formal noun. Using a simple verb is more direct.\n- **Suggestion:** \"Although pain was uncommon...\" or \"Although pain did not happen often...\"\n- **Example 2:** \"Any potential benefits should be weighed against the **inconvenience** of regularly carrying out the procedure.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"Inconvenience\" is an abstract noun. Describing the action is clearer.\n- **Suggestion:** \"Families should weigh the possible benefits against the trouble of doing the procedure regularly.\"\n\n**3. Clarify the final sentence:** The currency statement ends with an awkward, ungrammatical phrase that will confuse readers.\n- **Current:** \"The evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search.\"\n- **Suggestion:** \"This evidence is up to date to January 2023.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. Sentence length, word choice, and use of active voice are all excellent. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the rate of 'nominalization' (using nouns instead of verbs) is beyond the 90th percentile. This confirms the editorial finding that the text could be made more direct and easier to read by converting these noun-heavy phrases back into verb-driven actions."
