  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is uncertain how much using a special balloon to clear the ears (a technique called autoinflation) helps children with glue ear (fluid in the middle ear). The treatment may improve quality of life and help the fluid to clear in the short term, but it may also cause some ear pain.",
    "Better and larger studies are needed to understand the longer-term effects of this treatment on hearing, and to be more certain about its benefits and potential harms."

      "subheading": "What is 'glue ear' (otitis media with effusion)?",
      "content": "Otitis media with effusion (OME), often called 'glue ear', is a common childhood condition where fluid collects in the middle ear behind the eardrum. This fluid can cause hearing loss. If the problem persists, it may lead to issues with a child's behaviour and language development. One possible treatment is 'autoinflation'. This is a technique where a child uses a special device, such as a nasal balloon, to blow air through their nose. The aim is to create pressure that helps open the tube connecting the middle ear to the back of the throat (the Eustachian tube), allowing the fluid to drain away."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 11 studies with a total of 1036 children who had otitis media with effusion. The children were mostly between 3 and 11 years old. The studies were mainly conducted in Europe and North America, in both hospital and community settings. All studies compared various methods of autoinflation against no treatment. The treatment period in most studies lasted between 2 and 12 weeks, with outcomes assessed shortly after. The available evidence is not strong, so we have little confidence in the results. Autoinflation may improve a child's quality of life related to their ear problems and may slightly reduce the number of children with persistent fluid in the ear after three months. For every 1000 children with persistent fluid, about 89 fewer might have it if they used autoinflation. However, we do not know if autoinflation helps a child's hearing return to normal. Although the overall occurrence of pain was low, it is also unclear if autoinflation increases the risk of ear pain. Any potential benefits should be weighed against the inconvenience of regularly carrying out the procedure."
