  "draft": "For children with glue ear (fluid in the middle ear), what are the effects of using a special balloon to clear the ears (autoinflation)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is uncertain how much using a special balloon to clear the ears (a technique called autoinflation) helps children with glue ear (fluid in the middle ear). The treatment may improve quality of life and help the fluid to clear in the short term, but it may also cause some ear pain.\n- Better and larger studies are needed to understand the longer-term effects of this treatment on hearing, and to be more certain about its benefits and potential harms.\n\nWhat is 'glue ear' (otitis media with effusion)?\nOtitis media with effusion (OME), often called 'glue ear', is a common childhood condition where fluid collects in the middle ear behind the eardrum. This fluid can cause hearing loss. If the problem persists, it may affect a child's behaviour and how they develop language skills. One possible treatment is 'autoinflation'. This is a technique where a child uses a special device, such as a nasal balloon, to blow air through their nose. This technique creates pressure that helps open the tube connecting the middle ear to the back of the throat (the Eustachian tube), allowing the fluid to drain away.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective autoinflation is for treating glue ear in children. We were interested in both the benefits (such as improved hearing) and any potential harms (such as ear pain).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared autoinflation with no treatment or other treatments in children with fluid in the middle ear. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 11 studies with a total of 1036 children who had otitis media with effusion. The children were mostly between 3 and 11 years old. The studies were mainly conducted in Europe and North America, in both hospital and community settings. All studies compared various methods of autoinflation against no treatment. In most studies, children used the treatment for 2 to 12 weeks, and researchers checked the results shortly after.\n\nThe available evidence is not strong, so we have little confidence in the results. Autoinflation may improve a child's quality of life related to their ear problems and may slightly reduce the number of children with persistent fluid in the ear after 3 months. This means that for every 1000 children with persistent fluid, 89 fewer might have it if they use autoinflation. However, we do not know if autoinflation helps a child's hearing return to normal.\n\nWhile few children in the studies had ear pain, the evidence suggested autoinflation might increase this risk. However, we cannot be certain because the evidence was not strong. Families should weigh the possible benefits against the trouble of doing the procedure regularly.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

To make it even better for readers, I recommend three improvements.\n\n1. **Make the numbers for benefits and harms more concrete.** Readers need specific numbers to understand the trade-offs.\n   - **Instead of:** 'While few children in the studies had ear pain, the evidence suggested autoinflation might increase this risk.'\n   - **Consider this:** 'Although ear pain was uncommon, it may be more likely with autoinflation. About 4 in 100 children using it reported ear pain, compared to about 1 in 100 children who had no treatment.'\n\n2. **Strengthen sentences by using verbs instead of noun phrases.** The draft has a high number of 'nominalizations' (29 instances), which can make sentences feel passive and wordy.\n   - **Instead of:** 'Families should weigh the possible benefits against the trouble of doing the procedure regularly.'\n   - **Consider this:** 'Families should weigh the possible benefits against the inconvenience of performing the treatment regularly.'\n\n3. **Improve the structure by removing redundancy.** The conclusion about the low quality of evidence is stated twice in a row.\n   - **In the 'What did we find?' section, please remove this sentence:** 'The available evidence is not strong, so we have little confidence in the results.'\n   - **Reason:** This point is explained more thoroughly in the very next section, 'How reliable is this evidence?', so stating it here is unnecessary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features in the best quartile. Most readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 8.0) and structural metrics (e.g., words per sentence at 17.2) are excellent. However, the analysis flags a significant deviation in the use of nominalizations (noun forms of verbs), which is much higher than typical, and a related high count of nouns. This suggests the text could be made more direct by using more active verbs."
