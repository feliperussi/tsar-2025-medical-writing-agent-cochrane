  "draft": "Can topical repellents (insect repellents applied to the skin) prevent malaria?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of strong evidence, it is uncertain if applying insect repellents to the skin prevents malaria, especially when other protective measures (such as insecticide-treated bed nets) are used. The repellents appeared to be safe, with only rare and mild skin reactions reported.\n- Insect repellents applied to the skin might slightly reduce malaria cases in high-risk groups, such as refugees, who may not have access to other malaria prevention methods.\n- Better studies are needed to find out if skin repellents provide personal protection against malaria, particularly for high-risk groups like refugees who may not have access to other prevention methods.\n\nWhy look for new ways to prevent malaria?\nMalaria is a serious illness spread by mosquito bites. The most common ways to prevent it are using bed nets treated with insect-killing spray (insecticide) and spraying insecticide on the inside walls of homes. However, these methods mainly protect people when they are indoors and sleeping. They do not protect people who are outdoors, especially in the evening or early morning when mosquitoes are active. Some groups, such as refugees, soldiers, or people who work in forests, may be at higher risk and may not have access to nets or sprayed homes. This means there is a need for other ways to protect people from mosquito bites.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using topical repellents (creams or sprays applied to the skin to keep mosquitoes away) helps prevent people from getting malaria in areas where the disease is common. We looked at whether using repellents on their own or with other methods (like bed nets) reduced the number of new malaria cases. We were also interested in how repellents affected different groups of people, including those at high risk of infection.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched for studies that tested if topical repellents prevent malaria.\n\nHow did we analyze the evidence?\nWe combined the results from the studies to get an overall picture of the evidence.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence, considering how the studies were conducted.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies with a total of 61,651 people. The studies focused on high-risk groups (such as refugees, soldiers, and people who work in forests) as well as other people living in areas where malaria is common. 2 of the studies took place in refugee camps. We looked at studies where people used topical repellents either on their own or with other malaria prevention methods, like insecticide-treated nets. Topical repellents may slightly reduce the number of new malaria cases. They may also reduce the number of people who have malaria at any given time. This possible benefit was mainly seen in high-risk groups, such as refugees, who might not have access to other malaria prevention tools. There is not enough evidence to know if topical repellents are helpful in places where other prevention methods, like bed nets, are already being used. Topical repellents appear to be safe, as very few users reported mild skin reactions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, not all studies provided the data we were looking for.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to January 2023.",

The following suggestions are aimed at making it even easier for readers to understand.\n\n1. **Make the 'Methods' section more informative.** The current descriptions are very general and don't give a clear picture of what the review authors did. Explaining the process in simple terms builds trust with the reader.\n    - **Instead of:** 'We combined the results from the studies to get an overall picture of the evidence.'\n    - **Consider:** 'We compared and combined the results from the studies (a method called meta-analysis) to see what the overall evidence shows.'\n    - **Instead of:** 'We rated our confidence in the evidence, considering how the studies were conducted.'\n    - **Consider:** 'We used a standard method called GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence, based on how the studies were designed and carried out.'\n\n2. **Use more active, verb-driven sentences.** Some sentences are heavy with nouns, which can make them slightly harder to process. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which noted a high number of nouns.\n    - **Instead of:** 'The most common ways to prevent it are using bed nets treated with insect-killing spray (insecticide) and spraying insecticide on the inside walls of homes.'\n    - **Consider:** 'People most commonly prevent malaria by using bed nets treated with insecticide and by spraying insecticide on the inside walls of their homes.'\n\n3. **Remove redundant phrases to improve conciseness.** In the 'Why look for new ways to prevent malaria?' section, the final sentence can be removed to make the paragraph more direct.\n    - **The sentence:** 'This means there is a need for other ways to protect people from mosquito bites.'\n    - **Is not needed because** the previous sentence already establishes this need. Removing it makes the paragraph flow better.\n\n4. **Correct a typo in a subheading.**\n    - **The subheading:** 'How did we confident are we in the evidence?'\n    - **Should be:** 'How confident are we in the evidence?'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. The readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9.1) are excellent. The analysis identified two minor deviations: a high number of nouns (`nouns` at P90) and a high number of less-common words (`complex_words_dc` at P90). These metrics support the editorial suggestions to use more active, verb-driven sentences and to simplify language where possible, particularly in the methods section."
