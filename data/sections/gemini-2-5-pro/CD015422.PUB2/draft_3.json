  "draft": "Can topical repellents (insect repellents applied to the skin) prevent malaria?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of strong evidence, it is uncertain if applying insect repellents to the skin prevents malaria, especially when other protective measures (such as insecticide-treated bed nets) are used. The repellents appeared to be safe, with only rare and mild skin reactions reported.\n- Insect repellents applied to the skin might slightly reduce malaria cases in high-risk groups, such as refugees, who may not have access to other malaria prevention methods.\n- Better studies are needed to find out if skin repellents provide personal protection against malaria, particularly for high-risk groups like refugees who may not have access to other prevention methods.\n\nWhy look for new ways to prevent malaria?\nMalaria is a serious illness spread by mosquito bites. People most commonly prevent malaria by using bed nets treated with insecticide (an insect-killing spray) and by spraying insecticide on the inside walls of their homes. However, these methods mainly protect people when they are indoors and sleeping. They do not protect people who are outdoors, especially in the evening or early morning when mosquitoes are active. Some groups, such as refugees, soldiers, or people who work in forests, may be at higher risk and may not have access to nets or sprayed homes.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using topical repellents (creams or sprays applied to the skin to keep mosquitoes away) helps prevent people from getting malaria in areas where the disease is common. We looked at whether using repellents on their own or with other methods (like bed nets) reduced the number of new malaria cases. We were also interested in how repellents affected different groups of people, including those at high risk of infection.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched for studies that tested if topical repellents prevent malaria.\n\nHow did we analyze the evidence?\nWe compared and combined the results from the studies (a method called meta-analysis) to see what the overall evidence shows.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe used a standard method called GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence, based on how the studies were designed and carried out.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies with a total of 61,651 people. The studies focused on high-risk groups (such as refugees, soldiers, and people who work in forests) as well as other people living in areas where malaria is common. 2 of the studies took place in refugee camps.\n\nWe looked at studies where people used topical repellents either on their own or with other malaria prevention methods, like insecticide-treated nets. Topical repellents may slightly reduce the number of new malaria cases. They may also reduce the number of people who have malaria at any given time.\n\nThis possible benefit was mainly seen in high-risk groups, such as refugees, who might not have access to other malaria prevention tools. There is not enough evidence to know if topical repellents are helpful in places where other prevention methods, like bed nets, are already being used. Topical repellents appear to be safe, as very few users reported mild skin reactions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, not all studies provided the data we were looking for.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear and factually accurate. However, a few revisions would make it even easier for readers to understand. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify complex and noun-heavy language.** The summary uses more complex and long words than a typical PLS, which can slow readers down. Focus on using simpler, more common words and direct verbs.\n   - **INSTEAD OF:** 'This possible benefit was mainly seen in high-risk groups, such as refugees, who might not have access to other malaria prevention tools.'\n   - **CONSIDER:** 'This effect was mainly seen in high-risk groups, like refugees, who might not have other ways to prevent malaria.'\n   - **INSTEAD OF:** 'People most commonly prevent malaria by using bed nets treated with insecticide (an insect-killing spray) and by spraying insecticide on the inside walls of their homes.'\n   - **CONSIDER:** 'The most common ways to prevent malaria are using bed nets treated with an insect-killing spray (insecticide) and spraying it on the inside walls of homes.'\n\n2. **Combine the short methods paragraphs for better flow.** The three single-sentence paragraphs in the methods section feel disconnected. Combining them under a single heading would create a smoother narrative for the reader.\n   - **INSTEAD OF:**\n     'How did we find the studies?\n     We searched for studies that tested if topical repellents prevent malaria.\n\n     How did we analyze the evidence?\n     We compared and combined the results from the studies (a method called meta-analysis) to see what the overall evidence shows.\n\n     How confident are we in the evidence?\n     We used a standard method called GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence, based on how the studies were designed and carried out.'\n   - **CONSIDER combining these under a single heading like 'How we conducted this review':** 'We searched for studies that tested if topical repellents prevent malaria. We then compared and combined the results from the different studies (a method called meta-analysis) and used a standard method called GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence.'\n\n3. **Reduce repetition when describing high-risk groups.** The examples of high-risk groups (refugees, soldiers, forest workers) are listed multiple times. It's clearer for the reader if you define them once in the introduction and then refer to them more simply later on.\n   - **INSTEAD OF repeating the full list in the results section:** 'We found 8 studies... The studies focused on high-risk groups (such as refugees, soldiers, and people who work in forests)...'\n   - **CONSIDER:** After defining the groups in the introduction, you can simply say 'The studies focused on these high-risk groups as well as other people living in areas where malaria is common.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your draft is very readable in the sentence length. The main opportunity for improvement is in word choice, which is reflected in the linguistic analysis showing higher-than-typical counts for nouns, complex words, and long words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable in terms of sentence structure, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary, with higher-than-usual counts for nouns (173), complex words from the Dale-Chall list (236), and long words (166). This suggests the text could be simplified by using more common words and active verbs."
