  "draft": "Can topical repellents (insect repellents applied to the skin) prevent malaria?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of strong evidence, it is uncertain if applying insect repellents to the skin prevents malaria, especially when other protective measures (such as insecticide-treated bed nets) are used. The repellents appeared to be safe, with only rare and mild skin reactions reported.\n- Insect repellents applied to the skin might slightly reduce malaria cases in high-risk groups, such as refugees, who might not have other ways to prevent malaria.\n- Better studies are needed to find out if skin repellents provide personal protection against malaria, particularly for high-risk groups like refugees who may have few other ways to prevent it.\n\nWhy look for new ways to prevent malaria?\nMalaria is a serious illness spread by mosquito bites. The most common ways to prevent malaria are using bed nets treated with an insect-killing spray (insecticide) and spraying it on the inside walls of homes. However, these methods mainly protect people when they are indoors and sleeping. They do not protect people who are outdoors, especially in the evening or early morning when mosquitoes are active. Some groups, such as refugees, soldiers, or people who work in forests, may be at higher risk and may not be able to use nets or sprayed homes.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using topical repellents (creams or sprays applied to the skin to keep mosquitoes away) helps prevent people from getting malaria in areas where the disease is common. We looked at whether using repellents on their own or with other ways to prevent malaria (like bed nets) reduced the number of new malaria cases. We were also interested in how repellents affected different groups of people, including those at high risk of infection.\n\nHow we conducted this review\nWe searched for studies that tested if topical repellents prevent malaria. We then compared and combined the results from the different studies (a method called meta-analysis) and used a standard method called GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies with a total of 61,651 people. The studies focused on these high-risk groups as well as other people living in areas where malaria is common. 2 of the studies took place in refugee camps.\n\nWe looked at studies where people used topical repellents either on their own or with other ways to prevent malaria, like insecticide-treated nets. Topical repellents may slightly reduce the number of new malaria cases. They may also reduce the number of people who have malaria at any given time.\n\nThis effect was mainly seen in high-risk groups, like refugees, who might not have other ways to prevent malaria. There is not enough evidence to know if topical repellents are helpful in places where other ways to prevent malaria, like bed nets, are already being used. Topical repellents appear to be safe, as very few users reported mild skin reactions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, not all studies provided the data we were looking for.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear and well-structured. However, a few revisions will make it even more accessible to readers. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify the methods description.** The current phrasing is a bit technical for a lay audience and introduces jargon without a clear benefit to the reader.\n    - **Current text:** 'We then compared and combined the results from the different studies (a method called meta-analysis) and used a standard method called GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence.'\n    - **Suggestion:** 'We compared and combined the results of the studies. We then used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.'\n\n2. **Explain the 'why' behind the limitations.** Help the reader understand why a particular study design element is a weakness, rather than just stating the fact.\n    - **Current text:** 'This is because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting.'\n    - **Suggestion:** 'Our confidence is low because in some studies, participants knew they were using a repellent. This knowledge might have changed their behaviour or how they reported symptoms, which could affect the results.'\n\n3. **Use consistent terminology for key concepts.** Using the same term for the same concept throughout the summary reduces the reader's cognitive load.\n    - **Current text:** You use 'insecticide-treated bed nets' in the Key Messages but 'bed nets treated with an insect-killing spray (insecticide)' in the introduction.\n    - **Suggestion:** Define the term once in the introduction (e.g., '...bed nets treated with an insecticide (an insect-killing spray)...') and then use the shorter, consistent term 'insecticide-treated nets' for the rest of the summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and structure. However, the analysis identified one deviation: the number of Dale-Chall complex (unfamiliar) words is high (219), falling into the P90 range. This suggests that while sentence structure is simple, the vocabulary could be simplified further by replacing or explaining technical terms like 'meta-analysis' and 'GRADE', which aligns with the recommended editorial feedback."
