  "draft": "Can topical repellents (insect repellents applied to the skin) prevent malaria?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is uncertain if applying insect repellents to the skin prevents malaria, especially when other protective measures (such as insecticide-treated bed nets) are used. The repellents appeared to be safe, with only rare and mild skin reactions reported.\n- Insect repellents applied to the skin might slightly reduce malaria cases in high-risk groups, such as refugees, who may not have access to other malaria prevention methods.\n- Better studies are needed to find out if skin repellents provide personal protection against malaria, particularly for high-risk groups like refugees who may not have access to other prevention methods.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhy look for new ways to prevent malaria?\nMalaria is a serious illness spread by mosquito bites. The most common ways to prevent it are using bed nets treated with insect-killing spray (insecticide) and spraying insecticide on the inside walls of homes. However, these methods mainly protect people when they are indoors and sleeping. They do not protect people who are outdoors, especially in the evening or early morning when mosquitoes are active. Some groups, such as refugees, soldiers, or people who work in forests, may be at higher risk and may not have access to nets or sprayed homes. This means there is a need for other ways to protect people from mosquito bites.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using topical repellents (creams or sprays applied to the skin to keep mosquitoes away) helps prevent people from getting malaria in areas where the disease is common. We looked at whether using repellents on their own or in combination with other methods (like bed nets) reduced the number of new malaria cases. We were also interested in the effect on different groups of people, including those at high risk of infection.\n\nMethods\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched for studies that examined the effect of topical repellents on malaria prevention.\n\nData Synthesis\nWe combined the results of these studies using meta‑analysis techniques.\n\nConfidence Assessment\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included eight studies with a total of 61,651 participants. The studies focused on high-risk populations, such as refugees, military personnel, and forest goers, as well as non-high-risk populations in malaria-endemic areas. Two of the studies were conducted specifically in refugee camps. The review examined the use of topical repellents, both on their own and in combination with other malaria control methods like insecticide-treated nets or indoor spraying. Topical repellents may slightly reduce the number of new malaria cases and the number of people who have malaria at a given time. This potential benefit was mainly seen in high-risk groups, such as refugees, who might not have access to other malaria prevention tools. There is not enough evidence to know if topical repellents are helpful in places where other prevention methods, like bed nets, are already being used. Topical repellents appear to be safe, with very few users experiencing mild skin reactions.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nEvidence currency statement\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft conforms well to many typical PLS patterns, particularly in readability scores and sentence length, with 67% of features falling in the best quartile. However, the analysis also highlights significant deviation in four key areas: nominalization (P90), total nouns (P90), complex words from the Dale-Chall list (P90), and long words (P90). These metrics support the editorial feedback, indicating that the text relies more heavily on formal, noun-based phrasing and complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
