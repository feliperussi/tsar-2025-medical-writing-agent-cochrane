It is a common condition in women that can have a major impact on health and daily life. One treatment is a 'single-incision sling' operation. This is a minimally-invasive surgery where a surgeon places a short piece of synthetic tape under the tube that carries urine from the bladder (the urethra) to provide support and prevent leakage. However, the use of this type of synthetic mesh for gynaecological problems is restricted in many countries.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well single-incision sling operations work for treating urinary incontinence in women. We also wanted to understand the risks and summarise what is known about the cost-effectiveness of the procedure compared to other treatments.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that directly compared single‑incision slings with other sling procedures used to treat urinary incontinence in women. Eligible reports included randomized controlled trials and comparative observational studies. Relevant outcomes from the eligible studies were extracted and pooled using meta‑analysis where appropriate. Effect sizes were combined with a random‑effects model, and heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic. The certainty of the pooled evidence was appraised using the GRADE framework, taking into account risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThis review included 62 studies involving 8051 women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. The studies compared single-incision slings against other surgical options, mainly transobturator slings (51 studies) and retropubic slings (10 studies).\n\nWhen compared with transobturator slings, single-incision slings probably reduce long-term pain and problems with emptying the bladder after surgery. However, they make little to no difference to incontinence improvement and may reduce a person's quality of life.\n\nWhen compared with retropubic slings, single-incision slings may make little to no difference to incontinence improvement. For many outcomes, including the need for repeat surgery, the effect of single-incision slings is unclear when compared to either type of sling.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in some of the evidence because of concerns about how the studies were conducted. In addition, some of the evidence is based on a small number of studies, and does not cover the longer-term outcomes that are important to women.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

First, the 'Key messages' section is missing and contains placeholder text; this essential summary must be written based on the review's findings. Second, the 'What did we do?' (methods) section is filled with technical jargon (e.g., 'meta‑analysis', 'heterogeneity', 'GRADE framework') that is inappropriate for a lay audience and must be rewritten in simple terms. For example, instead of 'The certainty of the pooled evidence was appraised using the GRADE framework...', try 'We rated our confidence in the evidence using a system called GRADE.' This rewrite also addresses the high number of passive constructions (23 instances) and nominalizations (23 instances) identified in the linguistic analysis, which make the text feel overly formal and difficult to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to typical patterns in many areas, with 72% of features falling in the best quartile for readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 10.5). However, it deviates significantly in two key areas: passive voice (23 instances, P90) and nominalization (23 instances, P90). These high numbers reflect the overly technical and academic language used in the methods section, which requires simplification."
