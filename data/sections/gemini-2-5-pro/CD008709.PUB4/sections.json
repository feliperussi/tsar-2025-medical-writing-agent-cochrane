      "content": "Stress urinary incontinence is when urine leaks out during moments of physical pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or exercising. It is a common condition in women that can have a major impact on health and daily life. One treatment is a 'single-incision sling' operation. This is a minimally-invasive surgery where a surgeon places a short piece of synthetic tape under the tube that carries urine from the bladder (the urethra) to provide support and prevent leakage. However, the use of this type of synthetic mesh for gynaecological problems is restricted in many countries."

      "content": "This review included 62 studies involving 8051 women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. The studies compared single-incision slings against other surgical options, mainly transobturator slings (51 studies) and retropubic slings (10 studies).\n\nWhen compared with transobturator slings, single-incision slings probably reduce long-term pain and problems with emptying the bladder after surgery. However, they make little to no difference to incontinence improvement and may reduce a person's quality of life.\n\nWhen compared with retropubic slings, single-incision slings may make little to no difference to incontinence improvement. For many outcomes, including the need for repeat surgery, the effect of single-incision slings is unclear when compared to either type of sling."
