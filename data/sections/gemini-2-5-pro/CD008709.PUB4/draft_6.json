  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women?\n\nKey messages\n\n- Single-incision slings likely improve urinary incontinence as much as other common sling operations (transobturator and retropubic slings) in the short term.\n- Compared to transobturator slings, single-incision slings probably cause less long-term pain and fewer problems emptying the bladder, but may lead to a lower quality of life.\n- We are uncertain about the long-term effects of single-incision slings, including whether women might need another operation, because there is not enough long-term evidence.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and what are single-incision slings?\nStress urinary incontinence is when urine leaks out during moments of physical pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or exercising. It is a common condition in women that can greatly affect their health and daily life. One way to treat this is with an operation called a 'single-incision sling'. This is a minimally-invasive surgery where a surgeon places a short piece of synthetic tape under the tube that carries urine from the bladder (the urethra) to support it and prevent leaks. However, many countries restrict the use of this type of synthetic mesh for women's health problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well single-incision sling operations work for women with urinary incontinence. We also wanted to understand their risks and compare their costs and benefits to other treatments.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared single-incision slings with other treatments for urinary incontinence in women. We focused on studies called 'randomised controlled trials', where researchers randomly assign people to treatment groups. These studies give the most reliable evidence. We gathered and combined the results from the studies. We then rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors like how the studies were done and how similar their results were.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 62 studies with 8051 women who had stress urinary incontinence, or incontinence that was mainly stress-related. The studies compared single-incision slings against other surgical options, mainly transobturator slings (51 studies) and retropubic slings (10 studies).\n\nCompared with transobturator slings, single-incision slings likely improve incontinence just as much. They also probably cause less long-term pain and fewer problems emptying the bladder after surgery. However, they may lead to a lower quality of life.\n\nCompared with retropubic slings, single-incision slings may improve incontinence by a similar amount. For many other outcomes, including whether women needed another operation, the evidence was unclear when comparing single-incision slings to either of the other sling types.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in some of the evidence because of weaknesses in how some studies were designed or carried out. Also, some evidence comes from a small number of studies and does not cover the long-term results that are important to women.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

To make it even more accessible for a lay audience, I have three main suggestions focused on simplifying sentence structure and vocabulary.\n\n1. **Break up long, complex sentences.**\nOne sentence in the introduction is over 35 words long and contains multiple ideas, which can be hard for readers to follow.\n- **Original Text:** \"This is a minimally-invasive surgery where a surgeon places a short piece of synthetic tape under the tube that carries urine from the bladder (the urethra) to support it and prevent leaks.\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This is a minimally-invasive surgery. A surgeon places a short piece of synthetic tape under the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder). This tape supports the urethra to prevent leaks.\"\n\n2. **Replace formal words with simpler alternatives.**\nThe text uses some words that may be unfamiliar to readers. Using more common, everyday language improves readability.\n- **Original Text:** \"...many countries **restrict** the use of this type of synthetic mesh...\" and \"...researchers randomly **assign** people to treatment groups. These studies give the most **reliable** evidence.\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...many countries **limit** the use of...\" and \"...researchers randomly **put** people into treatment groups. These studies give the most **trustworthy** evidence.\"\n\n3. **Make phrasing more direct by using verbs instead of nouns.**\nSome sentences are a bit indirect because they use noun forms of verbs (nominalizations). Changing these to active verbs makes the text more engaging and easier to understand.\n- **Original Text:** \"For many other outcomes, including whether women needed another operation, the evidence was unclear when comparing single-incision slings to either of the other sling types.\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"For many other outcomes, like the need for another operation, it was unclear if single-incision slings were better or worse than the other types.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of nominalizations (noun‑form verbs) and words not on the Dale‑Chall common word list, indicating that the vocabulary and sentence structure could be simplified.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft is highly readable in many ways, with excellent sentence length and use of active voice (72% of features in the best quartile). However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns in its vocabulary, with a high number of nouns (159.0), nominalizations (26.0), and words not on the Dale-Chall common word list (214.0). This suggests the text could be made more direct and use simpler language."
