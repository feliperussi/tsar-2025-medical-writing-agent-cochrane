  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women?\n\nKey messages\n\n- Single-incision slings likely improve urinary incontinence as much as other common sling operations (transobturator and retropubic slings) in the short term.\n- Compared to transobturator slings, single-incision slings probably cause less long-term pain and fewer problems emptying the bladder, but may lead to a lower quality of life.\n- We are uncertain about the long-term effects of single-incision slings, including whether women might need another operation, because there is not enough long-term evidence.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and what are single-incision slings?\nStress urinary incontinence is when urine leaks out during moments of physical pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or exercising. It is a common condition in women that can greatly affect their health and daily life. One way to treat this is with an operation called a 'single-incision sling'. This is a minimally-invasive surgery where a surgeon places a short piece of synthetic tape under the tube that carries urine from the bladder (the urethra) to support it and prevent leaks. However, many countries restrict the use of this type of synthetic mesh for gynaecological problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well single-incision sling operations treat urinary incontinence in women. We also wanted to understand the risks and summarise how the costs and benefits of the procedure compare to other treatments.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared single-incision slings with other treatments for urinary incontinence in women. We focused on studies called 'randomised controlled trials', where researchers randomly assign people to treatment groups. These studies give the most reliable evidence. We gathered and combined the results from the studies. We then rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors like how the studies were done and how similar their results were.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 62 studies with 8051 women who had stress urinary incontinence, or incontinence that was mainly stress-related. The studies compared single-incision slings against other surgical options, mainly transobturator slings (51 studies) and retropubic slings (10 studies).\n\nCompared with transobturator slings, single-incision slings likely improve incontinence just as much. They also probably cause less long-term pain and fewer problems emptying the bladder after surgery. However, they may lead to a lower quality of life.\n\nCompared with retropubic slings, single-incision slings may improve incontinence by a similar amount. For many other outcomes, including whether women needed another operation, the evidence was unclear when comparing single-incision slings to either of the other sling types.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in some of the evidence because of how some studies were done. Also, some evidence comes from a small number of studies and does not cover the long-term results that are important to women.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

The following 3 suggestions are designed to address minor clarity issues and make the summary even more accessible to readers.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Replace a technical term with simpler language.**\n\n*   **Quote:** \"...many countries restrict the use of this type of synthetic mesh for gynaecological problems.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The word \"gynaecological\" is a technical term that may not be familiar to all readers, creating a small barrier to understanding.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"...for women's health problems.\"\n\n**2. Make the 'Aims' section more direct and concise.**\n\n*   **Quote:** \"We wanted to find out how well single-incision sling operations treat urinary incontinence in women. We also wanted to understand the risks and summarise how the costs and benefits of the procedure compare to other treatments.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly wordy. Using more direct verbs can make the goal clearer and the sentences punchier.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how well single-incision sling operations work for women with urinary incontinence. We also wanted to understand their risks and compare their costs and benefits to other treatments.\"\n\n**3. Clarify the reason for the evidence limitations.**\n\n*   **Quote:** \"We have little confidence in some of the evidence because of how some studies were done.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"how some studies were done\" is vague. Providing a little more detail, without adding jargon, helps the reader better understand the nature of the limitation.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We have less confidence in some of the evidence because of weaknesses in how some studies were designed or carried out.\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis\n\nYour draft has excellent readability scores. The suggestions above are supported by two metrics that fall outside the typical range for a Plain Language Summary. The draft has a high number of 'complex words' (Dale-Chall) and 'nominalizations' (noun-form verbs). The proposed edits help address both of these issues by simplifying vocabulary and using more direct, active verbs.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability. However, two metrics deviate from this pattern: 'nominalization' (use of noun-form verbs) and 'complex_words_dc' (use of words uncommon in everyday language) are in the P90 range. This suggests that while the text is very readable overall, there are minor opportunities to further simplify vocabulary and sentence structure."
