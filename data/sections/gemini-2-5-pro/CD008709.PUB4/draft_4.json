  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women?\n\nKey messages\n\n- Single-incision slings likely improve urinary incontinence as much as other common sling operations (transobturator and retropubic slings) in the short term.\n- Compared to transobturator slings, single-incision slings probably cause less long-term pain and fewer problems emptying the bladder, but may lead to a lower quality of life.\n- We are uncertain about the long-term effects of single-incision slings, including the risk of needing another operation, because there is not enough long-term evidence.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and what are single-incision slings?\nStress urinary incontinence is when urine leaks out during moments of physical pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or exercising. It is a common condition in women that can have a major impact on health and daily life. One treatment is a 'single-incision sling' operation. This is a minimally-invasive surgery where a surgeon places a short piece of synthetic tape under the tube that carries urine from the bladder (the urethra) to provide support and prevent leakage. However, many countries restrict the use of this type of synthetic mesh for gynaecological problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well single-incision sling operations work for treating urinary incontinence in women. We also wanted to understand the risks and summarise what is known about the cost-effectiveness of the procedure compared to other treatments.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared single-incision slings with other treatments for urinary incontinence in women. We focused on studies called 'randomised controlled trials', where researchers randomly assign people to treatment groups. These studies give the most reliable evidence. We gathered and combined the results from the studies. We then rated our confidence in the evidence based on how researchers conducted the studies and whether their findings agreed.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 62 studies with 8051 women who had stress urinary incontinence, or incontinence that was mainly stress-related. The studies compared single-incision slings against other surgical options, mainly transobturator slings (51 studies) and retropubic slings (10 studies).\n\nCompared with transobturator slings, single-incision slings likely improve incontinence just as much. They also probably cause less long-term pain and fewer problems emptying the bladder after surgery. However, they may lead to a lower quality of life.\n\nCompared with retropubic slings, single-incision slings may improve incontinence by a similar amount. For many other outcomes, including the need for another operation, the evidence was unclear when comparing single-incision slings to either of the other sling types.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in some of the evidence because of concerns about how researchers conducted the studies. Also, some evidence comes from a small number of studies and does not cover the long-term results that are important to women.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

The following suggestions focus on making the language even more direct and accessible for readers by addressing a pattern of noun-heavy sentences, which was also flagged by the linguistic analysis.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Use more direct verbs instead of noun forms (nominalizations).**\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"One treatment is a 'single-incision sling' operation.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence uses a noun (\"operation\") where a more direct verb form would be more active and easier to read. This pattern contributes to the high nominalization count.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"One way to treat this is with an operation called a 'single-incision sling'.\"\n\n2.  **Replace wordy phrases with stronger, more concise verbs.**\n    *   **Problematic phrase:** \"...can have a major impact on health and daily life.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This phrase is less direct than a single, strong verb. Being concise helps maintain reader engagement.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"...can greatly affect their health and daily life.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify abstract concepts with more concrete language.**\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"We then rated our confidence in the evidence based on how researchers conducted the studies and whether their findings agreed.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"whether their findings agreed\" is slightly abstract. Using more concrete terms can improve clarity for a lay audience.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We then rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors like how the studies were done and how similar their results were.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\nImplementing these changes will help address the high counts for **nominalization** (27 instances) and **nouns** (162 instances) identified in the evaluation, making the text more active and easier for readers to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72.2% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and style. However, it deviates significantly on three metrics related to vocabulary and sentence structure: nominalization (27.0 vs. median <13.0), noun count (162.0 vs. median <116.0), and use of uncommon words (Dale-Chall complex words: 217.0 vs. median <160.0). These metrics point to opportunities to make the text more direct by using more verbs and simpler phrasing."
