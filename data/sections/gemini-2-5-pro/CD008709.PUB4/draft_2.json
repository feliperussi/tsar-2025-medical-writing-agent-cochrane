  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For improving urinary incontinence, single-incision slings are likely as effective as other common sling operations (transobturator and retropubic slings) in the short term.\n- Compared to transobturator slings, single-incision slings probably cause less long-term pain and fewer problems emptying the bladder, but may result in a lower quality of life.\n- We are uncertain about the long-term effects of single-incision slings and the risk of needing repeat surgery compared to other slings because of a lack of long-term evidence.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and what are single-incision slings?\nStress urinary incontinence is when urine leaks out during moments of physical pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or exercising. It is a common condition in women that can have a major impact on health and daily life. One treatment is a 'single-incision sling' operation. This is a minimally-invasive surgery where a surgeon places a short piece of synthetic tape under the tube that carries urine from the bladder (the urethra) to provide support and prevent leakage. However, many countries restrict the use of this type of synthetic mesh for gynaecological problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well single-incision sling operations work for treating urinary incontinence in women. We also wanted to understand the risks and summarise what is known about the cost-effectiveness of the procedure compared to other treatments.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared single-incision slings with other treatments for urinary incontinence in women. We focused on randomised controlled trials, where people are randomly assigned to a treatment group, because these studies provide the most reliable evidence. We collected and combined the results from the studies to compare the treatments. We then rated our confidence in the evidence based on how the studies were conducted and how consistent their findings were.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 62 studies involving 8051 women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. The studies compared single-incision slings against other surgical options, mainly transobturator slings (51 studies) and retropubic slings (10 studies).\n\nWhen compared with transobturator slings, single-incision slings probably reduce long-term pain and problems with emptying the bladder after surgery. However, they make little to no difference to incontinence improvement and may reduce a person's quality of life.\n\nWhen compared with retropubic slings, single-incision slings may make little to no difference to incontinence improvement. For many outcomes, including the need for repeat surgery, the effect of single-incision slings is unclear when compared to either type of sling.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in some of the evidence because of concerns about how the studies were conducted. In addition, some of the evidence is based on a small number of studies, and does not cover the longer-term outcomes that are important to women.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. The readability scores are generally very good. To make it even clearer and more direct for patients, I recommend focusing on the following three improvements.\n\n1. **Use more action verbs instead of nouns.** The text often uses noun forms where a verb would be more direct (a pattern called 'nominalization'). This makes sentences feel more abstract and less active.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"However, they make little to no difference to incontinence **improvement** and may reduce a person's quality of life.\"\n   - **Problem:** The noun \"improvement\" is less direct than the verb \"improve\".\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"However, they do little to **improve** incontinence and may reduce a person's quality of life.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex or technical words.** Some words, while accurate, may be unfamiliar to a general audience and can be replaced with simpler alternatives without losing meaning.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"This review included 62 studies involving 8051 women with stress or stress-**predominant** mixed urinary incontinence.\"\n   - **Problem:** \"Predominant\" is a formal term that may not be widely understood.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This review included 62 studies with 8051 women who had stress urinary incontinence, or incontinence that was **mainly** stress-related.\"\n\n3. **Make the methods description more direct and less formal.** The language in the 'What did we do?' section is slightly technical and could be simplified to better align with the plain language goal.\n   - **Original paragraph:** \"We searched for studies that compared single-incision slings with other treatments for urinary incontinence in women. We focused on randomised controlled trials, where people are randomly assigned to a treatment group, because these studies provide the most reliable evidence. We collected and combined the results from the studies to compare the treatments. We then rated our confidence in the evidence based on how the studies were conducted and how consistent their findings were.\"\n   - **Problem:** Phrases like \"randomly assigned\" and \"how the studies were conducted\" are a bit formal.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for studies that compared single-incision slings with other treatments for urinary incontinence in women. We focused on studies called 'randomised controlled trials', where people are put into treatment groups at random. These studies give the most reliable evidence. We gathered and combined the results from the studies. We then rated our confidence in the evidence based on how the studies were done and whether their findings agreed.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make an already good summary even more accessible to your target audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis flags three key deviations that support the need for revision: the number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is beyond the 90th percentile, and the counts for total nouns and complex Dale-Chall words are in the P90 range. These metrics indicate that simplifying vocabulary and using more direct, active verbs would significantly improve clarity."
