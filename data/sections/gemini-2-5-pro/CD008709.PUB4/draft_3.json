  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women?\n\nKey messages\n\n- Single-incision slings likely improve urinary incontinence as much as other common sling operations (transobturator and retropubic slings) in the short term.\n- Compared to transobturator slings, single-incision slings probably cause less long-term pain and fewer problems emptying the bladder, but may lead to a lower quality of life.\n- We are uncertain about the long-term effects of single-incision slings, including the risk of needing another operation, because there is not enough long-term evidence.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and what are single-incision slings?\nStress urinary incontinence is when urine leaks out during moments of physical pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or exercising. It is a common condition in women that can have a major impact on health and daily life. One treatment is a 'single-incision sling' operation. This is a minimally-invasive surgery where a surgeon places a short piece of synthetic tape under the tube that carries urine from the bladder (the urethra) to provide support and prevent leakage. However, many countries restrict the use of this type of synthetic mesh for gynaecological problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well single-incision sling operations work for treating urinary incontinence in women. We also wanted to understand the risks and summarise what is known about the cost-effectiveness of the procedure compared to other treatments.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared single-incision slings with other treatments for urinary incontinence in women. We focused on studies called 'randomised controlled trials', where people are put into treatment groups at random. These studies give the most reliable evidence. We gathered and combined the results from the studies. We then rated our confidence in the evidence based on how the studies were done and whether their findings agreed.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 62 studies with 8051 women who had stress urinary incontinence, or incontinence that was mainly stress-related. The studies compared single-incision slings against other surgical options, mainly transobturator slings (51 studies) and retropubic slings (10 studies).\n\nCompared with transobturator slings, single-incision slings probably reduce long-term pain and problems emptying the bladder after surgery. However, they do little to improve incontinence and may reduce a person's quality of life.\n\nCompared with retropubic slings, single-incision slings may also do little to improve incontinence. For many outcomes, including the need for another operation, the effect of single-incision slings is unclear when compared to either type of sling.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in some of the evidence because of concerns about how the studies were done. Also, some evidence is based on a small number of studies and does not cover the long-term results that are important to women.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

This must be corrected to avoid misleading readers. Additionally, minor improvements can be made by converting some sentences to active voice and reducing noun-heavy phrasing to enhance readability, as supported by the linguistic analysis.",
