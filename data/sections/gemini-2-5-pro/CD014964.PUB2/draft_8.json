  "draft": "Is ultrasound guidance better than the traditional “feel” technique for spinal injections in adults?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Compared to the usual method of feeling for bones, using ultrasound to guide spinal or epidural injections in adults means doctors need fewer attempts with the needle and the procedure is quicker. It also likely helps the procedure succeed on the first try.\n- Ultrasound may not change how satisfied patients feel or whether doctors are unable to complete the injection, but this is uncertain. We are also uncertain if using ultrasound affects pain during the procedure or causes other side effects.\n\nWhat are spinal and epidural injections?\nSpinal or epidural injections are a type of pain relief involving an injection in the back, near the spinal cord. It is often used during surgery or childbirth (for example, an epidural or a spinal block). To give the injection, doctors usually feel for bones in the back (called anatomical landmarks) to guide the needle to the correct spot. This method can be difficult and may not always be accurate, which means the doctor might need to try several times with the needle. Multiple attempts can be uncomfortable and may cause more problems for the patient. An ultrasound machine creates a picture of the inside of the body and could help guide the needle more accurately.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ultrasound to guide the needle for spinal or epidural injections is more effective and safer for adults than the usual method of feeling for bones. We compared the two methods to see which one:\n- was more likely to succeed on the first attempt\n- needed fewer needle attempts overall\n- was quicker to perform\n- made patients more satisfied\n- caused less pain or other side effects\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using ultrasound guidance with the usual method of feeling for bones for spinal or epidural injections in adults. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies with a total of 6823 adults. About half of the studies involved people in labour or having a caesarean section. The other studies involved adults having different types of surgery. All studies compared using ultrasound to guide the needle with the usual method of feeling for bones in the back.\n\nWhat did the studies show?\nCompared to the usual method of feeling for bones, using ultrasound guidance for spinal or epidural injections in adults:\n- leads to fewer needle attempts\n- makes the procedure quicker\n- probably helps the procedure succeed on the first try\n\nUltrasound guidance may make little to no difference to how satisfied people feel, or to whether doctors are unable to complete the injection. We do not know if it affects pain during the procedure or other side effects.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. We are highly confident that using ultrasound leads to fewer needle attempts and a quicker procedure. We are moderately confident that it helps the procedure succeed on the first try. However, our confidence is low for the results on patient satisfaction and the risk of an incomplete injection, and very low for pain and side effects. Our confidence is lower for some findings because many studies were small, and their methods could have made the results less reliable. This makes it harder to be certain about the true effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, two metrics deviate from this strong pattern: 'nominalization' (use of noun-forms of verbs) and 'complex_words_dc' (use of words unfamiliar to a lay audience) are in the P90 range, meaning they are higher than is typical for a PLS. This suggests that focusing on using more active verbs and simpler, everyday words would be beneficial."
