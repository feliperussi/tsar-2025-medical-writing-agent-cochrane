  "draft": "Is ultrasound guidance better than the traditional “feel” technique for spinal injections in adults?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For adults receiving spinal injections (a needle in the back to numb an area for surgery), using ultrasound to guide the needle reduces the number of attempts needed and shortens the time the procedure takes compared to the traditional method of feeling for bony landmarks. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound guidance on pain during the procedure or other unwanted effects.\n- Because there was not enough good-quality evidence, more research is needed to understand if using ultrasound guidance makes a difference to patient satisfaction, pain, or the risk of technical problems with the injection.\n\nBACKGROUND\nWhat is neuraxial anaesthesia?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief that involves an injection into the back, near the spinal cord. It is often used during surgery or childbirth (for example, an epidural or a spinal block). To give the injection, doctors traditionally feel for bones in the back (anatomical landmarks) to guide the needle to the correct spot. However, this method can be difficult and may not always be accurate, sometimes requiring several attempts with the needle. Multiple attempts can be uncomfortable for the patient and may increase the risk of complications. Using an ultrasound machine, which creates a picture of the inside of the body, could help guide the needle more accurately.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ultrasound to guide the needle for neuraxial anaesthesia is more effective and safer for adults than the standard method of using anatomical landmarks. We compared the two methods to see which one:\n- was more likely to be successful on the first attempt;\n- required fewer needle attempts overall;\n- took less time to perform;\n- led to greater patient satisfaction;\n- caused less pain or other unwanted side effects.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched for studies that compared using ultrasound guidance with using anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 65 studies with a total of 6823 adult participants from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania. About half of the studies focused on people in labour or having a caesarean section, while the rest involved adults having other types of surgery. The studies compared using ultrasound to guide the needle with the usual method of using anatomical landmarks to find the right place for different types of anaesthesia in the back (neuraxial anaesthesia).\n\nMain results: ultrasound guidance for anaesthesia in the back\nCompared to using anatomical landmarks, using ultrasound guidance for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults reduces the number of attempts needed for success and reduces the time it takes to perform the procedure. It probably increases the chance of the procedure being successful on the first try. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference to how satisfied people are with the procedure or to whether the procedure fails for technical reasons. We do not know if ultrasound guidance has an effect on pain during the procedure or on side effects.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE\nThe evidence is limited by small sample sizes, potential selection bias, and reliance on self-reported data, which may affect generalizability and accuracy.\n\nHOW UP TO DATE IS THIS EVIDENCE?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023 of search.",

Additionally, the summary would be clearer for a lay audience by simplifying technical terms in the 'Limitations' section and reducing noun-heavy phrases throughout the text.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** Several subheadings do not follow the required question format, making the text less engaging and non-compliant with the style guide.\n   - **Problematic Subheadings:** \"METHODS\", \"RESULTS\", \"LIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrites:**\n     - For \"METHODS\", use: \"How did we conduct this review?\"\n     - For \"RESULTS\", use: \"What did we find?\"\n     - For \"LIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE\", use: \"How reliable is this evidence?\"\n\n2. **Explain the limitations in simpler, more concrete terms.** The current limitations section uses technical jargon that a patient is unlikely to understand.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"The evidence is limited by small sample sizes, potential selection bias, and reliance on self-reported data, which may affect generalizability and accuracy.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Terms like \"selection bias\" and \"generalizability\" are unclear to a non-medical audience. It's better to explain *how* these issues affect the evidence.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the results is limited because some studies were small and may not have chosen their participants in a balanced way. Also, some findings were based on what people told the researchers, which can be less reliable. This means the results might not apply to everyone.\"\n\n3. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs.** The text sometimes uses formal, noun-focused language (\"nominalizations\") where a simple verb would be clearer and more direct.\n   - **Problematic Phrase:** \"...reduces the number of attempts needed for success and reduces the time it takes to perform the procedure.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is wordy and less active. Using direct verbs makes the sentence shorter and easier to read.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...means fewer needle attempts are needed and the procedure is quicker.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, particularly in sentence structure and readability, with most readability scores falling in the best quartile (P25). However, the analysis also highlights significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics are in the P90 range, including 'nominalization' (noun-form verbs), 'long_words', and 'complex_words_dc'. This indicates that while sentence length is appropriate, the choice of words is often too technical or complex, supporting the need to simplify language in sections like the limitations."
