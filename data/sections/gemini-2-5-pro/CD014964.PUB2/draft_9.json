  "draft": "Is ultrasound guidance better than the traditional “feel” technique for spinal injections in adults?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Using ultrasound to guide spinal or epidural injections likely helps the procedure succeed on the first try. Compared to the usual 'feel' method, it also leads to fewer needle attempts and a quicker procedure.\n- Ultrasound may not change how satisfied patients feel or the risk of the injection failing for technical reasons, but this is uncertain. We are also uncertain if using ultrasound affects pain during the procedure or causes other side effects.\n\nWhat are spinal and epidural injections?\nSpinal or epidural injections are a type of pain relief involving an injection in the back, near the spinal cord. It is often used during surgery or childbirth (for example, an epidural or a spinal block). To give the injection, doctors usually feel for bones in the back (called anatomical landmarks) to guide the needle to the correct spot. This method can be difficult and may not always be accurate, which means the doctor might need to try several times with the needle. Needing several attempts can be uncomfortable and may cause more problems for the patient. An ultrasound machine creates a picture of the inside of the body and could help guide the needle more accurately.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ultrasound to guide the needle for spinal or epidural injections is more effective and safer for adults than the usual method of feeling for bones. We compared the two methods to see which one:\n- was more likely to succeed on the first attempt\n- needed fewer needle attempts overall\n- was quicker to perform\n- made patients more satisfied\n- caused less pain or other side effects\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using ultrasound guidance with the usual method of feeling for bones for spinal or epidural injections in adults. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies with a total of 6823 adults. About half of the studies involved people in labour or having a caesarean section. The other studies involved adults having different types of surgery. All studies compared using ultrasound to guide the needle with the usual method of feeling for bones in the back.\n\nWhat did the studies show?\nCompared to the usual method of feeling for bones, using ultrasound guidance for spinal or epidural injections in adults:\n- leads to fewer needle attempts\n- makes the procedure quicker\n- probably helps the procedure succeed on the first try\n\nUltrasound guidance may make little to no difference to how satisfied people feel, or to the risk of the injection failing for technical reasons. We do not know if it affects pain during the procedure or other side effects.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. We are highly confident that using ultrasound leads to fewer needle attempts and a quicker procedure. We are moderately confident that it helps the procedure succeed on the first try. However, our confidence is low for the results on patient satisfaction and the risk of the injection failing for technical reasons, and very low for pain and side effects. Our confidence is lower for some findings because many studies were small. In some studies, there were also concerns about how they were conducted, which could lead to less trustworthy results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. It passes all critical checks. I am recommending a few minor revisions to make it even more accessible to a lay audience before final approval. My top 3 suggestions focus on simplifying vocabulary and improving precision.\n\n1. **Simplify technical terms, even when defined.**\n   - **Quote:** \"...doctors usually feel for bones in the back (called anatomical landmarks) to guide the needle to the correct spot.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The term 'anatomical landmarks' is medical jargon. While you provide a good definition, the sentence is simpler and more direct for the reader if you remove the jargon entirely.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"To give the injection, doctors usually feel for specific bones in the back to guide the needle to the correct spot.\"\n\n2. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.**\n   - **Quote:** \"...or to the risk of the injection failing for technical reasons.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing uses a noun ('risk') where a more direct verb structure would be clearer and more active. This is a pattern known as 'nominalization'.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...or to whether the injection fails for technical reasons.\"\n\n3. **Ensure the title fully matches the review's scope.**\n   - **Quote:** \"Is ultrasound guidance better than the traditional “feel” technique for spinal injections in adults?\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The title only mentions 'spinal injections', but the summary correctly discusses both 'spinal or epidural injections'. A reader looking for information about epidurals might mistakenly skip this summary.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Is ultrasound guidance better than the traditional 'feel' technique for spinal or epidural injections in adults?\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the use of unfamiliar words (`complex_words_dc`) and noun-form verbs (`nominalization`) was higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, despite the draft's overall high quality.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft is very well-written and highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, two metrics deviate from the typical range: 'nominalization' (use of noun-form verbs) and 'complex_words_dc' (use of words unfamiliar to a general audience) are in the P90 range, indicating they are higher than usual. These metrics suggest opportunities to further improve clarity by using more direct verbs and simpler vocabulary."
