  "draft": "Is ultrasound guidance better than the traditional “feel” technique for spinal injections in adults?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Using ultrasound to guide spinal injections in adults reduces the number of needle attempts and shortens the time it takes to do the procedure compared to the usual method of feeling for bones. It also likely increases the chance of success on the first try.\n- Ultrasound may make little to no difference to how satisfied patients are or whether the procedure fails, but this finding is uncertain. We are also uncertain if using ultrasound makes a difference to pain during the procedure or other unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is neuraxial anaesthesia?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief involving an injection in the back, near the spinal cord. It is often used during surgery or childbirth (for example, an epidural or a spinal block). To give the injection, doctors usually feel for bones in the back (called anatomical landmarks) to guide the needle to the correct spot. This method can be difficult and may not always be precise, sometimes requiring several needle attempts. Multiple attempts can be uncomfortable and may cause more problems for the patient. An ultrasound machine creates a picture of the inside of the body and could help guide the needle more accurately.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ultrasound to guide the needle for neuraxial anaesthesia is more effective and safer for adults than the usual method of feeling for bones. We compared the two methods to see which one:\n- was more likely to succeed on the first attempt\n- needed fewer needle attempts overall\n- took less time to do\n- made patients more satisfied\n- caused less pain or other unwanted effects\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using ultrasound guidance with the usual method of feeling for bones for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies with a total of 6823 adults. About half of the studies involved people in labour or having a caesarean section. The other studies involved adults having different types of surgery. All studies compared using ultrasound to guide the needle with the usual method of feeling for bones in the back.\n\nWhat did the studies show?\nCompared to the usual method of feeling for bones, using ultrasound guidance for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults:\n- reduces the number of needle attempts needed\n- shortens the time it takes to do the procedure\n- probably increases the chance of success on the first try\n\nUltrasound guidance may make little to no difference to how satisfied people are or to whether the procedure fails for technical reasons. We do not know if it affects pain during the procedure or other unwanted effects.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies depending on the finding. We are highly confident that using ultrasound reduces needle attempts and procedure time. Our confidence is moderate that it increases success on the first try. However, we have low confidence in the results for patient satisfaction and technical failure, and very low confidence for pain and unwanted effects, because some studies had limitations in their methods.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.",

However, to make it even easier for patients to understand, I'm recommending three key improvements before final approval.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** Some sentences are a bit abstract because they use nouns to describe actions. Using stronger verbs will make the text more direct and easier to follow.\n    *   **Example:** \"Our confidence is moderate that it increases success on the first try.\"\n    *   **Problem:** The phrase \"increases success\" is a noun-based concept (a nominalization).\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite with a direct verb, like: \"We are moderately confident that it helps the procedure succeed on the first try.\"\n\n2.  **Make the limitations section more specific.** The explanation for why the evidence is uncertain is currently too vague for readers.\n    *   **Example:** \"...we have low confidence in the results for patient satisfaction and technical failure, and very low confidence for pain and unwanted effects, because some studies had limitations in their methods.\"\n    *   **Problem:** \"Limitations in their methods\" doesn't explain *why* the evidence is less certain. Providing a simple reason builds trust and improves understanding.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Add a brief, concrete reason, like: \"...because some studies were small or had flaws in their methods, which makes the results less certain.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify wordy phrases and complex vocabulary.** Some phrases can be simplified to use more common, everyday language.\n    *   **Example:** \"This method can be difficult and may not always be precise, sometimes requiring several needle attempts.\"\n    *   **Problem:** Words like \"precise\" and \"requiring\" can be replaced with simpler alternatives.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase for clarity, like: \"This method can be difficult and may not always be accurate, which means the doctor might need to try several times with the needle.\"\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows a high number of noun-form verbs (nominalizations) and complex words compared to typical plain language summaries. Addressing these points will significantly improve the draft's readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS draft is generally well-written and conforms to typical patterns for most metrics, with 83% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates from typical patterns in three key areas: a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), a high overall noun count, and a high count of complex words from the Dale-Chall list. These metrics suggest the text could be made more direct and easier to understand by using more active verbs and simpler, everyday vocabulary."
