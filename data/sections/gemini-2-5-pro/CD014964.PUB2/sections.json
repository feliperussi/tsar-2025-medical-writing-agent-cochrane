  "plain_title": "Is ultrasound guidance better than the traditional “feel” technique for spinal injections in adults?",
  "key_messages": [
    "For adults receiving spinal injections (a needle in the back to numb an area for surgery), using ultrasound to guide the needle reduces the number of attempts needed and shortens the time the procedure takes compared to the traditional method of feeling for bony landmarks. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound guidance on pain during the procedure or other unwanted effects.",
    "Because there was not enough good-quality evidence, more research is needed to understand if using ultrasound guidance makes a difference to patient satisfaction, pain, or the risk of technical problems with the injection."

      "subheading": "What is neuraxial anaesthesia?",
      "content": "Neuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief that involves an injection into the back, near the spinal cord. It is often used during surgery or childbirth (for example, an epidural or a spinal block). To give the injection, doctors traditionally feel for bones in the back (anatomical landmarks) to guide the needle to the correct spot. However, this method can be difficult and may not always be accurate, sometimes requiring several attempts with the needle. Multiple attempts can be uncomfortable for the patient and may increase the risk of complications. Using an ultrasound machine, which creates a picture of the inside of the body, could help guide the needle more accurately."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if using ultrasound to guide the needle for neuraxial anaesthesia is more effective and safer for adults than the standard method of using anatomical landmarks. We compared the two methods to see which one:\n- was more likely to be successful on the first attempt;\n- required fewer needle attempts overall;\n- took less time to perform;\n- led to greater patient satisfaction;\n- caused less pain or other unwanted side effects."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 65 studies with a total of 6823 adult participants from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania. About half of the studies focused on people in labour or having a caesarean section, while the rest involved adults having other types of surgery. The studies compared using ultrasound to guide the needle with the usual method of using anatomical landmarks to find the right place for different types of anaesthesia in the back (neuraxial anaesthesia)."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: ultrasound guidance for anaesthesia in the back",
      "content": "Compared to using anatomical landmarks, using ultrasound guidance for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults reduces the number of attempts needed for success and reduces the time it takes to perform the procedure. It probably increases the chance of the procedure being successful on the first try. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference to how satisfied people are with the procedure or to whether the procedure fails for technical reasons. We do not know if ultrasound guidance has an effect on pain during the procedure or on side effects."
