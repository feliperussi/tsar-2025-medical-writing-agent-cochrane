  "draft": "Is ultrasound guidance better than the traditional “feel” technique for spinal injections in adults?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Compared to the usual method of feeling for bones, using ultrasound to guide spinal injections in adults means doctors need fewer attempts with the needle and the procedure is quicker. It also likely helps the procedure succeed on the first try.\n- Ultrasound may not change how satisfied patients feel or whether the procedure fails for technical reasons, but this is uncertain. We are also uncertain if using ultrasound affects pain during the procedure or causes other side effects.\n\nWhat is neuraxial anaesthesia?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief involving an injection in the back, near the spinal cord. It is often used during surgery or childbirth (for example, an epidural or a spinal block). To give the injection, doctors usually feel for bones in the back (called anatomical landmarks) to guide the needle to the correct spot. This method can be difficult and may not always be accurate, which means the doctor might need to try several times with the needle. Multiple attempts can be uncomfortable and may cause more problems for the patient. An ultrasound machine creates a picture of the inside of the body and could help guide the needle more accurately.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ultrasound to guide the needle for neuraxial anaesthesia is more effective and safer for adults than the usual method of feeling for bones. We compared the two methods to see which one:\n- was more likely to succeed on the first attempt\n- needed fewer needle attempts overall\n- was quicker to perform\n- made patients more satisfied\n- caused less pain or other side effects\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using ultrasound guidance with the usual method of feeling for bones for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies with a total of 6823 adults. About half of the studies involved people in labour or having a caesarean section. The other studies involved adults having different types of surgery. All studies compared using ultrasound to guide the needle with the usual method of feeling for bones in the back.\n\nWhat did the studies show?\nCompared to the usual method of feeling for bones, using ultrasound guidance for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults:\n- leads to fewer needle attempts\n- makes the procedure quicker\n- probably helps the procedure succeed on the first try\n\nUltrasound guidance may make little to no difference to how satisfied people feel, or to whether the procedure fails for technical reasons. We do not know if it affects pain during the procedure or other side effects.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. We are highly confident that using ultrasound leads to fewer needle attempts and a quicker procedure. We are moderately confident that it helps the procedure succeed on the first try. However, our confidence is low for the results on patient satisfaction and technical failure, and very low for pain and side effects. This is because some studies were small or had flaws in their methods, which makes these results less certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.",

However, a few key improvements to the language will make it much more accessible for a lay audience. I am recommending 'NOT_APPROVED' to ensure these important vocabulary changes are made.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Replace the technical term 'neuraxial anaesthesia' with simpler language.**\n    While you define this term, it's complex and repeated throughout the text. Using simpler, more familiar language would significantly improve readability.\n    - **Example from the text:** \"Compared to the usual method of feeling for bones, using ultrasound guidance for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults...\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Compared to the usual method of feeling for bones, using ultrasound guidance for spinal or epidural injections in adults...\"\n\n2.  **Clarify the phrase 'fails for technical reasons' in the Key Messages.**\n    This phrase is jargon and may be unclear to readers. Explaining what it means in plain language will make this key finding easier to understand.\n    - **Example from the text:** \"Ultrasound may not change how satisfied patients feel or whether the procedure fails for technical reasons, but this is uncertain.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Ultrasound may not change how satisfied patients feel or whether doctors are unable to complete the injection, but this is uncertain.\"\n\n3.  **Make the explanation of evidence limitations more specific.**\n    The current explanation is a bit generic. Adding slightly more detail about *why* the evidence is less certain can build more trust and transparency with the reader.\n    - **Example from the text:** \"This is because some studies were small or had flaws in their methods, which makes these results less certain.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence is lower for some findings because many studies were small, and their methods could have made the results less reliable. This makes it harder to be certain about the true effects.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns. Sentence-level metrics like 'words_per_sentence' (17.29) and 'passive_voice' (7 instances) are excellent, falling within the best 25% of our corpus. However, the analysis identified a high number of complex words not on the Dale-Chall familiar word list ('complex_words_dc' = 219), placing it in the 90th percentile. This supports the editorial feedback to replace technical terms like 'neuraxial anaesthesia' and 'technical failure' with more common, everyday language to improve reader comprehension."
