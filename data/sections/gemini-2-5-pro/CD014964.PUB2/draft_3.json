  "draft": "Is ultrasound guidance better than the traditional “feel” technique for spinal injections in adults?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For adults receiving spinal injections (a needle in the back to numb an area for surgery), using ultrasound to guide the needle reduces the number of attempts needed and makes the procedure quicker compared to the traditional method of feeling for bony landmarks. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound guidance on pain during the procedure or other unwanted effects.\n- We need more good-quality research to know if ultrasound guidance improves how satisfied patients are, reduces pain, or lowers the risk of the injection failing for technical reasons.\n\nWhat is neuraxial anaesthesia?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief that involves an injection into the back, near the spinal cord. It is often used during surgery or childbirth (for example, an epidural or a spinal block). To give the injection, doctors traditionally feel for bones in the back (anatomical landmarks) to guide the needle to the correct spot. However, this method can be difficult and may not always be accurate, sometimes requiring several attempts with the needle. Multiple attempts can be uncomfortable for the patient and may increase the risk of complications. Using an ultrasound machine, which creates a picture of the inside of the body, could help guide the needle more accurately.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ultrasound to guide the needle for neuraxial anaesthesia is more effective and safer for adults than the standard method of feeling for bones in the back. We compared the two methods to see which one:\n- was more likely to be successful on the first attempt;\n- required fewer needle attempts overall;\n- took less time to perform;\n- led to greater patient satisfaction;\n- caused less pain or other unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using ultrasound guidance with feeling for bones in the back for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 65 studies with a total of 6823 adult participants from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania. About half of the studies focused on people in labour or having a caesarean section, while the rest involved adults having other types of surgery. The studies compared using ultrasound to guide the needle with the usual method of feeling for bones in the back to find the right place for different types of anaesthesia in the back (neuraxial anaesthesia).\n\nCompared to feeling for bones in the back, using ultrasound guidance for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults reduces the number of needle attempts and shortens the procedure time. It probably increases the chance of the procedure being successful on the first try. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference to how satisfied people are with the procedure or to whether the procedure fails for technical reasons. We do not know if ultrasound guidance has an effect on pain during the procedure or on side effects.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Some studies were small, and some may have had flaws in how they selected people to take part, which could affect the results. Also, some findings were based on what people told the researchers, which can be less reliable. This means the results might not apply to everyone.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.",

However, it can be made clearer for a lay audience by simplifying word choices and strengthening key explanations. The main issues are the use of overly academic language in places and a limitations section that is too vague. The following 3 improvements will significantly enhance readability.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Simplify Wordy and Technical Phrases**\n\nSome sentences contain unnecessary detail or jargon that can be simplified without losing meaning. This makes the text easier to scan and understand.\n\n- **Quote:** \"The review included 65 studies with a total of 6823 adult participants from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania.\"\n- **Problem:** The long list of continents is not essential information for the reader, and \"participants\" is a research term.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The review included 65 studies with a total of 6823 adults from around the world.\"\n\n**2. Make the Limitations Section More Specific**\n\nThe current explanation of the evidence's reliability is vague. Using more direct language will help readers better understand why the confidence in some findings is limited.\n\n- **Quote:** \"Some studies were small, and some may have had flaws in how they selected people to take part, which could affect the results. Also, some findings were based on what people told the researchers, which can be less reliable.\"\n- **Problem:** \"Flaws in how they selected people\" is a wordy and indirect way to describe bias. The explanation can be more direct.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. Some studies were small, and the way people were chosen for some studies could have created bias. Also, some results relied on what people told researchers, which can be less accurate.\"\n\n**3. Use More Direct Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases (Reduce Nominalization)**\n\nSentences are often clearer when they use strong verbs instead of complex noun phrases. This makes the writing more active and easier to follow.\n\n- **Quote:** \"...or lowers the risk of the injection failing for technical reasons.\"\n- **Problem:** The phrase \"risk of the injection failing\" is a noun-based construction (a nominalization). A simple verb is more direct.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...or prevents the injection from failing for technical reasons.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in sentence structure and readability, with 72% of features in the best quartile (e.g., good sentence length and high active voice). However, it deviates in vocabulary complexity, with high counts for nominalization (21.0), nouns (170.0), Dale-Chall complex words (226.0), and long words (167.0). This analysis supports the editorial feedback: while the sentences are well-structured, the word choice could be simpler and more direct to improve clarity for a lay audience."
