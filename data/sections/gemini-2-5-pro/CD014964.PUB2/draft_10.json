  "draft": "Is ultrasound guidance better than the traditional 'feel' technique for spinal or epidural injections in adults?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Using ultrasound to guide spinal or epidural injections likely helps the procedure succeed on the first try. Compared to the usual 'feel' method, it also leads to fewer needle attempts and a quicker procedure.\n- Ultrasound may not change how satisfied patients feel or whether the injection fails for technical reasons, but this is uncertain. We are also uncertain if using ultrasound affects pain during the procedure or causes other side effects.\n\nWhat are spinal and epidural injections?\nSpinal or epidural injections are a type of pain relief involving an injection in the back, near the spinal cord. It is often used during surgery or childbirth (for example, an epidural or a spinal block). To give the injection, doctors usually feel for specific bones in the back to guide the needle to the correct spot. This method can be difficult and may not always be accurate, which means the doctor might need to try several times with the needle. Needing several attempts can be uncomfortable and may cause more problems for the patient. An ultrasound machine creates a picture of the inside of the body and could help guide the needle more accurately.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ultrasound to guide the needle for spinal or epidural injections is more effective and safer for adults than the usual method of feeling for bones. We compared the two methods to see which one:\n- was more likely to succeed on the first attempt\n- needed fewer needle attempts overall\n- was quicker to perform\n- made patients more satisfied\n- caused less pain or other side effects\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using ultrasound guidance with the usual method of feeling for bones for spinal or epidural injections in adults. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies with a total of 6823 adults. About half of the studies involved people in labour or having a caesarean section. The other studies involved adults having different types of surgery. All studies compared using ultrasound to guide the needle with the usual method of feeling for bones in the back.\n\nWhat did the studies show?\nCompared to the usual method of feeling for bones, using ultrasound guidance for spinal or epidural injections in adults:\n- leads to fewer needle attempts\n- makes the procedure quicker\n- probably helps the procedure succeed on the first try\n\nUltrasound guidance may make little to no difference to how satisfied people feel, or to whether the injection fails for technical reasons. We do not know if it affects pain during the procedure or other side effects.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. We are highly confident that using ultrasound leads to fewer needle attempts and a quicker procedure. We are moderately confident that it helps the procedure succeed on the first try. However, our confidence is low for the results on patient satisfaction and whether the injection fails for technical reasons, and very low for pain and side effects. Our confidence is lower for some findings because many studies were small. In some studies, there were also concerns about how they were conducted, which could lead to less trustworthy results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.",

I'm recommending 'NOT_APPROVED' not because of major flaws, but to incorporate a few minor revisions that will make it even more accessible to readers. Here are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Simplify the term 'technical reasons'.** This phrase is mild jargon and may be unclear to a lay audience.\n    - **Current text:** \"...whether the injection fails for technical reasons...\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** A reader might not know what a 'technical reason' is. It's better to use simpler, more direct language.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...whether the injection is unsuccessful.\"\n\n2. **Clarify why the evidence is less reliable.** The explanation for lower confidence is a bit vague.\n    - **Current text:** \"In some studies, there were also concerns about how they were conducted, which could lead to less trustworthy results.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** This doesn't explain *what* the concerns were, leaving the reader to guess. Being slightly more specific builds more trust.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Also, we had some concerns about the methods used in some studies, which could make their results less trustworthy.\"\n\n3. **Reduce the use of the complex word 'procedure'.** This word is used 10 times and can sometimes be replaced with a simpler alternative.\n    - **Current text:** \"...it also leads to fewer needle attempts and a quicker procedure.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** While not incorrect, replacing 'procedure' where possible can improve readability, as flagged by the vocabulary analysis.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...it also leads to fewer needle attempts and makes getting the injection quicker.\"\n\nThese small changes will enhance an already excellent summary. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing the draft is very well-written but could be refined by simplifying some vocabulary and phrasing.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft HIGHLY CONFORMS to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of its features falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, the analysis identified two minor deviations: 'nominalization' (P90) and 'complex_words_dc' (P90). This suggests that while the text is very good, it could be slightly improved by using more direct verbs instead of noun phrases and replacing a few more complex or uncommon words with simpler, everyday alternatives."
