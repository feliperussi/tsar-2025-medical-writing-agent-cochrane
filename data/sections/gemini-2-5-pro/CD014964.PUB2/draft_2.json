  "draft": "Is ultrasound guidance better than the traditional “feel” technique for spinal injections in adults?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For adults receiving spinal injections (a needle in the back to numb an area for surgery), using ultrasound to guide the needle means fewer attempts are needed and the procedure is quicker compared to the traditional method of feeling for bony landmarks. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound guidance on pain during the procedure or other unwanted effects.\n- Because there was not enough good-quality evidence, more research is needed to understand if using ultrasound guidance makes a difference to patient satisfaction, pain, or the risk of technical problems with the injection.\n\nWhat is neuraxial anaesthesia?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia is a type of pain relief that involves an injection into the back, near the spinal cord. It is often used during surgery or childbirth (for example, an epidural or a spinal block). To give the injection, doctors traditionally feel for bones in the back (anatomical landmarks) to guide the needle to the correct spot. However, this method can be difficult and may not always be accurate, sometimes requiring several attempts with the needle. Multiple attempts can be uncomfortable for the patient and may increase the risk of complications. Using an ultrasound machine, which creates a picture of the inside of the body, could help guide the needle more accurately.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using ultrasound to guide the needle for neuraxial anaesthesia is more effective and safer for adults than the standard method of using anatomical landmarks. We compared the two methods to see which one:\n- was more likely to be successful on the first attempt;\n- required fewer needle attempts overall;\n- took less time to perform;\n- led to greater patient satisfaction;\n- caused less pain or other unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using ultrasound guidance with using anatomical landmarks for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 65 studies with a total of 6823 adult participants from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Oceania. About half of the studies focused on people in labour or having a caesarean section, while the rest involved adults having other types of surgery. The studies compared using ultrasound to guide the needle with the usual method of using anatomical landmarks to find the right place for different types of anaesthesia in the back (neuraxial anaesthesia).\n\nCompared to using anatomical landmarks, using ultrasound guidance for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults means fewer needle attempts are needed and the procedure is quicker. It probably increases the chance of the procedure being successful on the first try. Ultrasound guidance may make little to no difference to how satisfied people are with the procedure or to whether the procedure fails for technical reasons. We do not know if ultrasound guidance has an effect on pain during the procedure or on side effects.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited because some studies were small and may not have chosen their participants in a balanced way. Also, some findings were based on what people told the researchers, which can be less reliable. This means the results might not apply to everyone.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023.",

Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Simplify technical terms after they have been defined.** You do a great job explaining 'anatomical landmarks', but then continue to use the technical term. This can be tiring for readers. After the first use, switch to simpler language.\n   - **INSTEAD OF:** '...the usual method of using anatomical landmarks to find the right place...'\n   - **CONSIDER:** '...the usual method of feeling for bones in the back to find the right place...'\n\n2. **Make the 'Limitations' section more concrete.** The explanation of the evidence limitations is a bit abstract and could be clearer for a lay audience.\n   - **INSTEAD OF:** '...some studies... may not have chosen their participants in a balanced way.'\n   - **CONSIDER:** '...some studies may have had flaws in how they selected people to take part, which could affect the results.'\n\n3. **Use more direct language in the Key Messages.** The second key message is a bit noun-heavy and could be more active.\n   - **INSTEAD OF:** '...more research is needed to understand if using ultrasound guidance makes a difference to patient satisfaction, pain, or the risk of technical problems with the injection.'\n   - **CONSIDER:** 'We need more good-quality research to know if ultrasound guidance improves how satisfied patients are, reduces pain, or lowers the risk of the injection failing for technical reasons.'\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found higher-than-usual numbers of long words, complex words, and noun-form verbs ('nominalizations'). Addressing these points will make an already good summary even better.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical patterns in sentence length and active voice (72% of metrics are in the best quartile). However, it deviates from typical patterns in vocabulary, with higher-than-usual counts of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), total nouns, long words, and complex words from the Dale-Chall list. This suggests the text could be made more direct and accessible by simplifying word choices and sentence structures."
