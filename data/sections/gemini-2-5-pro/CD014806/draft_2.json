  "draft": "Can giving sugar water to newborn babies reduce pain from heel prick tests?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving newborn babies a small amount of sugar water by mouth probably helps to reduce their pain during heel prick tests (a procedure to take a small blood sample from the baby's heel) compared to giving plain water or no treatment. The studies found only minor unwanted effects that did not require any treatment.\n- Giving sugar water appears to be about as effective for pain relief as giving glucose (another type of sugar), expressed breast milk, or providing skin-to-skin contact with a parent.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear how effective sugar water is compared to other comforting methods like breastfeeding or non-nutritive sucking (giving a baby a pacifier to suck on). More research is needed to understand if combining sugar water with other pain-relief methods is more effective.\n\nWhy is pain relief important for newborn babies?\nNewborn babies (neonates) sometimes need to have minor but painful medical procedures, such as a 'heel lance'. This is where a small cut is made on the baby's heel to get a blood sample for testing. Because these procedures can cause pain and distress, researchers are looking for simple and safe ways to provide comfort and pain relief. One method that has been studied is giving babies a small amount of sucrose (a type of sugar) by mouth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving sucrose helps to relieve pain for newborn babies undergoing a heel lance. We also wanted to know how sucrose compared with other potential pain-relieving methods, such as giving water, breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact, or non-nutritive sucking (giving a pacifier).\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving sucrose versus other treatments or no treatment for pain relief in newborn babies having a heel lance. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 55 studies with a total of 6273 newborn babies. Some studies included full-term babies (born at or after 37 weeks of pregnancy), some included preterm babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy), and some included a mix of both. The studies looked at the pain-relieving effects of giving sugar water for heel prick tests. They compared giving sugar water with other options, such as giving plain water, no treatment, other comforting methods (like giving a pacifier, breastfeeding, or skin-to-skin care), or other types of pain relief.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nGiving a small amount of sugar water by mouth probably reduces pain for newborn babies having a heel prick test, compared to giving plain water or no treatment.\n\nSugar water may make little to no difference in pain when compared to giving glucose (another type of sugar), expressed breast milk, or providing skin-to-skin care.\n\nWe are uncertain if sugar water is more or less effective than other comfort measures. These include non-nutritive sucking (using a pacifier), breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, or facilitated tucking (holding the baby in a curled position). We also do not know if combining sugar water with a pacifier is more effective than using a pacifier alone.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for some comparisons. This is because the studies included different types of babies (full-term and preterm) and used different ways of measuring pain. Also, for many of the comfort measures we looked at, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up-to-date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, well-structured draft that is factually accurate and meets all critical requirements. To make it even clearer for patients, I recommend focusing on three key areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Replace uncommon words with simpler alternatives.** Some words, while technically correct, may be unfamiliar to a lay audience. Using more common language will make the summary easier to read. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of words from the Dale-Chall 'unfamiliar' list.\n    *   **Example 1:** 'Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear how effective sugar water is...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'Because there was not enough good-quality evidence, it is unclear how effective sugar water is...'\n    *   **Example 2:** '...for newborn babies undergoing a heel lance.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** '...for newborn babies who are having a heel lance.'\n\n2. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of nouns.** The draft has a very high number of nouns compared to a typical PLS. This can make sentences feel abstract and less active. Converting noun phrases into verbs makes the writing more engaging and easier to understand.\n    *   **Example:** 'The studies looked at the pain-relieving effects of giving sugar water for heel prick tests.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'The studies looked at how well giving sugar water relieved pain during heel prick tests.'\n\n3. **Briefly explain how pain was measured.** The methods section is very concise, but readers might wonder how researchers can measure pain in babies. Adding a short explanation provides helpful context.\n    *   **Current text:** 'We searched for studies that compared giving sucrose versus other treatments or no treatment for pain relief in newborn babies having a heel lance. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We searched for studies that compared giving sucrose with other treatments or no treatment for pain relief in newborn babies having a heel lance. In these studies, researchers measured pain using scoring systems that look at things like crying and facial expressions. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of metrics in the best quartile. However, two metrics deviate significantly: the noun count is beyond the 90th percentile, and the count of Dale-Chall complex (unfamiliar) words is in the 90th percentile range. This suggests the text could be made more direct and use more common vocabulary to improve readability for a lay audience."
