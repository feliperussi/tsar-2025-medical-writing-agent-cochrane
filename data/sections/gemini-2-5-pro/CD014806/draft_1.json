  "draft": "Can giving sugar water to newborn babies reduce pain from heel prick tests?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Giving newborn babies a small amount of sugar water by mouth probably helps to reduce their pain during heel prick tests (a procedure to take a small blood sample from the baby's heel) compared to giving plain water or no treatment. The studies found only minor unwanted effects that did not require any treatment.\n- Giving sugar water appears to be about as effective for pain relief as giving glucose (another type of sugar), expressed breast milk, or providing skin-to-skin contact with a parent.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear how effective sugar water is compared to other comforting methods like breastfeeding or non-nutritive sucking (giving a baby a pacifier to suck on). More research is needed to understand if combining sugar water with other pain-relief methods is more effective.\n\n**Why is pain relief important for newborn babies?**\nNewborn babies (neonates) sometimes need to have minor but painful medical procedures, such as a 'heel lance'. This is where a small cut is made on the baby's heel to get a blood sample for testing. Because these procedures can cause pain and distress, researchers are looking for simple and safe ways to provide comfort and pain relief. One method that has been studied is giving babies a small amount of sucrose (a type of sugar) by mouth.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to find out if giving sucrose helps to relieve pain for newborn babies undergoing a heel lance. We also wanted to know how sucrose compared with other potential pain-relieving methods, such as giving water, breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact, or non-nutritive sucking (giving a pacifier).\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared giving sucrose versus other treatments or no treatment for pain relief in newborn babies having a heel lance. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nThe review included 55 trials involving a total of 6273 infants. The participants were either term neonates (in 29 studies), preterm neonates (in 22 studies), or a mix of both (in four studies). The studies assessed the pain-relieving effects of sucrose for heel-lance procedures. The comparisons for sucrose included water, placebo, or no intervention, non-nutritive sucking (NNS), glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, music, laser acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and skin-to-skin care. The abstract did not provide information on the duration of the studies, the countries where they were conducted, or their funding sources.\n\n**Main results: Sucrose for heel lance procedures in newborn babies**\nFor newborn babies having a heel lance procedure, giving a small amount of sucrose (sugar water) by mouth probably reduces their pain compared to giving plain water or no treatment.\n\nSucrose may make little to no difference in pain scores when compared to giving glucose, expressed breast milk, or providing skin-to-skin care.\n\nWe do not know if sucrose has an effect on pain when compared to other comfort measures like non-nutritive sucking (using a pacifier), breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, or facilitated tucking (holding the baby in a curled position). We also do not know if adding sucrose to non-nutritive sucking is more effective than non-nutritive sucking alone.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies included different types of babies and used different ways of measuring pain. Also, for many outcomes, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**Date of the evidence**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs a few revisions to meet our style guide and improve clarity for readers. The main issue is that several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a requirement. Additionally, some sentences are dense with technical terms, and the final sentence about the date of the evidence is awkwardly phrased.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions.** Several subheadings do not follow the required question format, which makes the summary harder for readers to navigate.\n   - **Problematic subheadings:** 'Methods', 'Main results: Sucrose for heel lance procedures in newborn babies', 'Limitations of the evidence', 'Date of the evidence'.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Please change these to questions, for example: 'How did we conduct the review?', 'What were the main results?', 'What are the limitations of the evidence?', and 'How up-to-date is this evidence?'.\n\n2. **Simplify the dense list of comparisons.** The sentence listing all the comparison treatments is long and packed with nouns, making it difficult to read.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The comparisons for sucrose included water, placebo, or no intervention, non-nutritive sucking (NNS), glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, music, laser acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and skin-to-skin care.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies compared giving sucrose with other options, such as giving plain water, no treatment, other comforting methods (like giving a pacifier, breastfeeding, or skin-to-skin care), or other types of pain relief.\"\n\n3. **Remove irrelevant information about the abstract.** The results section includes a sentence about what the abstract *didn't* contain. This is confusing and not helpful for a patient reader who wants to know the study's findings.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The abstract did not provide information on the duration of the studies, the countries where they were conducted, or their funding sources.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Please remove this sentence. The PLS should focus on summarizing the review's findings, not commenting on the source abstract.\n\n4. **Clarify the evidence currency statement.** The final sentence is grammatically awkward and uses jargon ('of search').\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Please simplify this to: \"The evidence is up-to-date to February 2022.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, the analysis also flags three key deviations that support the need for revision: the number of nouns is significantly higher than typical (BEYOND_P90), as are the counts of long words (P90) and Dale-Chall complex words (P90). These metrics indicate that the vocabulary is more complex and noun-heavy than is ideal for a lay audience, reinforcing the recommendation to simplify dense sentences."
