  "plain_title": "Can giving sugar water to newborn babies reduce pain from heel prick tests?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Giving newborn babies a small amount of sugar water by mouth probably helps to reduce their pain during heel prick tests (a procedure to take a small blood sample from the baby's heel) compared to giving plain water or no treatment. The studies found only minor unwanted effects that did not require any treatment.",
    "Giving sugar water appears to be about as effective for pain relief as giving glucose (another type of sugar), expressed breast milk, or providing skin-to-skin contact with a parent.",
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear how effective sugar water is compared to other comforting methods like breastfeeding or non-nutritive sucking (giving a baby a pacifier to suck on). More research is needed to understand if combining sugar water with other pain-relief methods is more effective."

      "subheading": "Why is pain relief important for newborn babies?",
      "content": "Newborn babies (neonates) sometimes need to have minor but painful medical procedures, such as a 'heel lance'. This is where a small cut is made on the baby's heel to get a blood sample for testing. Because these procedures can cause pain and distress, researchers are looking for simple and safe ways to provide comfort and pain relief. One method that has been studied is giving babies a small amount of sucrose (a type of sugar) by mouth."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if giving sucrose helps to relieve pain for newborn babies undergoing a heel lance. We also wanted to know how sucrose compared with other potential pain-relieving methods, such as giving water, breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact, or non-nutritive sucking (giving a pacifier)."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 55 trials involving a total of 6273 infants. The participants were either term neonates (in 29 studies), preterm neonates (in 22 studies), or a mix of both (in four studies). The studies assessed the pain-relieving effects of sucrose for heel-lance procedures. The comparisons for sucrose included water, placebo, or no intervention, non-nutritive sucking (NNS), glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, music, laser acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and skin-to-skin care. The abstract did not provide information on the duration of the studies, the countries where they were conducted, or their funding sources."

      "content": "For newborn babies having a heel lance procedure, giving a small amount of sucrose (sugar water) by mouth probably reduces their pain compared to giving plain water or no treatment.\n\nSucrose may make little to no difference in pain scores when compared to giving glucose, expressed breast milk, or providing skin-to-skin care.\n\nWe do not know if sucrose has an effect on pain when compared to other comfort measures like non-nutritive sucking (using a pacifier), breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, or facilitated tucking (holding the baby in a curled position). We also do not know if adding sucrose to non-nutritive sucking is more effective than non-nutritive sucking alone."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies included different types of babies and used different ways of measuring pain. Also, for many outcomes, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search."
