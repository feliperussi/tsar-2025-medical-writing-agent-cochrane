  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medications taken by mouth for Ménière’s disease (a condition that causes vertigo, hearing loss, and ringing in the ears)?\n\n- It is very uncertain whether medications taken by mouth (such as betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, or corticosteroids) help to improve the symptoms of Ménière’s disease. The available studies also provided very little information about possible harmful effects.\n- Future studies on Ménière’s disease need to be better designed and should agree on the best ways to measure symptoms like vertigo (a spinning sensation). They should also carefully record any unwanted effects of the treatment.\n\nWhat is Ménière's disease and how is it treated?\nMénière's disease is a condition of the inner ear that causes repeated, sudden attacks of dizziness or a spinning sensation (vertigo). These attacks are also associated with hearing loss and a ringing or buzzing sound in the ears (tinnitus). The cause of Ménière's disease is unknown. A number of different medicines that are taken by mouth (systemic pharmacological interventions) are used to try and manage the condition and prevent the attacks. These include betahistine, diuretics (water tablets), antiviral medicines and corticosteroids. However, it is not clear how well these different treatments work.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of these different medicines for people with Ménière's disease. We compared the medicines to either a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment at all.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared different medicines (such as betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids) against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 10 studies with a total of 848 adults diagnosed with definite or probable Ménière's disease. The studies evaluated several drug treatments, including betahistine, diuretics, antivirals, and corticosteroids, comparing them to either a placebo or no treatment. The review did not find any studies that assessed antihistamines. All included studies followed participants for at least three months. For people with Ménière's disease, it is unclear if taking these medicines by mouth has any effect on vertigo symptoms. The available evidence is not reliable enough to determine if these treatments offer any benefits or if they are associated with any harms.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies that have been done are very small. The studies also used different ways to measure the effects of the treatments, and not all of them provided data on the outcomes that we were interested in.\n\nEvidence currency\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.",

However, it cannot be approved because it fails a critical check: several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is required by the style guide. Addressing this and two minor wording issues will make the summary ready for publication.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase subheadings as questions:** Three subheadings do not follow the required question format, which helps guide the reader.\n    -   **Quote:** \"Methods\"\n    -   **Suggestion:** \"How did we conduct the review?\"\n    -   **Quote:** \"Limitations of the evidence\"\n    -   **Suggestion:** \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n    -   **Quote:** \"Evidence currency\"\n    -   **Suggestion:** \"How up to date is this evidence?\"\n\n2.  **Simplify the currency statement:** The final sentence is phrased in a slightly unnatural way.\n    -   **Quote:** \"The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.\"\n    -   **Suggestion:** \"This evidence is up to date to September 2022.\"\n\n3.  **Remove unnecessary technical jargon:** The summary does a great job explaining technical terms, but in one case, the term itself isn't needed.\n    -   **Quote:** \"A number of different medicines that are taken by mouth (systemic pharmacological interventions) are used...\"\n    -   **Suggestion:** Since you've already explained what they are, you can remove the technical term in parentheses: \"A number of different medicines that are taken by mouth are used...\"",

An impressive 78% of metrics fall within the best quartile for readability and clarity, indicating the text is easy to understand. The only minor deviation is a slightly high count of long words (P90), which aligns with the editorial feedback to simplify the term 'systemic pharmacological interventions'."
