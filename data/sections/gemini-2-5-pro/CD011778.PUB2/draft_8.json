  "draft": "What happens when light-activated therapy is added to deep cleaning for gum disease?\n\nWe are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy (a treatment that uses a special dye and light to kill germs) to deep cleaning (cleaning below the gum line) helps to treat gum disease. The evidence suggests that any improvement is likely too small to be important. Most studies reported no unwanted effects from the therapy.\n\nWe cannot draw clear conclusions from the evidence because most studies were small and not well-designed. We need larger, better-designed studies to find out if this treatment is truly helpful for people with gum disease, and to see if it works for problems around dental implants.\n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontitis and peri-implant diseases are long-term infections in the mouth. Periodontitis affects the gums and bone that support natural teeth. Peri-implant diseases affect the same tissues, but around dental implants. Without treatment, these conditions can worsen over time, and people may lose teeth or implants. To treat these conditions, a healthcare worker deeply cleans the pockets around teeth or implants to remove the harmful film of bacteria. Healthcare workers call this deep cleaning ‘subgingival instrumentation’ or ‘scaling and root planing’.\n\nWhat is light-activated therapy?\nA treatment called 'light-activated therapy' can be added to deep cleaning. It is also known as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. It aims to kill the bacteria that cause the infection. A healthcare worker applies a light-sensitive liquid to the infected area and then shines a special light on it. The light activates the liquid, which destroys the bacteria.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if adding light-activated therapy to standard deep cleaning works better for treating these conditions in adults than deep cleaning alone or with a fake (placebo) light-activated therapy treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared deep cleaning plus light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone or with a fake light-activated therapy. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 50 studies that included a total of 1407 adults with gum disease (periodontitis) or diseases around dental implants (peri-implant diseases). The studies compared deep cleaning combined with light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone.\n\nFor people with periodontitis, we are very uncertain about the effects of adding light-activated therapy. It may do little or nothing to improve the condition and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of unwanted side effects.\n\nWe did not find enough evidence to understand the effects of this therapy for people with diseases around dental implants. This is because we found no studies in people with the more severe form of the disease (peri-implantitis) and only one very small study in people with the milder form (peri-implant mucositis).\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few key reasons. The studies were very small and used different methods to give the treatment. Also, the studies did not always hide which treatment people received. This is a problem because if people know which treatment they are getting, it can affect how they report their symptoms and bias the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and meets all critical requirements. However, it is not yet approved because several areas could be clearer for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make the methods section easier to scan.** The paragraph under 'How did we conduct this review?' is a dense block of text describing three distinct steps. This makes it hard for readers to quickly understand your process.\n    *   **Current text:** 'We searched for studies that compared deep cleaning plus light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone or with a fake light-activated therapy. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Break this into a bulleted list to improve scannability:\n        'To conduct this review, we:\\n        - searched for studies comparing deep cleaning plus light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone;\\n        - combined the results from the studies;\\n        - rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n\n2. **Simplify the explanation of study limitations.** The description of bias is a bit wordy and indirect, which could confuse readers who are unfamiliar with research methods.\n    *   **Current text:** 'Also, the studies did not always hide which treatment people received. This is a problem because if people know which treatment they are getting, it can affect how they report their symptoms and bias the results.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Use more direct language: 'Also, in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. This can bias the results, because knowing which treatment you receive can affect how you report your symptoms.'\n\n3. **Refine wording for precision and clarity.** Some phrasing could be more direct. For example, the definition of the therapy in the key message is less precise than in the main text and could be improved.\n    *   **Current text (in key message):** '...light-activated therapy (a treatment that uses a special dye and light to kill germs)...'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite (to match source):** '...light-activated therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill germs after they have been treated with a special dye)...'\n\nAddressing these points will help make the summary more accessible. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing higher-than-usual counts for 'nominalization' (noun-form verbs) and 'long_words', which can make text feel dense and overly formal.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, the analysis flags three metrics for review: 'nominalization', 'nouns', and 'long_words' are in the P90 range, deviating from typical patterns. This suggests the text, while generally clear, may contain sections with unnecessarily complex vocabulary and sentence structures that could be simplified."
