  "draft": "What happens when light-activated therapy is added to deep cleaning for gum disease?\n\nWe are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy to deep cleaning helps treat gum disease. This therapy uses a special dye and light to kill germs. The evidence suggests that any improvement is likely too small to be important. Most studies reported no unwanted effects from the light-activated therapy.\n\nThe evidence is not strong enough for us to draw clear conclusions because most studies were small and not well-designed. We need larger, better-designed studies to find out if this treatment is truly helpful for people with gum disease, and to see if it works for problems around dental implants.\n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontitis and peri-implant diseases are long-term infections in the mouth. Periodontitis affects the gums and bone that support natural teeth. Peri-implant diseases affect the same tissues, but around dental implants. Without treatment, these conditions can worsen over time, and people may lose teeth or implants. To treat these conditions, a healthcare worker deeply cleans the pockets around teeth or implants to remove the harmful film of bacteria. This deep cleaning is also called ‘subgingival instrumentation’ or ‘scaling and root planing’.\n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy?\nDoctors can add antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) to deep cleaning. It aims to kill the bacteria that cause the infection. A healthcare worker applies a light-sensitive liquid to the infected area and then shines a special light on it. The light activates the liquid, which destroys the bacteria. We will call this 'light-activated therapy' in this summary.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if adding light-activated therapy to standard deep cleaning works better for treating these conditions in adults than deep cleaning alone or with a fake (placebo) light-activated therapy treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe did the following:\n- We searched for studies that compared deep cleaning plus light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone or with a fake light-activated therapy.\n- We combined the results from the studies.\n- We rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 50 studies that included a total of 1407 adults with gum disease (periodontitis) or diseases around dental implants (peri-implant diseases). The studies compared deep cleaning combined with light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone.\n\nFor people with periodontitis, we are very uncertain about the effects of adding light-activated therapy. It may do little or nothing to improve the condition and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of unwanted side effects.\n\nWe did not find enough evidence to understand the effects of this therapy for people with diseases around dental implants. This is because we found no studies in people with the more severe form of the disease (peri-implantitis) and only one very small study in people with the milder form (peri-implant mucositis).\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few key reasons:\n- The studies were very small.\n- They used different methods to give the treatment.\n- The studies did not always hide which treatment people received. Knowing which treatment they were getting can influence how they report their symptoms and can bias the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to February 2024.",

However, to further improve readability for a lay audience, I recommend focusing on making the language more direct and active. Here are the top 3 suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.**\n   - **Quote:** \"The evidence is not strong enough for us to draw clear conclusions...\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** This phrasing is slightly indirect. Using a direct verb makes it clearer who is acting and is easier for readers to process, aligning with the style guide's preference for active voice.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We cannot draw clear conclusions from the evidence...\"\n\n2. **Simplify the explanation of bias in the limitations section.**\n   - **Quote:** \"Knowing which treatment they were getting can influence how they report their symptoms and can bias the results.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** This sentence explains a complex idea well, but it could be broken down to make it even easier to digest. Separating the cause from the effect can improve clarity.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This is a problem because if people know which treatment they are getting, it can influence how they report their symptoms and bias the results.\"\n\n3. **Introduce the plain language term for the therapy upfront.**\n   - **Quote:** The final sentence of the paragraph defining the therapy says: \"We will call this 'light-activated therapy' in this summary.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** Introducing the plain language term at the end of the paragraph is less effective. Stating it at the beginning helps the reader immediately associate the technical term with the simpler one they will see throughout the summary.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Start the paragraph like this: \"What is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy? Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), which we will call 'light-activated therapy' in this summary, can be added to deep cleaning...\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These suggestions will help address the pattern of high nominalization (22 instances vs. a typical median of <13) and noun usage noted in the linguistic analysis, making the text more active and direct for the reader.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity, with high counts for nominalization (P90), total nouns (P90), and long words (P90). These metrics support the editorial feedback to make the language more direct by using more verbs and simplifying sentence structures where possible."
