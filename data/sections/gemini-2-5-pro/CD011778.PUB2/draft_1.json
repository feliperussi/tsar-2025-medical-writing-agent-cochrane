  "draft": "What happens when light-activated therapy is added to deep cleaning for gum disease?\n\nWe are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill germs after they have been treated with a special dye) to deep cleaning (cleaning below the gum line) helps to treat gum disease. The available evidence suggests that any improvement is likely to be too small to be important. No unwanted effects of the light-activated therapy were reported in most studies.\nThe evidence is not strong enough to draw clear conclusions because most studies were small and had design flaws. Larger, better-designed studies are needed to find out if this treatment is truly helpful for people with gum disease, and to see if it works for problems around dental implants.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontitis and peri-implant diseases are long-term infections in the mouth. Periodontitis affects the gums and bone that support natural teeth. Peri-implant diseases affect the same tissues but around dental implants. If left untreated, these conditions can cause progressive damage, leading to the loss of teeth or implants. The standard treatment is a deep cleaning procedure (called 'subgingival instrumentation' or 'scaling and root planing') to remove the harmful film of bacteria from the pockets around the teeth or implants.\n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy?\nAntimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a treatment that can be used in addition to deep cleaning. It aims to kill the bacteria causing the infection. It involves applying a light-sensitive liquid to the infected area and then shining a special light on it to activate the liquid and destroy the bacteria.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if adding aPDT to standard deep cleaning is better for treating periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults than deep cleaning alone or with a fake (placebo) aPDT treatment.\n\nMethods\n\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched for studies that compared standard treatment for gum disease with an added light-based therapy against standard treatment alone or with a fake light-based therapy.\n\nData Synthesis\nWe then combined the results of these studies.\n\nEvidence Confidence\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 50 studies with a total of 1407 adults diagnosed with gum disease (periodontitis) or diseases around dental implants (peri-implant diseases). The studies compared standard deep cleaning combined with a special light therapy (antimicrobial photodynamic therapy) versus the standard cleaning alone. For people with periodontitis, we are very uncertain about the effects of adding the light therapy. The treatment may have little to no effect on improving the condition and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of unwanted side effects. There was not enough evidence to know the effects of this light therapy for people with diseases around dental implants as the review found no studies that included people with peri-implantitis and only one very small study on people with peri-implant mucositis.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it fails a critical style guide rule and has significant clarity issues that need to be addressed before approval.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. Many current subheadings are simple labels.\n   - **Problematic Headings:** \"Introduction\", \"Methods\", \"Search Strategy\", \"Data Synthesis\", \"Evidence Confidence\", \"Results\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\".\n   - **Suggested Rewrites:** Please replace these with questions. For example, change \"Limitations of the evidence\" to \"How reliable is the evidence?\" and \"Currency of the evidence\" to \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\". The very short, simplistic sub-sections under 'Methods' should be combined into a single paragraph under one question-based heading like \"How did we conduct this review?\".\n\n2. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with active verbs.** The text uses many 'nominalizations' (verbs turned into nouns), which makes sentences more abstract and harder to read. This was confirmed by the linguistic analysis, which found the use of nominalizations was exceptionally high.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"The standard treatment is a deep cleaning procedure (called 'subgingival instrumentation' or 'scaling and root planing') to remove the harmful film of bacteria from the pockets around the teeth or implants.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This 35-word sentence is dense with nouns ('treatment', 'procedure', 'instrumentation'). Using more direct verbs makes it clearer.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Standard treatment involves a deep cleaning (also called 'subgingival instrumentation' or 'scaling and root planing'). This removes the harmful film of bacteria from the pockets around teeth or implants.\"\n\n3. **Simplify awkward or technical phrasing.** Some sentences are phrased in a way that is unnatural for a lay reader.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"The evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"of search\" is jargon and sounds awkward.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This evidence is up-to-date to February 2024.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 50% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability. However, there are significant deviations in vocabulary complexity that require attention. The draft scored 'BEYOND_P90' for 'nominalization' (28 instances vs. a typical median of <13) and 'P90' for 'nouns' and 'long_words'. These scores indicate that the text relies too heavily on complex noun forms instead of simpler, more direct verbs, which can make the text less clear and engaging for a lay audience."
