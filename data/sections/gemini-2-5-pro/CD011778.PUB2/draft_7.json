  "draft": "What happens when light-activated therapy is added to deep cleaning for gum disease?\n\nWe are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy to deep cleaning helps treat gum disease. This therapy uses a special dye and light to kill germs. The evidence suggests that any improvement is likely too small to be important. Most studies reported no unwanted effects from the light-activated therapy.\n\nWe cannot draw clear conclusions from the evidence because most studies were small and not well-designed. We need larger, better-designed studies to find out if this treatment is truly helpful for people with gum disease, and to see if it works for problems around dental implants.\n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontitis and peri-implant diseases are long-term infections in the mouth. Periodontitis affects the gums and bone that support natural teeth. Peri-implant diseases affect the same tissues, but around dental implants. Without treatment, these conditions can worsen over time, and people may lose teeth or implants. To treat these conditions, a healthcare worker deeply cleans the pockets around teeth or implants to remove the harmful film of bacteria. This deep cleaning is also called ‘subgingival instrumentation’ or ‘scaling and root planing’.\n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy?\nAntimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), which we will call 'light-activated therapy' in this summary, can be added to deep cleaning. It aims to kill the bacteria that cause the infection. A healthcare worker applies a light-sensitive liquid to the infected area and then shines a special light on it. The light activates the liquid, which destroys the bacteria.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if adding light-activated therapy to standard deep cleaning works better for treating these conditions in adults than deep cleaning alone or with a fake (placebo) light-activated therapy treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared deep cleaning plus light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone or with a fake light-activated therapy. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 50 studies that included a total of 1407 adults with gum disease (periodontitis) or diseases around dental implants (peri-implant diseases). The studies compared deep cleaning combined with light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone.\n\nFor people with periodontitis, we are very uncertain about the effects of adding light-activated therapy. It may do little or nothing to improve the condition and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of unwanted side effects.\n\nWe did not find enough evidence to understand the effects of this therapy for people with diseases around dental implants. This is because we found no studies in people with the more severe form of the disease (peri-implantitis) and only one very small study in people with the milder form (peri-implant mucositis).\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few key reasons. The studies were very small and used different methods to give the treatment. Also, the studies did not always hide which treatment people received. This is a problem because if people know which treatment they are getting, it can influence how they report their symptoms and bias the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "While this summary is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issue is a pattern of dense, noun-heavy language and the use of unnecessarily long or technical words, which makes the text less direct and engaging. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make sentences more active by using verbs instead of nouns.** The summary is dense with nouns, which can make it harder to read. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing a high number of 'nominalizations' (verbs turned into nouns).\n    - **Example:** \"This deep cleaning is also called ‘subgingival instrumentation’ or ‘scaling and root planing’.”\n    - **Problem:** This sentence is passive and relies on a complex noun ('instrumentation').\n    - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this more directly, for example: \"Healthcare workers call this deep cleaning ‘subgingival instrumentation’ or ‘scaling and root planing’.”\n\n2. **Simplify technical explanations and remove unnecessary acronyms.** Introducing acronyms that are immediately replaced adds clutter for the reader.\n    - **Example:** \"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), which we will call 'light-activated therapy' in this summary, can be added to deep cleaning.\"\n    - **Problem:** The acronym 'aPDT' is technical jargon that isn't used again, so defining it is not helpful for a plain language summary.\n    - **Suggestion:** Introduce the plain language term first: \"A treatment called 'light-activated therapy' can be added to deep cleaning. It is also known as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy.\"\n\n3. **Replace longer words with simpler alternatives.** The analysis shows a high number of long words, which can slow readers down. Focusing on shorter, more common words will make the text more accessible.\n    - **Example:** \"...it can influence how they report their symptoms and bias the results.\"\n    - **Problem:** 'Influence' is a longer, more formal word.\n    - **Suggestion:** Use a simpler word: \"...it can affect how they report their symptoms and bias the results.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate the draft is highly readable in terms of sentence structure, with excellent scores for sentence length (15.89 words, P25) and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (9.25, P25). However, the summary deviates from typical PLS patterns in its vocabulary, with high values for nominalization (22.0, P90), noun count (163.0, P90), and long words (173.0, P90). This suggests that while sentences are short, the word choice is unnecessarily complex and noun-heavy, making the text denser than it needs to be."
