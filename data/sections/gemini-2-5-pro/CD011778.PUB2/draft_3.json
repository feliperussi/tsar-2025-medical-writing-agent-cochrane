  "draft": "What happens when light-activated therapy is added to deep cleaning for gum disease?\n\nWe are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy (a treatment that uses a special dye and light to kill germs) to deep cleaning (cleaning below the gum line) helps to treat gum disease. The evidence suggests this treatment is unlikely to help in a meaningful way. Most studies reported no unwanted effects from the light-activated therapy.\n\nThe evidence is not strong enough for us to draw clear conclusions because most studies were small and not well-designed. We need larger, better-designed studies to find out if this treatment is truly helpful for people with gum disease, and to see if it works for problems around dental implants.\n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontitis and peri-implant diseases are long-term infections in the mouth. Periodontitis affects the gums and bone that support natural teeth. Peri-implant diseases affect the same tissues, but around dental implants. If people do not get treatment, these conditions can cause damage that gets worse over time, leading to the loss of teeth or implants. The standard treatment is a deep cleaning (which doctors also call 'subgingival instrumentation' or 'scaling and root planing'). This procedure removes the harmful film of bacteria from the pockets around teeth or implants.\n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy?\nAntimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a treatment that doctors can use in addition to deep cleaning. It aims to kill the bacteria that cause the infection. A healthcare worker applies a light-sensitive liquid to the infected area and then shines a special light on it. The light activates the liquid, which destroys the bacteria.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if adding aPDT to standard deep cleaning works better for treating these conditions in adults than deep cleaning alone or with a fake (placebo) aPDT treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared standard deep cleaning plus light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone or with a fake light-activated therapy. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 50 studies that included a total of 1407 adults with gum disease (periodontitis) or diseases around dental implants (peri-implant diseases). The studies compared deep cleaning combined with light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone. For people with periodontitis, we are very uncertain about the effects of adding light therapy. It may do little or nothing to improve the condition and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of unwanted side effects. We did not find enough evidence to understand the effects of this therapy for people with diseases around dental implants. This is because we found no studies in people with the more severe form of the disease (peri-implantitis) and only one very small study in people with the milder form (peri-implant mucositis).\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few key reasons. The studies were very small, used different methods to give the treatment, and people in the studies may have known which treatment they received.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to February 2024.",

The following suggestions focus on making the language even more direct and easier for readers to follow, addressing some patterns identified in the linguistic analysis.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Use stronger, more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.**\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"If people do not get treatment, these conditions can cause damage that gets worse over time, leading to the loss of teeth or implants.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"leading to the loss of\" is indirect. Using a direct verb makes the consequence clearer and the sentence more concise.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Without treatment, these conditions can worsen over time and people may lose teeth or implants.\"\n\n2.  **Improve the flow when defining technical terms.**\n    *   **Problematic sentences:** \"The standard treatment is a deep cleaning (which doctors also call 'subgingival instrumentation' or 'scaling and root planing'). This procedure removes the harmful film of bacteria from the pockets around teeth or implants.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The current structure is slightly disjointed. Combining the explanation with the definition of the terms improves readability.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The standard treatment is a deep cleaning to remove the harmful film of bacteria from the pockets around teeth or implants. Healthcare professionals sometimes call this ‘subgingival instrumentation’ or ‘scaling and root planing’.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify the structure of the main key message.**\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"We are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy (a treatment that uses a special dye and light to kill germs) to deep cleaning (cleaning below the gum line) helps to treat gum disease.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The main point is interrupted by two definitions in parentheses, making the sentence long and complex. Readers may lose track of the main finding.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy to deep cleaning helps treat gum disease. This therapy uses a special dye and light to kill germs.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a higher-than-typical number of nouns and nominalizations (the use of noun-forms of verbs). Shifting to more active verbs as suggested above will help address this and improve overall readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 72% of features in the best quartile for readability and structure. However, three metrics—nominalization (use of noun-forms of verbs), total nouns, and long words—deviate significantly from typical patterns (P90 range). This suggests the text could be improved by using more direct verbs and simplifying word choices to enhance clarity."
