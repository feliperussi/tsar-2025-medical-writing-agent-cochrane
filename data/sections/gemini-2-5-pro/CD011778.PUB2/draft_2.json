  "draft": "What happens when light-activated therapy is added to deep cleaning for gum disease?\n\nWe are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill germs after they have been treated with a special dye) to deep cleaning (cleaning below the gum line) helps to treat gum disease. The available evidence suggests that any improvement is likely to be too small to be important. Most studies reported no unwanted effects from the light-activated therapy.\n\nThe evidence is not strong enough to draw clear conclusions because most studies were small and had design flaws. Larger, better-designed studies are needed to find out if this treatment is truly helpful for people with gum disease, and to see if it works for problems around dental implants.\n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontitis and peri-implant diseases are long-term infections in the mouth. Periodontitis affects the gums and bone that support natural teeth. Peri-implant diseases affect the same tissues but around dental implants. If left untreated, these conditions can cause progressive damage, leading to the loss of teeth or implants. Standard treatment involves a deep cleaning (also called 'subgingival instrumentation' or 'scaling and root planing'). This removes the harmful film of bacteria from the pockets around teeth or implants.\n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy?\nAntimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a treatment that can be used in addition to deep cleaning. It aims to kill the bacteria causing the infection. It involves applying a light-sensitive liquid to the infected area and then shining a special light on it to activate the liquid and destroy the bacteria.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if adding aPDT to standard deep cleaning is better for treating periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults than deep cleaning alone or with a fake (placebo) aPDT treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared standard deep cleaning plus light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone or with a fake light-activated therapy. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 50 studies with a total of 1407 adults who had gum disease (periodontitis) or diseases around dental implants (peri-implant diseases). The studies compared standard deep cleaning combined with light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone. For people with periodontitis, we are very uncertain about the effects of adding the light therapy. It may have little to no effect on improving the condition and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of unwanted side effects. We did not find enough evidence to know the effects of this therapy for people with diseases around dental implants. The review found no studies in people with peri-implantitis and only one very small study in people with peri-implant mucositis.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few key reasons. The studies were very small, used different ways of delivering the treatment, and people involved may have known which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to February 2024.",

However, a few targeted edits will make it even easier for readers to understand by addressing some patterns of complex phrasing. \n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use more active and direct phrasing.** Some sentences use passive voice, which can make them less direct. Rewriting in the active voice makes it clearer who is doing what.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"...a treatment that uses light to kill germs after they have been treated with a special dye...\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"have been treated\" is passive and a bit wordy.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...a treatment where a special dye is applied to germs, which are then killed with light.\"\n\n2. **Replace abstract nouns with simpler, verb-focused phrases.** The text sometimes uses noun forms of verbs (e.g., \"improvement\" instead of \"improves\"), which can make sentences feel dense.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The available evidence suggests that any improvement is likely to be too small to be important.\"\n   - **Problem:** The word \"improvement\" is an abstract noun. Phrasing this more directly makes the meaning clearer.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The available evidence suggests that the treatment is unlikely to help in a meaningful way.\"\n\n3. **Simplify complex words where possible.** While technical terms are well-explained, some other words could be simpler.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"If left untreated, these conditions can cause progressive damage, leading to the loss of teeth or implants.\"\n   - **Problem:** \"Progressive\" might not be understood by all readers.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"If left untreated, these conditions can cause damage that gets worse over time, leading to the loss of teeth or implants.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows strong conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and simplicity. However, it deviates significantly in three areas: passive voice (19 instances, P90), use of noun-form verbs (nominalization at 23 instances, P90), and long words (166 instances, P90). These outliers suggest that while the text is generally clear, it could be made more direct and easier to read by focusing on active voice and simpler word choices."
