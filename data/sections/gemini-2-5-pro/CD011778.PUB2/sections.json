  "plain_title": "What happens when light-activated therapy is added to deep cleaning for gum disease?",
  "key_messages": [
    "We are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill germs after they have been treated with a special dye) to deep cleaning (cleaning below the gum line) helps to treat gum disease. The available evidence suggests that any improvement is likely to be too small to be important. No unwanted effects of the light-activated therapy were reported in most studies.",
    "The evidence is not strong enough to draw clear conclusions because most studies were small and had design flaws. Larger, better-designed studies are needed to find out if this treatment is truly helpful for people with gum disease, and to see if it works for problems around dental implants."

      "subheading": "What are periodontitis and peri-implant diseases?",
      "content": "Periodontitis and peri-implant diseases are long-term infections in the mouth. Periodontitis affects the gums and bone that support natural teeth. Peri-implant diseases affect the same tissues but around dental implants. If left untreated, these conditions can cause progressive damage, leading to the loss of teeth or implants. The standard treatment is a deep cleaning procedure (called 'subgingival instrumentation' or 'scaling and root planing') to remove the harmful film of bacteria from the pockets around the teeth or implants."

      "subheading": "What is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy?",
      "content": "Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a treatment that can be used in addition to deep cleaning. It aims to kill the bacteria causing the infection. It involves applying a light-sensitive liquid to the infected area and then shining a special light on it to activate the liquid and destroy the bacteria."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if adding aPDT to standard deep cleaning is better for treating periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults than deep cleaning alone or with a fake (placebo) aPDT treatment."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 50 studies with a total of 1407 adults diagnosed with gum disease (periodontitis) or diseases around dental implants (peri-implant diseases). The studies compared standard deep cleaning combined with a special light therapy (antimicrobial photodynamic therapy) versus the standard cleaning alone. For people with periodontitis, we are very uncertain about the effects of adding the light therapy. The treatment may have little to no effect on improving the condition and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of unwanted side effects. There was not enough evidence to know the effects of this light therapy for people with diseases around dental implants as the review found no studies that included people with peri-implantitis and only one very small study on people with peri-implant mucositis."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the studies were very small.",
