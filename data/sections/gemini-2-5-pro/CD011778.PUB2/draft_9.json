  "draft": "What happens when light-activated therapy is added to deep cleaning for gum disease?\n\nWe are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill germs after they have been treated with a special dye) to deep cleaning (cleaning below the gum line) helps to treat gum disease. The evidence suggests that any improvement is likely too small to be important. Most studies reported no unwanted effects from the therapy.\n\nWe cannot draw clear conclusions from the evidence because most studies were small and not well-designed. We need larger, better-designed studies to find out if this treatment is truly helpful for people with gum disease, and to see if it works for problems around dental implants.\n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontitis and peri-implant diseases are long-term infections in the mouth. Periodontitis affects the gums and bone that support natural teeth. Peri-implant diseases affect the same tissues, but around dental implants. Without treatment, these conditions can worsen over time, and people may lose teeth or implants. To treat these conditions, a healthcare worker deeply cleans the pockets around teeth or implants to remove the harmful film of bacteria. Healthcare workers call this deep cleaning ‘subgingival instrumentation’ or ‘scaling and root planing’.\n\nWhat is light-activated therapy?\nA treatment called 'light-activated therapy' can be added to deep cleaning. It is also known as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. It aims to kill the bacteria that cause the infection. A healthcare worker applies a light-sensitive liquid to the infected area and then shines a special light on it. The light activates the liquid, which destroys the bacteria.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if adding light-activated therapy to standard deep cleaning works better for treating these conditions in adults than deep cleaning alone or with a fake (placebo) light-activated therapy treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nTo conduct this review, we:\n- searched for studies that compared deep cleaning plus light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone or with a fake light-activated therapy;\n- combined the results from the studies;\n- rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 50 studies that included a total of 1407 adults with gum disease (periodontitis) or diseases around dental implants (peri-implant diseases). The studies compared deep cleaning combined with light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone.\n\nFor people with periodontitis, we are very uncertain about the effects of adding light-activated therapy. It may do little or nothing to improve the condition and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of unwanted side effects.\n\nWe did not find enough evidence to understand the effects of this therapy for people with diseases around dental implants. This is because we found no studies in people with the more severe form of the disease (peri-implantitis) and only one very small study in people with the milder form (peri-implant mucositis).\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few key reasons. The studies were very small and used different methods to give the treatment. Also, in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. This can bias the results, because knowing which treatment you receive can affect how you report your symptoms.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. All critical checks have passed. However, to make it even clearer for readers, I have three suggestions focused on making the language more active and direct. These changes will help address the high number of passive constructions, noun-heavy sentences, and long words identified in the linguistic analysis.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make sentences more active and direct.**\n   - **Quote:** \"A treatment called 'light-activated therapy' can be added to deep cleaning.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** The passive voice (\"can be added\") is less direct. Using active voice clarifies: \"A healthcare worker can add a treatment called 'light-activated therapy' to deep cleaning.\"\n\n2. **Simplify long, repetitive sentences for better clarity.**\n   - **Quote:** \"We wanted to find out if adding light-activated therapy to standard deep cleaning works better for treating these conditions in adults than deep cleaning alone or with a fake (placebo) light-activated therapy treatment.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** This sentence is long and repeats the phrase \"light-activated therapy,\" which can make it hard for readers to follow.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if adding light-activated therapy to deep cleaning works better than deep cleaning alone or with a fake (placebo) therapy.\"\n\n3. **Improve the flow of the methods section.**\n   - **Quote:** \"How did we conduct this review?\\nTo conduct this review, we:\\n- searched for studies...;\\n- combined the results...;\\n- rated our confidence...\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** The introductory phrase \"To conduct this review, we:\" is redundant with the heading, and the list format breaks the narrative flow. A short paragraph would be more direct and easier to read.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"How did we conduct this review?\\nWe searched for studies that compared deep cleaning plus light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone or with a fake therapy. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\nThe PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 77.8% of features falling within the best quartile for readability. However, four metrics deviate significantly from the norm (P90 range): passive_voice (23 instances), nominalization (23 instances), nouns (165), and long_words (175). These results support the editorial feedback, suggesting the text could be more direct and use simpler, more active language to better align with plain language principles.",
