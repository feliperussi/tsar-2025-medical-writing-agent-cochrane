  "draft": "What happens when light-activated therapy is added to deep cleaning for gum disease?\n\nWe are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill germs after a healthcare worker applies a special dye) to deep cleaning (cleaning below the gum line) helps to treat gum disease. The evidence suggests that any improvement is likely too small to be important. Most studies reported no unwanted effects from the therapy.\n\nWe cannot draw clear conclusions from the evidence because most studies were small and not well-designed. We need larger, better-designed studies to find out if this treatment is truly helpful for people with gum disease, and to see if it works for problems around dental implants.\n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontitis and peri-implant diseases are long-term infections in the mouth. Periodontitis affects the gums and bone that support natural teeth. Peri-implant diseases affect the same tissues, but around dental implants. Without treatment, these conditions can worsen over time, and people may lose teeth or implants. To treat these conditions, a healthcare worker deeply cleans the pockets around teeth or implants to remove the harmful film of bacteria. Healthcare workers call this deep cleaning ‘subgingival instrumentation’ or ‘scaling and root planing’.\n\nWhat is light-activated therapy?\nHealthcare workers can add a treatment called 'light-activated therapy' to deep cleaning. They also call it antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. It aims to kill the bacteria that cause the infection. A healthcare worker applies a light-sensitive liquid to the infected area and then shines a special light on it. The light activates the liquid, which destroys the bacteria.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if adding light-activated therapy to deep cleaning works better than deep cleaning alone or with a fake (placebo) therapy.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared deep cleaning plus light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone or with a fake therapy. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 50 studies that included a total of 1407 adults with gum disease (periodontitis) or diseases around dental implants (peri-implant diseases). The studies compared deep cleaning combined with light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone.\n\nFor people with periodontitis, we are very uncertain about the effects of adding light-activated therapy. It may do little or nothing to improve the condition and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of unwanted side effects.\n\nWe did not find enough evidence to understand the effects of this therapy for people with diseases around dental implants. This is because we found no studies in people with the more severe form of the disease (peri-implantitis) and only one very small study in people with the milder form (peri-implant mucositis).\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few key reasons. The studies were very small and used different methods to give the treatment. Also, in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. This can bias the results, because knowing which treatment you receive can affect how you report your symptoms.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting. However, it can be made clearer for readers by addressing a pattern of wordiness and complex phrasing. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify wordy phrases by using verbs instead of nouns.** Some sentences are less direct because they use noun forms of verbs (nominalizations). Changing these to simple verbs makes the text easier to read.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"This can bias the results, because knowing which treatment you receive can affect how you report your symptoms.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This can bias the results, because people might report their symptoms differently if they know which treatment they received.\"\n\n2. **Introduce technical terms more smoothly.** The draft introduces technical terms for 'deep cleaning' in a separate sentence, which can feel abrupt. It's often clearer to integrate these terms where the concept is first explained.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"To treat these conditions, a healthcare worker deeply cleans the pockets around teeth or implants to remove the harmful film of bacteria. Healthcare workers call this deep cleaning ‘subgingival instrumentation’ or ‘scaling and root planing’.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"To treat these conditions, a healthcare worker deeply cleans the pockets around teeth or implants to remove the harmful film of bacteria (a procedure healthcare workers call ‘subgingival instrumentation’ or ‘scaling and root planing’).\"\n\n3. **Make key messages easier to read by breaking down complex sentences.** The first sentence of the summary is long and contains two definitions in parentheses. This can be overwhelming for readers at the very start.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy (a treatment that uses light to kill germs after a healthcare worker applies a special dye) to deep cleaning (cleaning below the gum line) helps to treat gum disease.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This review looked at adding a 'light-activated therapy' to the usual 'deep cleaning' for gum disease. Light-activated therapy uses a special dye and light to kill germs, while deep cleaning removes bacteria from below the gum line. We are very uncertain if adding the light-activated therapy helps treat gum disease.\"\n\nThese changes will help make an already good summary even more accessible to a lay audience. The linguistic analysis supports this, noting that the draft has a higher-than-typical number of nominalizations, nouns, and long words, which can affect clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, the analysis identified significant deviations in vocabulary complexity. The counts for 'nominalization' (22.0), 'nouns' (163.0), and 'long_words' (171.0) are all in the P90 range, indicating the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex vocabulary and phrasing than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Addressing these specific vocabulary issues is the primary area for improvement."
