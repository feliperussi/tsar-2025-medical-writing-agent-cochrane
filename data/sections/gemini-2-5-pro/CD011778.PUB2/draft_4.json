  "draft": "What happens when light-activated therapy is added to deep cleaning for gum disease?\n\nWe are very uncertain if adding light-activated therapy to deep cleaning helps treat gum disease. This therapy uses a special dye and light to kill germs. The evidence suggests that any improvement is likely too small to be important. Most studies reported no unwanted effects from the light-activated therapy.\n\nThe evidence is not strong enough for us to draw clear conclusions because most studies were small and not well-designed. We need larger, better-designed studies to find out if this treatment is truly helpful for people with gum disease, and to see if it works for problems around dental implants.\n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri-implant diseases?\nPeriodontitis and peri-implant diseases are long-term infections in the mouth. Periodontitis affects the gums and bone that support natural teeth. Peri-implant diseases affect the same tissues, but around dental implants. Without treatment, these conditions can worsen over time, and people may lose teeth or implants. The standard treatment is a deep cleaning to remove the harmful film of bacteria from the pockets around teeth or implants. Healthcare professionals sometimes call this ‘subgingival instrumentation’ or ‘scaling and root planing’.\n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy?\nAntimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a treatment that doctors can use in addition to deep cleaning. It aims to kill the bacteria that cause the infection. A healthcare worker applies a light-sensitive liquid to the infected area and then shines a special light on it. The light activates the liquid, which destroys the bacteria.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if adding aPDT to standard deep cleaning works better for treating these conditions in adults than deep cleaning alone or with a fake (placebo) aPDT treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared standard deep cleaning plus light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone or with a fake light-activated therapy. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 50 studies that included a total of 1407 adults with gum disease (periodontitis) or diseases around dental implants (peri-implant diseases). The studies compared deep cleaning combined with light-activated therapy against deep cleaning alone. For people with periodontitis, we are very uncertain about the effects of adding light therapy. It may do little or nothing to improve the condition and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of unwanted side effects. We did not find enough evidence to understand the effects of this therapy for people with diseases around dental implants. This is because we found no studies in people with the more severe form of the disease (peri-implantitis) and only one very small study in people with the milder form (peri-implant mucositis).\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few key reasons. The studies were very small, used different methods to give the treatment, and people in the studies may have known which treatment they received.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to February 2024.",

Simplify the introduction of technical terms.**\n*   **Quote:** \"Healthcare professionals sometimes call this ‘subgingival instrumentation’ or ‘scaling and root planing’.\n*   **Why it's problematic:** This phrasing is a bit indirect.

Use more direct and concise phrasing.**\n*   **Quote:** \"Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a treatment that doctors can use in addition to deep cleaning.\n*   **Why it's problematic:** This sentence is slightly wordy.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of its linguistic features falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. Readability scores are excellent (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 9.2). The analysis flagged two minor deviations from typical patterns: 'nominalization' (23 instances) and 'long_words' (165 instances) were in the P90 range. This suggests that while the text is very clear, a few sentences are slightly less direct or use longer words than is typical. The suggested edits focus on refining these specific areas to further improve conciseness."
