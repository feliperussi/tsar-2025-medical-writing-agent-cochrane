  "draft": "For women undergoing IVF, does choosing the dose of fertility drugs based on tests of their egg supply (ovarian reserve) improve outcomes?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- It is unclear from the available evidence whether choosing the dose of fertility drugs based on tests of a woman's egg supply (ovarian reserve) improves the chance of having a baby. This approach may, however, reduce the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS; a complication where the ovaries overreact to the drugs, causing them to swell and leak fluid).\n- The studies in this review used many different ways to adjust the drug dose, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. Future research is needed to find out which specific methods for choosing a dose are most effective at improving the chances of having a baby while keeping side effects low.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhy is the dose of fertility hormones important in IVF?\nWomen undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) receive daily hormone injections to encourage their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve a good number of eggs (between 5 and 15). The dose of the hormone needs to be just right for each woman. If the dose is too high, the ovaries can over-react, leading to a painful and potentially dangerous condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). If the dose is too low, too few eggs may develop, and the treatment cycle may have to be cancelled. To try and get the dose right, doctors can use tests that predict how a woman's ovaries will respond. These are known as 'ovarian reserve tests'.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if tailoring the dose of fertility hormones based on a woman's ovarian reserve test results improves the chances of having a baby and reduces the risk of OHSS for women undergoing IVF.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups by chance) that compared giving different doses of fertility hormones based on a woman's test results against giving a standard dose. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat does the evidence show?\nWe found 26 studies involving a total of 8520 women undergoing in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The studies compared different doses of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in women categorized as predicted low, normal, or high responders based on ovarian reserve tests. Other studies compared a personalized dose plan (based on these tests) against either giving every woman the same standard dose or using a different personalized plan.\n\nUsing ovarian reserve tests to guide the dose of fertility hormones may slightly increase the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. For example, if the chance of a live birth with a standard hormone dose is 25 out of 100 women, using a test-guided dose would result in between 25 and 31 live births for every 100 women.\n\nUsing these tests to guide the dose may also reduce the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (a complication from the hormones). If 5 out of 100 women experience this complication with a standard dose, using a test-guided dose would result in between 2 and 5 women experiencing it. It is unclear if using the tests has an effect on the risk of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome alone.\n\nFor women predicted to have a low, normal, or high response to the hormones, we are uncertain if adjusting the dose changes the chance of having a baby. The evidence was not strong enough to show a clear benefit or harm for these specific groups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few key reasons. People in the studies may have known which treatment they received, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies all used different methods to adjust the drug dose.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

The main issues are overly complex sentences, a run-on sentence in the limitations, and some passive voice that makes the text harder to read. Addressing the 3 improvements below will make the summary much clearer and more accessible for patients.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Simplify the dense language in the results section.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The studies compared different doses of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in women categorized as predicted low, normal, or high responders based on ovarian reserve tests.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is packed with technical concepts and jargon like \"categorized as predicted...responders,\" which is difficult for a non-medical reader to understand in one go.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Based on their test results, women were grouped by how they were expected to respond to the fertility drugs (a low, normal, or high response). The studies then compared different doses of the main hormone (FSH) for women in these groups.\"\n\n**2. Fix the run-on sentence in the limitations.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"People in the studies may have known which treatment they received, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies all used different methods to adjust the drug dose.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This is a run-on sentence that connects three distinct ideas with commas. Breaking it into a list makes the limitations much clearer.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We have low confidence in the evidence for three main reasons. First, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Second, there were not enough studies to be certain about the findings. Finally, the studies used different methods to adjust the drug dose, making them difficult to compare.\"\n\n**3. Shorten the long, complex sentence in the methods section.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups by chance) that compared giving different doses of fertility hormones based on a woman's test results against giving a standard dose.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** At 39 words, this sentence is too long and contains several different ideas. Breaking it into two or three shorter sentences will improve readability.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We searched for studies called randomised controlled trials. In these studies, people are assigned to a treatment group by chance. We looked for trials that compared personalised hormone doses based on test results against giving a standard dose to everyone.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a very high number of words unfamiliar to a lay audience (`complex_words_dc`) and more passive voice constructions than is typical for a Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns in many areas, with 61% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, there are significant deviations that impact clarity. The number of Dale-Chall complex (unfamiliar) words is beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the vocabulary is too advanced. The text also deviates from typical patterns with high rates of passive voice, nominalizations, nouns, and long words (all in the P90 range). These metrics support the editorial feedback to simplify sentence structure and word choice."
