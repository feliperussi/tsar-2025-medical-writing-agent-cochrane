  "draft": "For women undergoing IVF, does choosing the dose of fertility drugs based on tests of their egg supply (ovarian reserve) improve outcomes?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- It is unclear from the available evidence whether choosing the dose of fertility drugs based on tests of a woman's egg supply (ovarian reserve) improves the chance of having a baby. This approach may, however, reduce the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS; a complication where the ovaries overreact to the drugs, causing them to swell and leak fluid).\n- The studies in this review used many different ways to adjust the drug dose, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. Future research is needed to find out which specific methods for choosing a dose are most effective at improving the chances of having a baby while keeping side effects low.\n\nWHAT IS THIS REVIEW ABOUT?\nWhy is the dose of fertility hormones important in IVF?\nWomen undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) receive daily hormone injections to encourage their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve a good number of eggs (between 5 and 15). The dose of the hormone needs to be just right for each woman. If the dose is too high, the ovaries can over‑react, leading to a painful and potentially dangerous condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). If the dose is too low, too few eggs may develop, and the treatment cycle may have to be cancelled. To try and get the dose right, doctors can use tests that predict how a woman's ovaries will respond. These are known as 'ovarian reserve tests'.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if tailoring the dose of fertility hormones based on a woman's ovarian reserve test results improves the chances of having a baby and reduces the risk of OHSS for women undergoing IVF.\n\nWHAT WE DID IN THIS REVIEW\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups by chance) that compared giving different doses of fertility hormones based on a woman's test results against giving a standard dose. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies involving a total of 8520 women undergoing in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The studies compared different doses of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in women categorized as predicted low, normal, or high responders based on ovarian reserve tests. Other trials (sic) compared an individualized dosing strategy using these tests against a uniform dosing approach or a different individualized algorithm.\n\nMain results: using ovarian reserve tests to individualise follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) dose\nUsing ovarian reserve tests to guide the dose of fertility hormones may slightly increase the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. For example, if the chance of a live birth with a standard hormone dose is 25 out of 100 women, using a test-guided dose would result in between 25 and 31 live births for every 100 women.\n\nUsing these tests to guide the dose may also reduce the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (a complication from the hormones). If 5 out of 100 women experience this complication with a standard dose, using a test-guided dose would result in between 2 and 5 women experiencing it. It is unclear if using the tests has an effect on the risk of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome alone.\n\nFor women predicted to have a low, normal, or high response to the hormones, it is unclear if adjusting the hormone dose based on these predictions has an effect on the chance of live birth may slightly increase the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. It is unclear if adjusting the hormone dose based on these predictions has an effect on the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Furthermore, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nHOW UP TO DATE IS THIS EVIDENCE?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs some revisions to meet Cochrane standards and improve clarity for readers. There are two critical issues that must be addressed: several subheadings are not in the required question format, and a key results sentence is contradictory and confusing. Additionally, the summary could be made easier to read by simplifying some technical phrasing and reducing passive voice.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Critical Issue: Rephrase subheadings as questions.**\nSeveral subheadings do not follow the style guide rule of being phrased as questions. This makes the text harder for readers to scan and engage with.\n- **Problematic subheadings:** \"WHAT WE DID IN THIS REVIEW\", \"Main results: using ovarian reserve tests to individualise follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) dose\", \"LIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:**\n  - \"What did we do in this review?\"\n  - \"What were the main results?\"\n  - \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n\n**2. Critical Issue: Correct the confusing results statement.**\nThe final paragraph in the results section is repetitive and contradictory, which will confuse readers about the review's findings.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"For women predicted to have a low, normal, or high response to the hormones, it is unclear if adjusting the hormone dose based on these predictions has an effect on the chance of live birth may slightly increase the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. It is unclear if adjusting the hormone dose based on these predictions has an effect on the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite (based on the abstract):** \"For women predicted to have a low, normal, or high response to the hormones, we are uncertain if adjusting the dose changes the chance of having a baby. The evidence was not strong enough to show a clear benefit or harm for these specific groups.\"\n\n**3. Simplify technical descriptions.**\nSome sentences use technical terms and phrasing that could be simplified for a lay audience.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Other trials (sic) compared an individualized dosing strategy using these tests against a uniform dosing approach or a different individualized algorithm.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Other studies compared a personalized dose plan (based on these tests) against either giving every woman the same standard dose or using a different personalized plan.\"\n\n**4. Use more direct and active language in the limitations section.**\nThe limitations section is a bit wordy and uses passive phrasing. Using more direct language makes the reasons for uncertainty clearer.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Furthermore, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence for a few key reasons. People in the studies may have known which treatment they received, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies all used different methods to adjust the drug dose.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the draft has a high number of complex/unfamiliar words (`complex_words_dc`: BEYOND_P90), long words (`long_words`: P90), and passive constructions (`passive_voice`: P90) compared to typical plain language summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 55.6% of features in the best quartile for readability. However, there is significant deviation in vocabulary complexity and sentence structure. The metric for Dale-Chall complex words (`complex_words_dc`) is beyond the 90th percentile, indicating a high number of words unfamiliar to a lay audience. Several other metrics, including `long_words`, `smog_index`, `passive_voice`, `nominalization`, and `nouns`, are in the P90 range. This suggests the text uses more complex words, passive constructions, and noun-forms of verbs than is typical for a PLS, which could impact overall readability."
