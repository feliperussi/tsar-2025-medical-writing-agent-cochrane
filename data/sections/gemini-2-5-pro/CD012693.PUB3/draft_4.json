  "draft": "For women undergoing IVF, does choosing the dose of fertility drugs based on tests of their egg supply (ovarian reserve) improve outcomes?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- We are uncertain if choosing the dose of fertility drugs based on a woman's egg supply (ovarian reserve) improves the chance of having a baby. This approach may slightly increase the chance of a live birth, but the evidence is not strong enough to be sure. It may, however, reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a complication where the ovaries overreact to the drugs and swell up.\n- The studies we found used many different ways to adjust the drug dose. This makes it difficult to be certain about the results. More research is needed to find out which specific methods work best to improve the chance of having a baby while keeping side effects low.\n\nWhy is the dose of fertility hormones important in IVF?\nWomen having in vitro fertilisation (IVF) take daily hormone injections to help their ovaries produce multiple eggs. The goal is to collect a good number of eggs (between 5 and 15). The hormone dose needs to be right for each woman. If the dose is too high, the ovaries can overreact. This can lead to a painful and potentially dangerous condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). If the dose is too low, too few eggs may grow, and doctors may have to cancel the treatment. To help get the dose right, doctors can use 'ovarian reserve tests' to predict how a woman's ovaries will respond to the drugs.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if choosing the dose of fertility hormones based on a woman's ovarian reserve test results improves the chance of having a baby and reduces the risk of OHSS.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where researchers assign people to treatment groups by chance. We looked for trials that compared choosing hormone doses based on test results against giving everyone a standard dose. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that included 8520 women having IVF or a similar treatment called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The studies used tests to predict if women would have a low, normal, or high response to fertility drugs.\n\nSome studies compared different doses of the main fertility hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), for women in these groups. Other studies compared a personal dose plan based on these tests against giving every woman the same standard dose.\n\nWe are uncertain if using ovarian reserve tests to guide the hormone dose improves the chance of having a baby. The evidence suggests there may be a slight increase. For example, if 25 out of 100 women have a baby with a standard dose, between 25 and 31 out of 100 women might have a baby with a test-guided dose. However, we have little confidence in this finding.\n\nUsing these tests to guide the dose may reduce the risk of moderate or severe OHSS. For example, if 5 out of 100 women get OHSS with a standard dose, between 2 and 5 women out of 100 might get it with a test-guided dose. We are uncertain if using the tests affects the risk of severe OHSS alone.\n\nFor women predicted to have a low, normal, or high response to the hormones, we are uncertain if adjusting the dose changes the chance of having a baby. The evidence was not strong enough to show a clear benefit or harm for these specific groups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for three main reasons. First, in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Second, there were not enough studies to be certain about the findings. Finally, the studies used different ways to adjust the drug dose, which makes them difficult to compare.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks have passed. However, I am recommending a few revisions to enhance clarity and precision before final approval. My top three recommendations focus on refining a key message for accuracy, ensuring consistent terminology, and making the language more direct and active.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Refine the Key Message on OHSS for Accuracy:** The summary of the OHSS finding is slightly over-simplified in the key messages.\n    - **The issue is in this sentence:** \"It may, however, reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a complication where the ovaries overreact to the drugs and swell up.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** The evidence specifically found a reduction in *moderate or severe* OHSS, while the effect on *severe* OHSS alone was uncertain. The current wording could lead readers to believe the intervention reduces the risk of all forms of OHSS, which is not what the evidence shows.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"It may, however, reduce the risk of **moderate or severe** ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a complication where the ovaries overreact to the drugs.\"\n\n2. **Use More Consistent Terminology:** The phrase used to describe the main intervention changes frequently throughout the text, which can make it harder for readers to follow the core concept.\n    - **Examples from the text:** \"choosing the dose... based on tests\", \"a personal dose plan based on these tests\", \"using ovarian reserve tests to guide the hormone dose\", \"a test-guided dose\".\n    - **Why it's a problem:** While variety can be good, using several different phrases for the same key concept can be confusing. Establishing a simple, consistent term early on improves readability.\n    - **Suggested action:** Please choose one or two clear phrases, such as \"personalising the dose with tests\" or \"using test-guided dosing,\" and use them consistently throughout the summary.\n\n3. **Make Sentences More Active by Using Verbs Instead of Nouns:** Some sentences are grammatically correct but could be more direct and easier to read by converting nouns back into action verbs.\n    - **The issue is in this sentence:** \"For women predicted to have a low, normal, or high response to the hormones, we are uncertain if adjusting the dose changes the chance of having a baby.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"high response to the hormones\" is noun-heavy and slightly abstract. A more direct, active phrasing would be clearer for the reader.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are uncertain if adjusting the dose for women who are predicted to have a low, normal, or high **response to the hormones** changes their chance of having a baby.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour draft is very readable, with excellent scores for sentence length and grade level. The feedback above is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the text deviates from typical PLS patterns with high counts of **nouns** and **nominalizations** (noun-form verbs). The suggested edits will help address this pattern and make an already good summary even better.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable, with most readability scores (like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 8.1) falling in the best quartile for clarity. However, the analysis also flags several stylistic deviations from typical PLS patterns. Specifically, the counts for nominalization (21.0), nouns (183.0), Dale-Chall complex words (267.0), and long words (166.0) are in the 90th percentile, suggesting the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical, even though sentence structure remains simple."
