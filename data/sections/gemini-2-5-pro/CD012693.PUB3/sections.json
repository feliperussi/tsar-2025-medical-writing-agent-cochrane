  "key_messages": [
    "It is unclear from the available evidence whether choosing the dose of fertility drugs based on tests of a woman's egg supply (ovarian reserve) improves the chance of having a baby. This approach may, however, reduce the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS; a complication where the ovaries overreact to the drugs, causing them to swell and leak fluid).",
    "The studies in this review used many different ways to adjust the drug dose, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. Future research is needed to find out which specific methods for choosing a dose are most effective at improving the chances of having a baby while keeping side effects low."

      "content": "Women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) receive daily hormone injections to encourage their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve a good number of eggs (between 5 and 15). The dose of the hormone needs to be just right for each woman. If the dose is too high, the ovaries can overâ€‘react, leading to a painful and potentially dangerous condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). If the dose is too low, too few eggs may develop, and the treatment cycle may have to be cancelled. To try and get the dose right, doctors can use tests that predict how a woman's ovaries will respond. These are known as 'ovarian reserve tests'."

      "content": "We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups by chance) that compared giving different doses of fertility hormones based on a woman's test results against giving a standard dose. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 26 studies involving a total of 8520 women undergoing in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The studies compared different doses of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in women categorized as predicted low, normal, or high responders based on ovarian reserve tests. Other trials (sic) compared an individualized dosing strategy using these tests against a uniform dosing approach or a different individualized algorithm."

      "subheading": "Main results: using ovarian reserve tests to individualise follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) dose",
      "content": "Using ovarian reserve tests to guide the dose of fertility hormones may slightly increase the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. For example, if the chance of a live birth with a standard hormone dose is 25 out of 100 women, using a test-guided dose would result in between 25 and 31 live births for every 100 women.\n\nUsing these tests to guide the dose may also reduce the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (a complication from the hormones). If 5 out of 100 women experience this complication with a standard dose, using a test-guided dose would result in between 2 and 5 women experiencing it. It is unclear if using the tests has an effect on the risk of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome alone.\n\nFor women predicted to have a low, normal, or high response to the hormones, it is unclear if adjusting the hormone dose based on these predictions has an effect on the chance of live birth may slightly increase the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. It is unclear if adjusting the hormone dose based on these predictions has an effect on the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Furthermore, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
