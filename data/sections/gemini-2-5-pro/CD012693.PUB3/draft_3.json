  "draft": "For women undergoing IVF, does choosing the dose of fertility drugs based on tests of their egg supply (ovarian reserve) improve outcomes?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- It is unclear from the available evidence whether choosing the dose of fertility drugs based on tests of a woman's egg supply (ovarian reserve) improves the chance of having a baby. This approach may, however, reduce the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS; a complication where the ovaries overreact to the drugs, causing them to swell and leak fluid).\n- The studies in this review used many different ways to adjust the drug dose, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. Future research is needed to find out which specific methods for choosing a dose are most effective at improving the chances of having a baby while keeping side effects low.\n\nWhy is the dose of fertility hormones important in IVF?\nWomen undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) receive daily hormone injections to encourage their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve a good number of eggs (between 5 and 15). The dose of the hormone needs to be just right for each woman. If the dose is too high, the ovaries can over-react, leading to a painful and potentially dangerous condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS; a complication where the ovaries overreact to the drugs, causing them to swell and leak fluid). If the dose is too low, too few eggs may develop, and the treatment cycle may have to be cancelled. To try and get the dose right, doctors can use tests that predict how a woman's ovaries will respond. These are known as 'ovarian reserve tests'.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if tailoring the dose of fertility hormones based on a woman's ovarian reserve test results improves the chances of having a baby and reduces the risk of OHSS for women undergoing IVF.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials. In these studies, people are assigned to a treatment group by chance. We looked for trials that compared personalised hormone doses based on test results against giving a standard dose to everyone. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat does the evidence show?\nWe found 26 studies that included 8520 women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Based on their test results, women were grouped by how they were expected to respond to the fertility drugs (a low, normal, or high response). The studies then compared different doses of the main fertility hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), for women in these groups. Other studies compared a personalised dose plan based on these tests against giving every woman the same standard dose.\n\nUsing ovarian reserve tests to guide the dose of fertility hormones may slightly increase the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. For example, if the chance of a live birth with a standard hormone dose is 25 out of 100 women, using a test-guided dose would result in between 25 and 31 live births for every 100 women.\n\nUsing these tests to guide the dose may also reduce the risk of moderate or severe OHSS. For example, if 5 out of 100 women experience this complication with a standard dose, using a test-guided dose would result in between 2 and 5 women experiencing it. We are uncertain if using the tests affects the risk of severe OHSS alone.\n\nFor women predicted to have a low, normal, or high response to the hormones, we are uncertain if adjusting the dose changes the chance of having a baby. The evidence was not strong enough to show a clear benefit or harm for these specific groups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for three main reasons. First, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Second, there were not enough studies to be certain about the findings. Finally, the studies used different methods to adjust the drug dose, making them difficult to compare.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

However, the analysis also flags several areas for improvement that align with editorial review. The number of words from outside the Dale-Chall common word list ('complex_words_dc') is significantly higher than typical, and there are elevated rates of passive voice, nominalizations, and long words. Focusing on these areas will enhance clarity."
