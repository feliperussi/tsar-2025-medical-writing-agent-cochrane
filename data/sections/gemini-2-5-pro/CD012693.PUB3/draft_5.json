  "draft": "For women undergoing IVF, does choosing the dose of fertility drugs based on tests of their egg supply (ovarian reserve) improve outcomes?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- We are uncertain if using a test-guided dose of fertility drugs improves the chance of having a baby. This approach may slightly increase the chance of a live birth, but the evidence is not strong enough to be sure. It may, however, reduce the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a complication where the ovaries overreact to the drugs and swell up.\n- The studies we found used many different test-guided dosing methods. This makes it difficult to be certain about the results. More research is needed to find out which specific methods work best to improve the chance of having a baby while keeping side effects low.\n\nWhy is the dose of fertility hormones important in IVF?\nWomen having in vitro fertilisation (IVF) take daily hormone injections to help their ovaries produce multiple eggs. The goal is to collect a good number of eggs (between 5 and 15). The hormone dose needs to be right for each woman. If the dose is too high, the ovaries can overreact. This can lead to a painful and potentially dangerous condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). If the dose is too low, too few eggs may grow, and doctors may have to cancel the treatment. To help get the dose right, doctors can use 'ovarian reserve tests' to predict how a woman's ovaries will respond to the drugs.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a test-guided dose of fertility hormones improves the chance of having a baby and reduces the risk of OHSS.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where researchers assign people to treatment groups by chance. We looked for trials that compared using a test-guided dose of hormones against giving everyone a standard dose. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that included 8520 women having IVF or a similar treatment called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The studies used tests to predict if women would have a low, normal, or high response to fertility drugs.\n\nSome studies compared a test-guided dose against giving every woman the same standard dose.\n\nWe are uncertain if test-guided dosing improves the chance of having a baby. The evidence suggests there may be a slight increase. For example, if 25 out of 100 women have a baby with a standard dose, between 25 and 31 out of 100 women might have a baby with a test-guided dose. However, we have little confidence in this finding.\n\nUsing a test-guided dose may reduce the risk of moderate or severe OHSS. For example, if 5 out of 100 women get OHSS with a standard dose, between 2 and 5 women out of 100 might get it with a test-guided dose. We are uncertain if using the tests affects the risk of severe OHSS alone.\n\nWe are uncertain if using a test-guided dose changes the chance of having a baby for women who are predicted to have a low, normal, or high response to the hormones. The evidence was not strong enough to show a clear benefit or harm for these specific groups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for three main reasons. First, in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Second, there were not enough studies to be certain about the findings. Finally, the studies used different test-guided dosing methods, which makes them difficult to compare.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 67% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and simplicity (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 7.8). However, four metrics deviate from typical patterns, indicating areas for refinement. The draft shows a higher-than-usual number of passive voice constructions (20), nominalizations (21), total nouns (167), and complex Dale-Chall words (243). These suggest the text could be made more direct by using more active verbs and simpler, more common vocabulary."
