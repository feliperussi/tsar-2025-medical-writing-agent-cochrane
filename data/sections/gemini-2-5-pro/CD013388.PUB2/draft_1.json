  "draft": "Can cognitive rehabilitation (therapy to help with memory and daily tasks) help people with dementia manage everyday activities?\n\n- For people with mild to moderate dementia, cognitive rehabilitation (therapy to help with memory and daily tasks) helps them to better manage the specific everyday activities they choose to work on. The review did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The therapy may also have small benefits for the quality of life of care partners (family members or friends who provide support).\n- However, the findings of this review are based largely on one big study. More research is needed to confirm these results and to understand the best ways to use this therapy to help people with dementia.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation for dementia?\nDementia causes problems with thinking skills, such as memory, which can make it harder for people to manage everyday activities and live independently. Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised therapy that aims to help people with mild to moderate dementia overcome these challenges. In cognitive rehabilitation, the person with dementia works with a therapist to identify specific, practical goals for activities they find difficult. Together, they find new strategies and ways to manage these tasks, with the aim of improving their ability to handle daily life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia to better manage the everyday activities they have chosen to work on. We also wanted to understand its effects on other outcomes, such as quality of life, for both the person with dementia and their family members or carers.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included six randomised controlled trials with a total of 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia. The mean age of participants across the studies ranged from 76 to 80 years, and the proportion of men ranged from 29.4% to 79.3%. Most participants for whom a specific diagnosis was reported had Alzheimer's disease. The studies compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care. Follow-up was conducted between 3 and 12 months after the end of treatment.\n\nMain results: Cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild-to-moderate dementia manage their everyday activities\nFor people with mild to moderate dementia, cognitive rehabilitation causes a large increase in their ability to manage the everyday activities they chose to work on. This improvement is seen at the end of the treatment period and continues for several months afterwards. The treatment also slightly increases a person's confidence in their own abilities and their immediate memory. It probably also slightly improves their ability to focus on sounds for several months.\n\nFor care partners, the treatment slightly improves the social aspects of their quality of life and probably improves the psychological aspects of their quality of life for several months.\n\nCognitive rehabilitation probably makes little to no difference to the person's overall quality of life, anxiety, or general functional ability immediately after treatment. It may make little to no difference to other aspects of their memory and attention.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about two main issues. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be certain about all of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are a style guide violation and the use of overly complex and noun-heavy language, which makes the text harder to read than necessary. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.**\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Main results: Cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild-to-moderate dementia manage their everyday activities\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help readers scan the text and find the information they need. This subheading is a statement.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"What did the review find about everyday activities?\"\n\n2. **Use active verbs instead of abstract nouns (nominalizations).**\n   - **Problematic text:** \"This improvement is seen at the end of the treatment period and continues for several months afterwards.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This sentence uses a noun (\"improvement\") and a passive verb (\"is seen\"), which makes it less direct and engaging. Using a strong verb makes the meaning clearer and the text more readable.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"People continued to see these improvements for several months after the treatment ended.\"\n\n3. **Simplify complex and technical phrasing.**\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Most participants for whom a specific diagnosis was reported had Alzheimer's disease.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This phrasing is roundabout and academic. It creates unnecessary work for the reader to understand a simple point.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In the studies that reported the type of dementia, most people had Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the summary has a very high number of 'nominalizations' (verbs turned into nouns) and complex words. Addressing these points will make the summary much easier for patients and their families to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While sentence length and active voice are good (in the best quartile), the summary deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics, including nominalization, SMOG index, complex words, and long words, are in the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range. This indicates the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex language than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which can hinder readability for a lay audience."
