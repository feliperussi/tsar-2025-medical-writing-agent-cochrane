  "draft": "Can cognitive rehabilitation (therapy to help with memory and daily tasks) help people with dementia manage everyday activities?\n\n- Cognitive rehabilitation greatly improves how people with mild to moderate dementia manage the daily tasks they choose to work on. The review did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The therapy may also have small benefits for the quality of life of care partners (family members or friends who provide support).\n- However, the findings of this review are based largely on one big study. More research is needed to confirm these results and to understand the best ways to use this therapy to help people with dementia.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation for dementia?\n\nDementia causes problems with thinking skills, such as memory, which can make it harder for people to manage daily tasks and live independently. Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised therapy that aims to help people with mild to moderate dementia overcome these challenges. In this therapy, a person with dementia and a therapist work together. They set goals for difficult daily tasks and find new ways to manage them.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia to better manage the everyday activities they have chosen to work on. We also wanted to understand its effects on other outcomes, such as quality of life, for both the person with dementia and their care partners.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 6 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia. The average age of people in the studies was between 76 and 80 years, and between 29.4% and 79.3% were men. In the studies that reported the type of dementia, most people had Alzheimer's disease. The studies compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care. The researchers followed up with people between 3 and 12 months after the treatment ended.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n\nCognitive rehabilitation greatly improves how people with mild to moderate dementia manage the daily tasks they choose to work on. People saw these improvements at the end of the treatment, and the benefits continued for several months. The treatment also slightly boosted people's confidence in their own abilities and their immediate memory. It probably also slightly improves their ability to focus on sounds for several months.\n\nFor care partners, the treatment slightly improves their social life. It also probably improves their mental well-being for several months.\n\nCognitive rehabilitation probably makes little to no difference to the person's overall quality of life, anxiety, or general skills for daily tasks immediately after treatment. It may make little to no difference to other aspects of their memory and attention.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. This is mainly because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, and there were not enough studies to be certain about all the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

I'm flagging it as 'Not Approved' to ensure these minor but important edits are considered.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n**1. Rephrase noun-heavy sentences to be more direct.**\nSome sentences rely on noun forms of verbs (e.g., 'make a decision' instead of 'decide'), which can make the text feel abstract. Using more direct verbs makes the writing more active and easier to understand.\n\n- **Original sentence:** \"We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"rated our confidence\" is jargon and a bit clunky for a plain language summary.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We then combined the results from the studies and judged how reliable the evidence was.\"\n\n**2. Clarify research-specific terms and phrases.**\nWhile the draft does a good job defining key terms, some common research phrases could be simplified further.\n\n- **Original sentence:** \"The researchers followed up with people between 3 and 12 months after the treatment ended.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The term \"followed up with\" is vague. It doesn't explain what the researchers actually did or why.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Researchers checked on people 3 to 12 months after their treatment ended to see if the benefits lasted.\"\n\n**3. Ensure all subheadings are questions.**\nThe style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions to guide the reader. One subheading is currently a statement.\n\n- **Original subheading:** \"What are the main results?\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is a common error where the subheading is a statement about what the section contains, rather than a direct question.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"What were the main results of the review?\" or simply \"What did the review find?\"\n\nBy making these small changes, you can further improve the clarity and readability of an already excellent summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, the analysis flagged three metrics that deviate from the typical range, supporting the need for minor revisions. The 'nominalization' score is high (P90), indicating more noun-based phrases than usual. The 'SMOG index' (P90) and 'Dale-Chall complex words' (P90) are also high, suggesting that while the text is generally readable, it contains pockets of complex or unfamiliar words that could be simplified."
