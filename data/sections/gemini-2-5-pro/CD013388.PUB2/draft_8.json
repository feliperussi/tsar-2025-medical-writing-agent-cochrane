  "draft": "Can cognitive rehabilitation (therapy to help with memory and daily tasks) help people with dementia manage everyday activities?\n\n- Cognitive rehabilitation greatly improves how people with mild to moderate dementia manage the daily tasks they choose to work on. The review did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The therapy may also have small benefits for the quality of life of care partners (family members or friends who provide support).\n- However, the findings of this review are based largely on one big study. More research is needed to confirm these results and to understand the best ways to use this therapy to help people with dementia.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation for dementia?\n\nDementia causes problems with thinking skills, such as memory, which can make it harder for people to manage daily tasks and live independently. Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised therapy that aims to help people with mild to moderate dementia overcome these challenges. In this therapy, a person with dementia and a therapist work together. They set goals for specific daily tasks they find difficult and find new strategies to manage them.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia to better manage the everyday activities they have chosen to work on. We also wanted to understand its effects on other outcomes, such as quality of life, for both the person with dementia and their care partners.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. We then combined the results from the studies and judged how reliable the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 6 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia. The average age of people in the studies was between 76 and 80 years, and between 29.4% and 79.3% were men. In the studies that reported the type of dementia, most people had Alzheimer's disease. The studies compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care. Researchers checked on people 3 to 12 months after their treatment ended to see if the benefits lasted.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review?\n\nWe found that cognitive rehabilitation greatly helps people with mild to moderate dementia with the daily tasks they choose to work on. People saw these improvements at the end of the treatment, and the benefits continued for several months. The treatment also slightly boosted people's confidence in their own abilities and their immediate memory. It probably also slightly improves their ability to focus on sounds for several months.\n\nFor care partners, the treatment slightly improves their social life. It also probably improves their mood and mental health for several months.\n\nCognitive rehabilitation probably makes little to no difference to the person's overall quality of life, anxiety, or general ability to handle daily tasks immediately after treatment. It may make little to no difference to other aspects of their memory and attention.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\n\nWe judged the evidence to be moderately reliable. This is mainly because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, and there were not enough studies to be certain about all the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it is not approved because several key sentences use formal, indirect language that could be clearer for a lay audience. The feedback below focuses on making the language more direct and consistent, particularly when explaining the certainty of the evidence.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Use clearer, more standard language to explain the certainty of the evidence.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** In the methods section, you wrote: \"We then combined the results from the studies and judged how reliable the evidence was.\" A similar phrase appears in the limitations section: \"We judged the evidence to be moderately reliable.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"judged how reliable\" is abstract and not as clear as the standard Cochrane PLS terminology. It's better to talk directly about your team's \"confidence\" in the findings.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** Please use the more direct phrasing found in your source material. For example: \"We then combined the results from these studies and **rated our confidence in the evidence**.\" and \"**Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate** because...\"\n\n**2. Strengthen the language for findings with high-certainty evidence.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The treatment also slightly boosted people's confidence in their own abilities and their immediate memory.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The original abstract states this finding is based on *high-certainty* evidence. However, your sentence presents it with the same weight as other findings that you correctly qualify with \"probably\" (for moderate certainty) or \"may\" (for low certainty). This lack of distinction can be misleading.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** To reflect the high certainty, use stronger phrasing. For example: \"We are confident the treatment also slightly **improves** people's confidence in their own abilities and their immediate memory.\"\n\n**3. Simplify phrasing to be more direct and active.**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The review did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence uses a negative construction (\"did not report\") which is less direct than a positive statement. The linguistic analysis also noted a high number of complex words and noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations), suggesting a general need for simpler, more active language.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** A more direct and easier-to-read version would be: \"The review **found no unwanted or harmful effects**.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly conformant with typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis identified three deviations from typical patterns: a high number of nominalizations (noun-heavy phrases), a high SMOG index, and a high count of complex words from the Dale-Chall list. These metrics support the editorial feedback, indicating that while the draft is generally readable, it could be improved by using more active verbs and simplifying some vocabulary choices to enhance clarity for a lay audience."
