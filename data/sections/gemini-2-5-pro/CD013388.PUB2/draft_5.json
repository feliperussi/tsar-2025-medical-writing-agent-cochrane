  "draft": "Can cognitive rehabilitation (therapy to help with memory and daily tasks) help people with dementia manage everyday activities?\n\n- Cognitive rehabilitation greatly improves how people with mild to moderate dementia manage the daily tasks they choose to work on. The review did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The therapy may also have small benefits for the quality of life of care partners (family members or friends who provide support).\n- However, the findings of this review are based largely on one big study. More research is needed to confirm these results and to understand the best ways to use this therapy to help people with dementia.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation for dementia?\n\nDementia causes problems with thinking skills, such as memory, which can make it harder for people to manage daily tasks and live independently. Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised therapy that aims to help people with mild to moderate dementia overcome these challenges. In this therapy, a person with dementia works with a therapist to set goals for daily tasks they find hard. Together, they find new strategies and ways to manage these tasks, to improve how they handle daily life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia to better manage the everyday activities they have chosen to work on. We also wanted to understand its effects on other outcomes, such as quality of life, for both the person with dementia and their care partners.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. We then compared and combined the results from all the studies. We also assessed how reliable the evidence was for each finding.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 6 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia. The average age of people in the studies was between 76 and 80 years, and between 29.4% and 79.3% were men. In the studies that reported the type of dementia, most people had Alzheimer's disease. The studies compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care. The researchers followed up with people between 3 and 12 months after the treatment ended.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n\nCognitive rehabilitation greatly improves how people with mild to moderate dementia manage the daily tasks they choose to work on. People saw these improvements at the end of the treatment, and the benefits continued for several months. The treatment also slightly boosted people's confidence in their own abilities and their immediate memory. It probably also slightly improves their ability to focus on sounds for several months.\n\nFor care partners, the treatment slightly improves their social life. It also probably improves their mental well-being for several months.\n\nCognitive rehabilitation probably makes little to no difference to the person's overall quality of life, anxiety, or general skills for daily tasks immediately after treatment. It may make little to no difference to other aspects of their memory and attention.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\n\nWe are moderately confident in these results, but two main issues limit how certain we can be. It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be confident about all of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. It passes all critical checks. However, a few improvements in wording will make it even easier for readers to understand. The feedback below focuses on making the language more direct and concise.\n\nHere are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Make the description of the therapy more direct.** The current phrasing is slightly wordy.\n   - **Original Text:** \"In this therapy, a person with dementia works with a therapist to set goals for daily tasks they find hard. Together, they find new strategies and ways to manage these tasks, to improve how they handle daily life.\"\n   - **Problem:** This could be more concise and use stronger verbs.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In this therapy, a person with dementia and a therapist work together. They set goals for difficult daily tasks and find new ways to manage them.\"\n\n2. **Simplify the methods description.** The current sentences can be combined and made more active.\n   - **Original Text:** \"We then compared and combined the results from all the studies. We also assessed how reliable the evidence was for each finding.\"\n   - **Problem:** This is a bit clunky. Using a more direct verb than \"assessed how reliable\" would improve flow.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n3. **Make the limitations section easier to read.** The explanation is a bit repetitive and the main sentence is long.\n   - **Original Text:** \"We are moderately confident in these results, but two main issues limit how certain we can be. It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be confident about all of the results.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"limit how certain we can be\" is redundant after stating you are \"moderately confident\". Breaking the long second sentence into two parts would improve readability.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is moderate. This is mainly because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, and there were not enough studies to be certain about all the findings.\"\n\nThese changes address a pattern of using noun-heavy phrases where more direct verbs would be clearer, a finding supported by the linguistic analysis.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable, with most metrics like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (9.5) and words per sentence (16.6) falling in the best quartile for PLS texts. However, the summary shows significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary and structure, with high scores for nominalization (P90), SMOG index (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), and long words (P90). This suggests that while sentence structure is simple, the word choice could be simpler and more direct by replacing some complex words and noun phrases with simpler, verb-focused alternatives."
