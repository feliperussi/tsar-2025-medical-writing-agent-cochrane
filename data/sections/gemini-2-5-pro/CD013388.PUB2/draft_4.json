  "draft": "Can cognitive rehabilitation (therapy to help with memory and daily tasks) help people with dementia manage everyday activities?\n\n- Cognitive rehabilitation greatly improves how people with mild to moderate dementia manage the daily tasks they choose to work on. The review did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The therapy may also have small benefits for the quality of life of care partners (family members or friends who provide support).\n- However, the findings of this review are based largely on one big study. More research is needed to confirm these results and to understand the best ways to use this therapy to help people with dementia.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation for dementia?\n\nDementia causes problems with thinking skills, such as memory, which can make it harder for people to manage daily tasks and live independently. Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised therapy that aims to help people with mild to moderate dementia overcome these challenges. In this therapy, a person with dementia works with a therapist to set goals for daily tasks they find hard. Together, they find new strategies and ways to manage these tasks, to improve how they handle daily life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia to better manage the everyday activities they have chosen to work on. We also wanted to understand its effects on other outcomes, such as quality of life, for both the person with dementia and their care partners.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 6 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia. The average age of people in the studies was between 76 and 80 years, and between 29.4% and 79.3% were men. In the studies that reported the type of dementia, most people had Alzheimer's disease. The studies compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care. The researchers followed up with people between 3 and 12 months after the treatment ended.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n\nCognitive rehabilitation greatly improves how people with mild to moderate dementia manage the daily tasks they choose to work on. People saw these improvements at the end of the treatment, and the benefits continued for several months. The treatment also slightly boosted people's confidence in their own abilities and their immediate memory. It probably also helps them focus better on conversations in noisy places for several months.\n\nFor care partners, the treatment slightly improves their social life. It also probably improves their mental well-being for several months.\n\nCognitive rehabilitation probably makes little to no difference to the person's overall quality of life, anxiety, or general skills for daily tasks immediately after treatment. It may make little to no difference to other aspects of their memory and attention.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\n\nWe have moderate confidence in these results, but our confidence is limited for two main reasons. It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be confident about all of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, clear draft that is very close to approval. It passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting. To make it even more readable for a lay audience, please address the following 3 points to enhance clarity and style.\n\n1. **Simplify noun-heavy sentences to be more direct.**\n   - **Quote:** \"We have moderate confidence in these results, but our confidence is limited for two main reasons.\"\n   - **Problem:** This sentence uses the noun \"confidence\" twice, which is slightly repetitive and less direct than using a verb. This pattern contributes to a high 'nominalization' score.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite as: \"We are moderately confident in these results, but two main issues limit how certain we can be.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the description of the review methods.**\n   - **Quote:** \"We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the findings.\"\n   - **Problem:** For a reader unfamiliar with research, the phrases \"combined the results\" and \"rated our confidence\" are a bit abstract and could be clearer.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite as: \"We then compared and combined the results from all the studies. We also assessed how reliable the evidence was for each finding.\"\n\n3. **Refine the simplification of a key finding.**\n   - **Quote:** \"It probably also helps them focus better on conversations in noisy places for several months.\"\n   - **Problem:** This phrase simplifies the technical term 'auditory selective attention'. While the intention is good, the wording is a bit clunky and overly specific, which wasn't explicitly stated in the original abstract.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite as: \"It probably also slightly improves their ability to focus on sounds for several months.\"\n\nAddressing these minor points will improve the flow and directness of the text, aligning it more closely with best practices for plain language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, three metrics deviate from the typical range: Nominalization (use of noun-forms of verbs), SMOG Index (a readability score), and Dale-Chall Complex Words. This suggests that while the text is generally clear, there are opportunities to simplify sentence structures and word choices in a few places, as highlighted in the feedback."
