  "draft": "Can cognitive rehabilitation (therapy to help with memory and daily tasks) help people with dementia manage everyday activities?\n\n- For people with mild to moderate dementia, cognitive rehabilitation (therapy to help with memory and daily tasks) helps them to better manage the specific everyday activities they choose to work on. The review did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The therapy may also have small benefits for the quality of life of care partners (family members or friends who provide support).\n- However, the findings of this review are based largely on one big study. More research is needed to confirm these results and to understand the best ways to use this therapy to help people with dementia.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation for dementia?\n\nDementia causes problems with thinking skills, such as memory, which can make it harder for people to manage everyday activities and live independently. Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalised therapy that aims to help people with mild to moderate dementia overcome these challenges. In cognitive rehabilitation, the person with dementia works with a therapist to identify specific, practical goals for activities they find difficult. Together, they find new strategies and ways to manage these tasks, to improve how they handle daily life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia to better manage the everyday activities they have chosen to work on. We also wanted to understand its effects on other outcomes, such as quality of life, for both the person with dementia and their family members or carers.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 6 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1702 people with mild-to-moderate dementia. The average age of people in the studies was between 76 and 80 years, and between 29.4% and 79.3% were men. In the studies that reported the type of dementia, most people had Alzheimer's disease. The studies compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care. The researchers followed up with people between 3 and 12 months after the treatment ended.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n\nFor people with mild to moderate dementia, cognitive rehabilitation greatly improves their ability to manage the everyday activities they chose to work on. People saw these improvements at the end of the treatment, and the benefits continued for several months. The treatment also slightly boosted people's confidence in their own abilities and their immediate memory. It probably also helps them focus on sounds for several months.\n\nFor care partners, the treatment slightly improves their social life. It also probably improves their psychological well-being for several months.\n\nCognitive rehabilitation probably makes little to no difference to the person's overall quality of life, anxiety, or general ability to manage daily tasks immediately after treatment. It may make little to no difference to other aspects of their memory and attention.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\n\nWe have moderate confidence in the evidence for two main reasons. It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be certain about all of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured and factually accurate. However, it needs revision to simplify its vocabulary and make it more accessible for a lay audience. The key issues are the frequent use of formal words and abstract nouns where simpler, more direct language would be clearer. Addressing the three points below will significantly improve readability.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Simplify formal and technical vocabulary.**\n\nThe text often uses words that are more formal than necessary for a plain language summary. Replacing these with everyday equivalents will make the summary easier to understand.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"In cognitive rehabilitation, the person with dementia works with a therapist to identify specific, practical goals for activities they find difficult.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** Words like \"identify,\" \"specific,\" and \"activities\" are unnecessarily formal and can be simplified.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"In this therapy, a person with dementia works with a therapist to set goals for daily tasks they find hard.\"\n\n**2. Use active verbs instead of abstract nouns (nominalizations).**\n\nSome sentences use noun forms of verbs, which can make the text feel abstract and less direct. Using the verb form makes the writing more active and engaging.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"confidence in the evidence\" is technical jargon from the GRADE system. It's more direct to talk about how \"certain\" you are.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We then combined the results from these studies and rated how certain we were about the findings.\"\n\n**3. Make the description of evidence certainty more direct.**\n\nThe heading for the limitations section is good, but the first sentence still uses technical phrasing that can be simplified.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"We have moderate confidence in the evidence for two main reasons.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** \"Moderate confidence in the evidence\" is still jargon. A more direct statement would be better for a lay reader.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are moderately certain about these results. Our certainty is limited for two main reasons...\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows a mixed profile. While sentence-level metrics like length and active voice are excellent (in the best 25% of PLS), vocabulary metrics are a significant concern. Six key metrics, including `complex_words`, `long_words`, `nominalization`, and the `smog_index`, are in the P90 range, indicating the vocabulary is much more complex and formal than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This suggests the text may be difficult for a lay audience to understand, despite its simple sentence structure."
