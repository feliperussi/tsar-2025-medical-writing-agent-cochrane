  "draft": "Which ways of using nicotine replacement therapy (like patches or gum) are most effective for quitting smoking?\n\nKey messages\n- The most effective way to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to combine a nicotine patch with a faster-acting form, like gum or a lozenge. Higher-dose patches may also be more effective than lower-dose ones, and starting NRT before the quit day (a technique called pre-loading) may also help people to quit. The review found limited information on the unwanted effects of different ways of using NRT.\n- Future research is needed to better understand the potential unwanted effects of different ways of using nicotine replacement therapy and to confirm if starting it before the quit day is helpful.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhat is nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and how can it help people stop smoking?\nStopping smoking is difficult because tobacco contains nicotine, which is addictive. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that provides nicotine in the form of gums, patches, sprays, or lozenges, and lozenges. The aim is to replace the nicotine a person would get from cigarettes, which helps to reduce unpleasant withdrawal symptoms and cravings. This can make it easier for people to stop smoking completely.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe know that NRT helps people to stop smoking. However, there are many different ways to use NRT. For example, people can use different forms (like a patch plus a gum), different doses (strengths), and use it for different lengths of time. We wanted to find out if some ways of using NRT are more effective and safer than others for helping people to stop smoking long-term.\n\nMethods\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared different forms, doses, and ways of using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to help people stop smoking. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nThe review found 68 studies in 43,327 adults who wanted to stop smoking. The studies compared different types, doses, and ways of using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), such as using a patch plus a fast-acting form (like gum or a lozenge) versus a single product, different patch strengths, and starting NRT before versus on the quit day. All studies followed people for at least six months.\nMain results: Using a combination of nicotine replacement products is most effective for quitting smoking\nUsing a combination of NRTs (a patch plus a fast-acting form like gum or a lozenge) helps more people to stop smoking than using just one type of NRT. Starting to use NRT before the planned quit day may also help more people to quit than starting on the quit day. Using a standard-strength patch (21 mg or 25 mg) probably helps more people to quit than a lower-strength patch (14 mg or 15 mg). However, using a higher-strength patch probably makes little to no difference compared with a standard-strength patch. We are uncertain if using NRT for longer helps more people to quit, or if one type of fast-acting NRT is better than another.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about a few factors. For some questions, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results. In addition, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, particularly the safety of the treatments.\n\nEvidence currency statement\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022 of search.",

However, it cannot be approved because it fails a critical check: two subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is required by the style guide. Here are the top 3 improvements needed to meet the guidelines:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to maintain a consistent, reader-friendly format. Two subheadings currently do not follow this rule.\n- **Problem:** The subheadings \"Methods\" and \"Main results: Using a combination of nicotine replacement products is most effective for quitting smoking\" are statements, not questions.\n- **Suggestion:** Change \"Methods\" to \"How did we conduct the review?\" and change the main results heading to \"What did the review find about the most effective ways to use NRT?\"\n\n2. **Simplify noun-heavy sentences to be more direct.** The linguistic analysis shows a high number of nouns and 'nominalizations' (nouns made from verbs). This can make sentences feel abstract and less direct for readers.\n- **Problem:** The sentence, \"Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about a few factors,\" is grammatically correct but uses abstract nouns ('confidence', 'concerns', 'factors').\n- **Suggestion:** Rewrite this using more direct language, such as: \"We are only moderately confident in our findings for a few reasons.\"\n\n3. **Correct minor typos and awkward phrasing.** A couple of small errors can disrupt the reading experience.\n- **Problem 1 (Typo):** The text says, \"...provides nicotine in the form of gums, patches, sprays, or lozenges, and lozenges.\"\n- **Suggestion 1:** Remove the repeated word: \"...provides nicotine in the form of gums, patches, sprays, or lozenges.\"\n- **Problem 2 (Phrasing):** The sentence, \"The evidence is up to date to April 2022 of search,\" is slightly awkward.\n- **Suggestion 2:** Rephrase for clarity: \"The search for studies is up to date to April 2022.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 10.06). However, the analysis identified 3 features deviating from typical patterns, specifically high counts for nominalization (P90), nouns (P90), and complex words based on the Dale-Chall list (P90). This suggests that while readable, the text's vocabulary and sentence structure could be more direct and use more common words."
