  "draft": "What are the effects of different dressings and devices for preventing problems with arterial catheters (thin tubes put into an artery to take blood samples and measure blood pressure)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is unclear whether different types of dressings or devices are better than others for preventing problems with arterial catheters (thin tubes put into an artery to take blood samples and measure blood pressure).\n- Larger and better-designed studies are needed to find out which dressings and devices are most effective for preventing catheter failure and infections.\n\nWhat are peripheral arterial catheters?\nPeople in hospital, particularly in intensive care or during surgery, may have a thin tube called a peripheral arterial catheter placed into an artery, often in the wrist. These catheters allow healthcare staff to take blood samples and monitor blood pressure continuously without using new needles each time. However, these catheters can sometimes stop working properly (fail), meaning they need to be replaced. They can also lead to complications, such as becoming dislodged, blocked, or causing an infection. Special dressings and devices are used to secure the catheter to the skin to keep it working and prevent these problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective different dressings and securement devices are at preventing peripheral arterial catheters from failing and causing complications for people in hospital.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared different dressings and securement devices for arterial catheters. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included five studies with a total of 1228 hospitalised participants. The studies compare different types of dressings and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters. For people in hospital who need a peripheral arterial catheter, there is not enough evidence to be certain about the best type of dressing or securement device to prevent the catheter from failing or causing complications. The available evidence suggests that bordered dressings or integrated securement dressings may make little or no difference to the risk of catheter failure, bloodstream infections, dislodgement, or blockage when compared with standard dressings. For other comparisons, such as adding a tissue adhesive or a sutureless securement device to a standard dressing, we do not know if these have an effect on any of these outcomes because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. The studies were also very small and the evidence is based on few cases of the events we were interested in.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity and fully meet Cochrane style guidelines before it can be approved. Here are the top 4 areas for improvement:\\n\\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions.**\\nThree subheadings do not follow the style guide requirement to be phrased as questions. This makes the text less engaging for readers.\\n- *Problematic Text:* \\\"Methods\\\", \\\"Limitations of the evidence\\\", \\\"Currency of the evidence\\\".\\n- *Suggested Rewrite:* Please rephrase these as questions. For example: \\\"How did we find the evidence?\\\", \\\"What are the limitations of the evidence?\\\", and \\\"How up to date is this evidence?\\\"\\n\\n2. **Simplify the main results sentence.**\\nThe primary finding is presented in a single, 38-word sentence that lists multiple interventions and outcomes, which is difficult for a lay reader to process.\\n- *Problematic Text:* \\\"The available evidence suggests that bordered dressings or integrated securement dressings may make little or no difference to the risk of catheter failure, bloodstream infections, dislodgement, or blockage when compared with standard dressings.\\\"\\n- *Suggested Rewrite:* Consider breaking this sentence up and using a bulleted list. For example: \\\"The evidence suggests that using bordered dressings or integrated securement dressings, when compared to standard ones, may make little or no difference to the risk of problems like:\\n- catheter failure\\n- bloodstream infections\\n- the catheter coming out (dislodgement)\\n- blockage\\\"\\n\\n3. **Use more direct, less clinical language.**\\nSome phrases are abstract and use noun-heavy constructions (nominalizations), which can be confusing. This is reflected in the high `nominalization` score.\\n- *Problematic Text:* \\\"...the evidence is based on few cases of the events we were interested in.\\\"\\n- *Suggested Rewrite:* Please rephrase this to be more concrete. For example: \\\"...the problems we were looking for (like infections or blockages) happened too infrequently in the studies to draw strong conclusions.\\\"\\n\\n4. **Avoid repeating long definitions.**\\nThe long parenthetical definition of an arterial catheter is repeated in both the title and the first key message, which is redundant.\\n- *Problematic Text:* \\\"...arterial catheters (thin tubes put into an artery to take blood samples and measure blood pressure).\\\"\\n- *Suggested Rewrite:* Please remove this parenthetical from the key message. The term is clearly defined in the 'What are peripheral arterial catheters?' section immediately following, so it is not needed in the key messages.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with over 72% of features in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Four metrics are in the P90 range: `nominalization` (noun-heavy phrases), `lix`, `rix`, and `long_words` (all related to the use of long or complex words). This suggests that while the overall structure is good, the text could be simplified by replacing noun phrases with verbs and choosing shorter, more common words where possible."
