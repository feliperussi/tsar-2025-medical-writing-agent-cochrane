    "Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is unclear whether different types of dressings or devices are better than others for preventing problems with arterial catheters (thin tubes put into an artery to take blood samples and measure blood pressure).",
    "Larger and better-designed studies are needed to find out which dressings and devices are most effective for preventing catheter failure and infections."

      "subheading": "What are peripheral arterial catheters?",
      "content": "People in hospital, particularly in intensive care or during surgery, may have a thin tube called a peripheral arterial catheter placed into an artery, often in the wrist. These catheters allow healthcare staff to take blood samples and monitor blood pressure continuously without using new needles each time. However, these catheters can sometimes stop working properly (fail), meaning they need to be replaced. They can also lead to complications, such as becoming dislodged, blocked, or causing an infection. Special dressings and devices are used to secure the catheter to the skin to keep it working and prevent these problems."

      "content": "We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared different dressings and securement devices for arterial catheters. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included five studies with a total of 1228 hospitalised participants. The studies compare different types of dressings and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters. For people in hospital who need a peripheral arterial catheter, there is not enough evidence to be certain about the best type of dressing or securement device to prevent the catheter from failing or causing complications. The available evidence suggests that bordered dressings or integrated securement dressings may make little or no difference to the risk of catheter failure, bloodstream infections, dislodgement, or blockage when compared with standard dressings. For other comparisons, such as adding a tissue adhesive or a sutureless securement device to a standard dressing, we do not know if these have an effect on any of these outcomes because the evidence is very uncertain."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. The studies were also very small and the evidence is based on few cases of the events we were interested in.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2023."
