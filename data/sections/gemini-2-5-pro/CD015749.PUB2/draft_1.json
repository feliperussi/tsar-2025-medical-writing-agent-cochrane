  "draft": "Can combined medicine, diet, and exercise improve outcomes for people with cachexia?\n\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether combining treatments such as medicine, diet, and exercise helps people with cachexia (severe weight and muscle loss caused by long-term illness). The evidence was not strong enough to determine the benefits or unwanted effects of these combined treatments.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed to find out if combining different types of treatments can help manage cachexia in people with various long-term illnesses.\n\nWhat is disease-related wasting (cachexia)?\nCachexia is a condition of severe weight and muscle loss, also known as 'disease-related wasting'. It can happen to people with long-term illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). People with cachexia lose weight and muscle without meaning to, feel very tired, lose their appetite, and have a lower quality of life. One possible way to treat cachexia is to use several treatments at once, such as medicines, nutritional support (diet changes), and exercise. The idea is that these treatments might work better together than on their own.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a combination of treatments (known as multimodal interventions) helps to relieve or control cachexia in adults with a chronic illness. We also wanted to know if these combined treatments cause any harm or unwanted effects.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that tested treatments for cachexia using a combination of approaches, such as medicine, diet, and exercise. We compared and summarized the results of these combined treatments against usual care or single treatments, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included nine studies with a total of 926 adults with cachexia (disease-related wasting). The participants had various chronic illnesses, including cancer, COPD, chronic kidney disease, and HIV/AIDS. The studies assessed a combination of treatments (such as drugs, nutrition, and exercise) and compared them to usual treatment or a single treatment. The evidence is very uncertain, so for people with cachexia, we do not know if using a combination of treatments has an effect on their physical function, strength, body weight, appetite, or fatigue. It is also unclear whether these combined treatments cause more or fewer unwanted side effects.\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the evidence does not cover all of the people we were interested in, and the studies were very small.\n\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search.",

Additionally, a few sentences could be rephrased for better clarity. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase the 'Methods' subheading as a question.**\n    - **Problem:** The subheading 'Methods' does not follow the style guide rule to phrase subheadings as questions where possible. This makes the structure inconsistent and less engaging for the reader.\n    - **Original:** \"Methods\"\n    - **Suggestion:** \"How did we conduct this review?\"\n\n2.  **Clarify the wording in the limitations section.**\n    - **Problem:** The phrase 'the evidence does not cover all of the people we were interested in' is vague. Readers may not understand what specific groups were underrepresented.\n    - **Original:** \"...the evidence does not cover all of the people we were interested in...\"\n    - **Suggestion:** \"...most studies focused on people with cancer, so the results may not apply to people with other long-term illnesses that cause cachexia.\"\n\n3.  **Improve the phrasing of the evidence currency statement.**\n    - **Problem:** The final sentence is grammatically awkward and could be clearer.\n    - **Original:** \"The evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search.\"\n    - **Suggestion:** \"This review includes evidence published up to July 2024.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 66.7% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. All 18 metrics are within the typical ranges (P25, P50, or P75), indicating strong overall quality. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is 10.98 (P25), and the use of active voice and personal pronouns is high (P75), which aligns with plain language principles. No metrics show significant deviation, suggesting the text is structurally sound and requires only the minor stylistic and formatting adjustments noted in the feedback."
