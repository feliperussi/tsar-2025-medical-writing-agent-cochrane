  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether using a salt-water mist (nebulised hypertonic saline) helps children with a specific long-term lung condition (bronchiectasis) by reducing flare-ups (exacerbations) or improving how well their lungs work. The single study found did not report on unwanted effects.",
    "More and better-designed studies are needed to find out if different types of mucus-thinning medicines are helpful and safe for children with various long-term lung conditions that cause a wet cough. The review found no studies on medicines taken by mouth or on children with other similar lung conditions."

      "subheading": "What is chronic suppurative lung disease in children?",
      "content": "Chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) is a term for a group of lung conditions in children, including bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis. Children with these conditions have a long-lasting wet cough caused by a cycle of infection and swelling (inflammation) in their airways. Mucolytics are medicines that aim to break this cycle by helping to clear the sticky mucus from the lungs, making it easier to breathe."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if using mucolytics helps children with CSLD. We were interested in whether these medicines could reduce the number of flare-ups (exacerbations), improve children's quality of life and other health outcomes, and whether they caused any unwanted effects."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included one study with 52 children who had non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The children's average age was around 9 years. The eight-week study compared nebulised 3% hypertonic saline (a salt-water mist) given before chest physiotherapy to chest physiotherapy alone. Because this study was small and had a high risk of bias, it is unclear if regularly using nebulised hypertonic saline has an effect on lung disease flare-ups or lung function. The study did not measure the children's quality of life, and information on unwanted effects was limited. The review did not find any studies that looked at using mucolytics during an exacerbation, oral mucolytics, other types of inhaled mucolytics, or their use in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB)."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is based on a single small study, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. It is possible that people in the study were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the data we were interested in was provided. The evidence also does not cover all of the treatments or types of people we wanted to investigate.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to September 2024 of search."
