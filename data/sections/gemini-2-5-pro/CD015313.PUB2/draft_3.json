  "draft": "Are mucolytics (medicines that thin mucus) helpful for children with long-term lung conditions that cause a wet cough?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether using a salt-water mist (nebulised hypertonic saline) helps children with a specific long-term lung condition (bronchiectasis) by reducing flare-ups (exacerbations) or improving how well their lungs work. Information about unwanted effects was limited, but no children were reported to have left the study because of them.\n- More and better-designed studies are needed to find out if different types of mucus-thinning medicines are helpful and safe for children with various long-term lung conditions that cause a wet cough. The review found no studies on medicines taken by mouth or on children with other similar lung conditions.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative lung disease in children?\nChronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) is a term for a group of lung conditions in children, including bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis. In children with these conditions, the airways become infected and swollen. This cycle causes a long-lasting wet cough. Mucolytics are medicines that aim to break this cycle by helping to clear the sticky mucus from the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using mucolytics helps children with CSLD. We were interested in whether these medicines could reduce the number of flare-ups (exacerbations), improve children's quality of life and other health outcomes, and whether they caused any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared mucolytics (medicines that help clear mucus) with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment in children with chronic suppurative lung disease. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included one study with 52 children who had non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The children's average age was around 9 years. The 8-week study compared nebulised 3% hypertonic saline (a salt-water mist) given before chest physiotherapy to chest physiotherapy alone. Because this study was small and had a high risk of bias, it is unclear if regularly using nebulised hypertonic saline has an effect on lung disease flare-ups or lung function. The study did not measure the children's quality of life, and information on unwanted effects was limited, although it was reported that no children left the study because of them. The review did not find any studies that looked at using mucolytics during an exacerbation, oral mucolytics, other types of inhaled mucolytics, or their use in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB).\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence. This is because our findings are based on a single small study that we judged to have a high risk of bias. This was because people involved may have known which treatment they were getting, some data was missing, and not all planned outcomes were reported. Because there was only one study, the evidence does not cover all the treatments or types of children we wanted to investigate.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to September 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, clear summary that is very close to being ready. The readability scores are excellent. I have three suggestions to make it even clearer for readers by focusing on a more active and direct style, which will also bring it fully in line with Cochrane's guidelines.\n\n1. **Change passive voice to active voice for greater clarity.** The metrics show a high number of passive sentences, which can make it harder for readers to understand who performed an action. The style guide recommends using an active voice.\n   - **Original text:** \"...it was reported that no children left the study because of them.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This passive phrasing is vague about who did the reporting.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The study reported that no children left because of them.\"\n\n2. **Make the explanation of bias more direct.** The limitations section is crucial for helping readers understand the low certainty of the evidence. Using a more active voice here can strengthen the message.\n   - **Original text:** \"This was because people involved may have known which treatment they were getting, some data was missing, and not all planned outcomes were reported.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence uses several passive constructions ('was missing', 'were reported') and is less direct than it could be.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We judged the study to have a high risk of bias because people may have known which treatment they received, some data was missing, and the researchers did not report all the outcomes they had planned to.\"\n\n3. **Combine sentences to improve flow.** In the background section, a small adjustment can make the explanation of the condition more concise.\n   - **Original text:** \"In children with these conditions, the airways become infected and swollen. This cycle causes a long-lasting wet cough.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** While clear, these two sentences can be combined for a more direct and efficient explanation.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In children with these conditions, a cycle of infection and swelling in the airways causes a long-lasting wet cough.\"\n\nAddressing these points will resolve the minor deviations noted in the linguistic analysis and make an already good summary even better.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is well-written and highly conformant with typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, the analysis identified two areas for potential improvement: the number of passive voice constructions (19.0) and the total noun count (160.0) are higher than is typical for a PLS, falling into the 90th percentile range. This suggests that converting some sentences to active voice and using more verbs could further enhance clarity."
