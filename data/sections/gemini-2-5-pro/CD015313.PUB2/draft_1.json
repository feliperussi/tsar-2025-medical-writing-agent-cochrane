  "draft": "Are mucolytics (medicines that thin mucus) helpful for children with long-term lung conditions that cause a wet cough?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether using a salt-water mist (nebulised hypertonic saline) helps children with a specific long-term lung condition (bronchiectasis) by reducing flare-ups (exacerbations) or improving how well their lungs work. The single study found did not report on unwanted effects.\n- More and better-designed studies are needed to find out if different types of mucus-thinning medicines are helpful and safe for children with various long-term lung conditions that cause a wet cough. The review found no studies on medicines taken by mouth or on children with other similar lung conditions.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative lung disease in children?\nChronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) is a term for a group of lung conditions in children, including bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis. Children with these conditions have a long-lasting wet cough caused by a cycle of infection and swelling (inflammation) in their airways. Mucolytics are medicines that aim to break this cycle by helping to clear the sticky mucus from the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using mucolytics helps children with CSLD. We were interested in whether these medicines could reduce the number of flare-ups (exacerbations), improve children's quality of life and other health outcomes, and whether they caused any unwanted effects.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared mucolytics (medicines that help clear mucus) with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment in children with chronic suppurative lung disease. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included one study with 52 children who had non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The children's average age was around 9 years. The eight-week study compared nebulised 3% hypertonic saline (a salt-water mist) given before chest physiotherapy to chest physiotherapy alone. Because this study was small and had a high risk of bias, it is unclear if regularly using nebulised hypertonic saline has an effect on lung disease flare-ups or lung function. The study did not measure the children's quality of life, and information on unwanted effects was limited. The review did not find any studies that looked at using mucolytics during an exacerbation, oral mucolytics, other types of inhaled mucolytics, or their use in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB).\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is based on a single small study, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. It is possible that people in the study were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the data we were interested in was provided. The evidence also does not cover all of the treatments or types of people we wanted to investigate.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start but needs a few important revisions before it can be approved. Here are the main areas to focus on:\n\n1. **Correct the statement on unwanted effects:** The key message is slightly inaccurate.\n    *   **You wrote:** 'The single study found did not report on unwanted effects.'\n    *   **The issue:** The original study did provide some information (that no children dropped out due to adverse events). Stating they were not reported at all is incorrect. The draft's own results section is more accurate, stating information was 'limited'.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change the key message to be more precise, for example: 'Information about unwanted effects was limited, but no children were reported to have left the study because of them.'\n\n2. **Rephrase all subheadings as questions:** Several subheadings do not follow the required question format, which is a key part of the style guide for guiding the reader.\n    *   **You wrote:** 'Methods', 'Limitations of the evidence', 'Currency of the evidence'\n    *   **The issue:** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change them to:\n        *   'Methods' -> 'How did we conduct this review?'\n        *   'Limitations of the evidence' -> 'How reliable is this evidence?'\n        *   'Currency of the evidence' -> 'How up to date is this evidence?'\n\n3. **Improve clarity in the 'Limitations' section:** One sentence is long and uses indirect phrasing.\n    *   **You wrote:** 'It is possible that people in the study were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the data we were interested in was provided.'\n    *   **The issue:** This sentence is a bit complex. Breaking it up and using more direct, active language would make it easier to read.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Consider rewriting this as two shorter sentences: 'People in the study may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, the study did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in.'\n\n4. **Simplify the 'Currency' statement:** The final sentence is awkwardly phrased.\n    *   **You wrote:** 'The evidence is up to date to September 2024 of search.'\n    *   **The issue:** The phrase 'of search' is confusing. Using a more active, direct verb would be clearer. This also helps address the high number of nouns noted in the linguistic analysis.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please rephrase this to: 'We searched for evidence up to September 2024.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 13 of 18 metrics (72%) falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, the analysis flagged one deviation: the noun count is high (158, placing it in the 90th percentile). This suggests that some sentences could be made more direct by using verbs instead of noun forms, a point reflected in the feedback."
