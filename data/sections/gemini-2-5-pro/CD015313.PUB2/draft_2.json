  "draft": "Are mucolytics (medicines that thin mucus) helpful for children with long-term lung conditions that cause a wet cough?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether using a salt-water mist (nebulised hypertonic saline) helps children with a specific long-term lung condition (bronchiectasis) by reducing flare-ups (exacerbations) or improving how well their lungs work. Information about unwanted effects was limited, but no children were reported to have left the study because of them.\n- More and better-designed studies are needed to find out if different types of mucus-thinning medicines are helpful and safe for children with various long-term lung conditions that cause a wet cough. The review found no studies on medicines taken by mouth or on children with other similar lung conditions.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative lung disease in children?\nChronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) is a term for a group of lung conditions in children, including bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis. Children with these conditions have a long-lasting wet cough caused by a cycle of infection and swelling (inflammation) in their airways. Mucolytics are medicines that aim to break this cycle by helping to clear the sticky mucus from the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using mucolytics helps children with CSLD. We were interested in whether these medicines could reduce the number of flare-ups (exacerbations), improve children's quality of life and other health outcomes, and whether they caused any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared mucolytics (medicines that help clear mucus) with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment in children with chronic suppurative lung disease. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included one study with 52 children who had non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The children's average age was around 9 years. The 8-week study compared nebulised 3% hypertonic saline (a salt-water mist) given before chest physiotherapy to chest physiotherapy alone. Because this study was small and had a high risk of bias, it is unclear if regularly using nebulised hypertonic saline has an effect on lung disease flare-ups or lung function. The study did not measure the children's quality of life, and information on unwanted effects was limited. The review did not find any studies that looked at using mucolytics during an exacerbation, oral mucolytics, other types of inhaled mucolytics, or their use in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB).\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is based on a single small study, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. People in the study may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, the study did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in. The evidence also does not cover all of the treatments or types of people we wanted to investigate.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to September 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. The readability scores are excellent. However, a few key improvements would make it much clearer for readers. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of nouns.**\nThe text is quite noun-heavy, which can make it feel dense and academic. Converting some nouns back into action verbs will make it easier to read.\n- **Original sentence:** \"Children with these conditions have a long-lasting wet cough caused by a cycle of infection and swelling (inflammation) in their airways.\"\n- **Problem:** This sentence is packed with nouns (conditions, cough, cycle, infection, swelling, inflammation, airways), which slows the reader down.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"In children with these conditions, the airways become infected and swollen. This cycle causes a long-lasting wet cough.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the limitations using more active and direct language.**\nThe section on evidence reliability is a bit passive and could be more direct about the study's flaws.\n- **Original sentence:** \"People in the study may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, the study did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\"\n- **Problem:** This phrasing is indirect. It's clearer to state what the review authors concluded about the study's bias.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We judged the study to have a high risk of bias. This was because people involved may have known which treatment they were getting, some data was missing, and not all planned outcomes were reported.\"\n\n3. **Ensure consistency between the Key Messages and the Results.**\nThe Key Messages section contains a useful detail about unwanted effects that is missing from the main results, which could confuse readers.\n- **Original sentence (in 'What did we find?'):** \"...and information on unwanted effects was limited.\"\n- **Problem:** This is less informative than the key message, which states: \"...no children were reported to have left the study because of them.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The study did not measure the children's quality of life, and information on unwanted effects was limited, although it was reported that no children left the study because of them.\"\n\nThe PLS evaluation results show this draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 94% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. The Flesch‑Kincaid Grade Level is low (10.69), and the Flesch Reading Ease is high (53.12), indicating the text is easy to understand. The one significant deviation is the high noun count (160), which is in the 90th percentile. This supports the editorial feedback to reduce noun‑heavy sentences to improve clarity and flow.",
