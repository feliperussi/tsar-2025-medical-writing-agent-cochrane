  "draft": "Are psychostimulants (stimulant medicines) helpful for excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy?\n\nKey messages\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy who have excessive daytime sleepiness, it is very uncertain whether stimulant medicines improve wakefulness when measured by laboratory tests. However, these medicines may help people feel less sleepy based on their own rating on a questionnaire, and they may increase the risk of unwanted effects.\nAll the evidence comes from short-term studies (lasting up to four weeks). Longer and larger studies are needed to better understand the benefits and safety of using stimulant medicines for longer periods.\n\nWhat is myotonic dystrophy and excessive daytime sleepiness?\nMyotonic dystrophy is a long-term condition that causes muscle weakness and other health problems. A common and difficult symptom for people with myotonic dystrophy is excessive daytime sleepiness (also known as hypersomnia). To treat this sleepiness, doctors sometimes use a type of medicine called a psychostimulant, which aims to help people feel more awake and alert.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what effects psychostimulants have on excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy. We looked for studies that compared these medicines to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared psychostimulants with a placebo (a dummy treatment) for treating excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included six studies with a total of 136 adult outpatients (between 18 and 70 years old) with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. The studies were short-term, lasting up to four weeks, and compared psychostimulants to a placebo or no treatment. No studies were found that evaluated the effects in the long term. For people with myotonic dystrophy, it is very uncertain if psychostimulants improve wakefulness when measured by objective tests or if they improve quality of life. Psychostimulants may help reduce feelings of sleepiness as rated by the person themselves, but they may also increase the risk of unwanted side effects.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

However, it does not pass the critical check for formatting because three subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a requirement of the style guide. Addressing this and two other minor clarity points will make the summary ready for approval.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be in a question format to help guide the reader. Three subheadings currently do not follow this rule.\n    *   **Problem:** \"Methods\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", and \"Currency of the evidence\" are statements, not questions.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please rephrase them like this:\n        *   Change \"Methods\" to \"How did we conduct the review?\"\n        *   Change \"Limitations of the evidence\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n        *   Change \"Currency of the evidence\" to \"How up to date is this evidence?\"\n\n2.  **Improve the clarity of the 'Limitations' section.** The single sentence explaining the limitations combines several distinct points, which can be hard for readers to follow.\n    *   **Problem:** \"We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this into a bulleted list to make the reasons clearer:\n        \"We are not confident in the evidence for several reasons:\n        - the studies were very small;\n        - they included different types of people;\n        - they used different methods for the treatment.\"\n\n3.  **Avoid repeating definitions.** The definition for \"placebo\" is provided twice, which is unnecessary and slightly clutters the text.\n    *   **Problem:** The phrase \"placebo (a dummy treatment)\" appears in both the \"What did we want to find out?\" section and the \"Methods\" section.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Define the term once at its first use, and then just use the word \"placebo\" afterwards. In the \"Methods\" section, change the sentence to: \"We searched for studies that compared psychostimulants with a placebo for treating...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has good conformity with typical PLS patterns. All metrics, including readability scores and sentence length (18.82 words/sentence), fall within the best quartile or median ranges. This indicates a strong statistical foundation with no major readability issues detected by the metrics."
