  "draft": "Which type of surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) or surgery through the urinary tract with a scope (retrograde intrarenal surgery)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For adults with kidney stones, surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) may increase the number of people who are stone-free and may cause a large reduction in the need for a second operation compared to surgery with a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery). However, surgery through the back may lead to a longer hospital stay. There is probably little or no difference between the two types of surgery in the risk of major complications.\n- Because of weaknesses in the design of the included studies, our confidence in these results is limited. Future research should measure how these surgeries affect people's quality of life and whether they lead to unplanned medical visits, as we found no information on these important outcomes.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they treated?\nKidney stones are hard deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause pain, block the flow of urine, and lead to infections. There are several ways to treat kidney stones, depending on their size and location. Two common surgical methods are percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). In PCNL, a surgeon makes a small cut in the person's back and creates a tunnel directly into the kidney to remove the stone. In RIRS, a surgeon passes a thin, flexible viewing tube through the body's natural urinary passages to the kidney to break up and remove the stone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the two surgical procedures, PCNL and RIRS, for treating kidney stones in adults. We wanted to know which procedure was better at getting rid of the stones completely, which had more serious side effects (complications), and whether people needed more treatment afterwards.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared two types of surgery for kidney stones in adults. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 trials that included 4571 adults with kidney stones. These studies compared surgery through the back (PCNL) with surgery using a scope through the urinary tract (RIRS). The average stone size ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. Most of the included studies did not provide information on their funding sources.\n\nFor adults with kidney stones, surgery through the back (PCNL) may increase the number of people who are stone-free and may cause a large reduction in the need for a second operation. However, this procedure may lead to a longer hospital stay. PCNL probably does not change the risk of major complications. The risk of ureteral stricture (injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney) may also be similar for both procedures. We found no evidence about the effect of either procedure on unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data on the outcomes we were interested in. Also, the studies included people with a wide range of stone sizes, and the 'surgery through the back' (PCNL) was performed using tools of various sizes. These differences made it difficult to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

I have three suggestions to make the key sections even more accessible to readers by simplifying some phrasing and adding more context.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Simplify the description of the methods.**\n- **Problematic Text:** \"We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is abstract and doesn't explain what \"rating confidence\" means to a patient. It's a missed opportunity to explain the scientific process in simple terms.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We then compared and summarized the results from all the studies. We also assessed how reliable the evidence was, based on factors like how the studies were conducted and how many people they included.\"\n\n**2. Use more direct, verb-focused language in the key messages.**\n- **Problematic Text:** \"...may cause a large reduction in the need for a second operation...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrase is noun-heavy (\"reduction,\" \"need\"), which can make it harder to process quickly. Using a more direct verb phrase makes the meaning clearer.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...may mean people are much less likely to need a second operation...\"\n\n**3. Make the limitations easier to understand.**\n- **Problematic Text:** \"These differences made it difficult to draw firm conclusions.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrase is a bit weak and generic. Explaining the *consequence* of the limitations is more helpful for the reader's understanding.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Because the studies were different in these ways, it is difficult to be certain about the results for any single group of people or type of surgery.\"\n\nThese minor changes will help address the high number of nouns and less-common words identified in the linguistic analysis, making an already good summary even better.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is well-structured and highly readable, with 83% of its linguistic features falling into the best quartile for plain language summaries. However, the analysis indicates a deviation from typical patterns in two areas: the number of nouns (178, in the 90th percentile) and the count of less-common words based on the Dale-Chall list (235, in the 90th percentile). This suggests that some sentences may be overly reliant on nouns and could be simplified by using more common vocabulary and active verbs."
