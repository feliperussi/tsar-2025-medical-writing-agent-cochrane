  "draft": "Which type of surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) or surgery through the urinary tract with a scope (retrograde intrarenal surgery)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For adults with kidney stones, surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) may increase the number of people who are stone-free and may mean people are much less likely to need a second operation compared to surgery with a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery). However, surgery through the back may lead to a longer hospital stay. There is probably little or no difference between the two types of surgery in the risk of major complications.\n- Because of weaknesses in the design of the included studies, our confidence in these results is limited. Future research should measure how these surgeries affect people's quality of life and whether they lead to unplanned medical visits, as we found no information on these important outcomes.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they treated?\nKidney stones are hard deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause pain, block the flow of urine, and lead to infections. There are several ways to treat kidney stones, depending on their size and location. Two common surgical methods are percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). In PCNL, a surgeon makes a small cut in the person's back and creates a tunnel directly into the kidney to remove the stone. In RIRS, a surgeon passes a thin, flexible viewing tube through the body's natural urinary passages to the kidney to break up and remove the stone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the two surgical procedures, PCNL and RIRS, for treating kidney stones in adults. We wanted to know which procedure was better at getting rid of the stones completely, which had more serious side effects (complications), and whether people needed more treatment afterwards.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared two types of surgery for kidney stones in adults. We compared and summarized the results of these studies. We then rated our confidence in the overall evidence based on factors like study methods and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 trials that included 4571 adults with kidney stones. These studies compared surgery through the back (PCNL) with surgery using a scope through the urinary tract (RIRS). The average stone size ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. Most of the included studies did not provide information on their funding sources.\n\nFor adults with kidney stones, surgery through the back (PCNL) may increase the number of people who are stone-free and may mean people are much less likely to need a second operation. However, this procedure may lead to a longer hospital stay. PCNL probably does not change the risk of major complications. The risk of ureteral stricture (injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney) may also be similar for both procedures. We found no evidence about the effect of either procedure on unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data on the outcomes we were interested in. The studies also included people with a wide range of stone sizes, and surgery through the back (PCNL) was performed using tools of various sizes. Because the studies included people with different stone sizes and used various surgical tools, we cannot be certain how well each procedure works in specific situations.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured, accurate, and meets all critical requirements. However, it is not yet approved because several key sentences are too complex for a lay audience, and the vocabulary is more technical than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Addressing the 3 points below will significantly improve clarity for your readers.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Simplify the first Key Message by breaking it into shorter sentences.**\n\nYour first key message is the most important part of the summary, but it's a single 49-word sentence that combines multiple complex ideas. This makes it difficult for readers to quickly grasp the main findings.\n\n- **Original Sentence:** \"For adults with kidney stones, surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) may increase the number of people who are stone-free and may mean people are much less likely to need a second operation compared to surgery with a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery).\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Compared to surgery with a scope, surgery through a small cut in the back may lead to more people being stone-free. It may also mean people are much less likely to need a second operation.\"\n\n**2. Reduce the use of long, technical procedure names after their initial definition.**\n\nYou do a great job of providing simple explanations for the procedures. However, the summary continues to use the long technical names (e.g., \"percutaneous nephrolithotomy\") and acronyms (PCNL, RIRS) throughout the text. This makes the summary feel dense and can intimidate readers.\n\n- **Example:** \"These studies compared surgery through the back (PCNL) with surgery using a scope through the urinary tract (RIRS).\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** After defining the terms once in the introduction, use the simpler descriptions consistently. For example: \"These studies compared surgery through the back with surgery using a scope.\"\n\n**3. Rephrase sentences to lead with plain language instead of jargon.**\n\nEven when a technical term is defined, it's best to introduce the concept in simple terms first. This avoids making the reader pause to decipher jargon.\n\n- **Original Sentence:** \"The risk of ureteral stricture (injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney) may also be similar for both procedures.\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The risk of injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney (called ureteral stricture) may also be similar for both procedures.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour own editorial instincts about complexity are confirmed by the evaluation metrics. The draft has a high number of complex words, long words, and nouns (all in the P90 range), which supports the need to simplify vocabulary and use the plain language descriptions you've already created more consistently.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is well-structured and factually accurate. Its readability scores are generally strong, with good sentence length and use of active voice. However, the analysis shows significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. The number of nouns, complex words (3+ syllables), Dale-Chall unfamiliar words, and long words are all in the 90th percentile range, indicating the text is more technical and dense than a typical PLS."
