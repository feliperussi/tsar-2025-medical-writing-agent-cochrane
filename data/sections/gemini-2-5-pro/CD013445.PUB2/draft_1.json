  "draft": "Which type of surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) or surgery through the urinary tract with a scope (retrograde intrarenal surgery)?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n- For adults with kidney stones, surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) may be better at clearing stones and may reduce the need for a second operation compared to surgery with a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery). However, surgery through the back may lead to a longer hospital stay, while there is probably little or no difference between the two types of surgery in the risk of major complications.\n- Because of weaknesses in the design of the included studies, our confidence in these results is limited. Future research should measure how these surgeries affect people's quality of life and whether they lead to unplanned medical visits, as we found no information on these important outcomes.\n\n**Background**\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they treated?\nKidney stones are hard deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause pain, block the flow of urine, and lead to infections. There are several ways to treat kidney stones, depending on their size and location. Two common surgical methods are percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). In PCNL, a surgeon makes a small cut in the person's back and creates a tunnel directly into the kidney to remove the stone. In RIRS, a surgeon passes a thin, flexible viewing tube through the body's natural urinary passages to the kidney to break up and remove the stone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the two surgical procedures, PCNL and RIRS, for treating kidney stones in adults. We wanted to know which procedure was better at getting rid of the stones completely, which had more serious side effects (complications), and whether people needed more treatment afterwards.\n\n**Methods**\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared two types of surgery for kidney stones in adults. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nThe review included 42 trials with a total of 4571 adults with kidney stones, where the average stone size ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. The studies compared two surgical procedures: percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). Most of the included studies did not provide information on their funding sources. For adults with kidney stones, comparing the two procedures shows that PCNL may increase the number of people who are stone-free and may cause a large reduction in the need for additional procedures. However, PCNL may increase the length of hospital stay. PCNL probably makes little to no difference to the risk of major complications and may make little to no difference to the risk of ureteral stricture (a type of urinary tract injury). We found no evidence about the effect of either procedure on unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search.",

However, a few minor revisions are needed to fully meet Cochrane style guidelines and enhance readability for a lay audience. The summary is not approved at this stage due to a critical check failure regarding subheading format.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions.** Two subheadings do not follow the required question format, which helps guide the reader.\n   - **Current Text:** 'Methods' and 'Limitations of the evidence'\n   - **Problem:** The style guide requires subheadings to be phrased as questions to be more engaging for readers.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'How did we conduct this review?' and 'What are the limitations of the evidence?'\n\n2. **Simplify the currency statement.** The wording is slightly awkward and contains jargon.\n   - **Current Text:** 'The evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search.'\n   - **Problem:** The phrase 'of search' is technical jargon and unnatural for a lay audience.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'This evidence is up to date to March 2023.'\n\n3. **Make the main finding more direct.** The key results sentence is slightly long and noun-heavy, which can make it harder to process.\n   - **Current Text:** 'For adults with kidney stones, comparing the two procedures shows that PCNL may increase the number of people who are stone-free and may cause a large reduction in the need for additional procedures.'\n   - **Problem:** This sentence uses indirect phrasing ('comparing... shows that') and nominalizations ('a large reduction'). The linguistic analysis supports this, showing a high noun count compared to typical summaries.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'For adults with kidney stones, PCNL may help more people become stone-free. It may also greatly reduce their need for more operations.'\n\nBy addressing these points, particularly the subheading format, the summary will fully align with all guidelines.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of features falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (10.42) and average words per sentence (18.5) are excellent. However, the analysis identified two metrics that deviate from typical patterns: the count of nouns (165) and Dale-Chall complex words (228) are higher than usual (P90 range), suggesting some sentences could be simplified by using more common words and direct verbs instead of noun forms."
