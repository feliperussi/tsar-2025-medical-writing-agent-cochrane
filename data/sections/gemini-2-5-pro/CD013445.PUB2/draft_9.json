  "draft": "Which type of surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) or surgery through the urinary tract with a scope (retrograde intrarenal surgery)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- Compared to surgery with a scope through the urinary tract, surgery through a small cut in the back may lead to more people being stone-free. People who have surgery through the back may also be much less likely to need a second operation. However, this procedure may lead to a longer hospital stay. There is probably little or no difference between the two types of surgery in the risk of major complications.\n- Because of weaknesses in the design of the included studies, our confidence in these results is limited. Future research should measure how these surgeries affect people's quality of life and whether they lead to unplanned medical visits, as we found no information on these important outcomes.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they treated?\nKidney stones are hard deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause pain, block the flow of urine, and lead to infections. Treatment for kidney stones depends on their size and location. Two common surgical methods are surgery through the back and surgery with a scope. In surgery through the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy), a surgeon makes a small cut in the person's back and creates a tunnel directly into the kidney to remove the stone. In surgery with a scope (retrograde intrarenal surgery), a surgeon passes a thin, flexible viewing tube through the body's natural urinary passages to the kidney to break up and remove the stone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the two surgical procedures, surgery through the back and surgery using a scope, for treating kidney stones in adults. We wanted to know which procedure was better at getting rid of the stones completely, which had more serious side effects (complications), and whether people needed more treatment afterwards.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared two types of surgery for kidney stones in adults. We compared and summarized the results of these studies. We then rated our confidence in the overall evidence based on factors like study methods and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 trials that included 4571 adults with kidney stones. These studies compared surgery through the back with surgery using a scope through the urinary tract. The average stone size ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. Most of the included studies did not provide information on their funding sources.\n\nFor adults with kidney stones, surgery through the back may increase the number of people who are stone-free and may mean people are much less likely to need a second operation. However, this procedure may lead to a longer hospital stay. Surgery through the back probably does not change the risk of major complications. The risk of injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney (called ureteral stricture) may also be similar for both procedures. We found no evidence about the effect of either procedure on unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data on the outcomes we were interested in. The studies also included people with a wide range of stone sizes, and surgery through the back was performed using tools of various sizes. Because the studies included people with different stone sizes and used various surgical tools, we cannot be certain how well each procedure works in specific situations.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. All critical checks have passed. However, it is not approved because several clarity and style issues make it harder to read than necessary. Focusing on the following three areas will significantly improve the summary for readers.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Simplify and Standardize Key Terms**\n\nThe summary uses long, inconsistent phrases to describe the two surgeries, which can be tiring for the reader. After defining the terms once, you can use shorter, more consistent labels.\n\n- **Problematic Phrases:** \"surgery with a scope through the urinary tract\", \"surgery using a scope\", \"surgery through a small cut in the back\", \"surgery through the back\"\n- **Explanation:** Using multiple variations for the same concept increases the reader's cognitive load. The metrics support this, showing a high number of complex and long words.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** In the 'What are kidney stones...' section, define the terms clearly. Then, for the rest of the summary, consistently use the shortest versions: **\"surgery with a scope\"** and **\"surgery through the back\"**. For example, in the key messages, change \"Compared to surgery with a scope through the urinary tract, surgery through a small cut in the back...\" to \"Compared to surgery with a scope, surgery through the back...\"\n\n**2. Remove Repetitive Sentences in the Limitations Section**\n\nThe final sentence of the limitations section repeats information already stated, making the paragraph feel wordy.\n\n- **Problematic Sentences:** \"The studies also included people with a wide range of stone sizes, and surgery through the back was performed using tools of various sizes. **Because the studies included people with different stone sizes and used various surgical tools, we cannot be certain how well each procedure works in specific situations.**\"\n- **Explanation:** The second sentence rephrases the first without adding new information. This weakens the overall point.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** Combine these ideas into a more concise statement. For example: \"We have little confidence in the evidence because not all studies provided the data we were interested in. Also, the studies included people with a wide range of stone sizes and used surgical tools of various sizes, which makes it hard to be certain how well each procedure works in specific situations.\"\n\n**3. Improve the Readability of the Main Findings**\n\nThe main results are presented in a dense paragraph that could be clearer and easier to scan.\n\n- **Problematic Paragraph:** \"For adults with kidney stones, surgery through the back may increase the number of people who are stone-free and may mean people are much less likely to need a second operation. However, this procedure may lead to a longer hospital stay. Surgery through the back probably does not change the risk of major complications. The risk of injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney (called ureteral stricture) may also be similar for both procedures.\"\n- **Explanation:** This format forces the reader to hold multiple outcomes in their head at once. Using a bulleted list is a standard PLS technique to make findings easier to digest.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** Restructure the findings as a bulleted list:\n\"When comparing the two procedures, we found that surgery through the back:\n- may lead to more people being stone-free.\n- may mean people are much less likely to need a second operation.\n- may lead to a longer hospital stay.\n- probably makes little or no difference to the risk of major complications or injury to the urinary tube.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the summary has an excellent foundation, with short sentences, good use of active voice, and a readable structure (most metrics are in the best quartile). However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns due to its vocabulary. The metrics for complex words, long words, and the SMOG index are all in the P90 range, indicating that the word choice is more complex than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. The feedback provided focuses on simplifying this vocabulary to improve overall clarity."
