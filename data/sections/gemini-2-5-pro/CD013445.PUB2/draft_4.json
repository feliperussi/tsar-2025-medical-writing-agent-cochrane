  "draft": "Which type of surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) or surgery through the urinary tract with a scope (retrograde intrarenal surgery)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For adults with kidney stones, surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) may be better at clearing stones and may reduce the need for a second operation compared to surgery with a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery). However, surgery through the back may lead to a longer hospital stay, while there is probably little or no difference between the two types of surgery in the risk of major complications.\n- Because of weaknesses in the design of the included studies, our confidence in these results is limited. Future research should measure how these surgeries affect people's quality of life and whether they lead to unplanned medical visits, as we found no information on these important outcomes.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they treated?\nKidney stones are hard deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause pain, block the flow of urine, and lead to infections. There are several ways to treat kidney stones, depending on their size and location. Two common surgical methods are percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). In PCNL, a surgeon makes a small cut in the person's back and creates a tunnel directly into the kidney to remove the stone. In RIRS, a surgeon passes a thin, flexible viewing tube through the body's natural urinary passages to the kidney to break up and remove the stone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the two surgical procedures, PCNL and RIRS, for treating kidney stones in adults. We wanted to know which procedure was better at getting rid of the stones completely, which had more serious side effects (complications), and whether people needed more treatment afterwards.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared two types of surgery for kidney stones in adults. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 42 trials with a total of 4571 adults with kidney stones, where the average stone size ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. The studies compared two surgical procedures: percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). Most of the included studies did not provide information on their funding sources.\n\nFor adults with kidney stones, PCNL (surgery through the back) may help more people become stone-free and may also greatly reduce their need for a second operation. However, this procedure may increase the length of hospital stay.\n\nPCNL probably does not change the risk of major complications and may not change the risk of injuring the tube that carries urine from the kidney (a ureteral stricture). We found no evidence about the effect of either procedure on unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data on the outcomes we were interested in. Also, because the studies included people with different stone sizes and used slightly different surgical techniques, it was difficult to combine their results accurately. This makes our conclusions less certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, well-structured draft that is factually accurate and meets all critical requirements. The readability scores are excellent. To make it even clearer for patients, I recommend focusing on three areas:\n\n1. **Make the 'Limitations' section more specific and meaningful.** The current explanation is quite generic and doesn't give readers a concrete reason for the uncertainty.\n    *   **Current text:** 'Also, because the studies included people with different stone sizes and used slightly different surgical techniques, it was difficult to combine their results accurately.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** 'Slightly different surgical techniques' is vague. We can be more specific about *why* this matters without getting too technical.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Also, the studies included people with a wide range of stone sizes, and the 'surgery through the back' (PCNL) was performed using tools of various sizes. These differences made it difficult to draw firm conclusions.'\n\n2. **Make the opening of the 'Results' section more direct.** The first two sentences can be combined to be more concise and active.\n    *   **Current text:** 'The review included 42 trials with a total of 4571 adults with kidney stones, where the average stone size ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. The studies compared two surgical procedures: percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly repetitive ('The review included... The studies compared...') and could be more engaging.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We found 42 trials that included 4571 adults. These studies compared surgery through the back (PCNL) with surgery through the urinary tract (RIRS). The average stone size ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm.'\n\n3. **Simplify noun-heavy sentences to improve flow.** Some sentences rely heavily on nouns, which can make them dense. Using more direct verbs can help.\n    *   **Current text:** 'PCNL probably does not change the risk of major complications and may not change the risk of injuring the tube that carries urine from the kidney (a ureteral stricture).'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is a bit long and repeats the phrase 'change the risk'. The high overall noun count (166 instances, in the 90th percentile for PLS texts) suggests this is a pattern worth addressing.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'PCNL probably has little to no effect on major complications. It also may not affect the risk of ureteral stricture (injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney).'\n\nBy making these adjustments, the summary will be even more accessible and useful for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows excellent conformity with typical PLS patterns, with over 83% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and style. However, two metrics, `nouns` (166.0) and `complex_words_dc` (233.0), are in the P90 range, indicating a higher-than-usual density of nouns and less common words. The high number of complex words is likely necessary due to the technical topic, but the high noun count points to opportunities for using more active verbs to improve clarity."
