  "draft": "Which type of surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) or surgery through the urinary tract with a scope (retrograde intrarenal surgery)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For adults with kidney stones, surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) may be better at clearing stones and may reduce the need for a second operation compared to surgery with a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery). However, surgery through the back may lead to a longer hospital stay, while there is probably little or no difference between the two types of surgery in the risk of major complications.\n- Because of weaknesses in the design of the included studies, our confidence in these results is limited. Future research should measure how these surgeries affect people's quality of life and whether they lead to unplanned medical visits, as we found no information on these important outcomes.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they treated?\nKidney stones are hard deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause pain, block the flow of urine, and lead to infections. There are several ways to treat kidney stones, depending on their size and location. Two common surgical methods are percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). In PCNL, a surgeon makes a small cut in the person's back and creates a tunnel directly into the kidney to remove the stone. In RIRS, a surgeon passes a thin, flexible viewing tube through the body's natural urinary passages to the kidney to break up and remove the stone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the two surgical procedures, PCNL and RIRS, for treating kidney stones in adults. We wanted to know which procedure was better at getting rid of the stones completely, which had more serious side effects (complications), and whether people needed more treatment afterwards.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared two types of surgery for kidney stones in adults. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 42 trials with a total of 4571 adults with kidney stones, where the average stone size ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. The studies compared two surgical procedures: percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). Most of the included studies did not provide information on their funding sources.\n\nFor adults with kidney stones, surgery through the back (PCNL) may help more people become stone-free. It may also greatly reduce their need for a second operation. However, surgery through the back (PCNL) may increase the length of hospital stay.\n\nSurgery through the back (PCNL) probably does not change the risk of major complications. It also may not affect the risk of injuring the urinary tract (a condition called ureteral stricture). We found no evidence about the effect of either procedure on unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. Also, the studies included people with different sizes of kidney stones and used slightly different surgical techniques, which makes the results less certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, well-structured draft that is factually accurate and clear. The following suggestions focus on refining the language to make it even more accessible for readers.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Reduce Repetition in the Results Section:** The repeated use of the full procedure descriptions makes the main findings section feel a bit clunky. Since you've defined the terms clearly upfront, you can use the acronyms or a shorter description for better flow.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"For adults with kidney stones, surgery through the back (PCNL) may help more people become stone-free. It may also greatly reduce their need for a second operation. However, surgery through the back (PCNL) may increase the length of hospital stay.\"\n*   **Reasoning:** Repeating \"surgery through the back (PCNL)\" in consecutive sentences is redundant and slows the reader down.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"For adults with kidney stones, PCNL (surgery through the back) may help more people become stone-free and may also greatly reduce their need for a second operation. However, this procedure may lead to a longer hospital stay.\"\n\n**2. Simplify the Explanation of a Key Side Effect:** The description of 'ureteral stricture' is a bit technical and noun-heavy. Explaining what it is in simpler terms will help reader understanding.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"It also may not affect the risk of injuring the urinary tract (a condition called ureteral stricture).\"\n*   **Reasoning:** The phrase \"a condition called\" is indirect. Defining the term by describing what it is physically is more helpful for a lay audience.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"It also may not change the risk of injuring the tube that carries urine from the kidney (a ureteral stricture).\"\n\n**3. Clarify the Impact of Study Limitations:** The explanation for why the evidence is limited is good, but you can make the connection between the cause and effect even clearer.\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"Also, the studies included people with different sizes of kidney stones and used slightly different surgical techniques, which makes the results less certain.\"\n*   **Reasoning:** Explicitly stating that these differences make it hard to combine results helps the reader understand *why* the conclusions are less certain.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Also, because the studies included people with different stone sizes and used slightly different surgical techniques, it was difficult to combine their results accurately. This makes our conclusions less certain.\",",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with over 83% of metrics in the best quartile. Readability scores are excellent. However, two metrics deviate from the typical range: the count of nouns (169.0) and Dale-Chall complex words (233.0) are higher than usual (P90). This suggests that while readable, the text is dense in some areas and could benefit from simpler vocabulary and more active verb use, as highlighted in the feedback."
