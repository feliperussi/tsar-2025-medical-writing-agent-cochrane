  "draft": "Which type of surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) or surgery through the urinary tract with a scope (retrograde intrarenal surgery)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For adults with kidney stones, surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) may be better at clearing stones and may reduce the need for a second operation compared to surgery with a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery). However, surgery through the back may lead to a longer hospital stay. There is probably little or no difference between the two types of surgery in the risk of major complications.\n- Because of weaknesses in the design of the included studies, our confidence in these results is limited. Future research should measure how these surgeries affect people's quality of life and whether they lead to unplanned medical visits, as we found no information on these important outcomes.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they treated?\nKidney stones are hard deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause pain, block the flow of urine, and lead to infections. There are several ways to treat kidney stones, depending on their size and location. Two common surgical methods are percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). In PCNL, a surgeon makes a small cut in the person's back and creates a tunnel directly into the kidney to remove the stone. In RIRS, a surgeon passes a thin, flexible viewing tube through the body's natural urinary passages to the kidney to break up and remove the stone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the two surgical procedures, PCNL and RIRS, for treating kidney stones in adults. We wanted to know which procedure was better at getting rid of the stones completely, which had more serious side effects (complications), and whether people needed more treatment afterwards.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared two types of surgery for kidney stones in adults. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 trials that included 4571 adults with kidney stones. These studies compared surgery through the back (PCNL) with surgery through the urinary tract (RIRS). The average stone size ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. Most of the included studies did not provide information on their funding sources.\n\nFor adults with kidney stones, surgery through the back (PCNL) may be better at clearing stones and may greatly reduce the need for a second operation. However, this procedure may lead to a longer hospital stay. PCNL probably has little to no effect on major complications. It also may not affect the risk of ureteral stricture (injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney). We found no evidence about the effect of either procedure on unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data on the outcomes we were interested in. Also, the studies included people with a wide range of stone sizes, and the 'surgery through the back' (PCNL) was performed using tools of various sizes. These differences made it difficult to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

To make the summary even better for readers, please address the following 3 points to improve the precision and directness of the language.\n\n1. **Improve precision in the main findings.**\n   - **Quote:** \"For adults with kidney stones, surgery through the back (PCNL) may be better at clearing stones and may greatly reduce the need for a second operation.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"better at clearing stones\" is slightly vague. Phrasing this in terms of the number of people affected is more concrete for readers. Similarly, \"greatly reduce\" is an interpretation; using the more standard phrasing from the source material (\"large reduction\") is more precise.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"For adults with kidney stones, surgery through the back (PCNL) may increase the number of people who are stone-free and may cause a large reduction in the need for a second operation.\"\n\n2. **Use more direct, active phrasing to reduce noun density.**\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The draft has a high number of nouns, which can make sentences feel abstract and less direct. Rewriting sentences to use verbs instead of noun phrases (like \"has an effect on\") makes the information easier to process.\n   - **Quote 1:** \"PCNL probably has little to no effect on major complications.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite 1:** \"PCNL probably does not change the risk of major complications.\"\n   - **Quote 2:** \"It also may not affect the risk of ureteral stricture...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite 2:** \"The risk of ureteral stricture... may also be similar for both procedures.\"\n\n3. **Ensure consistent descriptions of the surgeries.**\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The initial descriptions of the two surgeries in the title and key messages are very clear. Maintaining this clarity throughout helps readers who may not remember the acronyms or technical terms.\n   - **Quote:** In the \"What did we find?\" section, RIRS is described as \"surgery through the urinary tract (RIRS).\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** To improve clarity, please re‑introduce the key element of the scope used in the procedure: \"surgery using a scope through the urinary tract (RIRS).\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and plain language. The readability scores (e.g., Flesch‑Kincaid Grade Level of 9.5) are excellent. However, the analysis identified two minor deviations: the number of nouns ('nouns' = 170) and the count of less common words ('complex_words_dc' = 233) are higher than typical. This supports the editorial feedback to rephrase some sentences to be more verb‑focused and direct, which can help reduce noun density and improve clarity."
