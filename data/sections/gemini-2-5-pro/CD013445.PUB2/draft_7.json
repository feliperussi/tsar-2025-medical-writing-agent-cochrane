  "draft": "Which type of surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) or surgery through the urinary tract with a scope (retrograde intrarenal surgery)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For adults with kidney stones, surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) may increase the number of people who are stone-free and may mean people are much less likely to need a second operation compared to surgery with a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery). However, surgery through the back may lead to a longer hospital stay. There is probably little or no difference between the two types of surgery in the risk of major complications.\n- Because of weaknesses in the design of the included studies, our confidence in these results is limited. Future research should measure how these surgeries affect people's quality of life and whether they lead to unplanned medical visits, as we found no information on these important outcomes.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they treated?\nKidney stones are hard deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause pain, block the flow of urine, and lead to infections. There are several ways to treat kidney stones, depending on their size and location. Two common surgical methods are percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). In PCNL, a surgeon makes a small cut in the person's back and creates a tunnel directly into the kidney to remove the stone. In RIRS, a surgeon passes a thin, flexible viewing tube through the body's natural urinary passages to the kidney to break up and remove the stone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the two surgical procedures, PCNL and RIRS, for treating kidney stones in adults. We wanted to know which procedure was better at getting rid of the stones completely, which had more serious side effects (complications), and whether people needed more treatment afterwards.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared two types of surgery for kidney stones in adults. We then compared and summarized the results from all the studies. We also assessed how reliable the evidence was, based on factors like how the studies were conducted and how many people they included.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 trials that included 4571 adults with kidney stones. These studies compared surgery through the back (PCNL) with surgery using a scope through the urinary tract (RIRS). The average stone size ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. Most of the included studies did not provide information on their funding sources.\n\nFor adults with kidney stones, surgery through the back (PCNL) may increase the number of people who are stone-free and may mean people are much less likely to need a second operation. However, this procedure may lead to a longer hospital stay. PCNL probably does not change the risk of major complications. The risk of ureteral stricture (injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney) may also be similar for both procedures. We found no evidence about the effect of either procedure on unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data on the outcomes we were interested in. Also, the studies included people with a wide range of stone sizes, and the 'surgery through the back' (PCNL) was performed using tools of various sizes. Because the studies were different in these ways, it is difficult to be certain about the results for any single group of people or type of surgery.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. All critical checks have passed. However, it is not approved because there are a few key areas where clarity and readability can be significantly improved for a patient audience. The main issue is the repetitive use of long, technical descriptions for the two surgeries, which makes the text cumbersome. Addressing the 3 improvements below will make the summary much easier for readers to follow.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Simplify Repeated References to the Surgeries**\n\n*   **Issue:** You define the two types of surgery with their full names and plain language descriptions in the title and the first key message. This is great for the start, but you continue to repeat these very long phrases (e.g., \"surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy)\") throughout the summary. This repetition makes sentences long and difficult to read.\n*   **Example from the text:** \"For adults with kidney stones, surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) may increase the number of people who are stone-free and may mean people are much less likely to need a second operation compared to surgery with a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery).\"\n*   **Suggestion:** After defining the terms clearly in the 'What are kidney stones?' section, use a shortened, consistent reference. For example, you could use \"surgery through the back (PCNL)\" and \"surgery with a scope (RIRS)\" in the rest of the document. This would make sentences much shorter and clearer.\n\n**2. Make the Limitations Section More Concrete**\n\n*   **Issue:** The explanation of the evidence limitations is slightly vague and could be more direct for the reader.\n*   **Example from the text:** \"Because the studies were different in these ways, it is difficult to be certain about the results for any single group of people or type of surgery.\"\n*   **Suggestion:** Rephrase this to be more specific about *why* the differences matter. For example: \"Because the studies included people with different stone sizes and used various surgical tools, we cannot be certain how well each procedure works in specific situations.\"\n\n**3. Increase Conciseness in the Methods Section**\n\n*   **Issue:** The description of your methods is a little wordy and could be more direct, which helps maintain reader engagement.\n*   **Example from the text:** \"We then compared and summarized the results from all the studies. We also assessed how reliable the evidence was, based on factors like how the studies were conducted and how many people they included.\"\n*   **Suggestion:** Adopt a more concise phrasing, such as: \"We compared and summarized the results of these studies. We then rated our confidence in the overall evidence based on factors like study methods and size.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis also supports the need for the suggested edits. The draft deviates from typical patterns with a high number of nouns (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), and long words (P90). This is likely caused by the repeated use of the long, technical names for the surgical procedures. Implementing the suggested change to shorten these references after their initial definition should help bring these metrics into a more typical range and improve overall readability."
