  "draft": "Which type of surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) or surgery through the urinary tract with a scope (retrograde intrarenal surgery)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For adults with kidney stones, surgery through a small cut in the back (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) may be better at clearing stones and may reduce the need for a second operation compared to surgery with a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery). However, surgery through the back may lead to a longer hospital stay, while there is probably little or no difference between the two types of surgery in the risk of major complications.\n- Because of weaknesses in the design of the included studies, our confidence in these results is limited. Future research should measure how these surgeries affect people's quality of life and whether they lead to unplanned medical visits, as we found no information on these important outcomes.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they treated?\nKidney stones are hard deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause pain, block the flow of urine, and lead to infections. There are several ways to treat kidney stones, depending on their size and location. Two common surgical methods are percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). In PCNL, a surgeon makes a small cut in the person's back and creates a tunnel directly into the kidney to remove the stone. In RIRS, a surgeon passes a thin, flexible viewing tube through the body's natural urinary passages to the kidney to break up and remove the stone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the two surgical procedures, PCNL and RIRS, for treating kidney stones in adults. We wanted to know which procedure was better at getting rid of the stones completely, which had more serious side effects (complications), and whether people needed more treatment afterwards.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared two types of surgery for kidney stones in adults. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 42 trials with a total of 4571 adults with kidney stones, where the average stone size ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. The studies compared two surgical procedures: percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). Most of the included studies did not provide information on their funding sources. For adults with kidney stones, PCNL may help more people become stone-free. It may also greatly reduce their need for more operations. However, PCNL may increase the length of hospital stay. PCNL probably makes little to no difference to the risk of major complications and may make little to no difference to the risk of ureteral stricture (a type of urinary tract injury). We found no evidence about the effect of either procedure on unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

Here are the top 3 suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Keep using the helpful plain language descriptions for the surgeries.** In the results section, you revert to using only acronyms. Readers may not remember which procedure is which, forcing them to scroll up.\n   - **Instead of:** \"For adults with kidney stones, PCNL may help more people become stone-free... However, PCNL may increase the length of hospital stay.\"\n   - **Consider:** \"For adults with kidney stones, surgery through the back (PCNL) may help more people become stone-free... However, surgery through the back may increase the length of hospital stay.\"\n\n2. **Simplify the long sentence about complications.** The key finding on complications is a bit dense and repetitive, which can make it hard to process.\n   - **Instead of:** \"PCNL probably makes little to no difference to the risk of major complications and may make little to no difference to the risk of ureteral stricture (a type of urinary tract injury).\"\n   - **Consider splitting it:** \"PCNL probably does not change the risk of major complications. It also may not affect the risk of injuring the urinary tract (a condition called ureteral stricture).\"\n\n3. **Make the limitations more specific.** The explanation for the limited confidence is a bit generic and could apply to many reviews.\n   - **Instead of:** \"...the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.\"\n   - **Consider:** \"...the studies included people with different sizes of kidney stones and used slightly different surgical techniques, which makes the results less certain.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this is a very strong draft that highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. The draft has excellent sentence length and uses active voice effectively. The main areas for attention are the high number of nouns and Dale-Chall complex words, which are slightly above the typical range. This supports the editorial feedback that some sentences could be simplified by using more direct verbs and breaking up noun-heavy phrases."
