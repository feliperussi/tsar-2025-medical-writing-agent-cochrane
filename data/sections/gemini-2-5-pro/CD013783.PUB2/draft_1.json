  "draft": "How reliable are toe blood pressure tests for detecting poor leg circulation?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain how reliable toe blood pressure tests are for detecting poor leg circulation (peripheral arterial disease, a condition caused by blocked arteries in the legs). The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of the tests.\n- Future studies using better methods are needed to understand the true accuracy of these tests for identifying poor leg circulation.\n\nWhat is peripheral arterial disease and why is it important to diagnose it accurately?\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition where the arteries that supply blood to the lower legs become narrow, reducing blood flow. This can lead to serious complications, including severe pain, non-healing wounds, gangrene, and even amputation. People with PAD are also at a higher risk of heart attack and stroke. Diagnosing PAD accurately and early is important so that treatment can be started to prevent these problems and slow the progression of the disease.\n\nWhat are the toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure tests?\nThe toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are two simple, non-invasive tests used to help diagnose PAD. 'Non-invasive' means they do not require any needles or surgery. Healthcare professionals use these tests in various settings to check for reduced blood flow in the toes, which can be a sign of PAD.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how accurate the TBI and TSBP tests are for diagnosing PAD in people at risk of the condition. They also wanted to compare the accuracy of the two tests and investigate if factors such as the type of patient (for example, people with diabetes) or the equipment used affected how well the tests performed.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that investigated the accuracy of toe blood pressure tests for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 18 studies. Toe-brachial index (TBI) was investigated in 1927 participants, and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) was investigated in 701 participants. The studies assessed the accuracy of these tests for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease in adults. However, the available evidence is very limited and of low quality, so we do not know how accurate TBI and TSBP tests are. The overall performance of these tests is uncertain, and more high-quality research is needed to determine their accuracy.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft with excellent readability scores, but it requires a few revisions to meet our style guide and improve clarity. The main issue is that three subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a requirement. Addressing this and two other minor points will make the summary ready for publication.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase subheadings as questions.**\n    -   **Problem:** The subheadings 'Methods', 'Limitations of the evidence', and 'Currency of the evidence' do not follow the style guide rule to phrase all subheadings as questions. This format helps guide the reader through the text.\n    -   **Suggestion:** Please change them to:\n        -   'Methods' → 'How did we conduct the review?'\n        -   'Limitations of the evidence' → 'What are the limitations of the evidence?'\n        -   'Currency of the evidence' → 'How up to date is this evidence?'\n\n2.  **Simplify the currency statement.**\n    -   **Quote:** \"The evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search.\"\n    -   **Problem:** The phrase \"of search\" is technical jargon and sounds unnatural to a lay reader.\n    -   **Suggestion:** Please rewrite this for clarity. For example: \"This review includes evidence published up to 27 February 2024.\"\n\n3.  **Make the limitations section more direct and easier to read.**\n    -   **Quote:** \"We are not confident in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\"\n    -   **Problem:** This sentence is long (33 words) and a bit wordy, which can make it hard to follow.\n    -   **Suggestion:** Please break this into two shorter, more direct sentences. For example: \"Our confidence in the evidence is low because the studies did not provide all the data we needed. There were also too few studies to be certain about the results.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. Readability scores like the Flesch-Kincaid Grade (10.8) are excellent, and sentence length (20 words on average) is appropriate. The metrics do not indicate any major structural or vocabulary issues, confirming the draft is well-written but needs the specific style guide adjustments mentioned in the feedback."
