  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain how reliable toe blood pressure tests are for detecting poor leg circulation (peripheral arterial disease, a condition caused by blocked arteries in the legs). The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of the tests.",
    "Future studies using better methods are needed to understand the true accuracy of these tests for identifying poor leg circulation."

      "subheading": "What is peripheral arterial disease and why is it important to diagnose it accurately?",
      "content": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition where the arteries that supply blood to the lower legs become narrow, reducing blood flow. This can lead to serious complications, including severe pain, non-healing wounds, gangrene, and even amputation. People with PAD are also at a higher risk of heart attack and stroke. Diagnosing PAD accurately and early is important so that treatment can be started to prevent these problems and slow the progression of the disease."

      "subheading": "What are the toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure tests?",
      "content": "The toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are two simple, non-invasive tests used to help diagnose PAD. 'Non-invasive' means they do not require any needles or surgery. Healthcare professionals use these tests in various settings to check for reduced blood flow in the toes, which can be a sign of PAD."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out how accurate the TBI and TSBP tests are for diagnosing PAD in people at risk of the condition. They also wanted to compare the accuracy of the two tests and investigate if factors such as the type of patient (for example, people with diabetes) or the equipment used affected how well the tests performed."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 18 studies. Toe-brachial index (TBI) was investigated in 1927 participants, and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) was investigated in 701 participants. The studies assessed the accuracy of these tests for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease in adults. However, the available evidence is very limited and of low quality, so we do not know how accurate TBI and TSBP tests are. The overall performance of these tests is uncertain, and more high-quality research is needed to determine their accuracy."
