  "draft": "Are specialized care programs better than standard care for people with atrial fibrillation (a common heart rhythm problem)?\n\nKey messages\n\nFor people with atrial fibrillation (a common heart rhythm problem), specialized care programs likely reduce the risk of death from any cause and reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems when compared to standard care. It is less clear if these programs affect the risk of being hospitalized for any reason: it is less clear if these programs affect the risk of being hospitalized for any reason, or the risk of complications caused by blood clots (such as stroke) or major bleeding in the brain.\n\nThe evidence is based on a small number of studies, so more high-quality research is needed to confirm these findings. Future studies should also compare different types of specialized care programs, including those that use technology like mobile health apps.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and how is care for it organised?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart condition where the heart beats with an irregular rhythm. As more people are diagnosed with AF and its management becomes more complex, it is important to find the best ways to provide care. Recommended approaches often involve organised care from a team of different healthcare professionals (multidisciplinary care) or the use of technology like health apps and online tools (known as virtual care, eHealth, or mHealth).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if these organised ways of providing clinical services for people with atrial fibrillation are more effective than the usual care they would normally receive.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared organized clinical services with usual care for adults with atrial fibrillation. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies with 8205 adults with atrial fibrillation. The average age of participants was between 60 and 73 years. The studies took place in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. They compared organised clinical services (like nurse-led teams or mobile health management) with usual care.\n\nMain results: organised clinical services versus usual care for people with atrial fibrillation\nCompared to usual care, organised clinical services for people with atrial fibrillation probably cause a large reduction in deaths from any cause and reduce hospital admissions for heart-related causes. However, these services probably make little to no difference to hospital admissions for any cause. They may also make little to no difference to deaths from heart-related causes, or to the risk of complications like stroke or major bleeding in the brain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.",

Here are the most important changes needed:\\n\\n1. **Correct the Inaccurate Currency Statement:** The summary omits a key search date, which could mislead readers about how up-to-date the evidence is.\\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \\\"The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The original abstract states that trial registries were searched up to April 2023. Your version omits this, making the review seem less current than it is. The phrasing \\\"of search\\\" is also awkward.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \\\"We searched for studies published up to October 2022 and trial registries up to April 2023.\\\"\\n\\n2. **Remove Duplicate Text in Key Messages:** A copy-paste error in the first key message makes it confusing.\\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \\\"It is less clear if these programs affect the risk of being hospitalized for any reason: it is less clear if these programs affect the risk of being hospitalized for any reason, or the risk of complications caused by blood clots (such as stroke) or major bleeding in the brain.\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \\\"it is less clear if these programs affect the risk of being hospitalized for any reason\\\" is repeated, which will confuse the reader.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \\\"It is less clear if these programs affect the risk of being hospitalized for any reason, or the risk of complications caused by blood clots (such as stroke) or major bleeding in the brain.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Use More Active and Direct Language:** The summary often uses passive voice and noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations), which can make the text feel indirect and harder to read. \\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \\\"Compared to usual care, organised clinical services for people with atrial fibrillation probably cause a large reduction in deaths from any cause and reduce hospital admissions for heart-related causes.\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \\\"cause a large reduction in deaths\\\" is indirect. It's clearer to use a direct verb. The long phrase \\\"organised clinical services for people with atrial fibrillation\\\" is also repeated from the previous heading.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \\\"Compared to usual care, these specialized programs probably greatly reduce deaths from any cause and also reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems.\\\"\\n\\n**Supporting Evidence from Analysis:** Your draft is generally easy to read, but the linguistic analysis confirms the issue with indirect language. It shows a high number of passive voice constructions (23) and nominalizations (25), placing the text in the 90th percentile for these metrics and suggesting a need for more direct, active phrasing.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft generally conforms to typical PLS patterns, with most readability and vocabulary metrics falling within the best quartile. However, the analysis flags two significant deviations: the number of passive voice constructions (23) and nominalizations (25) are both in the 90th percentile, indicating the text is less direct and active than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
