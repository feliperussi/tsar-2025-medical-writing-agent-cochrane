  "draft": "Are specialized care programs better than standard care for people with atrial fibrillation (a common heart rhythm problem)?\n\nKey messages\n\nFor people with atrial fibrillation (a common heart rhythm problem), specialized care programs likely reduce the risk of death from any cause and reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems compared to standard care. It is less clear if these programs affect the risk of a hospital stay for any reason, or the risk of complications from blood clots (such as stroke) or major bleeding in the brain.\n\nThis evidence comes from a small number of studies, so we need more high-quality research to confirm these findings. Future studies should also compare different types of specialized care programs, including those using technology like mobile health apps.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and how do doctors organize care for it?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart condition where the heart beats with an irregular rhythm. As doctors diagnose more people with AF and managing it becomes more complex, it is important to find the best ways to provide care. Doctors recommend two main approaches: organized care from a team of different healthcare professionals (multidisciplinary care) or using technology like health apps and online tools (known as virtual care, eHealth, or mHealth).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if these specialized care programs for people with atrial fibrillation are more effective than usual care.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where researchers assign people to a treatment group by chance) that compared specialized care programs with usual care for adults with atrial fibrillation. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 8 studies with 8205 adults with atrial fibrillation. The average age of participants was between 60 and 73 years. The studies took place in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. They compared specialized care programs (like nurse-led teams or using mobile health apps) with usual care.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nCompared to usual care, these specialized care programs probably greatly reduce deaths from any cause and also reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems. However, these programs probably make little to no difference to hospital stays for any cause. They may also make little to no difference to deaths from heart-related causes, or to the risk of complications like stroke or major bleeding in the brain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, and we did not find enough studies to be certain about all the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nWe searched for studies published up to October 2022 and checked trial registries up to April 2023.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly conformant with typical PLS patterns. 15 of 18 metrics (83.3%) fall into the best quartile, indicating excellent readability and structure. Key metrics like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (9.46) and words per sentence (18.63) are strong. There are no significant statistical deviations; the required revisions are for factual accuracy and minor clarity improvements, not for core linguistic issues."
