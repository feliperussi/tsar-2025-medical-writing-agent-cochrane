  "draft": "Are specialized care programs better than standard care for people with atrial fibrillation (a common heart rhythm problem)?\n\nKey messages\n\nFor people with atrial fibrillation (a common heart rhythm problem), specialized care programs likely reduce the risk of death from any cause and reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems when compared to standard care. It is less clear if these programs affect the risk of being hospitalized for any reason, or the risk of complications caused by blood clots (such as stroke) or major bleeding in the brain.\n\nThe evidence is based on a small number of studies, so more high-quality research is needed to confirm these findings. Future studies should also compare different types of specialized care programs, including those that use technology like mobile health apps.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and how is care for it organised?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart condition where the heart beats with an irregular rhythm. As more people are diagnosed with AF and its management becomes more complex, it is important to find the best ways to provide care. Recommended approaches often involve organised care from a team of different healthcare professionals (multidisciplinary care) or the use of technology like health apps and online tools (known as virtual care, eHealth, or mHealth).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if these specialized care programs for people with atrial fibrillation are more effective than the usual care they would normally receive.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared organized clinical services with usual care for adults with atrial fibrillation. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 8 studies with 8205 adults with atrial fibrillation. The average age of participants was between 60 and 73 years. The studies took place in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. They compared organised clinical services (like nurse-led teams or mobile health management) with usual care.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nCompared to usual care, these specialized programs probably greatly reduce deaths from any cause and also reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems. However, these services probably make little to no difference to hospital admissions for any cause. They may also make little to no difference to deaths from heart-related causes, or to the risk of complications like stroke or major bleeding in the brain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because people in the studies might have known which treatment they were getting, and we did not find enough studies to be certain about all the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nWe searched for studies published up to October 2022 and trial registries up to April 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft with excellent readability scores. All critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and length have passed. However, it is NOT_APPROVED because a few key improvements to the writing style will make it much clearer and more direct for readers.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use more active voice.** The text often uses passive voice, which can make it unclear who is performing the action. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of passive constructions (22 instances).\n    *   **Example:** 'We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance)...'\n    *   **Problem:** The phrase 'are assigned' is passive. It's clearer to state who does the assigning.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite as: 'We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where researchers assign people to a treatment group by chance)...'\n\n2. **Replace noun phrases with verbs.** The draft frequently uses nouns to describe actions (a feature called nominalization), which makes sentences more abstract and wordy. The analysis identified 21 instances of this.\n    *   **Example:** 'Recommended approaches often involve organised care from a team of different healthcare professionals... or the use of technology like health apps...'\n    *   **Problem:** 'the use of technology' is a noun phrase. Using a verb makes the sentence more direct.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite as: 'Doctors recommend two main approaches: care from an organised team... or using technology like health apps...'\n\n3. **Improve conciseness and consistency.** Some phrases are redundant, and the terms for 'specialized care' change throughout the text, which could confuse readers.\n    *   **Example:** '...more effective than the usual care they would normally receive.'\n    *   **Problem:** 'Usual care they would normally receive' is repetitive.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Simplify to: '...more effective than usual care.'\n    *   **Also:** Please choose one term for the intervention—'specialized care programs' or 'organised clinical services'—and use it consistently throughout the summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable and conforms to typical PLS patterns for most features, with 13 of 18 metrics falling in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in two key areas: passive voice (22 instances, P90) and nominalizations (21 instances, P90). These high values suggest the text is less direct and active than is ideal for a plain language summary, which could impact reader engagement and understanding."
