  "plain_title": "Are specialized care programs better than standard care for people with atrial fibrillation (a common heart rhythm problem)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "For people with atrial fibrillation (a common heart rhythm problem), specialized care programs likely reduce the risk of death from any cause and reduce hospital stays for heart-related problems when compared to standard care. It is less clear if these programs affect the risk of being hospitalized for any reason: it is less clear if these programs affect the risk of being hospitalized for any reason, or the risk of complications caused by blood clots (such as stroke) or major bleeding in the brain.",
    "The evidence is based on a small number of studies, so more high-quality research is needed to confirm these findings. Future studies should also compare different types of specialized care programs, including those that use technology like mobile health apps."

      "subheading": "What is atrial fibrillation and how is care for it organised?",
      "content": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart condition where the heart beats with an irregular rhythm. As more people are diagnosed with AF and its management becomes more complex, it is important to find the best ways to provide care. Recommended approaches often involve organised care from a team of different healthcare professionals (multidisciplinary care) or the use of technology like health apps and online tools (known as virtual care, eHealth, or mHealth)."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if these organised ways of providing clinical services for people with atrial fibrillation are more effective than the usual care they would normally receive."
    }
  ],
  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared organized clinical services with usual care for adults with atrial fibrillation. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  ],
  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 8 studies with 8205 adults with atrial fibrillation. The average age of participants was between 60 and 73 years. The studies took place in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. They compared organised clinical services (like nurse-led teams or mobile health management) with usual care."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: organised clinical services versus usual care for people with atrial fibrillation",
      "content": "Compared to usual care, organised clinical services for people with atrial fibrillation probably cause a large reduction in deaths from any cause and reduce hospital admissions for heart-related causes. However, these services probably make little to no difference to hospital admissions for any cause. They may also make little to no difference to deaths from heart-related causes, or to the risk of complications like stroke or major bleeding in the brain."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search."
