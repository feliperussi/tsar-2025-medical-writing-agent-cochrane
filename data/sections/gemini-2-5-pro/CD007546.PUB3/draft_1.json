  "draft": "What can be done to reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bedrails or belts) for older people in care homes?\n\n**Key messages**\n- To reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bedrails or belts) in care homes, the most effective approach is likely to be programmes that change the home's overall culture. These programmes, which involve things like staff education and new policies, appear to reduce restraint use without increasing falls.\n- It is unclear if simpler approaches, such as providing staff with education alone, are effective at reducing the use of physical restraints.\n- All the evidence comes from care homes, so we do not know if these approaches would work for people receiving care in their own homes. Future studies should also look more closely at any potential unwanted effects of these programmes.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat are physical restraints and why is their use a problem in long-term care?\nPhysical restraints are devices used to limit a person's movement. Examples include belts used in chairs or beds, and bedrails. They are often used for older people living in long-term care settings, such as nursing homes. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are often not effective or safe, and many guidelines recommend that they should be avoided.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what kinds of approaches or programmes (interventions) are effective for preventing and reducing the use of physical restraints for older people receiving long-term care.\n\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that tested interventions to prevent or reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care. We compared and summarized the results, and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 11 studies with a total of 19,003 participants. All studies were conducted in long-term residential care facilities and included older people with dementia, with an average age of approximately 85 years. The review found no studies conducted in community settings. The interventions tested were organisational strategies to promote a least-restraint policy (four studies), simple educational interventions for staff (six studies), and providing staff with information about residents' fall risk (one study). In most studies, these interventions were compared to usual care.\nMain results: reducing the use of physical restraints in older people with dementia\nFor older people in long-term care, organisational changes aimed at using fewer restraints probably reduce the number of residents who are physically restrained and probably cause a large reduction in the number of residents restrained with a belt. These organisational changes make little to no difference to residents' quality of life. They probably make little to no difference to the number of residents prescribed mood-altering medications, and may make little to no difference to the number of falls or fall-related injuries. We do not know if simple educational interventions for staff have an effect on the use of physical restraints. Providing staff with information about residents' risk of falling may make little to no difference to the use of physical restraints.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence may be limited by small sample sizes, selection bias, lack of longitudinal data, reliance on self-reported measures, and potential confounding variables that were not controlled for, which can affect the generalizability and causal interpretation of the findings.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs a few important revisions before it's ready. The most critical issue is that the 'Limitations' section is generic and doesn't describe the actual limitations found in the review, such as the high risk of bias in some studies. Additionally, several subheadings need to be rephrased as questions to meet style guide requirements. Finally, some sentences are dense with technical terms and complex nouns, making them difficult for a lay audience to read easily.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Make the 'Limitations' section specific and accurate.** The current text is a generic statement that could apply to any review. It needs to reflect the actual limitations mentioned in the original abstract.\n    *   **Problem:** \"The evidence may be limited by small sample sizes, selection bias, lack of longitudinal data, reliance on self-reported measures, and potential confounding variables that were not controlled for...\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is inaccurate and unhelpful. The original review identified specific issues, such as a high risk of bias in how participants were selected and compared in several studies. Readers need to know the real, specific weaknesses of the evidence.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited because of issues with how some of the studies were designed. For example, in several studies, there was a high risk that the groups being compared were not similar enough at the start, which could affect the results. This means we are less certain about the findings.\"\n\n2.  **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** Several subheadings are simple labels, which goes against the style guide's requirement to use questions to guide the reader.\n    *   **Problem:** The subheadings \"Methods\" and \"Main results: reducing the use of physical restraints in older people with dementia\" are not questions.\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Phrasing subheadings as questions makes the summary more engaging and easier for readers to navigate to find the information they need.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Change \"Methods\" to \"How did we conduct the review?\" and change the main results subheading to \"What were the main findings?\"\n\n3.  **Simplify complex and noun-heavy sentences.** Some sentences are long and rely on technical phrasing, which can be hard to follow.\n    *   **Problem:** \"For older people in long-term care, organisational changes aimed at using fewer restraints probably reduce the number of residents who are physically restrained and probably cause a large reduction in the number of residents restrained with a belt.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This 38-word sentence is dense and repeats phrases like \"number of residents.\" It can be broken down and simplified for much better clarity.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Programmes that change a care home's policies to use fewer restraints probably reduce how many residents are restrained. These programmes seem especially effective at reducing the use of belts.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows a mixed profile. While the summary has good sentence length (18 words/sentence) and strong readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10.5), it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics, including 'complex_words' (P90), 'long_words' (P90), and 'nouns' (P90), are in the highest 10% of the corpus, indicating the text is denser and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This supports the editorial feedback to simplify noun-heavy sentences and replace technical terms with more common language."
