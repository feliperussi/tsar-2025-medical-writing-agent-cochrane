  "key_messages": [
    "To reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bedrails or belts) in care homes, the most effective approach is likely to be programmes that change the home's overall culture. These programmes, which involve things like staff education and new policies, appear to reduce restraint use without increasing falls.",
    "It is unclear if simpler approaches, such as providing staff with education alone, are effective at reducing the use of physical restraints.",
    "All the evidence comes from care homes, so we do not know if these approaches would work for people receiving care in their own homes. Future studies should also look more closely at any potential unwanted effects of these programmes."

      "subheading": "What are physical restraints and why is their use a problem in long-term care?",
      "content": "Physical restraints are devices used to limit a person's movement. Examples include belts used in chairs or beds, and bedrails. They are often used for older people living in long-term care settings, such as nursing homes. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are often not effective or safe, and many guidelines recommend that they should be avoided."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review included 11 studies with a total of 19,003 participants. All studies were conducted in long-term residential care facilities and included older people with dementia, with an average age of approximately 85 years. The review found no studies conducted in community settings. The interventions tested were organisational strategies to promote a least-restraint policy (four studies), simple educational interventions for staff (six studies), and providing staff with information about residents' fall risk (one study). In most studies, these interventions were compared to usual care."

      "subheading": "Main results: reducing the use of physical restraints in older people with dementia",
      "content": "For older people in long-term care, organisational changes aimed at using fewer restraints probably reduce the number of residents who are physically restrained and probably cause a large reduction in the number of residents restrained with a belt. These organisational changes make little to no difference to residents' quality of life. They probably make little to no difference to the number of residents prescribed mood-altering medications, and may make little to no difference to the number of falls or fall-related injuries. We do not know if simple educational interventions for staff have an effect on the use of physical restraints. Providing staff with information about residents' risk of falling may make little to no difference to the use of physical restraints."
