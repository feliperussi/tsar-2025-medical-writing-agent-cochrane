  "key_messages": [
    "The review identified several ways to provide eye care for correctable vision problems in community settings, such as school-based programs, outreach clinics, and vision centres. However, due to a lack of studies evaluating these approaches, their benefits and potential harms are unclear.",
    "Future research is needed to evaluate how effective these different ways of delivering eye care are in order to help communities decide which approaches work best."

      "subheading": "What is uncorrected refractive error?",
      "content": "Refractive error is a very common eye condition that causes blurred vision because the eye cannot focus light correctly. It is a leading cause of vision impairment across the globe. For most people, this problem can be easily corrected with a pair of glasses. However, many people do not have access to the eye tests and glasses they need. To solve this, global health experts are looking for better ways to provide eye care services in local places like schools, pharmacies, and community health centres."

      "content": "We wanted to identify the different ways that eye tests and glasses are provided to people in community and primary care settings. We also wanted to find out how these different approaches have been evaluated to see how well they work."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review authors found 402 records describing different ways of providing eye care, such as eye tests and glasses, in community and primary care settings. These included services based in schools, pharmacies, and health centres, as well as outreach and door-to-door programs. However, the authors found very few studies that evaluated how well these different approaches work. Therefore, we do not know how effective these different ways of delivering eye care are."
