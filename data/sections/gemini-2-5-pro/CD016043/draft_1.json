  "draft": "Ways to Provide Community Eye Care for Correctable Vision Problems\n\nKey messages\n- The review identified several ways to provide eye care for correctable vision problems in community settings, such as school-based programs, outreach clinics, and vision centres. However, due to a lack of studies evaluating these approaches, their benefits and potential harms are unclear.\n- Future research is needed to evaluate how effective these different ways of delivering eye care are in order to help communities decide which approaches work best.\n\nWhat is uncorrected refractive error?\nRefractive error is a very common eye condition that causes blurred vision because the eye cannot focus light correctly. It is a leading cause of vision impairment across the globe. For most people, this problem can be easily corrected with a pair of glasses. However, many people do not have access to the eye tests and glasses they need. To solve this, global health experts are looking for better ways to provide eye care services in local places like schools, pharmacies, and community health centres.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to identify the different ways that eye tests and glasses are provided to people in community and primary care settings. We also wanted to find out how these different approaches have been evaluated to see how well they work.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies and reports that described different ways of providing eye tests and glasses in community and primary care settings, and we summarized the different approaches we found.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review authors found 402 records describing different ways of providing eye care, such as eye tests and glasses, in community and primary care settings. These included services based in schools, pharmacies, and health centres, as well as outreach and door-to-door programs. However, the authors found very few studies that evaluated how well these different approaches work. Therefore, we do not know how effective these different ways of delivering eye care are.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022 of search.",

The linguistic analysis shows it's very readable and uses plain language effectively. However, it needs a few revisions to fully align with the Cochrane style guide before it can be approved.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions.** Several subheadings are currently labels rather than questions, which makes the summary harder for readers to navigate and does not follow the style guide.\n    - **Current:** \"Methods\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\"\n    - **Suggestion:** Please change these to questions, for example: \"How did we conduct the review?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", and \"How up to date is this evidence?\"\n\n2. **Clarify the evidence currency statement.** The final sentence is grammatically awkward and could be confusing for readers.\n    - **Current:** \"The evidence is up to date to November 2022 of search.\"\n    - **Suggestion:** Please rewrite this for clarity. For example: \"This review includes evidence found up to November 2022.\"\n\n3. **Change the main title to a question.** Like the subheadings, phrasing the title as a question is more engaging for a lay audience and is a key part of the required style.\n    - **Current:** \"Ways to Provide Community Eye Care for Correctable Vision Problems\"\n    - **Suggestion:** Please rephrase this as a question, such as: \"What are the different ways to provide community eye care for correctable vision problems?\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis indicates the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges. Readability scores like the Flesch-Kincaid Grade (10.76) are excellent, and the use of active voice (41 instances) and personal pronouns (25 instances) is strong. These results show a solid foundation in plain language, but do not capture the specific style guide violations noted in the feedback."
