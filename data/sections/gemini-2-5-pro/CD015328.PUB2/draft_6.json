  "draft": "Can programs that encourage healthy eating and physical activity help prevent obesity in children?\n\nKey messages\n- Programs combining healthy eating and physical activity, and those focusing only on physical activity, may cause a small reduction in children's weight for up to 15 months. Programs focusing only on diet have little to no effect. The effects of any program may not be long-lasting.\n- There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects, such as injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n- Most of the studies we found looked at programs run in schools. More research is needed to understand the effects of these programs in other settings, such as in the home or the community, and for children living with disabilities.\n\nWhy is preventing obesity in children important?\nObesity in children is a major health concern around the world. It can seriously affect a child's health, development, and well-being. To prevent obesity, many programs encourage children to develop healthier habits. These programs typically focus on promoting healthy eating, increasing physical activity, improving sleep, and reducing time spent sitting down.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if programs focusing on diet, physical activity, or both can prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years. We looked at how these programs affected body weight measures, such as body mass index (BMI). We also wanted to know if the programs caused any serious unwanted effects, like injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared diet or activity programs (or both) with no program to prevent obesity in children. We combined and summarized their results, and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 172 studies with 189,707 children. The children’s average age was between 5 and 11 years. Most studies did not include children with mental or physical disabilities. The studies compared diet, physical activity, or both against no program or usual care. They lasted from a single visit up to 4 years. Most studies took place in schools in high-income countries. Most programs (132) were not funded by industry, while 24 received some or all funding from industry.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to taking no action:\n- Programs combining diet and physical activity may cause a small reduction in children's weight. This effect was seen when measured up to 15 months later.\n- Programs focused only on physical activity may cause a similar small reduction in weight when measured between 9 and 15 months later.\n- Programs focused only on diet may make little to no difference.\n\nWe found little to no effect for any program at long-term follow-up (beyond 15 months). There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects, such as injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because the studies included different groups of children and tested many different types of programs, which makes the results less certain. There was also very little information for certain groups, such as children with disabilities, or for programs delivered outside of schools.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured and factually accurate. However, a few improvements to the language and framing of the results will make it even clearer for readers. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Simplify wordy phrases and complex vocabulary.** The summary uses longer words than necessary, which can make it harder for some people to read. Replacing these with simpler, everyday words will improve clarity.\n   - **Example from the draft:** \"These programs typically focus on promoting healthy eating, increasing physical activity, improving sleep, and reducing time spent sitting down.\"\n   - **Problem:** This sentence uses several long words ('promoting', 'increasing', 'reducing') where simpler verbs would be more direct.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"These programs aim to help children eat healthier, be more active, sleep better, and sit less.\"\n\n2. **Improve the precision of the Key Messages.** The first key message groups two findings together, but the evidence for them is slightly different, which could be misleading.\n   - **Example from the draft:** \"Programs combining healthy eating and physical activity, and those focusing only on physical activity, may cause a small reduction in children's weight for up to 15 months.\"\n   - **Problem:** The effect for 'activity only' programs was mainly seen at medium-term follow-up (9 to 15 months), not across the entire 'up to 15 months' period like the combined programs.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Programs that combine healthy eating and physical activity may cause a small reduction in weight for up to 15 months. Programs that focus only on physical activity may also have a small effect, but this was mainly seen between 9 and 15 months after the program started.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the different timeframes in the results section.** The results mention effects at different times (e.g., \"up to 15 months later\" vs. \"between 9 and 15 months later\") without clearly defining these periods for the reader.\n   - **Example from the draft:** The text uses phrases like \"up to 15 months later\" and \"between 9 and 15 months later\" without context.\n   - **Problem:** Readers may be confused by the different time periods and why they matter. You define 'long-term' but not the other periods.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Add a sentence at the start of the 'What are the main results?' section to orient the reader, for example: \"The studies checked on children at different times: in the short-term (up to 9 months), medium-term (9 to 15 months), and long-term (more than 15 months).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is generally well-structured and readable, with 83% of its linguistic features falling within the best quartile for PLS texts. However, it deviates from typical patterns in its vocabulary, with a high number of long words (180) and words not on the Dale-Chall list of common words (218). This suggests the language could be simplified for better clarity."
