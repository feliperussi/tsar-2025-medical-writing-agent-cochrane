  "draft": "Can programs that encourage healthy eating and physical activity help prevent obesity in children?\n\nKey messages\n- Programs that encourage both healthy eating and physical activity in children may lead to a small reduction in body weight measures (like Body Mass Index, or BMI) for up to about 15 months, but these effects may not be long-lasting. Programs focusing only on physical activity may have a small effect for up to about 15 months, while programs focusing only on diet seemed to have little to no effect. There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects, such as injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n- Most of the available evidence comes from programs run in schools. More research is needed to understand the effects of these programs in other settings, such as in the home or the community, and for children living with disabilities.\n\nWhy is preventing obesity in children important?\nObesity in children is a major health concern around the world. It can have a serious impact on a child's health, development, and general well-being. To help prevent children from developing obesity, programs are often put in place to encourage healthier habits. These programs typically focus on promoting healthy eating, increasing physical activity, improving sleep, and reducing the time spent sitting down.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if these programs, which focus on diet, physical activity, or a combination of both, are effective at preventing obesity in children between 5 and 11 years old. We looked at the effects of these programs on measures of body weight, such as body mass index (BMI). We also wanted to know if the programs caused any serious unwanted effects, such as injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared diet or activity programs (or both) with no program to prevent obesity in children. We combined and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 172 studies that included 189,707 children. The children's average age was between 5 and 11 years, and most studies did not include children with mental or physical disabilities. The studies compared diet, physical activity, or both against no intervention or usual care, and lasted from a single visit up to four years. Most studies took place in schools in high-income countries. Most studies (132) were not funded by industry; 24 studies received some or all funding from industry.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to taking no action, programs that combine dietary changes and physical activity probably reduce children's weight slightly for up to about 15 months. Programs focused only on physical activity probably have a similar small effect for up to about 15 months. Programs focused only on diet probably make little to no difference to children's weight. In the first few months, and after about 15 months, these programs may make little to no difference. There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects, such as injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because the studies included different groups of children and ran the programs in various ways. Also, there was little information for certain groups, like children with disabilities, or for programs delivered at home.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that is clear, accurate, and meets all critical requirements. The following suggestions are aimed at making it even more precise and easy for readers to understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Clarify the Timeframes for When Effects Were Seen**\n\n- **The issue:** The summary uses phrases like \"for up to about 15 months\" which are a bit vague and group together different follow-up periods where results varied.\n- **Quote from draft:** \"...may lead to a small reduction in body weight measures... for up to about 15 months...\" and \"In the first few months, and after about 15 months, these programs may make little to no difference.\"\n- **Suggestion:** Be more specific about the time points to give readers a clearer picture. For example, you could change the first phrase to \"...when measured between 9 and 15 months later.\" For the second, you could clarify: \"However, these effects were not seen in the first 9 months, and they did not seem to last beyond 15 months.\"\n\n**2. Use More Direct Verbs and Fewer Noun Phrases**\n\n- **The issue:** Some sentences use noun phrases or passive voice where a stronger, more direct verb would be simpler and more engaging for the reader.\n- **Quote from draft:** \"It can have a serious impact on a child's health, development, and general well-being.\" and \"...programs are often put in place to encourage healthier habits.\"\n- **Suggestion:** Rewriting these with active verbs makes them more concise. Try: \"It can seriously affect a child's health, development, and well-being.\" and \"To prevent obesity, many programs encourage children to develop healthier habits.\"\n\n**3. Add Precision to the Key Message About Physical Activity**\n\n- **The issue:** The key message about activity-only programs is slightly oversimplified. It correctly states there's a small effect but omits that this effect was *only* seen in the medium term (9-15 months), not before or after.\n- **Quote from draft:** \"Programs focusing only on physical activity may have a small effect for up to about 15 months...\"\n- **Suggestion:** A more precise and helpful version would be: \"Programs focusing only on physical activity may have a small effect when measured between 9 and 15 months, but little to no effect before or after that.\"\n\nBy making these small changes, you can improve the precision and clarity of an already excellent summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable and well-structured, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile for typical PLS texts. However, it shows some deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary, with higher-than-usual counts for nouns (160.0), Dale-Chall complex words (226.0), and long words (186.0). This suggests an opportunity to simplify word choices and sentence structures further to enhance clarity."
