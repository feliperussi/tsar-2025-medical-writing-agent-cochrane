  "draft": "Can programs that encourage healthy eating and physical activity help prevent obesity in children?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Programs that encourage both healthy eating and physical activity in children may lead to a small reduction in body weight measures (like Body Mass Index, or BMI) for up to about 15 months, but these effects may not be long-lasting. Programs focusing on only diet or only physical activity seemed to have little to no effect. There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects.\n- Most of the available evidence comes from programs run in schools. More research is needed to understand the effects of these programs in other settings, such as in the home or the community, and for children living with disabilities.\n\n**Introduction**\nWhy is preventing obesity in children important?\nObesity in children is a major health concern around the world. It can have a serious impact on a child's health, development, and general well-being. To help prevent children from developing obesity, programs are often put in place to encourage behavioural changes. These programs typically focus on promoting healthy eating, increasing physical activity, improving sleep, and reducing the time spent sitting down.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if these programs, which focus on diet, physical activity, or a combination of both, are effective at preventing obesity in children between 5 and 11 years old. We looked at the effects of these programs on measures of body weight, such as body mass index (BMI). We also wanted to know if the programs caused any serious unwanted effects.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared diet or activity programs (or both) with no program to prevent obesity in children. We combined and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 172 studies that included 189,707 children. The children's average age was between 5 and 11 years, and most studies did not include children with mental or physical disabilities. The studies compared diet, physical activity, or both against no intervention or usual care, and lasted from a single visit up to four years. Most studies took place in schools in high-income countries. Most studies (132) were not funded by industry; 24 studies received some or all funding from industry.\n\nMain results: Interventions for preventing obesity in children\nCompared to taking no action, interventions that combine dietary changes and physical activity probably reduce children's weight slightly after about a year. Interventions focused only on physical activity probably have a similar small effect after a year. Interventions focused only on diet probably make little to no difference to children's weight. In the short and long term, these interventions may make little to no difference. There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the programs, and the evidence does not cover all of the children or settings we were interested in, such as children living with disabilities or programs delivered at home.\n\n**Currency of the evidence**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and factually accurate. However, it is not approved because it fails on two critical checks: several subheadings do not follow the required question format, and there is a contradiction in the findings presented. Here are the top 3 improvements needed to get this ready for publication:\n\n1. **Resolve Contradictory Findings on 'Activity Only' Programs:** The Key Message section conflicts with the Main Results section, which could confuse readers. The Key Message states that activity-only programs have 'little to no effect', while the results correctly state they have a 'small effect after a year'. Please make the Key Message consistent with the main findings.\n\n- **Problem:**\n  - *Key Message:* \"Programs focusing on only diet or only physical activity seemed to have little to no effect.\"\n  - *Main results:* \"Interventions focused only on physical activity probably have a similar small effect after a year.\"\n- **Suggestion:** Update the Key Message to reflect the nuance in the findings. For example: \"Programs focusing only on physical activity may have a small effect for up to about 15 months, while programs focusing only on diet seemed to have little to no effect.\"\n\n2. **Rephrase All Subheadings as Questions:** Per the style guide, all subheadings must be phrased as questions to help guide the reader. Several current subheadings are statements.\n\n- **Problem:** \"Methods\", \"Main results: Interventions for preventing obesity in children\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\"\n- **Suggestion:** Please rephrase these as questions:\n  - *Methods* → \"How did we conduct the review?\"\n  - *Main results...* → \"What are the main results?\"\n  - *Limitations of the evidence* → \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n  - *Currency of the evidence* → \"How up to date is this evidence?\"\n\n3. **Simplify Phrasing and Word Choice:** The linguistic analysis shows a higher-than-usual number of long or complex words for a Plain Language Summary. Replacing a few key terms would improve readability.\n\n- **Problem 1:** The currency statement is slightly awkward.\n  - *Quote:* \"The evidence is up to date to February 2023 of search.\"\n  - *Suggestion:* \"The evidence is up to date to February 2023.\"\n- **Problem 2:** Some technical phrasing can be simplified.\n  - *Quote:* \"...programs are often put in place to encourage behavioural changes.\"\n  - *Suggestion:* \"...programs are often put in place to encourage healthier habits.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 16 of 18 metrics (89%) falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, two vocabulary metrics deviate from the typical range: 'complex_words_dc' (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words) and 'long_words' are in the P90 range, indicating a higher count of unfamiliar and long words than is typical. This suggests that simplifying some word choices would improve overall readability."
