  "plain_title": "Can programs that encourage healthy eating and physical activity help prevent obesity in children?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Programs that encourage both healthy eating and physical activity in children may lead to a small reduction in body weight measures (like Body Mass Index, or BMI) for up to about 15 months, but these effects may not be long-lasting. Programs focusing on only diet or only physical activity seemed to have little to no effect. There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects.",
    "Most of the available evidence comes from programs run in schools. More research is needed to understand the effects of these programs in other settings, such as in the home or the community, and for children living with disabilities."

      "subheading": "Why is preventing obesity in children important?",
      "content": "Obesity in children is a major health concern around the world. It can have a serious impact on a child's health, development, and general well-being. To help prevent children from developing obesity, programs are often put in place to encourage behavioural changes. These programs typically focus on promoting healthy eating, increasing physical activity, improving sleep, and reducing the time spent sitting down."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if these programs, which focus on diet, physical activity, or a combination of both, are effective at preventing obesity in children between 5 and 11 years old. We looked at the effects of these programs on measures of body weight, such as body mass index (BMI). We also wanted to know if the programs caused any serious unwanted effects."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared diet or activity programs (or both) with no program to prevent obesity in children. We combined and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  ],
  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 172 studies that included 189,707 children. The children's average age was between 5 and 11 years, and most studies did not include children with mental or physical disabilities. The studies compared diet, physical activity, or both against no intervention or usual care, and lasted from a single visit up to four years. Most studies took place in schools in high-income countries. Most studies (132) were not funded by industry; 24 studies received some or all funding from industry."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Interventions for preventing obesity in children",
      "content": "Compared to taking no action, interventions that combine dietary changes and physical activity probably reduce children's weight slightly after about a year. Interventions focused only on physical activity probably have a similar small effect after a year. Interventions focused only on diet probably make little to no difference to children's weight. In the short and long term, these interventions may make little to no difference. There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the programs, and the evidence does not cover all of the children or settings we were interested in, such as children living with disabilities or programs delivered at home.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023 of search."
