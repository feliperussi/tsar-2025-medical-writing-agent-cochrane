  "draft": "Can programs that encourage healthy eating and physical activity help prevent obesity in children?\n\nKey messages\n- Programs that encourage both healthy eating and physical activity in children may lead to a small reduction in body weight measures (like Body Mass Index, or BMI) for up to about 15 months, but these effects may not be long-lasting. Programs focusing only on physical activity may have a small effect for up to about 15 months, while programs focusing only on diet seemed to have little to no effect. There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects.\n- Most of the available evidence comes from programs run in schools. More research is needed to understand the effects of these programs in other settings, such as in the home or the community, and for children living with disabilities.\n\nIntroduction\nWhy is preventing obesity in children important?\nObesity in children is a major health concern around the world. It can have a serious impact on a child's health, development, and general well-being. To help prevent children from developing obesity, programs are often put in place to encourage healthier habits. These programs typically focus on promoting healthy eating, increasing physical activity, improving sleep, and reducing the time spent sitting down.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if these programs, which focus on diet, physical activity, or a combination of both, are effective at preventing obesity in children between 5 and 11 years old. We looked at the effects of these programs on measures of body weight, such as body mass index (BMI). We also wanted to know if the programs caused any serious unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared diet or activity programs (or both) with no program to prevent obesity in children. We combined and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 172 studies that included 189,707 children. The children's average age was between 5 and 11 years, and most studies did not include children with mental or physical disabilities. The studies compared diet, physical activity, or both against no intervention or usual care, and lasted from a single visit up to four years. Most studies took place in schools in high-income countries. Most studies (132) were not funded by industry; 24 studies received some or all funding from industry.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to taking no action, interventions that combine dietary changes and physical activity probably reduce children's weight slightly after about a year. Interventions focused only on physical activity probably have a similar small effect after a year. Interventions focused only on diet probably make little to no difference to children's weight. In the short and long term, these interventions may make little to no difference. There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the programs, and the evidence does not cover all of the children or settings we were interested in, such as children living with disabilities or programs delivered at home.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, a few key improvements are needed to maximize clarity for the reader before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Clarify vague timeframes.** The main results section uses terms that may be unclear to readers.\n   - **Original Text:** \"In the short and long term, these interventions may make little to no difference.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Readers don't know what 'short term' or 'long term' means in this context. The key messages section handles this better by using \"up to about 15 months\".\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In the first few months, and after about 15 months, these programs may make little to no difference.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex sentences and vocabulary.** The limitations section contains a very long sentence and some formal language that could be simplified.\n   - **Original Text:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the programs, and the evidence does not cover all of the children or settings we were interested in, such as children living with disabilities or programs delivered at home.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** At 49 words, this sentence is difficult to follow. Phrases like \"different types of people\" and \"used different ways of delivering the programs\" are a bit clunky.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low. This is because the studies included different groups of children and ran the programs in various ways. Also, there was little information for certain groups, like children with disabilities, or for programs delivered at home.\"\n\n3. **Make abstract concepts more concrete.** The term \"serious unwanted effects\" is used correctly but could be made clearer by providing an example.\n   - **Original Text:** \"There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Readers may wonder what counts as a \"serious unwanted effect.\" Adding a brief example from the review (e.g., injuries, unhealthy dieting) makes the concept tangible.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects, such as injuries or unhealthy dieting behaviours.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make an already good summary even more accessible and clear for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft HIGHLY CONFORMS to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling within the best quartile. Readability scores, sentence length, and use of active voice are all excellent. However, the analysis identified deviations in vocabulary complexity. Specifically, the counts for 'complex_words_dc' (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words) and 'long_words' are in the P90 range, suggesting that replacing some less common or longer words with simpler alternatives would better align the text with typical PLS standards and improve reader comprehension."
