  "draft": "Can programs that encourage healthy eating and physical activity help prevent obesity in children?\n\nKey messages\n- Programs combining healthy eating and physical activity may cause a small reduction in children's weight for up to 15 months. Programs focusing only on physical activity may have a similar effect, but mainly between 9 and 15 months.\n- Programs focusing only on diet have little to no effect. The effects of any program may not last long.\n- There was not enough information to be certain about serious unwanted effects, like injuries. More research is needed on programs outside of schools and for children with disabilities.\n\nWhy is preventing obesity in children important?\nObesity in children is a major health concern around the world. It can seriously affect a child's health, development, and well-being. To prevent obesity, many programs encourage children to build healthier habits. These programs aim to help children eat healthier, be more active, sleep better, and sit less.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if programs focusing on diet, physical activity, or both can prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years. We looked at how these programs affected body weight measures, such as body mass index (BMI). We also wanted to know if the programs caused any serious unwanted effects, like injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared diet or activity programs (or both) with no program to prevent obesity in children. We combined and summarized their results, and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 172 studies with 189,707 children. The children’s average age was between 5 and 11 years. Most studies did not include children with mental or physical disabilities. The studies compared diet, physical activity, or both against no program or usual care. They lasted from a single visit up to 4 years. Most studies took place in schools in high-income countries. Most programs (132) were not funded by companies, while 24 received some or all funding from companies.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nThe studies checked on children at different times: in the short-term (up to 9 months), medium-term (9 to 15 months), and long-term (more than 15 months).\n\nCompared to taking no action:\n- Programs combining diet and physical activity may cause a small reduction in children's weight in the short- and medium-term (up to 15 months).\n- Programs focused only on physical activity may cause a similar small reduction in weight, but this was mainly seen in the medium-term (between 9 and 15 months).\n- Programs focused only on diet may make little to no difference at any time.\n\nWe found little to no effect for any program in the long-term (more than 15 months). There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects, such as injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because the studies were very different from each other. They included different groups of children and tested many types of programs, which makes the results less certain. There was also very little information for certain groups, such as children with disabilities, or for programs run outside of schools.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks passed. However, a few targeted revisions will significantly improve its clarity and precision for readers. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Reflect the different levels of evidence certainty.**\n   - **The issue:** The draft currently uses the word \"may\" to describe all findings (e.g., \"may cause a small reduction\"). This simplifies the results but loses important nuance, as the original review found stronger (moderate-certainty) evidence for some outcomes compared to others (low-certainty).\n   - **Example from the draft:** \"Programs focused only on physical activity **may** cause a similar small reduction in weight...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Use stronger wording for the more certain findings. For example: \"Programs focused only on physical activity **likely** cause a small reduction in weight between 9 and 15 months.\"\n\n2. **Simplify vocabulary and sentence structure.**\n   - **The issue:** Some sentences are slightly repetitive or use more complex words than necessary. This is supported by the evaluation metrics, which show a high number of long words and words unfamiliar to a general audience.\n   - **Example from the draft:** \"Most programs (132) were not funded by companies, while 24 received some or all funding from companies.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Make the sentence more direct and concise. For example: \"Most studies (132) did not receive funding from companies, while 24 did.\"\n\n3. **Make the link between study differences and uncertainty clearer.**\n   - **The issue:** The limitations section explains that confidence is low because studies were different, but the reason *why* this lowers confidence could be more explicit for a lay reader.\n   - **Example from the draft:** \"This is because the studies were very different from each other. They included different groups of children and tested many types of programs, which makes the results less certain.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Clarify the connection between the differences and the uncertainty. For example: \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited because the results from the studies were inconsistent. When studies test many different programs in various groups of children, it makes it harder to draw firm conclusions about what works best.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability (e.g., short sentences, active voice). However, two metrics deviate significantly: the number of long words (P90) and the number of words unfamiliar to a general audience (Dale-Chall complex words, P90). This suggests that while the sentence structure is excellent, the vocabulary could be simplified further to improve clarity."
