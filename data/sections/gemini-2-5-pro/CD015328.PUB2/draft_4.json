  "draft": "Can programs that encourage healthy eating and physical activity help prevent obesity in children?\n\nKey messages\n- Programs that combine healthy eating and physical activity may lead to a small reduction in body weight measures (like Body Mass Index, or BMI) when measured up to 15 months later, but these effects may not last. Programs focusing only on physical activity may have a small effect when measured between 9 and 15 months, but little to no effect before or after that. Programs focusing only on diet have little to no effect.\n- There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects, such as injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n- Most of the available evidence comes from programs run in schools. More research is needed to understand the effects of these programs in other settings, such as in the home or the community, and for children living with disabilities.\n\nWhy is preventing obesity in children important?\nObesity in children is a major health concern around the world. It can seriously affect a child's health, development, and well-being. To prevent obesity, many programs encourage children to develop healthier habits. These programs typically focus on promoting healthy eating, increasing physical activity, improving sleep, and reducing time spent sitting down.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if programs focusing on diet, physical activity, or both can prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years. We looked at how these programs affected body weight measures, such as body mass index (BMI). We also wanted to know if the programs caused any serious unwanted effects, like injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared diet or activity programs (or both) with no program to prevent obesity in children. We combined and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 172 studies with 189,707 children. The children’s average age was between 5 and 11 years. Most studies did not include children with mental or physical disabilities. The studies compared diet, physical activity, or both against no program or usual care. They lasted from a single visit up to 4 years. Most studies took place in schools in high-income countries. Most programs (132) were not funded by industry, while 24 received some or all funding from industry.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to taking no action:\n- Programs combining diet and physical activity probably reduce children's weight slightly. This effect was seen when measured up to 15 months later.\n- Programs focused only on physical activity probably have a small effect when measured between 9 and 15 months later.\n- Programs focused only on diet probably make little to no difference.\n\nWe found little to no effect for any program at long-term follow-up (beyond 15 months). There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects, such as injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. The studies included different groups of children and delivered the programs in various ways, which makes the results less certain. There was also very little information for certain groups, such as children with disabilities, or for programs delivered outside of schools.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. The feedback below focuses on 3 key areas to enhance clarity and ensure the language is as accessible as possible for a lay audience.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Make the Language About Certainty Consistent**\n\nYour summary uses different words to describe the certainty of the findings, which could be confusing. The Key Message uses \"may,\" while the Main Results section uses the stronger term \"probably.\"\n\n- **Problematic Sentences:**\n  - *Key Message:* \"Programs that combine healthy eating and physical activity **may lead to** a small reduction in body weight measures...\"\n  - *Main Results:* \"Programs combining diet and physical activity **probably reduce** children's weight slightly.\"\n\n- **Why it's an issue:** Using different terms for the same finding can make readers unsure about how confident they should be in the results. Sticking to one term is clearer.\n\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** Use the more cautious and consistent term \"may\" in the Main Results section to match the Key Message.\n  - *Rewrite:* \"Compared to taking no action: Programs combining diet and physical activity **may** reduce children's weight slightly. This effect was seen when measured up to 15 months later.\"\n\n**2. Replace Jargon and Complex Phrases with Simpler Alternatives**\n\nThe draft includes some phrases that are common in research but can be simplified for a public audience. This will make the summary easier to read and understand.\n\n- **Problematic Phrase 1:** \"Most of the **available evidence** comes from programs run in schools.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** \"Available evidence\" is abstract. It's clearer to talk about the studies themselves.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Most of the **studies we found** looked at programs run in schools.\"\n\n- **Problematic Phrase 2:** \"The studies included different groups of children and **delivered the programs in various ways**...\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This phrasing is a bit vague and formal. Being more direct helps the reader understand the limitation better.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies **tested many different types of programs** and included different groups of children...\"\n\n**3. Break Up Long, Complex Sentences**\n\nOne sentence in the Key Messages is quite long and contains multiple ideas. Splitting it into two shorter sentences will improve readability.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"Programs that combine healthy eating and physical activity may lead to a small reduction in body weight measures (like Body Mass Index, or BMI) when measured up to 15 months later, but these effects may not last.\"\n\n- **Why it's an issue:** This 36-word sentence presents the finding, the timeframe, and the long-term outcome all at once, which can be hard to follow.\n\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Programs combining healthy eating and physical activity may slightly reduce children's weight for up to 15 months. However, these effects may not be long-lasting.\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found that the draft has a higher number of long words and complex words (specifically, `long_words` and `complex_words_dc` were in the P90 range) than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. The proposed edits will help address this by simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, two vocabulary metrics deviate from the typical range: the number of long words (184) and the count of words unfamiliar to a general audience (Dale-Chall complex words: 229) are higher than usual. This suggests that simplifying some word choices could further improve clarity."
