  "draft": "Can programs that encourage healthy eating and physical activity help prevent obesity in children?\n\nKey messages\n- Programs combining healthy eating and physical activity may slightly reduce children's weight for up to 15 months, but these effects may not be long-lasting. Programs focusing only on physical activity may have a small effect for a limited time, while programs focusing only on diet have little to no effect.\n- There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects, such as injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n- Most of the studies we found looked at programs run in schools. More research is needed to understand the effects of these programs in other settings, such as in the home or the community, and for children living with disabilities.\n\nWhy is preventing obesity in children important?\nObesity in children is a major health concern around the world. It can seriously affect a child's health, development, and well-being. To prevent obesity, many programs encourage children to develop healthier habits. These programs typically focus on promoting healthy eating, increasing physical activity, improving sleep, and reducing time spent sitting down.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if programs focusing on diet, physical activity, or both can prevent obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years. We looked at how these programs affected body weight measures, such as body mass index (BMI). We also wanted to know if the programs caused any serious unwanted effects, like injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared diet or activity programs (or both) with no program to prevent obesity in children. We combined and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 172 studies with 189,707 children. The children’s average age was between 5 and 11 years. Most studies did not include children with mental or physical disabilities. The studies compared diet, physical activity, or both against no program or usual care. They lasted from a single visit up to 4 years. Most studies took place in schools in high-income countries. Most programs (132) were not funded by industry, while 24 received some or all funding from industry.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to taking no action:\n- Programs combining diet and physical activity may reduce children's weight slightly. This effect was seen when measured up to 15 months later.\n- Programs focused only on physical activity may have a small effect when measured between 9 and 15 months later.\n- Programs focused only on diet may make little to no difference.\n\nWe found little to no effect for any program at long-term follow-up (beyond 15 months). There was not enough information to be certain about any serious unwanted effects, such as injuries or unhealthy dieting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. The studies included different groups of children and tested many different types of programs, which makes the results less certain. There was also very little information for certain groups, such as children with disabilities, or for programs delivered outside of schools.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it is not approved because a few key sentences could be clearer for a lay audience. The first key message is a very long sentence that combines three different findings, making it hard to follow. The language used to describe the results is inconsistent (e.g., 'reduce weight slightly' vs. 'have a small effect'), which makes it difficult for readers to compare the interventions. Finally, a phrase in the methods section, 'rated our confidence in the evidence', is technical jargon that could be simplified. Addressing these three points will significantly improve the clarity of the main findings.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. Sentence length and structure are excellent. However, the draft deviates from typical patterns on vocabulary complexity. The metrics for 'complex_words_dc' (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words) and 'long_words' are in the P90 range, indicating a higher-than-usual number of uncommon or long words. This supports the editorial feedback to simplify specific technical phrases and complex sentences to improve reader comprehension."
