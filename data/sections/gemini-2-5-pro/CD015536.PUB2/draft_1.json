  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of the drug entecavir for people with chronic (long-term) hepatitis B?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is unclear what the benefits and harms of the drug entecavir are for people with long-term hepatitis B. The review could not determine if entecavir affects the risk of death or serious unwanted effects (serious health problems that may or may not be caused by the treatment) when compared to no treatment or a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n- Given that entecavir is a widely used medicine, better and larger studies are needed to understand its effects on outcomes that are important to patients, such as quality of life, and to get a clearer picture of its potential harms.\n\nWhat is chronic hepatitis B and how is it treated?\nChronic hepatitis B is a long-term liver disease that is a major public health problem worldwide. Entecavir is an antiviral medicine that many clinical guidelines recommend as a first-choice treatment for people with chronic hepatitis B. However, these recommendations have not been based on a thorough review that directly compares the effects of entecavir with no treatment or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to review the evidence from clinical trials to understand the benefits and harms of using entecavir to treat children and adults with chronic hepatitis B, compared to giving them no treatment or a placebo.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared the drug entecavir with no treatment or a placebo (a dummy treatment) in children and adults with chronic hepatitis B. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 22 studies with a total of 2940 people diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B. The studies followed participants for between 5 and 228 weeks. Most studies included only adults, while one included only children. The studies compared oral entecavir against either no treatment or a placebo. Compared with no treatment or a placebo, we do not know if entecavir has an effect on the risk of death because no deaths occurred in the studies. We also do not know if entecavir has an effect on the risk of serious unwanted effects. The evidence suggests that for every 1000 people treated, entecavir might result in as many as 44 fewer serious unwanted effects or as many as 21 more. No studies looked at the effect of entecavir on people's quality of life.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the evidence is based on few cases of condition/type of event.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It requires revisions to meet the style guide and improve clarity for readers.\n\n**Critical Issue: Subheading Format**\nThree subheadings violate the style guide rule that they must be questions.\n- **Quote:** 'Methods', 'Limitations of the evidence', 'Currency of the evidence'\n- **Problem:** These are labels, not questions. This makes the summary harder for readers to navigate.\n- **Suggestion:** Please rephrase them as questions. For example: 'How did we conduct the review?', 'What are the limitations of the evidence?', and 'How up-to-date is this evidence?'.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Simplify the definition of 'serious unwanted effects'.**\n- **Quote:** '...serious unwanted effects (serious health problems that may or may not be caused by the treatment)...'\n- **Problem:** The parenthetical definition is long and interrupts the flow of a key message.\n- **Suggestion:** Shorten the definition to make it easier to grasp. For example: '...serious unwanted effects (health problems that might be caused by the treatment).'\n\n**2. Make the results for unwanted effects more direct.**\n- **Quote:** 'The evidence suggests that for every 1000 people treated, entecavir might result in as many as 44 fewer serious unwanted effects or as many as 21 more.'\n- **Problem:** This sentence is 28 words long and the phrasing 'as many as... or as many as' is repetitive.\n- **Suggestion:** Use a more direct structure. For example: 'For every 1000 people, this means entecavir might cause anywhere from 44 fewer to 21 more serious unwanted effects.'\n\n**3. Clarify the limitations of the evidence.**\n- **Quote:** '...the evidence is based on few cases of condition/type of event.'\n- **Problem:** This phrase is vague and uses passive voice. Readers won't know what 'condition/type of event' refers to.\n- **Suggestion:** Be more specific and use active voice, based on the abstract's mention of 'few events'. For example: 'Also, the studies reported very few serious unwanted effects, which makes the results less certain.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The text generally conforms to PLS patterns, with most metrics (61%) in the best quartile for readability. However, it shows some weakness in sentence structure. The average sentence length (words_per_sentence) and use of passive voice are in the 75th percentile, indicating sentences are longer and less direct than is typical. The most significant deviation is in nominalization (P90), suggesting an overuse of noun-based phrases instead of direct verbs, which can reduce clarity and contributed to the issues identified in the feedback."
