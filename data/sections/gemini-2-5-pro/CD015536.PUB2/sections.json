  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is unclear what the benefits and harms of the drug entecavir are for people with long-term hepatitis B. The review could not determine if entecavir affects the risk of death or serious unwanted effects (serious health problems that may or may not be caused by the treatment) when compared to no treatment or a placebo (a dummy treatment).",
    "Given that entecavir is a widely used medicine, better and larger studies are needed to understand its effects on outcomes that are important to patients, such as quality of life, and to get a clearer picture of its potential harms."

      "content": "Chronic hepatitis B is a long-term liver disease that is a major public health problem worldwide. Entecavir is an antiviral medicine that many clinical guidelines recommend as a first-choice treatment for people with chronic hepatitis B. However, these recommendations have not been based on a thorough review that directly compares the effects of entecavir with no treatment or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment)."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 22 studies with a total of 2940 people diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B. The studies followed participants for between 5 and 228 weeks. Most studies included only adults, while one included only children. The studies compared oral entecavir against either no treatment or a placebo. Compared with no treatment or a placebo, we do not know if entecavir has an effect on the risk of death because no deaths occurred in the studies. We also do not know if entecavir has an effect on the risk of serious unwanted effects. The evidence suggests that for every 1000 people treated, entecavir might result in as many as 44 fewer serious unwanted effects or as many as 21 more. No studies looked at the effect of entecavir on people's quality of life."
