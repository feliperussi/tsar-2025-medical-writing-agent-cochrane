  "draft": "Can a liquid painted on teeth (silver diamine fluoride) help to prevent or treat tooth decay?\n\nKey messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a liquid painted on teeth) probably helps to prevent tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help to stop existing decay in baby teeth, but the evidence is unclear for other situations. SDF can permanently stain teeth black where it is applied. The studies did not report this clearly, so we are very uncertain about all unwanted effects.\n- We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know if silver diamine fluoride is better or worse than other common treatments for tooth decay, such as fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth) or special fillings.\n- Future studies are needed to provide more certain evidence on the effects of silver diamine fluoride, and should properly measure unwanted effects, especially the staining of teeth.\n\nWhat is tooth decay?\nTooth decay (also known as dental caries) is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person's nutrition and general well-being. Researchers are looking for treatments that are cost-effective and easy to use to either prevent tooth decay or stop it from getting worse. One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that a dentist paints directly onto the teeth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) works to prevent and manage tooth decay in both children and adults. We looked at its effects on both baby teeth and permanent (adult) teeth. We compared SDF with other treatments, a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment with no active ingredient), or no treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, different ways of applying it, or other dental treatments for preventing and managing tooth decay. We combined the results from the studies and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 participants, including 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies we found compared SDF with other treatments, including:\n- a placebo (a dummy treatment);\n- fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth);\n- sealants (a protective coating); and\n- a special type of filling.\nSome studies also compared applying SDF in different ways.\n\nCompared to a placebo or no treatment, we found that SDF:\n- probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth;\n- may help stop existing decay in baby teeth.\nHowever, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it prevents new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of permanent teeth.\n\nWhen compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may make little to no difference in preventing new decay in baby teeth, and the evidence for other uses is uncertain. For all other comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain, meaning we do not know if one treatment is better than another. The studies did not report well on the impact of SDF staining teeth, and the evidence for other unwanted effects is also very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for two main reasons. First, people in the studies likely knew which treatment they were receiving, which could have influenced the results. Second, some studies were too small to provide reliable conclusions.\n\nThis evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and accuracy have passed. However, a few targeted improvements will make it even more accessible to a lay audience. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns with direct verbs.** Some sentences use noun forms of verbs (a style called 'nominalization'), which can make the text feel more formal and less direct. Simplifying these will make the summary easier to read.\n    - **Quote:** \"We combined the results from the studies and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\"\n    - **Problem:** The phrase \"how certain we were\" is less direct than using a verb.\n    - **Suggestion:** \"We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n2. **Make the key messages more specific.** The key messages should be as clear and self-contained as possible. One point uses a vague term that requires the reader to look elsewhere for the answer.\n    - **Quote:** \"...but the evidence is unclear for other situations.\"\n    - **Problem:** Readers will immediately wonder, \"What other situations?\" This information is crucial and should be included directly in the key message.\n    - **Suggestion:** \"...but the evidence is unclear for preventing decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of adult teeth.\"\n\n3. **Simplify vocabulary to use more common words.** While generally clear, some word choices are more typical of research writing than plain language. Swapping these for everyday equivalents improves readability.\n    - **Quote:** \"This review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 participants...\"\n    - **Problem:** \"Participants\" is a formal research term. A simpler, more common word is available.\n    - **Suggestion:** \"This review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 people...\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your draft is very well-written, and most linguistic metrics are excellent. The suggestions above are supported by the PLS evaluation, which found the text deviates from typical patterns with a high number of nominalizations (23) and complex words from the Dale-Chall list (237). Addressing these points will bring the text into closer alignment with plain language best practices.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 12 of 18 metrics (66.7%) in the best quartile for readability and style. However, it deviates from typical patterns in two areas: a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) and a high count of complex words from the Dale-Chall list, suggesting the vocabulary and sentence structure could be simplified further."
