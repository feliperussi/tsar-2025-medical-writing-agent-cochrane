  "draft": "Can a liquid painted on teeth (silver diamine fluoride) help to prevent or treat tooth decay?\n\nKey messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a liquid painted on teeth) probably helps to prevent tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help to stop existing decay in baby teeth, but the evidence is unclear for other situations. A known unwanted effect is permanent black staining, but because the studies did not report this clearly, the evidence about all unwanted effects is very uncertain.\n- We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know if silver diamine fluoride is better or worse than other common treatments for tooth decay, such as fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth) or special fillings.\n- Future studies are needed to provide more certain evidence on the effects of silver diamine fluoride, and should properly measure unwanted effects, especially the staining of teeth.\n\nWhat is tooth decay?\nTooth decay (also known as dental caries) is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person's nutrition and general well-being. Researchers are looking for treatments that are cost-effective and easy to use to either prevent tooth decay or stop it from getting worse. One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that a dentist paints directly onto the teeth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) works to prevent and manage tooth decay in both children and adults. We looked at its effects on both baby teeth and permanent (adult) teeth. We compared SDF with other treatments, a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment with no active ingredient), or no treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, different ways of applying it, or other dental treatments for preventing and managing tooth decay. We combined the results from the studies and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 participants, including 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies we found compared SDF with other treatments, including:\n- a placebo (a dummy treatment);\n- fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth);\n- sealants (a protective coating); and\n- a special type of filling.\nSome studies also compared different ways of applying SDF. Compared to a placebo or no treatment, SDF probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth. It may also help stop existing decay in baby teeth. However, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it prevents new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of permanent teeth. When compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may make little to no difference in preventing new decay in baby teeth, and the evidence for other uses is uncertain. For all other comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain, meaning we do not know if one treatment is better than another. The studies did not report well on the impact of SDF staining teeth, and the evidence for other unwanted effects is also very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for two main reasons. First, people in the studies likely knew which treatment they were receiving, which could have influenced the results. Second, some studies were too small to provide reliable conclusions.\n\nThis evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and length. The readability scores are excellent. However, there are a few key areas for improvement to make the text more direct and easier for readers to understand. My feedback focuses on reducing complex noun phrases and clarifying the structure of the main findings.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Make the key message on side effects more direct.**\n    *   **The issue:** The current wording is a bit convoluted and less clear than it could be.\n    *   **In the draft:** \"A known unwanted effect is permanent black staining, but because the studies did not report this clearly, the evidence about all unwanted effects is very uncertain.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite this as two simpler sentences to improve clarity. For example: \"SDF can permanently stain teeth black where it is applied. The studies did not report this clearly, so we are very uncertain about all unwanted effects.\"\n\n2.  **Use more direct verbs instead of complex nouns (reduce nominalization).**\n    *   **The issue:** Some sentences are built around noun phrases where a simple verb would be more direct and easier to read.\n    *   **In the draft:** \"Some studies also compared different ways of applying SDF.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase to use the verb directly. For example: \"Some studies also compared applying SDF in different ways.\"\n\n3.  **Clarify the structure of the main findings.**\n    *   **The issue:** The paragraph summarizing the results contains several key findings in a single block of text, which can be difficult for readers to process.\n    *   **In the draft:** \"Compared to a placebo or no treatment, SDF probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth. It may also help stop existing decay in baby teeth. However, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it prevents new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of permanent teeth.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Use a simple list to break up the information and make the distinct findings easier to digest. For example: \"Compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment, we found that SDF:\n        - probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth;\n        - may help stop existing decay in baby teeth.\n    However, we are very uncertain if it prevents new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of permanent teeth.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make an already good summary even clearer for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 11 of 18 metrics (61%) falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, the analysis identified three metrics that deviate significantly from typical patterns (in the P90 range), indicating areas for improvement. These are a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), a high total noun count, and a high count of complex words from the Dale-Chall list. This statistical evidence supports the editorial feedback to use more direct verbs and simplify sentence structures."
