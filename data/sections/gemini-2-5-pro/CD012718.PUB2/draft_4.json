  "draft": "Can a liquid painted on teeth (silver diamine fluoride) help to prevent or treat tooth decay?\n\nKey messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a liquid painted on teeth) probably helps to prevent tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help to stop existing decay in baby teeth, but the evidence is unclear if it helps in other situations. The main unwanted effect is permanent black staining where the liquid is applied, but the studies did not report this clearly.\n- We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know if silver diamine fluoride is better or worse than other common treatments for tooth decay, such as fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth) or special fillings.\n- Future studies are needed to provide more certain evidence on the effects of silver diamine fluoride, and should properly measure unwanted effects, especially the staining of teeth.\n\nWhat is tooth decay?\nTooth decay (also known as dental caries) is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person's nutrition and general well-being. Researchers are looking for treatments that are cost-effective and easy to use to either prevent tooth decay or stop it from getting worse. One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that is applied directly to the teeth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) works to prevent and manage tooth decay in both children and adults. We looked at its effects on both baby teeth and permanent (adult) teeth. We compared SDF with other treatments, a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment with no active ingredient), or no treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, different ways of applying it, or other dental treatments for preventing and managing tooth decay. We combined the results from the studies and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 participants, including 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies we found compared SDF against several alternatives: a placebo (dummy treatment), fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth), sealants (a protective coating), and a special type of filling. Some studies also compared different ways of applying SDF. Compared to a placebo or no treatment, SDF probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth. It may also help stop existing decay in baby teeth. However, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it prevents new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of permanent teeth. When compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may make little to no difference in preventing new decay in baby teeth, and the evidence for other uses is uncertain. For all other comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain, meaning we do not know if one treatment is better than another. The studies did not report well on the impact of SDF staining teeth, and the evidence for other unwanted effects is also very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for two main reasons. First, people in the studies likely knew which treatment they were receiving, which could have influenced the results. Second, some studies were too small to provide reliable conclusions.\n\nThis evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and meets all critical checks for completeness and word count. The feedback below focuses on 3 key areas to enhance readability and fully align with plain language principles, making the summary even more accessible to patients.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Clarify the Certainty About Side Effects**\n\n*   **Quote from draft:** \"The main unwanted effect is permanent black staining where the liquid is applied, but the studies did not report this clearly.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This states definitively that staining *is* the main unwanted effect found in the review. However, the source abstract notes that the evidence for all adverse effects is \"very uncertain\" because staining was \"poorly reported\". The sentence should more closely reflect this uncertainty.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"A known unwanted effect of SDF is permanent black staining where the liquid is applied. However, the studies in this review did not report clearly on this or other unwanted effects, so the evidence about them is very uncertain.\"\n\n**2. Strengthen Active Voice and Use Simpler Verbs**\n\n*   **Quote from draft:** \"One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that is applied directly to the teeth.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"is applied\" is passive. The style guide recommends using active voice to make the text more direct and engaging (e.g., who is doing the action?).\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that a dentist paints directly onto the teeth.\"\n\n**3. Simplify Complex Sentence Structure and Vocabulary**\n\n*   **Quote from draft:** \"The studies we found compared SDF against several alternatives: a placebo (dummy treatment), fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth), sealants (a protective **[sic]** coating), and a special type of filling.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is long and contains the slightly formal word \"alternatives\". Breaking up long lists can improve readability for audiences with lower health literacy.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies we found compared SDF with other treatments, including:\n    - a placebo (a dummy treatment);\n    - fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth);\n    - sealants (a protective coating); and\n    - a special type of filling.\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis\n\nYour draft is very well-written and scores highly on most readability metrics. The suggestions above are supported by the linguistic analysis, which flagged a higher-than-typical number of complex words (`complex_words_dc`) and noun-form verbs (`nominalization`). Adopting these edits will help address those patterns and further improve clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with over 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, the analysis identified two areas for improvement: the use of noun-form verbs (nominalization) and the number of complex SDF words from the Dale-Chall list are higher than typical, falling in the P90 range. This suggests the text could be made more direct and easier to understand by using more common vocabulary and active verbs."
