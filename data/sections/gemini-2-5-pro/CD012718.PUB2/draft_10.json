  "draft": "Can a liquid painted on teeth (silver diamine fluoride) help to prevent or treat tooth decay?\n\nKey messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a liquid painted on teeth) probably helps to prevent tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help to stop existing decay in baby teeth, but the evidence is unclear if it helps in other situations. The main unwanted effect is permanent black staining where the liquid is applied, but the studies did not provide clear information about this.\n- We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know if silver diamine fluoride is better or worse than other common treatments for tooth decay, such as fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth) or special fillings.\n- Future studies are needed to provide more certain evidence on the effects of silver diamine fluoride, and should properly measure unwanted effects, especially the staining of teeth.\n\nWhat is tooth decay?\nTooth decay (also known as dental caries) is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person's nutrition and general well-being. Researchers are looking for treatments that are cost-effective and easy to use to either prevent tooth decay or stop it from getting worse. One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that a dentist paints directly onto the teeth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) works to prevent and manage tooth decay in both children and adults. We looked at its effects on both baby teeth and permanent (adult) teeth. We compared SDF with other treatments, a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment with no active ingredient), or no treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, different ways of applying it, or other dental treatments for preventing and managing tooth decay. We compared and combined the results from the studies. We then graded how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 people, including 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies we found compared SDF with:\n- a placebo (a dummy treatment)\n- fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth)\n- sealants (a protective coating)\n- special fillings that can be applied without drilling\n\nSome studies also compared applying SDF in different ways.\n\nCompared to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment, we found that SDF:\n- probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth\n- may help stop existing decay in baby teeth\n\nFor other uses, such as preventing new decay in baby teeth or on the chewing surfaces of adult teeth, the evidence was very uncertain.\n\nWhen compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may make little to no difference in preventing new decay in baby teeth, and the evidence for other uses is uncertain. For all other comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain, meaning we do not know if one treatment is better than another. The studies did not report well on the impact of SDF staining teeth, and the evidence for other unwanted effects is also very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because most studies had weaknesses in their methods. For example, dentists and participants often knew which treatment they were receiving. Knowing which treatment they received could have affected what they reported about things like pain or how happy they were with the results. Also, some studies were very small, which makes their results less certain.\n\nThis evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it is NOT_APPROVED because several improvements are needed to enhance clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of noun-heavy phrases, some complex vocabulary, and a slightly confusing structure in the results section. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** This makes the writing more active and easier to understand. This is supported by a high 'nominalization' score in the analysis.\n    *   **Problem:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is low.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We have low confidence in the evidence.'\n    *   **Problem:** 'Knowing which treatment they received could have affected what they reported about things like pain or how happy they were with the results.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'This knowledge could have affected how they reported things like pain or their satisfaction with the results.'\n\n2. **Replace complex or vague words with simpler, everyday language.** The analysis shows a high number of long and complex words.\n    *   **Problem:** '...affect a person's nutrition and general well-being.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** '...affect a person's ability to eat and their overall health.'\n\n3. **Improve the structure of the results for better clarity.** The list of comparisons in the 'What did we find?' section is incomplete, which may confuse readers.\n    *   **Problem:** The text lists four comparisons in bullet points, then adds 'Some studies also compared applying SDF in different ways' in a separate sentence.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Integrate all comparisons into a single, clear list. For example:\n        'The studies we found compared SDF with:\n        - a placebo (a dummy treatment)\n        - fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth)\n        - sealants (a protective coating)\n        - special fillings that can be applied without drilling\n\n        Some studies also compared applying SDF in different ways.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns, with 10 out of 18 metrics (55.6%) falling in the best quartile. Readability scores are excellent (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 9.78). However, there is a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure. Four metrics are in the P90 range, indicating higher-than-usual complexity: nominalization (26.0), noun count (167.0), Dale-Chall complex words (252.0), and long words (169.0). This suggests the text is noun-heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a PLS, which could be simplified for better clarity."
