  "draft": "Can a liquid painted on teeth (silver diamine fluoride) help to prevent or treat tooth decay?\n\nKey messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a liquid painted on teeth) probably helps to prevent tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help to stop existing decay in baby teeth, but the evidence is unclear if it helps in other situations. The main unwanted effect is permanent black staining where the liquid is applied, but the studies did not provide clear information about this.\n- We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know if silver diamine fluoride is better or worse than other common treatments for tooth decay, such as fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth) or special fillings.\n- Future studies are needed to provide more certain evidence on the effects of silver diamine fluoride, and should properly measure unwanted effects, especially the staining of teeth.\n\nWhat is tooth decay?\nTooth decay (also known as dental caries) is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person's nutrition and general well-being. Researchers are looking for treatments that are cost-effective and easy to use to either prevent tooth decay or stop it from getting worse. One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that is applied directly to the teeth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) works to prevent and manage tooth decay in both children and adults. We looked at its effects on both baby teeth and permanent (adult) teeth. We compared SDF with other treatments, a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment with no active ingredient), or no treatment.\n\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with a placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment, different ways of applying it, or other dental treatments for preventing and managing tooth decay.\n\nInclusion Criteria\nEligible studies were those that and that evaluated silver diamine fluoride against a placebo, no treatment, alternative application methods, or other dental interventions for caries prevention or management.\n\nData Synthesis\nThe results of the included studies were summarized, and the overall findings were compiled.\n\nConfidence Assessment\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence using an appropriate grading system.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 participants, comprising 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies evaluated silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for preventing and managing dental caries. The main comparisons included SDF versus a placebo or no treatment, different SDF application methods, SDF versus fluoride varnish, SDF versus sealants, and SDF versus atraumatic restorative treatment. When compared to a placebo or no treatment, SDF probably helps prevent new tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help SDF may help stop existing decay in baby teeth. However, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it prevents new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of permanent teeth. When compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may make little to no difference in preventing new decay in baby teeth, and the evidence for other uses is uncertain. For all other comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain, meaning we do not know if one treatment is better than another. The impact of SDF staining teeth was not well reported, and the evidence for other unwanted effects is also very uncertain.\n\nLimitations of evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and some of the studies were very small.\n\nEvidence currency statement\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions before it's ready for publication. The main issue is the 'Methods' section, which uses technical subheadings and jargon instead of the required question format and plain language. This makes a key part of the summary difficult for a lay audience to understand. Additionally, the text frequently uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which makes the writing less direct and more abstract.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rewrite the 'Methods' section subheadings and content.** The current subheadings ('Search Strategy', 'Inclusion Criteria', etc.) are technical and do not follow the style guide rule to use questions. The content is also too formal for a plain language summary.\n   - **Problematic Subheadings:** \"Search Strategy\", \"Inclusion Criteria\", \"Data Synthesis\", \"Confidence Assessment\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Replace these with simple questions that a reader would ask, such as:\n     - \"What did we do?\"\n     - \"We searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with other treatments (or no treatment) for tooth decay in children and adults. To assess the evidence, we summarized the results and rated our confidence in them.\"\n\n2. **Use active verbs instead of noun forms (nominalizations).** The draft has a high number of nominalizations, which makes sentences less direct. Changing these nouns back into verbs will make the text more active and easier to read.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"The studies evaluated silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for preventing and managing dental caries.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies evaluated how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) prevents and manages tooth decay.\"\n   - **Another Example:** \"...different SDF application methods...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...different ways of applying SDF...\"\n\n3. **Clarify the wording of the currency statement.** The current phrasing is slightly awkward for a lay reader.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"The evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This evidence is up to date to June 2023.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall readability, with several metrics falling in the best quartile for PLS texts (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 11.7). However, the analysis also highlights significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure. The number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90), and the counts for total nouns, long words, and complex words are also in the highest decile (P90). These metrics support the editorial feedback, indicating that while the text is generally readable, specific sections contain dense, abstract, and unnecessarily complex language that should be simplified."
