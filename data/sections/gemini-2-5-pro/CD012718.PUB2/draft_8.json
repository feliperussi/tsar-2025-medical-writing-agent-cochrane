  "draft": "Can a liquid painted on teeth (silver diamine fluoride) help to prevent or treat tooth decay?\n\nKey messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a liquid painted on teeth) probably helps to prevent tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help to stop existing decay in baby teeth, but the evidence is unclear if it helps in other situations. The main unwanted effect is permanent black staining where the liquid is applied, but the studies did not provide clear information about this.\n- We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know if silver diamine fluoride is better or worse than other common treatments for tooth decay, such as fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth) or special fillings.\n- Future studies are needed to provide more certain evidence on the effects of silver diamine fluoride, and should properly measure unwanted effects, especially the staining of teeth.\n\nWhat is tooth decay?\nTooth decay (also known as dental caries) is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person's nutrition and general well-being. Researchers are looking for treatments that are cost-effective and easy to use to either prevent tooth decay or stop it from getting worse. One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that a dentist paints directly onto the teeth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) works to prevent and manage tooth decay in both children and adults. We looked at its effects on both baby teeth and permanent (adult) teeth. We compared SDF with other treatments, a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment with no active ingredient), or no treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, different ways of applying it, or other dental treatments for preventing and managing tooth decay. We compared and combined the results from the studies. We then graded how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 people, including 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies we found compared SDF with:\n- a placebo (a dummy treatment)\n- fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth)\n- sealants (a protective coating)\n- a special type of filling\n\nSome studies also compared applying SDF in different ways.\n\nCompared to a placebo or no treatment, we found that SDF:\n- probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth\n- may help stop existing decay in baby teeth\n\nHowever, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it prevents new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of permanent teeth.\n\nWhen compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may make little to no difference in preventing new decay in baby teeth, and the evidence for other uses is uncertain. For all other comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain, meaning we do not know if one treatment is better than another. The studies did not report well on the impact of SDF staining teeth, and the evidence for other unwanted effects is also very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for two main reasons. First, people in the studies likely knew which treatment they were receiving, which could have affected the results. Second, some studies were too small to give reliable results.\n\nThis evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and accuracy have passed. The summary is close to approval, but requires a few revisions to enhance clarity for a lay audience. The feedback below focuses on making the explanation of the evidence's limitations more concrete and simplifying some complex sentence structures to ensure the key findings are as easy as possible to understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Make the explanation of evidence limitations more concrete.**\n\n*   **Quote from draft:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low for two main reasons. First, people in the studies likely knew which treatment they were receiving, which could have affected the results. Second, some studies were too small to give reliable results.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This explains *that* there are limitations but is a bit too abstract about *why* they matter. Phrases like \"could have affected the results\" and \"less reliable\" don't give the reader a clear picture of the real-world implications.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low. This is because most studies had weaknesses in their methods. For example, dentists and participants often knew which treatment they were receiving. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported effects like pain or satisfaction. Also, some studies were very small, which makes their results less certain.\"\n\n**2. Simplify the structure of the main findings to improve clarity.**\n\n*   **Quote from draft:** \"Compared to a placebo or no treatment, we found that SDF: - probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth - may help stop existing decay in baby teeth. However, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it prevents new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of permanent teeth.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Presenting two positive findings and then immediately following with a long sentence that qualifies one of them is slightly confusing. It forces the reader to re-read to understand which finding is being partially contradicted.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment, we found that SDF:\n    - probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth;\n    - may help stop existing decay in baby teeth.\nFor other uses, such as preventing new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of adult teeth, the evidence was very uncertain.\"\n\n**3. Clarify the vague term \"a special type of filling\".**\n\n*   **Quote from draft:** \"The studies we found compared SDF with: ... - a special type of filling\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** While simplifying \"atraumatic restorative treatment\" is a good idea, \"a special type of filling\" is too vague and may leave readers wondering what makes it special. Adding a brief, practical explanation would be more helpful.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"- a special type of filling (that can be applied without drilling)\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft deviates from typical PLS patterns in its use of complex vocabulary and abstract nouns (`complex_words_dc` and `nominalization` are both in the P90 range). Adopting the suggested rewrites will help address this by using more direct, concrete language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS draft is well-structured and highly readable, with 67% of its linguistic features falling into the best quartile for PLS conformity. However, it shows significant deviation from typical patterns in two areas: the use of complex words not on the Dale-Chall list (238 instances, placing it in the P90 range) and a high number of nominalizations (24 instances, also P90). These metrics suggest that simplifying vocabulary and using more direct verb forms could further improve clarity."
