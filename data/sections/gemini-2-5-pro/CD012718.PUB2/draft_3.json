  "draft": "Can a liquid painted on teeth (silver diamine fluoride) help to prevent or treat tooth decay?\n\nKey messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a liquid painted on teeth) probably helps to prevent tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help to stop existing decay in baby teeth, but the evidence is unclear if it helps in other situations. The main unwanted effect is permanent black staining where the liquid is applied, but the studies did not provide clear information about this.\n- We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know if silver diamine fluoride is better or worse than other common treatments for tooth decay, such as fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth) or special fillings.\n- Future studies are needed to provide more certain evidence on the effects of silver diamine fluoride, and should properly measure unwanted effects, especially the staining of teeth.\n\nWhat is tooth decay?\nTooth decay (also known as dental caries) is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person's nutrition and general well-being. Researchers are looking for treatments that are cost-effective and easy to use to either prevent tooth decay or stop it from getting worse. One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that is applied directly to the teeth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) works to prevent and manage tooth decay in both children and adults. We looked at its effects on both baby teeth and permanent (adult) teeth. We compared SDF with other treatments, a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment with no active ingredient), or no treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, different ways of applying it, or other dental treatments for preventing and managing tooth decay. We combined the results from the studies and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 participants, including 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies looked at how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) prevents and manages tooth decay. The studies compared SDF with several other treatments, such as a placebo (a dummy treatment), fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth), sealants (a protective coating), and a special type of filling. They also looked at different ways of applying SDF. Compared to a placebo or no treatment, SDF probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth. It may also help stop existing decay in baby teeth. However, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it prevents new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of permanent teeth. When compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may make little to no difference in preventing new decay in baby teeth, and the evidence for other uses is uncertain. For all other comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain, meaning we do not know if one treatment is better than another. The studies did not report well on the impact of SDF staining teeth, and the evidence for other unwanted effects is also very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and some of the studies were very small.\n\nThis evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, clear summary that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. The readability scores are excellent. To make it even more direct and easier for readers to follow, I have three suggestions focusing on using more active language and streamlining key sentences.\n\n**1. Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.**\nThis makes the writing more active and easier to understand.\n- **Original sentence:** \"The main unwanted effect is permanent black staining where the liquid is applied, but the studies did not provide clear information about this.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"provide clear information\" is less direct than a simple verb.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The main unwanted effect is permanent black staining where the liquid is applied, but the studies did not report this clearly.\"\n\n**2. Streamline the description of the studies to avoid repetition.**\nCombining related ideas can improve the flow of the 'What did we find?' section.\n- **Original sentences:** \"The studies looked at how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) prevents and manages tooth decay. The studies compared SDF with several other treatments... They also looked at different ways of applying SDF.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Repeating \"The studies looked/compared/looked\" is a bit clunky and makes the paragraph less engaging.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies we found compared SDF against several alternatives: a placebo (dummy treatment), fluoride varnish, sealants (a protective coating), and a special type of filling. Some studies also compared different ways of applying SDF.\"\n\n**3. Explain *why* the evidence is less reliable.**\nAdding a brief explanation helps readers understand the impact of study limitations.\n- **Original sentence:** \"We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and some of the studies were very small.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Readers may not understand why \"being aware of the treatment\" is a problem.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low for two main reasons. First, people in the studies likely knew which treatment they were receiving, which could have influenced the results. Second, some studies were too small to provide reliable conclusions.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:**\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft had a high number of 'nominalizations' (noun-forms of verbs) and a high overall noun count. Addressing these points will make an already good summary even better.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns, with 10 of 18 metrics (55.6%) falling into the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, the analysis identified significant deviations in three areas: nominalization (use of noun-forms of verbs), total noun count, and the number of complex words from the Dale-Chall list. These metrics suggest the text, while readable, could be made more direct and less dense by using more active verbs and simplifying some vocabulary."
