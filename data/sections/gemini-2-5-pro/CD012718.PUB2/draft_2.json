  "draft": "Can a liquid painted on teeth (silver diamine fluoride) help to prevent or treat tooth decay?\n\nKey messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a liquid painted on teeth) probably helps to prevent tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help to stop existing decay in baby teeth, but the evidence is unclear if it helps in other situations. The main unwanted effect is permanent black staining where the liquid is applied, but the studies did not provide clear information about this.\n- We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know if silver diamine fluoride is better or worse than other common treatments for tooth decay, such as fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth) or special fillings.\n- Future studies are needed to provide more certain evidence on the effects of silver diamine fluoride, and should properly measure unwanted effects, especially the staining of teeth.\n\nWhat is tooth decay?\nTooth decay (also known as dental caries) is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person's nutrition and general well-being. Researchers are looking for treatments that are cost-effective and easy to use to either prevent tooth decay or stop it from getting worse. One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that is applied directly to the teeth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) works to prevent and manage tooth decay in both children and adults. We looked at its effects on both baby teeth and permanent (adult) teeth. We compared SDF with other treatments, a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment with no active ingredient), or no treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, different ways of applying it, or other dental treatments for preventing and managing tooth decay. We collected and combined the results from the studies and used a standard system to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 participants, including 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies looked at how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) prevents and manages tooth decay. The main treatments compared were SDF versus a placebo or no treatment, different ways of applying SDF, SDF versus fluoride varnish, SDF versus sealants, and SDF versus special fillings (known as atraumatic restorative treatment). When compared to a placebo or no treatment, SDF probably helps prevent new tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help stop existing decay in baby teeth. However, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it prevents new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of permanent teeth. When compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may make little to no difference in preventing new decay in baby teeth, and the evidence for other uses is uncertain. For all other comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain, meaning we do not know if one treatment is better than another. The studies did not report well on the impact of SDF staining teeth, and the evidence for other unwanted effects is also very uncertain.\n\nLimitations of evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and some of the studies were very small.\n\nThis evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

However, it is not approved because it fails a critical check: one subheading does not follow the required question format. I have also identified three key areas where we can improve clarity for readers by simplifying technical language and sentence structure.\n\n**Critical Issue (Must Fix)**\n\n*   **Subheading Format:** One subheading is not phrased as a question, which is required by the style guide.\n    *   **Text:** \"Limitations of evidence\"\n    *   **Problem:** Subheadings should be questions to guide the reader.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Change this to \"How reliable is the evidence?\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed**\n\n1.  **Simplify the List of Technical Treatments:** The sentence listing all the treatment comparisons is long and contains jargon that may be unfamiliar to readers.\n    *   **Text:** \"The main treatments compared were SDF versus a placebo or no treatment, different ways of applying SDF, SDF versus fluoride varnish, SDF versus sealants, and SDF versus special fillings (known as atraumatic restorative treatment).\"\n    *   **Problem:** This list is dense and terms like 'sealants' and 'atraumatic restorative treatment' are technical. It's hard for a reader to absorb all at once.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this down and define the terms more simply. For example: \"The studies compared SDF to several other options: a placebo (a dummy treatment), fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth), sealants (a protective coating), and a special type of filling.\"\n\n2.  **Use More Direct Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases:** Some sentences use noun forms where a direct verb would be simpler and more active. This is reflected in the high 'nominalization' score.\n    *   **Text:** \"We collected and combined the results from the studies and used a standard system to rate our confidence in the evidence.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This phrasing is slightly indirect. Using simpler, more active verbs makes the process clearer.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite as \"We combined the results from the studies and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\"\n\n3.  **Break Up Long, Complex Sentences:** The main findings are packed into one long sentence. Splitting it would make the key results easier to understand and remember.\n    *   **Text:** \"When compared to a placebo or no treatment, SDF probably helps prevent new tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help stop existing decay in baby teeth.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This 26-word sentence combines two separate findings, which can reduce clarity.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Split this into two distinct sentences: \"Compared to a placebo or no treatment, SDF probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth. It may also help stop existing decay in baby teeth.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns. Readability scores like the Flesch-Kincaid Grade (11.04) are excellent, falling within the best quartile. However, the analysis identified three metrics that deviate from typical patterns: 'nominalization' (use of noun-form verbs), 'nouns', and 'complex_words_dc' (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words) are all in the P90 range. These results support the editorial feedback to use more direct verbs and simplify technical terms to further improve clarity."
