  "draft": "Can a liquid painted on teeth (silver diamine fluoride) help to prevent or treat tooth decay?\n\nKey messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a liquid painted on teeth) probably helps to prevent tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help to stop existing decay in baby teeth, but the evidence is unclear for preventing decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of adult teeth. It can permanently stain teeth black where it is applied, but the studies did not report this clearly, so we are very uncertain about unwanted effects.\n- We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know if silver diamine fluoride is better or worse than other common treatments for tooth decay, such as fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth) or special fillings.\n- Future studies are needed to provide more certain evidence on the effects of silver diamine fluoride, and should properly measure unwanted effects, especially the staining of teeth.\n\nWhat is tooth decay?\nTooth decay (also known as dental caries) is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person's nutrition and general well-being. Researchers are looking for treatments that are cost-effective and easy to use to either prevent tooth decay or stop it from getting worse. One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that a dentist paints directly onto the teeth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) works to prevent and manage tooth decay in both children and adults. We looked at its effects on both baby teeth and permanent (adult) teeth. We compared SDF with other treatments, a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment with no active ingredient), or no treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, different ways of applying it, or other dental treatments for preventing and managing tooth decay. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 people, including 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies we found compared SDF with other treatments, including:\n- a placebo (a dummy treatment);\n- fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth);\n- sealants (a protective coating); and\n- a special type of filling.\nSome studies also compared applying SDF in different ways.\n\nCompared to a placebo or no treatment, we found that SDF:\n- probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth;\n- may help stop existing decay in baby teeth.\nHowever, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it prevents new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of permanent teeth.\n\nWhen compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may make little to no difference in preventing new decay in baby teeth, and the evidence for other uses is uncertain. For all other comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain, meaning we do not know if one treatment is better than another. The studies did not report well on the impact of SDF staining teeth, and the evidence for other unwanted effects is also very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for two main reasons. First, people in the studies likely knew which treatment they were receiving, which could have influenced the results. Second, some studies were too small to provide reliable conclusions.\n\nThis evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

I'm recommending a few revisions to address a pattern of slightly formal language and formatting before approval.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** Some sentences are less direct because they use noun forms of verbs (nominalizations). Changing these to action verbs makes the text clearer.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n    *   **Reasoning:** The phrase \"rated our confidence\" is abstract. Using a more direct verb makes it clearer what you did.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We compared and combined the results from the studies. We then graded how certain we were about the evidence.\"\n\n2.  **Improve the formatting of lists for readability.** The list of treatments is presented as a single sentence with semicolons, which is dense and hard to scan.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"The studies we found compared SDF with other treatments, including: - a placebo (a dummy treatment); - fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth); - sealants (a protective coating); and - a special type of filling.\"\n    *   **Reasoning:** A proper bulleted list with line breaks is much easier for readers to skim and understand, in line with the style guide's principles.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:**\n        \"The studies we found compared SDF with:\n        - a placebo (a dummy treatment)\n        - fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth)\n        - sealants (a protective coating)\n        - a special type of filling\"\n\n3.  **Replace less common words with simpler alternatives.** To maximize readability, it's best to use everyday words where possible.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"...which could have influenced the results.\"\n    *   **Reasoning:** While correct, the word \"influenced\" is less common than a simpler alternative.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"...which could have affected the results.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns overall, with 61% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis supports the need for the suggested edits. Three metrics deviate significantly from the typical pattern (P90 range): 'nominalization' (24 instances), 'nouns' (163 instances), and 'complex_words_dc' (244 words). This pattern indicates a tendency towards a more academic or noun-heavy style than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which the recommended edits will help address."
