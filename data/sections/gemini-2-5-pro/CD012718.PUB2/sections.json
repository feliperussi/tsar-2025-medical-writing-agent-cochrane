  "key_messages": [
    "Silver diamine fluoride (a liquid painted on teeth) probably helps to prevent tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help to stop existing decay in baby teeth, but the evidence is unclear if it helps in other situations. The main unwanted effect is permanent black staining where the liquid is applied, but the studies did not provide clear information about this.",
    "We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know if silver diamine fluoride is better or worse than other common treatments for tooth decay, such as fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth) or special fillings.",
    "Future studies are needed to provide more certain evidence on the effects of silver diamine fluoride, and should properly measure unwanted effects, especially the staining of teeth."

      "content": "Tooth decay (also known as dental caries) is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person's nutrition and general well-being. Researchers are looking for treatments that are cost-effective and easy to use to either prevent tooth decay or stop it from getting worse. One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that is applied directly to the teeth."

We looked at its effects on both baby teeth and permanent (adult) teeth. We compared SDF with other treatments, a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment with no active ingredient), or no treatment."

      "content": "This review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 participants, comprising 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies evaluated silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for preventing and managing dental caries. The main comparisons included SDF versus a placebo or no treatment, different SDF application methods, SDF versus fluoride varnish, SDF versus sealants, and SDF versus atraumatic restorative treatment. When compared to a placebo or no treatment, SDF probably helps prevent new tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help SDF may help stop existing decay in baby teeth. However, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it prevents new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of permanent teeth. When compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may make little to no difference in preventing new decay in baby teeth, and the evidence for other uses is uncertain. For all other comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain, meaning we do not know if one treatment is better than another. The impact of SDF staining teeth was not well reported, and the evidence for other unwanted effects is also very uncertain."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and some of the studies were very small.",
