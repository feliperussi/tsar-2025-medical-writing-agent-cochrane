  "draft": "Can a liquid painted on teeth (silver diamine fluoride) help to prevent or treat tooth decay?\n\nKey messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a liquid painted on teeth) probably helps to prevent tooth decay on the roots of teeth and may help to stop existing decay in baby teeth, but the evidence is unclear if it helps in other situations. The main unwanted effect is permanent black staining where the liquid is applied, but the studies did not provide clear information about this.\n- We do not have enough good-quality evidence to know if silver diamine fluoride is better or worse than other common treatments for tooth decay, such as fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth) or special fillings.\n- Future studies are needed to provide more certain evidence on the effects of silver diamine fluoride, and should properly measure unwanted effects, especially the staining of teeth.\n\nWhat is tooth decay?\nTooth decay (also known as dental caries) is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person's nutrition and general well-being. Researchers are looking for treatments that are cost-effective and easy to use to either prevent tooth decay or stop it from getting worse. One such treatment is silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a liquid that a dentist paints directly onto the teeth.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well silver diamine fluoride (SDF) works to prevent and manage tooth decay in both children and adults. We looked at its effects on both baby teeth and permanent (adult) teeth. We compared SDF with other treatments, a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment with no active ingredient), or no treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, different ways of applying it, or other dental treatments for preventing and managing tooth decay. We compared and combined the results from the studies. We then graded how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 29 studies with a total of 13,036 people, including 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies we found compared SDF with:\n- a placebo (a dummy treatment)\n- fluoride varnish (another liquid painted on teeth)\n- sealants (a protective coating)\n- a special type of filling (that can be applied without drilling)\n\nSome studies also compared applying SDF in different ways.\n\nCompared to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment, we found that SDF:\n- probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth\n- may help stop existing decay in baby teeth\n\nFor other uses, such as preventing new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of adult teeth, the evidence was very uncertain.\n\nWhen compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may make little to no difference in preventing new decay in baby teeth, and the evidence for other uses is uncertain. For all other comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain, meaning we do not know if one treatment is better than another. The studies did not report well on the impact of SDF staining teeth, and the evidence for other unwanted effects is also very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because most studies had weaknesses in their methods. For example, dentists and participants often knew which treatment they were receiving. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported effects like pain or satisfaction. Also, some studies were very small, which makes their results less certain.\n\nThis evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

The linguistic analysis supports this, showing the text uses more nouns, long words, and 'nominalizations' (verbs turned into nouns) than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Focusing on the following 3 improvements will make the summary more accessible.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Clarify technical descriptions.**\n    *   **Quote:** \"...preventing new decay in baby teeth or on the main surfaces of adult teeth...\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The term \"main surfaces\" is vague for a lay audience. Using a more descriptive term that relates to function is clearer.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"...preventing new decay in baby teeth or on the **chewing surfaces** of adult teeth...\"\n\n2.  **Simplify the explanation of study limitations.**\n    *   **Quote:** \"This knowledge could have influenced how they reported effects like pain or satisfaction.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is abstract and uses a nominalization (\"satisfaction\"). Explaining the concept of bias in more direct, everyday language makes it easier to understand.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Knowing which treatment they received could have **affected what they reported about things like pain or how happy they were with the results**.\"\n\n3.  **Use more direct and concise language.**\n    *   **Quote:** \"...a special type of filling (that can be applied without drilling)\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly wordy and indirect. It appears in both the 'Key messages' and 'What did we find?' sections.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"...**special fillings that can be applied without drilling**.\",",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 11 of 18 metrics (61%) falling into the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates significantly in four areas related to vocabulary and style: nominalization (P90), total nouns (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), and long words (P90). This suggests the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than a typical PLS, which supports the recommendation to simplify word choices and sentence structures."
