  "draft": "For a complex bulge in the main artery in the belly (abdominal aortic aneurysm), is a special type of keyhole surgery (fenestrated endovascular repair) a better treatment than traditional open surgery or no surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- We could not determine if a special type of keyhole surgery (fenestrated endovascular repair) is a better treatment than traditional open surgery or no surgery for a complex bulge in the main artery in the belly (abdominal aortic aneurysm). This is because we found no robust studies that directly compared these treatments.\n- High-quality research is needed to compare the benefits and harms of these different ways of treating complex bulges in the main artery in the belly to help guide treatment decisions.\n\nWhat is a complex abdominal aortic aneurysm?\nThe aorta is the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart down through the abdomen. An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulge or swelling in this blood vessel. If an aneurysm gets too big, it can burst, which is a life-threatening emergency. These aneurysms are considered 'complex' when the bulge is very close to the arteries that supply blood to the kidneys and other organs, making them more difficult to treat. The main treatments are traditional open surgery, which involves a large cut in the abdomen to repair the aorta, or a less invasive procedure called fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR). FEVAR uses a special tube (a stent-graft) with custom-made holes that allow blood to keep flowing to the kidney arteries after the repair.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what the best treatment is for people with complex AAAs. We aimed to compare the benefits and harms of FEVAR against open surgical repair or conservative management (monitoring the aneurysm without an operation).\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) with open surgery or no surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. We found no studies that met our requirements.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review authors found no studies that compared fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) with open surgical repair or conservative management for adults with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nEvidence currency statement\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft has a strong foundation, but it doesn't meet our style guidelines for subheadings and has some areas where clarity can be improved. The main issue is that several subheadings must be rephrased as questions. Here are the 3 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions:** Our style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions to help guide the reader. Three subheadings are currently formatted as statements.\n   - **Originals:** \"Methods\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Evidence currency statement\"\n   - **Problem:** These are simple labels, not engaging questions that set expectations for the content of the section.\n   - **Suggestion:** Please change them to:\n     - \"How did we conduct the review?\"\n     - \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n     - \"How up to date is this evidence?\"\n\n2. **Clarify the 'Limitations' section:** The current wording is confusing because there is no evidence to be confident or not confident about.\n   - **Original:** \"We are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"results of our outcomes\" is awkward when no studies were found. The key limitation is the complete absence of evidence, not uncertainty about results.\n   - **Suggestion:** Please rewrite for clarity: \"Because no studies were found, there is no evidence to answer our review question. We cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of FEVAR compared to other treatments.\"\n\n3. **Streamline the 'Methods' and 'Results' sections:** These two sections are very repetitive because the review found no studies. This can be streamlined to avoid saying the same thing twice.\n   - **Original 'Methods':** \"We searched for studies that compared fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) with open surgery or no surgery for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. We found no studies that met our requirements.\"\n   - **Problem:** This section describes the methods but also gives the main result, making the 'What did we find?' section feel redundant.\n   - **Suggestion:** Separate the action from the finding. Revise 'Methods' to describe only the search, and let the 'Results' section state the finding:\n     - **Revised 'Methods':** \"We searched for studies that compared FEVAR with open surgery or no surgery in adults with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.\"\n     - **Keep 'What did we find?':** \"The review authors found no studies that met our requirements.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has good conformity with typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median (P50) or best quartile (P75) ranges for Cochrane Plain Language Summaries. This indicates the text has a solid foundation in terms of sentence length, voice, and vocabulary complexity, with no significant statistical deviations."
