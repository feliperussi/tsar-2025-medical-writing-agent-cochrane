  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of different nerve blocks (injections to numb a specific area) for pain after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages\n\n- The available evidence suggests that the different types of nerve blocks (injections to numb a specific area) studied are likely similar in how well they reduce pain after breast cancer surgery. No harmful effects from the blocks were reported in the small number of studies that looked for them.\n- Larger studies are needed to provide more reliable evidence on the benefits and potential harms of these different nerve blocks.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHow is pain managed after breast cancer surgery?\nPain after surgery for breast cancer is a common and important concern for patients. One way to manage this pain is with 'regional analgesia'. This involves injecting numbing medicine near specific nerves in the chest area to block pain from the site of the surgery. These injections are often called 'nerve blocks'. There are several different types of nerve blocks that can be used, but they may also carry risks of unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how the different types of nerve blocks compared with each other for women having breast cancer surgery. We were interested in their benefits (how well they reduced pain) and their harms (any complications or unwanted side effects).\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared the benefits and harms of different types of nerve blocks for pain relief after breast cancer surgery. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 39 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 2348 women undergoing breast cancer surgery. The studies were conducted in several countries, including Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the USA, and Thailand. These trials compared various regional analgesia techniques: paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block, pectoral nerve block, and serratus anterior plane block. The abstract did not contain information about the funding sources for the individual studies.\n\nWe found that the different types of nerve blocks seem to be similar for managing pain after the operation.\n- Pain at rest: The different nerve blocks made little to no difference in pain levels during the first day after surgery.\n- Pain during movement: The pectoral nerve block may slightly reduce pain 2 hours after surgery compared to the paravertebral block, but other comparisons showed little to no difference.\n- Harmful effects: No complications were reported in the studies, so we do not know if there is a difference in risk between the blocks.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because many of the studies were very small and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes. Also, the studies used different ways of delivering the treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

I have three suggestions to further improve its precision and transparency for the reader before final approval.\n\n**1. Clarify the funding source for the review.**\n- **The sentence:** 'The abstract did not contain information about the funding sources for the individual studies.'\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is true, but it omits a key piece of information for transparency: that the review itself was unfunded. Readers may wonder if the review authors had a conflict of interest.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'This review did not receive any specific funding. We did not collect information about the funding sources for the individual studies.'\n\n**2. Add important context to the main finding on pain.**\n- **The sentence:** 'Pain at rest: The different nerve blocks made little to no difference in pain levels during the first day after surgery.'\n- **Why it's a problem:** This statement is a bit vague because it doesn't mention what the blocks were compared against. The original text specifies they were compared to the 'paravertebral block', which is the standard context for the finding.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'Pain at rest: Compared to the paravertebral block (a common type of nerve block), the other types made little to no difference in pain levels during the first day after surgery.'\n\n**3. Make the 'What did we do?' section more direct.**\n- **The sentence:** 'We searched for studies that compared the benefits and harms of different types of nerve blocks for pain relief after breast cancer surgery.'\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly wordy and repetitive ('benefits and harms... for pain relief'). It can be made more concise.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'We searched for studies that compared different types of nerve blocks for managing pain after breast cancer surgery.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is very well-written and highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An exceptional 94.4% of metrics, including readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9.5), sentence length (17.1 words), and active voice, fall within the best quartile for PLS texts. The draft has no major structural or vocabulary issues, indicating a strong foundation that only requires minor revisions for clarity and precision."
