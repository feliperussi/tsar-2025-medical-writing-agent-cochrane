  "key_messages": [
    "The available evidence suggests that the different types of nerve blocks (injections to numb a specific area) studied are likely similar in how well they reduce pain after breast cancer surgery. No harmful effects from the blocks were reported in the small number of studies that looked for them.",
    "Larger studies are needed to provide more reliable evidence on the benefits and potential harms of these different nerve blocks."

      "subheading": "How is pain managed after breast cancer surgery?",
      "content": "Pain after surgery for breast cancer is a common and important concern for patients. One way to manage this pain is with 'regional analgesia'. This involves injecting numbing medicine near specific nerves in the chest area to block pain from the site of the surgery. These injections are often called 'nerve blocks'. There are several different types of nerve blocks that can be used, but they may also carry risks of unwanted effects."

      "content": "We wanted to find out how the different types of nerve blocks compared with each other for women having breast cancer surgery. We were interested in their benefits (how well they reduced pain) and their harms (any complications or unwanted side effects)."

      "content": "The review included 39 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 2348 women undergoing breast cancer surgery. The studies were conducted in several countries, including Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the USA, and Thailand. These trials compared various regional analgesia techniques: paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB). The abstract did not contain information about the funding sources for the individual studies. For women undergoing breast cancer surgery, these different regional nerve blocks appear to be comparable in managing pain after the operation. When compared to the paravertebral block for reducing pain while at rest in the first day after surgery, the other nerve blocks make little to no difference. For pain during movement, the pectoral nerve block may slightly reduce pain two hours after surgery compared to the paravertebral block. However, for other comparisons of pain during movement, the different nerve blocks probably or may make little to no difference. We are very uncertain about some of these results. We do not know if these nerve blocks have an effect on the risk of complications because no such events were reported in the included studies."

  "limitations": "Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because many of the studies were very small and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes. Also, the studies used different ways of delivering the treatments.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search."
