  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of different nerve blocks (injections to numb a specific area) for pain after breast cancer surgery?\n\n**Key messages**\n\n- The available evidence suggests that the different types of nerve blocks (injections to numb a specific area) studied are likely similar in how well they reduce pain after breast cancer surgery. No harmful effects from the blocks were reported in the small number of studies that looked for them.\n- Larger studies are needed to provide more reliable evidence on the benefits and potential harms of these different nerve blocks.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nHow is pain managed after breast cancer surgery?\nPain after surgery for breast cancer is a common and important concern for patients. One way to manage this pain is with 'regional analgesia'. This involves injecting numbing medicine near specific nerves in the chest area to block pain from the site of the surgery. These injections are often called 'nerve blocks'. There are several different types of nerve blocks that can be used, but they may also carry risks of unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how the different types of nerve blocks compared with each other for women having breast cancer surgery. We were interested in their benefits (how well they reduced pain) and their harms (any complications or unwanted side effects).\n\n**Methods**\n\nWe searched for studies that compared the benefits and harms of different types of nerve blocks for pain relief after breast cancer surgery. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe review included 39 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 2348 women undergoing breast cancer surgery. The studies were conducted in several countries, including Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the USA, and Thailand. These trials compared various regional analgesia techniques: paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB). The abstract did not contain information about the funding sources for the individual studies. For women undergoing breast cancer surgery, these different regional nerve blocks appear to be comparable in managing pain after the operation. When compared to the paravertebral block for reducing pain while at rest in the first day after surgery, the other nerve blocks make little to no difference. For pain during movement, the pectoral nerve block may slightly reduce pain two hours after surgery compared to the paravertebral block. However, for other comparisons of pain during movement, the different nerve blocks probably or may make little to no difference. We are very uncertain about some of these results. We do not know if these nerve blocks have an effect on the risk of complications because no such events were reported in the included studies.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because many of the studies were very small and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes. Also, the studies used different ways of delivering the treatments.\n\n**Currency of the evidence**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and meets the word count. However, it is not approved because several subheadings do not follow the mandatory question format, and the 'Results' section is a dense paragraph that is difficult for a lay reader to follow. Revising these key structural elements will significantly improve clarity.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rewrite subheadings as questions.** Several subheadings are single words, which violates the style guide and makes the summary harder for readers to scan. \n    -   **Problem:** \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\"\n    -   **Suggestion:** Change these to questions, such as \"What did we do?\", \"What did we find?\", \"How reliable is the evidence?\", and \"How up to date is this evidence?\"\n\n2.  **Restructure the main findings for clarity.** The 'Results' section presents all findings in one long, dense paragraph, making it difficult to distinguish the key takeaways.\n    -   **Problem:** \"For women undergoing breast cancer surgery, these different regional nerve blocks appear to be comparable... We do not know if these nerve blocks have an effect on the risk of complications because no such events were reported in the included studies.\"\n    -   **Suggestion:** Break this paragraph into a main summary sentence followed by a bulleted list to separate the key findings. For example:\n        \"We found that the different types of nerve blocks seem to be similar for managing pain after the operation.\n        - **Pain at rest:** The different nerve blocks made little to no difference in pain levels during the first day after surgery.\n        - **Pain during movement:** The pectoral nerve block may slightly reduce pain two hours after surgery compared to the paravertebral block, but other comparisons showed little to no difference.\n        - **Harmful effects:** No complications were reported in the studies, so we don't know if there is a difference in risk between the blocks.\"\n\n3.  **Remove unnecessary technical abbreviations.** The draft introduces abbreviations for the four nerve block types but never uses them again, creating unnecessary clutter for the reader.\n    -   **Problem:** \"...paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB).\"\n    -   **Suggestion:** Remove the abbreviations as they are not used. Simply list the full names of the techniques.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 17 of 18 metrics falling within the best quartile for readability. Sentence length and word complexity are excellent. The one notable deviation is the high noun count (168, in the 90th percentile range), which supports the editorial recommendation to restructure the dense 'Results' paragraph. Replacing noun-heavy phrases with more direct verb constructions, as suggested in the feedback, would improve flow and bring this metric closer to the typical range."
