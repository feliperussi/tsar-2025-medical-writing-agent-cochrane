  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of different nerve blocks (injections to numb a specific area) for pain after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages\n\n- The available evidence suggests that the different types of nerve blocks (injections to numb a specific area) studied are likely similar in how well they reduce pain after breast cancer surgery. No harmful effects from the blocks were reported in the small number of studies that looked for them.\n- Larger studies are needed to provide more reliable evidence on the benefits and potential harms of these different nerve blocks.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHow is pain managed after breast cancer surgery?\nPain after surgery for breast cancer is a common and important concern for patients. One way to manage this pain is with 'regional analgesia'. This involves injecting numbing medicine near specific nerves in the chest area to block pain from the site of the surgery. These injections are often called 'nerve blocks'. There are several different types of nerve blocks that can be used, but they may also carry risks of unwanted effects.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how the different types of nerve blocks compared with each other for women having breast cancer surgery. We were interested in their benefits (how well they reduced pain) and their harms (any complications or unwanted side effects).\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared different types of nerve blocks for managing pain after breast cancer surgery. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 39 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 2348 women undergoing breast cancer surgery. The studies were conducted in several countries, including Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the USA, and Thailand. These trials compared various regional analgesia techniques: paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block, pectoral nerve block, and serratus anterior plane block. This review did not receive any specific funding. We did not collect information about the funding sources for the individual studies.\n\nWe found that the different types of nerve blocks seem to be similar for managing pain after the operation.\n- Pain at rest: Compared to the paravertebral block (a common type of nerve block), the other types made little to no difference in pain levels during the first day after surgery.\n- Pain during movement: The pectoral nerve block may slightly reduce pain 2 hours after surgery compared to the paravertebral block, but other comparisons showed little to no difference.\n- Harmful effects: No complications were reported in the studies, so we do not know if there is a difference in risk between the blocks.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because many of the studies were very small and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes. Also, the studies used different ways of delivering the treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

However, it is not approved because several key sentences can be made clearer and more direct for a lay audience. The main areas for improvement are reducing wordiness in the key messages, converting passive voice to active voice for greater impact, and clarifying vague language in the limitations section. These minor revisions will significantly improve readability for patients.",

Readability scores are excellent (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 9.78). However, some metrics like passive voice (14 instances, P75) are in the upper-middle range of what is typical, supporting the editorial recommendation to revise for more direct, active language."
