  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of the combined birth control pill for treating painful periods (primary dysmenorrhoea)?\n\nKey messages\n- For women with painful periods, the combined birth control pill (a pill containing hormones to prevent pregnancy) reduces pain more than a placebo (a dummy pill). However, it may cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea.\n- Taking the pill continuously (without the usual week-long break each month) may be better at reducing pain than taking it in the standard way.\n- Because the studies were short, the long-term effects of using the pill for painful periods are not known. It is also unclear if the pill is more effective than other common pain medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, like ibuprofen), due to a lack of studies directly comparing them.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and what did this review study?\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea?\nMany women experience painful menstrual cramps, a condition known as dysmenorrhoea. It is a common and major cause of pain. When these painful cramps are not caused by another underlying medical condition in the pelvis, it is called 'primary dysmenorrhoea'. Combined oral contraceptive pills (often called 'the pill') are a common treatment for this pain.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using combined oral contraceptive pills to manage primary dysmenorrhoea.\n\nHow was the review conducted?\nWe searched for studies that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with a placebo (a dummy pill), other contraceptive pills, or anti-inflammatory drugs for treating painful periods. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 21 studies called randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 3723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. In these studies, people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups. The studies compared combined oral contraceptive pills (the pill) with a placebo, with different types or schedules of the pill, or with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nMain results: oral contraceptives for painful menstrual cramps\nFor women with painful menstrual cramps, the pill reduces pain more effectively than a placebo (a dummy pill). However, the pill comes with unwanted effects. It causes a large increase in the risk of irregular bleeding. For example, if 18 out of 100 women experience irregular bleeding with a placebo, between 39 and 60 out of 100 would experience it if they used the pill. The pill also probably increases the risk of headaches and nausea. We are uncertain if it has an effect on weight gain.\nWhen comparing different ways of taking the pill, continuous use (without a pill-free break) may reduce pain more effectively than the standard schedule. There is probably little to no difference in pain relief between lower and higher dose pills, or between newer and older generation pills.\nDue to a lack of studies, we are uncertain if the pill is more or less effective than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating menstrual pain.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for all health effects. The evidence also does not cover all of the effects we were interested in, such as the long-term effects of the treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it requires a few revisions to meet our style guidelines and improve clarity for the reader. The main issue is that one subheading does not follow the required question format. I've also identified a few sentences that could be simplified by using more common words and a more direct, active voice. Addressing these points will make the summary even easier for a lay audience to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase Subheading to be a Question:** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. One of your subheadings is a statement.\n    *   **Text to change:** \"Main results: oral contraceptives for painful menstrual cramps\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"What did the studies find about using the pill for painful menstrual cramps?\"\n\n2.  **Simplify Complex or Formal Phrasing:** Some sentences use formal language and contain complex words that could be simpler. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the number of complex and long words was higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary.\n    *   **Text to change:** \"When these painful cramps are not caused by another underlying medical condition in the pelvis, it is called 'primary dysmenorrhoea'.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"This is called 'primary dysmenorrhoea' when the pain is not caused by another medical problem in the pelvis.\"\n\n3.  **Use Active Voice for Clearer Explanations:** The description of the study methods uses passive voice, which can be less clear and direct for readers.\n    *   **Text to change:** \"In these studies, people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"In these studies, researchers randomly put people into one of two or more treatment groups to compare them.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of its features falling within the best quartile. Readability scores like the Flesch-Kincaid Grade (9.68 and 9.68) are excellent. However, the analysis identified three features in the P90 range, deviating from typical patterns: the number of nouns (158), Dale-Chall complex words (241), and long words (165). This suggests the vocabulary is slightly more complex and noun-heavy than is ideal, supporting the editorial recommendation to simplify some phrasing."
