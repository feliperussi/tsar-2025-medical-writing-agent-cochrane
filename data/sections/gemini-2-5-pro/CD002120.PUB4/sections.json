  "key_messages": [
    "For women with painful periods, the combined birth control pill (a pill containing hormones to prevent pregnancy) reduces pain more than a placebo (a dummy pill). However, it may cause unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea.",
    "Taking the pill continuously (without the usual week-long break each month) may be better at reducing pain than taking it in the standard way.",
    "Because the studies were short, the long-term effects of using the pill for painful periods are not known. It is also unclear if the pill is more effective than other common pain medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, like ibuprofen), due to a lack of studies directly comparing them."

      "content": "Many women experience painful menstrual cramps, a condition known as dysmenorrhoea. It is a common and major cause of pain. When these painful cramps are not caused by another underlying medical condition in the pelvis, it is called 'primary dysmenorrhoea'. Combined oral contraceptive pills (often called 'the pill') are a common treatment for this pain."

      "content": "This review included 21 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 3723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies compared combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) with a placebo, with different types or regimens of OCPs, or with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: oral contraceptives for painful menstrual cramps",
      "content": "For women with painful menstrual cramps, combined oral contraceptives (OCPs) reduce pain more effectively than a placebo (a dummy pill). However, OCPs come with unwanted effects. They cause a large increase in the risk of irregular bleeding. For example, if 18 out of 100 women experience irregular bleeding with a placebo, between 39 and 60 out of 100 would experience it if they used OCPs. OCPs also probably increase the risk of headaches and nausea. We are uncertain if they have an effect on weight gain.\n\nWhen comparing different ways of taking OCPs, continuous use (without a pill-free break) may reduce pain more effectively than the standard schedule. There is probably little to no difference in pain relief between lower and higher dose pills, or between newer and older generation pills.\n\nDue to a lack of studies, we are uncertain if OCPs are more or less effective than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating menstrual pain."
