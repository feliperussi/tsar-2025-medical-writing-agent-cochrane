  "key_messages": [
    "Programs aimed at individual healthcare workers may help reduce their work-related stress for up to a year. This applies to programs that help workers focus on their experience of stress (for example, by changing their thoughts and feelings) and those that help them focus away from stress (for example, through relaxation or exercise). The studies did not provide information about any unwanted or harmful effects of these programs.",
    "However, the evidence is not strong, and the long-term effects of these programs (beyond one year) are unknown. Larger, better-designed studies are needed to be more certain about the benefits and to understand how best to support the well-being of healthcare workers."

      "subheading": "Why is work-related stress a problem for healthcare workers?",
      "content": "Healthcare workers can experience work-related stress when there is an imbalance between the demands of their job, their skills, and the support they receive at work. This can lead to burnout (emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion), other health problems, and may affect the quality of care they provide to patients."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out how effective different interventions are at reducing stress symptoms in individual healthcare workers. We compared these interventions to receiving no intervention, being on a wait list for an intervention, or receiving a different type of stress-reduction intervention."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly put into different treatment groups) that tested stress-reduction interventions for individual healthcare workers. We grouped the interventions by type, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review included 117 studies with 11,119 healthcare workers, evaluating different types of stress-reduction interventions for individuals. We found that stress-management techniques that focus on the individual, such as those that help people focus on their experience of stress or away from it, may reduce stress for up to a year. A combination of interventions may also reduce stress in the short term. However, we do not know if interventions that focus on changing work-related factors have an effect on stress. The long-term effects of any of these interventions are unknown, and it is unclear if one type of intervention is better than another."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022."
