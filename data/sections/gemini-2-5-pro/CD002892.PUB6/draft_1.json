  "draft": "Can programs aimed at individual healthcare workers reduce work-related stress?\n\nKey messages\n- Programs aimed at individual healthcare workers may help reduce their work-related stress for up to a year. This applies to programs that help workers focus on their experience of stress (for example, by changing their thoughts and feelings) and those that help them focus away from stress (for example, through relaxation or exercise). The studies did not provide information about any unwanted or harmful effects of these programs.\n- However, the evidence is not strong, and the long-term effects of these programs (beyond one year) are unknown. Larger, better-designed studies are needed to be more certain about the benefits and to understand how best to support the well-being of healthcare workers.\n\nWhy is work-related stress a problem for healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers can experience work-related stress when there is an imbalance between the demands of their job, their skills, and the support they receive at work. This can lead to burnout (emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion), other health problems, and may affect the quality of care they provide to patients.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective different interventions are at reducing stress symptoms in individual healthcare workers. We compared these interventions to receiving no intervention, being on a wait list for an intervention, or receiving a different type of stress-reduction intervention.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly put into different treatment groups) that tested stress-reduction interventions for individual healthcare workers. We grouped the interventions by type, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 117 studies with 11,119 healthcare workers, evaluating different types of stress-reduction interventions for individuals. We found that stress-management techniques that focus on the individual, such as those that help people focus on their experience of stress or away from it, may reduce stress for up to a year. A combination of interventions may also reduce stress in the short term. However, we do not know if interventions that focus on changing work-related factors have an effect on stress. The long-term effects of any of these interventions are unknown, and it is unclear if one type of intervention is better than another.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, factually accurate draft. However, it requires a few revisions to improve clarity and fully align with Cochrane style guidelines before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n**1. Rephrase All Subheadings as Questions**\nTo better guide the reader, all subheadings should be phrased as questions. Three subheadings are currently statements.\n- **Instead of:** \"Methods\"\n- **Consider:** \"How did we conduct the review?\"\n- **Instead of:** \"Limitations of the evidence\"\n- **Consider:** \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n- **Instead of:** \"Currency of the evidence\"\n- **Consider:** \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n**2. Use Direct Verbs Instead of Noun-Heavy Phrases**\nThe text often uses nouns to describe actions (a style called 'nominalization'), which can make sentences more abstract and wordy. Using direct verbs makes the writing clearer and is more engaging.\n- **For example:** \"We wanted to find out how effective different interventions are at reducing stress symptoms in individual healthcare workers.\"\n- **Problem:** The phrase \"reducing stress symptoms\" is a noun-based construction.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how well different programs reduce stress in individual healthcare workers.\"\n\n**3. Shorten Sentences and Remove Redundant Words**\nSome sentences are longer than necessary and contain repeated information, which can make them harder for readers to follow.\n- **For example:** \"We found that stress-management techniques that focus on the individual, such as those that help people focus on their experience of stress or away from it, may reduce stress for up to a year.\"\n- **Problem:** This sentence is 33 words long. The phrase \"that focus on the individual\" is also redundant, as the entire review is about individual-level programs.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found that techniques helping people focus on their experience of stress, or away from it, may reduce stress for up to a year.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 50% of the metrics falling in the best quartile and excellent readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade of 10.68). The primary deviation from typical patterns is in 'nominalization' (the use of noun-form verbs), which is in the 90th percentile. This confirms that focusing on using more direct verbs instead of noun phrases would be the most impactful edit."
