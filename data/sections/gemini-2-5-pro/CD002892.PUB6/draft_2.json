  "draft": "Can programs aimed at individual healthcare workers reduce work-related stress?\n\nKey messages\n- Programs for individual healthcare workers may reduce work-related stress for up to a year. This includes programs that help workers focus on their experience of stress (like changing their thoughts) and those that help them focus away from stress (like relaxation or exercise). The studies did not provide information about any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- However, the evidence is not strong, and we do not know the long-term effects (beyond 1 year). We need larger, better-designed studies to be more certain about the benefits and to understand how best to support healthcare workers.\n\nWhy is work-related stress a problem for healthcare workers?\nHealthcare workers can experience work-related stress when there is an imbalance between the demands of their job, their skills, and the support they receive at work. This can lead to burnout (emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion), other health problems, and may affect the quality of care they provide to patients.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different programs reduce stress for individual healthcare workers. We compared these programs to no program, being on a waitlist, or a different type of stress-reduction program.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that tested programs to reduce stress for individual healthcare workers. We grouped the programs by type, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 117 studies with 11,119 healthcare workers, which tested different types of programs to reduce stress. We found that techniques helping people focus on their experience of stress, or away from it, may reduce stress for up to a year. A combination of programs may also reduce stress in the short term. However, we do not know if programs that change work-related factors affect stress. The long-term effects of any of these programs are unknown, and it is unclear if one type is better than another.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the studies were very small.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

I have three suggestions to make it even better for a lay audience.\n\n1. **Add examples to the results to explain the types of programs.** The 'What did we find?' section mentions programs that 'focus on their experience of stress, or away from it', which can be abstract for readers. Including the concrete examples used in the Key Messages would significantly improve understanding.\n    *   **Original text:** 'We found that techniques helping people focus on their experience of stress, or away from it, may reduce stress for up to a year.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We found that programs may reduce stress for up to a year. This was true for programs that help people focus on their experience of stress (for example, by changing their thoughts) and for programs that help them focus away from it (such as relaxation or exercise).'\n\n2. **Break up the long paragraph in the results section.** The main findings are currently in a single, dense paragraph. Breaking this into shorter paragraphs, each focused on a single idea, will make the results easier to digest, in line with the style guide's advice to keep paragraphs short.\n    *   **Original text:** 'This review included 117 studies with 11,119 healthcare workers, which tested different types of programs to reduce stress. We found that techniques helping people focus on their experience of stress, or away from it, may reduce stress for up to a year. A combination of programs may also reduce stress in the short term.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. An impressive 89% of the metrics (16 out of 18) fall within the best quartile for readability and clarity (e.g., P25 for lower-is-better metrics like sentence length, P75 for higher-is-better metrics like active voice). The remaining metrics are in the median range. There are no metrics showing significant deviation, indicating a very strong linguistic foundation that will be further enhanced by the suggested qualitative improvements."
