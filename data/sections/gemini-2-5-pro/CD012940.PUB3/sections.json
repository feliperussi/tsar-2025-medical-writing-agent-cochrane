  "key_messages": [
    "For premature babies, it is uncertain whether putting undigested milk that is left in the stomach (gastric residuals) back in is better or worse than throwing it away. The limited available evidence suggests that putting the milk back in may have little to no effect on important health results, such as the time it takes to regain birth weight or the risk of developing a serious gut problem (necrotising enterocolitis).",
    "Larger, well-designed studies are needed to provide a clear answer on whether it is better to put back or throw away undigested milk for premature babies."

      "subheading": "What is the issue with feeding preterm infants?",
      "content": "Preterm babies (babies born early) are often too small or weak to feed from the breast or a bottle, so they are fed through a tube that goes into their stomach. Before giving a new feed, nurses often check to see how much milk is left in the stomach from the last feed. This leftover milk is called a 'gastric residual'. Health professionals are unsure what to do with this residual. Some believe it should be returned to the baby's stomach ('re-feeding') because it contains partially digested milk and other substances that can help with digestion. Others are concerned that re-feeding might cause problems like vomiting or lead to serious conditions such as necrotising enterocolitis (a dangerous gut disease) or sepsis (a serious blood infection)."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review is based on one trial that included 72 preterm infants. The study compared the effects of re-feeding gastric residuals versus discarding them. Based on this one small study, re-feeding stomach tube aspirates (gastric residuals) to preterm infants may make little to no difference to several important health outcomes. These include the time it takes for infants to regain their birth weight, the risk of developing a serious gut problem (necrotising enterocolitis), the risk of death before leaving the hospital, the time it takes to get infants fully on milk feeds, the number of days infants need intravenous feeding, and the risk of poor growth. We do not know if re-feeding has an effect on how often feeds are interrupted."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. The one available study was very small, and it is possible that people in the study were aware of which treatment they were getting.",
