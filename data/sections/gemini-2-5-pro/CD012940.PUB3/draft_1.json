  "draft": "For premature babies, should undigested milk left in the stomach (gastric residuals) be put back in or thrown away?\n\nKey messages\n\nFor premature babies, it is uncertain whether putting undigested milk that is left in the stomach (gastric residuals) back in is better or worse than throwing it away. The limited available evidence suggests that putting the milk back in may have little to no effect on important health results, such as the time it takes to regain birth weight or the risk of developing a serious gut problem (necrotising enterocolitis).\n\nLarger, well-designed studies are needed to provide a clear answer on whether it is better to put back or throw away undigested milk for premature babies.\n\nWhat is the issue with feeding preterm infants?\n\nPreterm babies (babies born early) are often too small or weak to feed from the breast or a bottle, so they are fed through a tube that goes into their stomach. Before giving a new feed, nurses often check to see how much milk is left in the stomach from the last feed. This leftover milk is called a 'gastric residual'. Health professionals are unsure what to do with this residual. Some believe it should be returned to the baby's stomach ('re-feeding') because it contains partially digested milk and other substances that can help with digestion. Others are concerned that re-feeding might cause problems like vomiting or lead to serious conditions such as necrotising enterocolitis (a dangerous gut disease) or sepsis (a serious blood infection).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to compare the effects of re-feeding gastric residuals with throwing them away to find out which approach is safer and more effective for preterm infants.\n\nMethods\n\nWe searched for studies that compared re-feeding gastric residuals with discarding them in preterm infants. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThis review is based on one trial that included 72 preterm infants. The study compared the effects of re-feeding gastric residuals versus discarding them. Based on this one small study, re-feeding stomach tube aspirates (gastric residuals) to preterm infants may make little to no difference to several important health outcomes. These include the time it takes for infants to regain their birth weight, the risk of developing a serious gut problem (necrotising enterocolitis), the risk of death before leaving the hospital, the time it takes to get infants fully on milk feeds, the number of days infants need intravenous feeding, and the risk of poor growth. We do not know if re-feeding has an effect on how often feeds are interrupted.\n\nLimitations\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. The one available study was very small, and it is possible that people in the study were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",

For example: 'How did we conduct the review?', 'What are the limitations of the evidence?', and 'How up-to-date is this evidence?'\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Use Consistent Terminology:** The results section introduces a new technical term ('stomach tube aspirates') after the main term ('gastric residuals') has already been well-established. This could confuse readers.\n    *   **Quote:** '...re-feeding stomach tube aspirates (gastric residuals) to preterm infants...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Stick to the term you've already defined. Please change this to: '...re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants...'\n\n2.  **Improve Phrasing for Clarity:** The final sentence in the 'Currency' section is grammatically awkward and unclear.\n    *   **Quote:** 'The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase this for better flow. For example: 'This review includes evidence published up to February 2022.'\n\n3.  **Use Active Voice More Often:** The summary uses passive voice more than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which can make sentences less direct. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing passive voice use is in the 90th percentile for this type of document.\n    *   **Quote:** '...it is possible that people in the study were aware of which treatment they were getting.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** A more active and direct phrasing would be: '...it is possible that the researchers and parents knew which treatment the babies received.'",

However, the analysis flags one significant deviation: the use of passive voice is in the 90th percentile, suggesting a need for revision to improve directness and clarity."
