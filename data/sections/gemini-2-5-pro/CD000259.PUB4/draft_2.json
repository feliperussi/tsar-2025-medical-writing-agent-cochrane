  "draft": "Does reviewing the work of healthcare professionals and giving them feedback (audit and feedback) improve the care they provide to patients?\n\nKey messages\n\nThe evidence suggests that reviewing the work of healthcare professionals and giving them feedback (a process called audit and feedback) can lead to small but potentially important improvements in the care they provide. The review did not find any studies that reported on unwanted effects of this approach.\n\nAudit and feedback may be more effective when it targets areas where professionals have lots of room to improve, is given to individuals rather than teams, compares performance to top performers, and includes a specific plan for improvement.\n\nMore research is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the most effective ways to design audit and feedback to improve healthcare.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is audit and feedback?\nHealthcare professionals, like doctors and nurses, aim to provide the best possible care. 'Audit and feedback' is a widely used strategy to help them improve. It involves two steps. First, an 'audit' measures a professional's performance over a period of time. For example, it might track how often a doctor prescribes a certain medicine or orders a specific test. Then, 'feedback' is given, where the results of the audit are shared with the professional. The idea is that when professionals see data about their own practice, it encourages them to make positive changes. However, it is uncertain how well audit and feedback works and what makes it most effective.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective audit and feedback is for improving the practice of healthcare professionals. We also wanted to identify which features of audit and feedback might make it work better.\n\nHow did we do the review?\n\nWe searched for studies that tested if giving healthcare professionals feedback on their performance ('audit and feedback') improved the care they provided. We combined the results to see how well it worked and what factors made it more effective, and then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review find?\n\nWe found 292 studies. 26 of these studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries. The recipients of the audit and feedback interventions were most commonly physicians. The studies looked at how audit and feedback, sometimes with other support like education or reminders, could improve professional practices like prescribing medicines and ordering tests. The review did not provide information on the total number of participants, how long the studies lasted, or their funding sources.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nAudit and feedback probably leads to a small improvement in the practice of healthcare professionals. The size of this improvement can vary. This means that, on average, audit and feedback helped professionals follow recommended practices about 6% more often.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\n\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence is not higher because in some studies, professionals knew they were being observed, which might have changed their behaviour. Also, the studies used many different feedback methods, which made the results less consistent.\n\nHow up-to-date is this review?\n\nThe evidence in this review is current to 14 February 2022.",

Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Clarify the main result using frequencies, not percentages.**\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"This means that, on average, audit and feedback helped professionals follow recommended practices about 6% more often.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** An abstract percentage is harder for a lay audience to interpret than a concrete frequency. The source material provides a clearer 'X in 100' format that is more impactful and easier to visualize.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This means that for every 100 opportunities for a healthcare professional to follow a recommended practice, using audit and feedback probably results in about 6 more instances of the practice being followed.\"\n\n2. **Rephrase the statement about missing information to avoid confusion.**\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The review did not provide information on the total number of participants, how long the studies lasted, or their funding sources.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is ambiguous and could be misinterpreted as a flaw in the Cochrane review itself, rather than a limitation of the original studies that were included. This could undermine the reader's trust in your work.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The original studies included in this review did not always report on the total number of participants, how long they lasted, or their funding sources.\"\n\n3. **Ensure all subheadings are phrased as questions.**\n   - **Problematic subheading:** \"What were the main results?\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This subheading is not phrased as a question, which is inconsistent with the other subheadings and the style guide's recommendation.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"What did the main results show?\" or \"What effect did audit and feedback have?\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis indicates the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the ideal or median ranges for readability and style. For example, the average sentence length (16.35 words) and reading grade level (9.42) are excellent, indicating the text is generally easy to read. The feedback focuses on improving the framing of key results and clarifying potentially misleading statements, rather than addressing underlying linguistic issues."
