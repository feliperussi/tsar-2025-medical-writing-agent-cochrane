  "draft": "Does reviewing the work of healthcare professionals and giving them feedback (audit and feedback) improve the care they provide to patients?\n\nKey messages\n\nThe evidence suggests that reviewing the work of healthcare professionals and giving them feedback (a process called audit and feedback) can lead to small but potentially important improvements in the care they provide. The review did not find any studies that reported on unwanted effects of this approach.\n\nAudit and feedback may be more effective when it targets areas where professionals have lots of room to improve, is given to individuals rather than teams, compares performance to top performers, and includes a specific plan for improvement.\n\nMore research is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the most effective ways to design audit and feedback to improve healthcare.\n\nWhat is audit and feedback?\n\nHealthcare professionals, like doctors and nurses, aim to provide the best possible care. 'Audit and feedback' is a widely used strategy to help them improve. It involves two steps. First, an 'audit' measures a professional's performance over a period of time. For example, it might track how often a doctor prescribes a certain medicine or orders a specific test. Then, 'feedback' is given, where the results of the audit are shared with the professional. The idea is that when professionals see data about their own practice, it encourages them to make positive changes. However, it is uncertain how well audit and feedback works and what makes it most effective.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective audit and feedback is for improving the practice of healthcare professionals. We also wanted to identify which features of audit and feedback might make it work better.\n\nHow did we do the review?\n\nWe searched for studies that tested if giving healthcare professionals feedback on their performance ('audit and feedback') improved the care they provided. We combined the results to see how well it worked and what factors made it more effective, and then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 292 studies. 26 of these studies were done in low- or middle-income countries. In most studies, the feedback was given to doctors. The studies looked at how audit and feedback, sometimes with other support like education or reminders, could improve the way healthcare professionals work, such as when they prescribe medicines or order tests.\n\nWhat did the main results show?\n\nAudit and feedback probably leads to a small improvement in the care that healthcare professionals provide. The size of this improvement can vary. This means that for every 100 times a healthcare professional should follow a recommendation, using audit and feedback probably results in them following it about 6 more times.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\n\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence is not higher because in some studies, professionals knew they were being observed, which might have changed their behaviour. Also, the studies used many different feedback methods, which made the results less consistent.\n\nHow up-to-date is this review?\n\nThe evidence in this review is current to October 2025.",

The original abstract indicates the search was last updated in February 2022. This must be corrected to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Correct the currency date.**\n    *   **Problem:** The sentence 'The evidence in this review is current to October 2025' is factually incorrect and misleads the reader.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change this to 'The evidence in this review is current to February 2022.'\n\n2.  **Make the main result easier to understand.**\n    *   **Problem:** The sentence 'This means that for every 100 times a healthcare professional should follow a recommendation, using audit and feedback probably results in them following it about 6 more times' is a bit abstract.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Consider this slightly clearer wording: 'This means that for every 100 opportunities to follow a recommended practice, audit and feedback probably leads to it being followed about 6 more times.'\n\n3.  **Use more direct, active phrasing in the results.**\n    *   **Problem:** The sentence 'The studies looked at how audit and feedback...could improve the way healthcare professionals work' is slightly indirect.\n    *   **Suggestion:** For a more direct and engaging tone, try: 'The studies tested if audit and feedback...improved professional practices like prescribing medicines or ordering tests.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median (P50) or best quartile (P25/P75) ranges of the corpus. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (8.98) and Words Per Sentence (15.94) are excellent, indicating the text is clear and easy to read. The high conformity suggests the writing style is appropriate, but it does not guarantee factual accuracy, which must be addressed."
