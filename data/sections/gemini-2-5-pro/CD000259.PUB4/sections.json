  "plain_title": "Does reviewing the work of healthcare professionals and giving them feedback (audit and feedback) improve the care they provide to patients?",
  "key_messages": [
    "The evidence suggests that reviewing the work of healthcare professionals and giving them feedback (a process called audit and feedback) can lead to small but potentially important improvements in the care they provide. The review did not find any studies that reported on unwanted effects of this approach.",
    "Audit and feedback may be more effective when it targets areas where professionals have lots of room to improve, is given to individuals rather than teams, compares performance to top performers, and includes a specific plan for improvement.",
    "More research is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the most effective ways to design audit and feedback to improve healthcare."

      "subheading": "What is audit and feedback?",
      "content": "Healthcare professionals, like doctors and nurses, aim to provide the best possible care. 'Audit and feedback' is a widely used strategy to help them improve. It involves two steps. First, an 'audit' measures a professional's performance over a period of time. For example, it might track how often a doctor prescribes a certain medicine or orders a specific test. Then, 'feedback' is given, where the results of the audit are shared with the professional. The idea is that when professionals see data about their own practice, it encourages them to make positive changes. However, it is uncertain how well audit and feedback works and what makes it most effective."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out how effective audit and feedback is for improving the practice of healthcare professionals. We also wanted to identify which features of audit and feedback might make it work better."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that tested if giving healthcare professionals feedback on their performance ('audit and feedback') improved the care they provided. We combined the results to see how well it worked and what factors made it more effective, and then rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 292 studies. Twenty-six of these studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries. The recipients of the audit and feedback interventions were most commonly physicians. The studies looked at how audit and feedback, sometimes with other support like education or reminders, could improve professional practices like prescribing medicines and ordering tests. The review did not provide information on the total number of participants, how long the studies lasted, or their funding sources."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: the effect of audit and feedback on the practice of healthcare professionals",
      "content": "Audit and feedback probably leads to a small improvement in the practice of healthcare professionals. The size of this improvement can vary. On average, for every 100 opportunities for a healthcare professional to follow a recommended practice, using audit and feedback probably results in about six additional instances of the practice being followed."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because of concerns that in some studies people may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "All evidence cited is current and accurate as of October 2025."
