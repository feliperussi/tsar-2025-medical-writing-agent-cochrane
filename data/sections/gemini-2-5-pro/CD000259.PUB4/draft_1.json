  "draft": "Does reviewing the work of healthcare professionals and giving them feedback (audit and feedback) improve the care they provide to patients?\n\nKey messages\n\nThe evidence suggests that reviewing the work of healthcare professionals and giving them feedback (a process called audit and feedback) can lead to small but potentially important improvements in the care they provide. The review did not find any studies that reported on unwanted effects of this approach.\n\nAudit and feedback may be more effective when it targets areas where professionals have lots of room to improve, is given to individuals rather than teams, compares performance to top performers, and includes a specific plan for improvement.\n\nMore research is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the most effective ways to design audit and feedback to improve healthcare.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is audit and feedback?\nHealthcare professionals, like doctors and nurses, aim to provide the best possible care. 'Audit and feedback' is a widely used strategy to help them improve. It involves two steps. First, an 'audit' measures a professional's performance over a period of time. For example, it might track how often a doctor prescribes a certain medicine or orders a specific test. Then, 'feedback' is given, where the results of the audit are shared with the professional. The idea is that when professionals see data about their own practice, it encourages them to make positive changes. However, it is uncertain how well audit and feedback works and what makes it most effective.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective audit and feedback is for improving the practice of healthcare professionals. We also wanted to identify which features of audit and feedback might make it work better.\n\nHow we did the review\n\nWe searched for studies that tested if giving healthcare professionals feedback on their performance ('audit and feedback') improved the care they provided. We combined the results to see how well it worked and what factors made it more effective, and then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat the review found\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 292 studies. Twenty-six of these studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries. The recipients of the audit and feedback interventions were most commonly physicians. The studies looked at how audit and feedback, sometimes with other support like education or reminders, could improve professional practices like prescribing medicines and ordering tests. The review did not provide information on the total number of participants, how long the studies lasted, or their funding sources.\n\nMain results: the effect of audit and feedback on the practice of healthcare professionals\nAudit and feedback probably leads to a small improvement in the practice of healthcare professionals. The size of this improvement can vary. On average, for every 100 opportunities for a healthcare professional to follow a recommended practice, using audit and feedback probably results in about six additional instances of the practice being followed.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\n\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because of concerns that in some studies people may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nHow up-to-date is this review?\n\nAll evidence cited is current and accurate as of October 2025.",

The draft states the evidence is current to 'October 2025', but the abstract's final search date is 'February 14, 2022'. Please correct this to reflect the actual search date.\n2. **Incorrect Subheading Format:** Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is required by the style guide. For example, 'How we did the review' and 'What the review found' must be rephrased.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed to improve clarity for readers:\n\n1. **Rewrite subheadings as questions.** This makes the summary easier to navigate.\n    *   **Instead of:** 'How we did the review' and 'What the review found'\n    *   **Please use:** 'How did we do the review?' and 'What did the review find?'\n    *   **Also, simplify this long subheading:** 'Main results: the effect of audit and feedback on the practice of healthcare professionals'\n    *   **To something like:** 'What were the main results?'\n\n2. **Simplify the explanation of the main result.** The current phrasing is long and abstract.\n    *   **Current sentence:** 'On average, for every 100 opportunities for a healthcare professional to follow a recommended practice, using audit and feedback probably results in about six additional instances of the practice being followed.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'This means that audit and feedback helped professionals follow recommended practices about 6% more often.'\n\n3. **Clarify the limitations using simpler language.** The explanation for the evidence certainty contains jargon.\n    *   **Current sentence:** '...because of concerns that in some studies people may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Our confidence is not higher because in some studies, professionals knew they were being observed, which might have changed their behaviour. Also, the studies used many different feedback methods, which made the results less consistent.'\n\nThe linguistic analysis supports the need for simpler vocabulary. The draft has a high number of long words (171) and words that may be unfamiliar to lay readers (217), placing it in the 90th percentile for these metrics. Adopting the suggested changes will help address this.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 78% of its features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis identified two areas for improvement: the number of long words (7+ characters) and the number of complex words from the Dale-Chall list are both in the 90th percentile, indicating the vocabulary is more complex than is typical for a PLS. Reducing these will improve overall clarity."
