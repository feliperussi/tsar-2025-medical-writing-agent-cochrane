  "draft": "What is the best way to prepare the womb for a frozen embryo transfer: using a natural cycle or using hormones?\n\nKey messages\n- We do not know if preparing the womb for a frozen embryo transfer (placing a previously frozen embryo into the womb) using a woman's natural monthly cycle is better or worse than using medicines (hormone therapy). The available evidence was not strong enough to show a clear difference in the chances of having a baby or a miscarriage.\n- Future, larger, and well-designed studies are needed to provide more certain results to help people decide on the best way to prepare for a frozen embryo transfer.\n\nWhat is frozen embryo transfer and how is the womb prepared for it?\nFrozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) is a type of fertility treatment. It involves thawing a previously frozen embryo and placing it into a woman's womb to try and achieve a pregnancy. For the embryo to successfully attach, the lining of the womb (the endometrium) must be properly prepared. There are several ways to do this. Doctors can rely on the woman's natural monthly cycle ('natural cycle'). Alternatively, they can use medicines like oestrogen and progesterone to prepare the womb lining ('hormone therapy'). Another approach is to use drugs to stimulate the ovaries to release an egg ('ovulation induction').\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare these different methods for preparing the womb before a frozen embryo transfer. We wanted to find out which method was more effective and safer for achieving a live birth and reducing the risk of miscarriage.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of preparing the womb for frozen embryo transfer. We then compared and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 32 randomised controlled trials that included 6352 women undergoing frozen embryo transfer. The studies compared different ways to prepare the womb for the embryo, including using a natural cycle, a modified natural cycle, or various types of hormone therapy. The main goal was to find out which method was best for increasing the chance of a live birth and reducing the risk of miscarriage. Overall, the review found that it is uncertain if one method is better than another. The evidence suggests there probably or may be little to no difference between the different methods for the chance of having a baby or the risk of miscarriage.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and the evidence is based on few cases of condition/type of event.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022 of search.",

Please address the following points:\n\n1. **Subheadings must be questions:** Two subheadings do not follow the required question format. This is a critical requirement of the style guide.\n   - **Current:** 'Methods' and 'Limitations of the evidence'\n   - **Problem:** The style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions to help guide the reader.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Change 'Methods' to 'What did we do?' and 'Limitations of the evidence' to 'How reliable is the evidence?'\n\n2. **Awkward phrasing in the currency statement:** The final sentence is ungrammatical and uses jargon.\n   - **Current:** 'The evidence is up to date to December 2022 of search.'\n   - **Problem:** The phrase 'of search' is confusing for a lay audience and grammatically incorrect in this context.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'The evidence is up to date to December 2022.'\n\n3. **Vague language in the limitations section:** The explanation for low confidence is too technical.\n   - **Current:** '...and the evidence is based on few cases of condition/type of event.'\n   - **Problem:** This phrase is abstract and unclear. Readers won't understand what 'cases of condition/type of event' means.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** '...and in many studies, too few women had a live birth or a miscarriage for us to be certain about the results.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. Key indicators such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (10.34), words per sentence (19.68), and passive voice count (8) are excellent. This indicates a strong foundation, but the metrics do not capture non-compliance with specific formatting rules (e.g., question-based subheadings) or subtle clarity issues in phrasing, which are the primary reasons for the required revisions."
