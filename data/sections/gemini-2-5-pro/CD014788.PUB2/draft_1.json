  "draft": "For women with endometriosis, what are the benefits and harms of treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (a type of hormone therapy)?\n\nKey messages\n- For women with endometriosis, a type of hormone therapy called gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues may help to relieve pain when compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment). However, this treatment may also cause unwanted effects, such as hot flushes, and may lead to a decrease in bone mineral density (a measure of bone strength).\n- The evidence is not strong, so we are not certain about these effects. More and better-quality studies are needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of this treatment, especially when compared to other options for endometriosis.\n\nWhat is endometriosis and how can it be treated?\nEndometriosis is a common condition affecting women of reproductive age. It occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows outside the womb, which can cause pain (such as painful periods or pain during sex) and infertility. One treatment option is a type of hormone therapy called gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas), which can help reduce this pain. However, these medicines can have side effects, including a loss of bone mineral density, which can lead to weaker bones.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe GnRH analogues are for treating the painful symptoms of endometriosis when compared with other treatments, placebo (a dummy treatment), or no treatment. We also wanted to understand their effect on women's bone density, quality of life, and any other side effects.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues with other treatments, placebo (a dummy treatment), or no treatment for women with endometriosis. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 72 studies involving 7355 women with endometriosis. The studies compared gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) with placebo, danazol, or GnRHas combined with calcium-regulating agents. The review authors did not find any studies that compared GnRHas with no treatment or with analgesics. The treatment duration in the included studies ranged from three to 12 months.\n\nMain results: GnRHas compared to placebo for endometriosis-related pain\nCompared to a placebo (a dummy treatment), gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) may reduce endometriosis-related pain, including painful periods, pain during sex, and pelvic tenderness. However, GnRHas may cause a large increase in hot flushes. When comparing GnRHas with another medication called danazol, it is unclear if GnRHas have an effect on endometriosis-related pain. Using GnRHas alone may reduce bone mineral density slightly compared to using them together with calcium-regulating agents, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. There are also not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2022 of search.",

The main issues are that several subheadings are not phrased as questions, and the text uses complex noun phrases and long words where simpler, more direct language would be better.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help readers find information easily. Several current subheadings are statements.\n   - **Problem:** \"Methods\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Please change these to questions, for example:\n     - \"How did we conduct the review?\"\n     - \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n     - \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n2. **Use verbs instead of complex noun phrases (nominalizations).** The draft often uses noun forms where a direct verb would be simpler and more active. This makes sentences longer and harder to process.\n   - **Problem:** \"...this treatment may also cause unwanted effects, such as hot flushes, and may lead to a **decrease in bone mineral density**...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite using a verb: \"...this treatment may also cause unwanted effects, such as hot flushes, and may **decrease bone mineral density**...\"\n\n3. **Reduce the use of long, technical terms.** The full name \"gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues\" is very long and repeated multiple times. After defining it once, you can use simpler terms.\n   - **Problem:** \"Compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment), **gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas)** may reduce endometriosis-related pain...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** After the first full definition, use a simpler phrase: \"Compared to a placebo, **this hormone therapy (GnRHas)** may reduce endometriosis-related pain...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 8 of 18 metrics (44%) falling into the best quartile. However, the analysis also highlights three key areas for improvement where the draft deviates significantly from the typical pattern (P90 range). These are 'nominalization' (using nouns instead of verbs), 'nouns' (high overall noun count), and 'long_words'. These metrics support the editorial feedback, indicating that the text could be made clearer and more direct by using more action verbs and replacing long, complex words with simpler alternatives."
