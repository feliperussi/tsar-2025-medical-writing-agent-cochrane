  "draft": "After weight-loss surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), does closing surgical gaps in the abdomen prevent a twisted bowel (internal hernia)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having a type of weight-loss surgery called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, closing the surgical gaps inside the abdomen may reduce the risk of a serious complication where the bowel twists (internal hernia). There appears to be little to no difference in other unwanted effects or death shortly after the surgery.\n- Our confidence in these findings is limited because they are based on a small number of studies. More research is needed to be more certain about the benefits and potential harms of closing these surgical gaps.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is an internal hernia after weight-loss surgery?\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a common type of weight-loss (bariatric) surgery. The procedure involves creating a small stomach pouch and rearranging the small intestine. This rearrangement can leave small gaps or defects inside the abdomen. A serious complication can occur if part of the intestine slips through one of these gaps, causing a blockage or twisting. This is called an internal hernia. To prevent this, some surgeons stitch these gaps closed during the original operation. However, there is a concern that closing the gaps might increase the risk of other problems, such as a blockage in the small intestine.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of closing these internal gaps compared to leaving them open for people having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. We wanted to know if closing the gaps reduces the risk of internal hernias and whether it affects the risk of other complications, death, or the length of the hospital stay.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared closing surgical defects with not closing them in people having gastric bypass surgery. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nThe review authors found three studies with 3010 people with obesity who were having a type of weight-loss surgery called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The studies compared closing certain spaces inside the abdomen with not closing them. People in the studies were followed for up to 10 years after their surgery. The studies did not say where they took place or who funded them.\n\nMain results: Closing internal spaces during surgery and the risk of internal hernia\nFor people undergoing a type of weight-loss surgery called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, closing certain spaces inside the abdomen may cause a large reduction in the risk of a serious complication known as internal hernia. Closing these spaces may make little to no difference to the number of overall complications in the month after surgery. We are very uncertain about the effect of closing these spaces on the risk of death after surgery or on the risk of complications during the operation. Closing these spaces may also increase how long people stay in the hospital, but we are very uncertain about this finding.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft, but it cannot be approved because it fails a critical check: several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is required by the style guide. Additionally, I have identified 3 key areas for improvement to enhance clarity for the reader.\n\n**Critical Issue: Subheading Format**\n- **Problem:** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. Several of your subheadings are statements.\n- **Examples:** \"Methods\", \"Main results: Closing internal spaces during surgery and the risk of internal hernia\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\".\n- **Suggestion:** Please rephrase these as questions. For example:\n    - \"Methods\" → \"How did we conduct this review?\"\n    - \"Main results...\" → \"What are the main results?\"\n    - \"Limitations of the evidence\" → \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n    - \"Currency of the evidence\" → \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed**\n\n1.  **Simplify Noun-Heavy Sentences:** Some sentences are long and rely on many nouns, which can make them hard to follow. This is supported by the high noun count identified in the evaluation.\n    - **Quote:** \"For people undergoing a type of weight-loss surgery called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, closing certain spaces inside the abdomen may cause a large reduction in the risk of a serious complication known as internal hernia.\"\n    - **Problem:** This 36-word sentence is packed with nouns (\"surgery\", \"reduction\", \"risk\", \"complication\") and could be more direct.\n    - **Suggestion:** Try rewriting this to be more active and concise. For example: \"Closing surgical gaps during this type of weight-loss surgery may greatly reduce the risk of a serious complication called an internal hernia.\"\n\n2.  **Use Consistent Terminology:** The summary uses several different terms for the same concept, which could confuse readers.\n    - **Quote:** The text uses \"surgical gaps\", \"defects\", \"internal gaps\", and \"certain spaces inside the abdomen\" to describe the same thing.\n    - **Problem:** Readers may wonder if these terms refer to different things. Consistency is key for clarity in a plain language summary.\n    - **Suggestion:** Choose one clear, simple term and use it consistently after the initial explanation. We recommend using \"surgical gaps\" throughout the text after defining it initially (e.g., \"...can leave small gaps or defects inside the abdomen.\").\n\n3.  **Clarify the Limitations Statement:** The wording in the limitations section is slightly redundant and jargony.\n    - **Quote:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\"\n    - **Problem:** The phrase \"results of our outcomes\" is unclear for a lay audience.\n    - **Suggestion:** Simplify this for better readability. For example: \"We have little confidence in the evidence because it is based on only a few studies. This means we cannot be certain about the findings.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, the evaluation also flags two areas for review that align with the editorial feedback: the number of nouns ('nouns': P90) and the count of unfamiliar words ('complex_words_dc': P90) are higher than typical. Addressing the noun-heavy sentences and simplifying vocabulary as suggested will help bring these metrics closer to the typical range and improve overall clarity for the reader."
