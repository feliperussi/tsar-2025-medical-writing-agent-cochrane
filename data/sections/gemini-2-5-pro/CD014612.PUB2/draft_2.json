  "draft": "After weight-loss surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), does closing surgical gaps in the abdomen prevent a twisted bowel (internal hernia)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having a type of weight-loss surgery called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, closing the surgical gaps inside the abdomen may reduce the risk of a serious complication where the bowel twists (internal hernia). There appears to be little to no difference in other unwanted effects or death shortly after the surgery.\n- Our confidence in these findings is limited because they are based on a small number of studies. More research is needed to be more certain about the benefits and potential harms of closing these surgical gaps.\n\nWhat is an internal hernia after weight-loss surgery?\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a common type of weight-loss (bariatric) surgery. The procedure involves creating a small stomach pouch and rearranging the small intestine. This rearrangement can leave small gaps or defects inside the abdomen. A serious complication can occur if part of the intestine slips through one of these gaps, causing a blockage or twisting. This is called an internal hernia. To prevent this, some surgeons stitch these gaps closed during the original operation. However, there is a concern that closing the gaps might increase the risk of other problems, such as a blockage in the small intestine.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of closing these surgical gaps compared to leaving them open for people having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. We wanted to know if closing the gaps reduces the risk of internal hernias and whether it affects the risk of other complications, death, or the length of the hospital stay.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared closing surgical gaps with not closing them in people having gastric bypass surgery. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review authors found 3 studies with 3010 people with obesity who were having a type of weight-loss surgery called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The studies compared closing surgical gaps with not closing them. People in the studies were followed for up to 10 years after their surgery. The studies did not say where they took place or who funded them.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nClosing surgical gaps during this type of weight-loss surgery may greatly reduce the risk of a serious complication called an internal hernia. Closing these surgical gaps may make little to no difference to the number of overall complications in the month after surgery. We are very uncertain about the effect of closing these surgical gaps on the risk of death after surgery or on the risk of complications during the operation. Closing these surgical gaps may also increase how long people stay in the hospital, but we are very uncertain about this finding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is based on only a few studies. This means we cannot be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a very clear and well-structured summary that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, a few key improvements are needed to ensure maximum clarity and consistency for the reader. I am recommending 'NOT_APPROVED' so you can incorporate these important changes.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1.  **Use consistent terminology for 'surgical gaps'.**\nThe summary uses several different terms like 'defects', 'spaces', and 'gaps' to describe the same thing, which could confuse a reader into thinking they are different concepts.\n\n    *   **Problematic Phrases:** \"closing surgical gaps\" (Title), \"gaps or defects\" (Introduction), \"closing surgical defects\" (Methods), \"closing certain spaces\" (Results).\n    *   **Suggestion:** For clarity, please choose one simple term and use it consistently. \"Surgical gaps\" is an excellent plain language choice used in the title. I recommend replacing \"defects\" and \"spaces\" with \"surgical gaps\" throughout the text.\n        *   For example, rewrite: \"The studies compare closing certain spaces inside the abdomen...\"\n        *   To: \"The studies compare closing surgical gaps inside the abdomen...\"\n\n2.  **Soften the language describing the main result.**\nThe description of the main finding in the results section sounds more certain than the evidence allows.\n\n    *   **Problematic Sentence:** \"Closing surgical gaps during this type of weight-loss surgery may greatly reduce the risk of a serious complication called an internal hernia.\"\n    *   **Explanation:** The phrase \"greatly reduce\" may overstate the finding, which is based on low‑certainty evidence. The wording in your 'Key messages' section (\"may reduce the risk\") is more appropriately cautious.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Align the language in the main results with the key message. Rewrite the sentence to: \"Closing surgical gaps during this type of weight‑loss surgery may reduce the risk of a serious complication called an internal hernia.\"\n\n3.  **Avoid repeating the full, technical name of the surgery.**\nThe full name of the surgery is used multiple times, even after it has been clearly established. This makes the text slightly repetitive.\n\n    *   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The review authors found 3 studies with 3010 people with obesity who were having a type of weight‑loss surgery called Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass.\"\n    *   **Explanation:** By this point in the summary, the reader knows what surgery is being discussed. You can use a simpler term.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Replace the full name with a shorter version. For example: \"The review authors found 3 studies with 3010 people with obesity who were having this type of weight‑loss surgery.\"\n\nAddressing these points, especially the first two, will make an already good summary even better and ensure the findings are communicated as clearly and accurately as possible.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling into the best-performing quartile. Readability scores are excellent (e.g., Flesch‑Kincaid Grade Level of 8.9). The single notable deviation is the count of Dale‑Chall complex words ('complex_words_dc'), which is higher than typical. The suggested editorial changes, such as replacing terms like 'defects' with the simpler 'gaps', will help address this metric while also improving overall clarity."
