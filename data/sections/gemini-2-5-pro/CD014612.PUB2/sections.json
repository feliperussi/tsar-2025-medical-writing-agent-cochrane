  "key_messages": [
    "For people having a type of weight-loss surgery called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, closing the surgical gaps inside the abdomen may reduce the risk of a serious complication where the bowel twists (internal hernia). There appears to be little to no difference in other unwanted effects or death shortly after the surgery.",
    "Our confidence in these findings is limited because they are based on a small number of studies. More research is needed to be more certain about the benefits and potential harms of closing these surgical gaps."

      "subheading": "What is an internal hernia after weight-loss surgery?",
      "content": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a common type of weight-loss (bariatric) surgery. The procedure involves creating a small stomach pouch and rearranging the small intestine. This rearrangement can leave small gaps or defects inside the abdomen. A serious complication can occur if part of the intestine slips through one of these gaps, causing a blockage or twisting. This is called an internal hernia. To prevent this, some surgeons stitch these gaps closed during the original operation. However, there is a concern that closing the gaps might increase the risk of other problems, such as a blockage in the small intestine."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of closing these internal gaps compared to leaving them open for people having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. We wanted to know if closing the gaps reduces the risk of internal hernias and whether it affects the risk of other complications, death, or the length of the hospital stay."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared closing surgical defects with not closing them in people having gastric bypass surgery. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review authors found three studies with 3010 people with obesity who were having a type of weight-loss surgery called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The studies compared closing certain spaces inside the abdomen with not closing them. People in the studies were followed for up to 10 years after their surgery. The studies did not say where they took place or who funded them."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Closing internal spaces during surgery and the risk of internal hernia",
      "content": "For people undergoing a type of weight-loss surgery called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, closing certain spaces inside the abdomen may cause a large reduction in the risk of a serious complication known as internal hernia. Closing these spaces may make little to no difference to the number of overall complications in the month after surgery. We are very uncertain about the effect of closing these spaces on the risk of death after surgery or on the risk of complications during the operation. Closing these spaces may also increase how long people stay in the hospital, but we are very uncertain about this finding."
