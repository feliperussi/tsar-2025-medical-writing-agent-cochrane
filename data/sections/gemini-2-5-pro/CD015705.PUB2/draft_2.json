  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms when healthcare workers use their own mobile phones for work?\n\n- The evidence from 30 studies suggests that when healthcare workers use their own mobile phones for work, it can help them be more flexible and responsive to patients' needs. However, this informal use also has drawbacks: it can put patient information at risk, create extra costs and out-of-hours work for staff (especially those in lower-paid roles), and lead to important health information not being recorded in official systems.\n- Efforts to strengthen formal communication systems in healthcare should consider how to include the benefits of informal mobile phone use (such as flexibility and responsiveness) while reducing the risks to patients and the burdens on staff.\n\nWhy do healthcare workers use their own mobile phones for work?\nHealthcare workers sometimes need to find their own ways to get their work done, especially when the official communication systems at their workplace are not enough. One common solution is for them to use their personal mobile phones or other devices. While this can help them care for patients and communicate with colleagues, using personal devices in ways that are not regulated by their employer can also create new challenges for the workers, their patients, and the healthcare system.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand the views, experiences, and practices of healthcare workers and managers who use personal mobile devices informally to support their work.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that explored the views and experiences of healthcare workers who use their personal mobile devices for work. We then combined the findings from these studies and rated our confidence in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 30 studies published between 2013 and 2022. These studies were conducted in a range of high-, middle-, and low-income countries and covered various healthcare settings and different types of healthcare workers. The studies primarily described the use of mobile phones, rather than other mobile devices like tablets. Healthcare workers' informal use of their personal mobile phones for work probably helps them to be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to the needs of patients and colleagues. This can also help strengthen their relationships. However, this practice also probably creates new problems. It may deepen existing inequities among healthcare workers, particularly for those in lower-level roles. Using personal phones for work probably also introduces risks for patients, such as breaking the confidentiality of their information, and may weaken the formal healthcare system by keeping important information out of official records.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it does not cover all of the types of mobile devices we were interested in; it focused mainly on mobile phones rather than other devices like tablets.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review includes evidence published up to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and meets all critical requirements. However, it is not approved because a few key improvements to sentence and paragraph structure will make the findings much clearer for readers. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Simplify the first key message.** The first bullet point is a single sentence that is over 50 words long, combining multiple ideas.\n    - **Quote:** \"The evidence from 30 studies suggests that when healthcare workers use their own mobile phones for work, it can help them be more flexible and responsive to patients' needs. However, this informal use also has drawbacks: it can put patient information at risk, create extra costs and out-of-hours work for staff (especially those in lower-paid roles), and lead to important health information not being recorded in official systems.\"\n    - **Suggestion:** Break this into two shorter sentences or two separate bullet points to distinguish the benefits from the drawbacks. For example: \"- Using personal phones for work helps healthcare workers be more flexible and responsive to patients' needs. - However, this practice also has drawbacks: it can risk patient privacy, create extra costs for staff, and lead to important information being left out of official records.\"\n\n2. **Split the main results paragraph.** The final, long paragraph in the 'What did we find?' section mixes benefits and harms, which can be confusing for readers.\n    - **Quote:** \"Healthcare workers' informal use of their personal mobile phones for work probably helps them to be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to the needs of patients and colleagues... [through to] ...keeping important information out of official records.\"\n    - **Suggestion:** Divide this into two paragraphs. The first should focus on the benefits (flexibility, stronger relationships). The second should start with \"However, this practice also probably creates new problems\" and detail the drawbacks (inequities, patient risks, weaker systems).\n\n3. **Rephrase the currency statement for clarity.** The current phrasing is slightly passive and could be more direct, in line with the style guide's preference for active voice.\n    - **Quote:** \"This review includes evidence published up to August 2022.\"\n    - **Suggestion:** Use a more active and direct statement from the authors' perspective, such as: \"We searched for evidence published up to August 2022.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. For example, the average words per sentence (19.46) and low use of passive voice (7 instances) are excellent. However, these strong overall averages mask a few specific instances of overly long sentences (over 50 words) in key sections, which were identified for revision to further improve reader comprehension."
