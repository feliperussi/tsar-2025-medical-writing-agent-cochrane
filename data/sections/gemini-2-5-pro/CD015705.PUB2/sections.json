  "key_messages": [
    "The evidence from 30 studies suggests that when healthcare workers use their own mobile phones for work, it can help them be more flexible and responsive to patients' needs. However, this informal use also has drawbacks: it can put patient information at risk, create extra costs and out-of-hours work for staff (especially those in lower-paid roles), and lead to important health information not being recorded in official systems.",
    "Efforts to strengthen formal communication systems in healthcare should consider how to include the benefits of informal mobile phone use (such as flexibility and responsiveness) while reducing the risks to patients and the burdens on staff."

      "subheading": "Why do healthcare workers use their own mobile phones for work?",
      "content": "Healthcare workers sometimes need to find their own ways to get their work done, especially when the official communication systems at their workplace are not enough. One common solution is for them to use their personal mobile phones or other devices. While this can help them care for patients and communicate with colleagues, using personal devices in ways that are not regulated by their employer can also create new challenges for the workers, their patients, and the healthcare system."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 30 studies published between 2013 and 2022. These studies were conducted in a range of high-, middle-, and low-income countries and covered various healthcare settings and different types of healthcare workers. The studies primarily described the use of mobile phones, rather than other mobile devices like tablets. Healthcare workers' informal use of their personal mobile phones for work probably helps them to be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to the needs of patients and colleagues. This can also help strengthen their relationships. However, this practice also probably creates new problems. It may deepen existing inequities among healthcare workers, particularly for those in lower-level roles. Using personal phones for work probably also introduces risks for patients, such as breaking the confidentiality of their information, and may weaken the formal healthcare system by keeping important information out of official records."
