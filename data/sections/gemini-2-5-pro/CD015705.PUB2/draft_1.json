  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms when healthcare workers use their own mobile phones for work?\n\n- The evidence from 30 studies suggests that when healthcare workers use their own mobile phones for work, it can help them be more flexible and responsive to patients' needs. However, this informal use also has drawbacks: it can put patient information at risk, create extra costs and out-of-hours work for staff (especially those in lower-paid roles), and lead to important health information not being recorded in official systems.\n- Efforts to strengthen formal communication systems in healthcare should consider how to include the benefits of informal mobile phone use (such as flexibility and responsiveness) while reducing the risks to patients and the burdens on staff.\n\nWhy we did this review\nWhy do healthcare workers use their own mobile phones for work?\nHealthcare workers sometimes need to find their own ways to get their work done, especially when the official communication systems at their workplace are not enough. One common solution is for them to use their personal mobile phones or other devices. While this can help them care for patients and communicate with colleagues, using personal devices in ways that are not regulated by their employer can also create new challenges for the workers, their patients, and the healthcare system.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand the views, experiences, and practices of healthcare workers and managers who use personal mobile devices informally to support their work.\n\nHow we did this review\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched for studies that explored the views and experiences of healthcare workers who use their personal mobile devices for work.\nData Synthesis\nWe then combined the findings from these studies and rated our confidence in them.\n\nWhat the review found\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 30 studies published between 2013 and 2022. These studies were conducted in a range of high-, middle-, and low-income countries and covered various healthcare settings and different types of healthcare workers. The studies primarily described the use of mobile phones, rather than other mobile devices like tablets. Healthcare workers' informal use of their personal mobile phones for work probably helps them to be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to the needs of patients and colleagues. This can also help strengthen their relationships. However, this practice also probably creates new problems. It may deepen existing inequities among healthcare workers, particularly for those in lower-level roles. Using personal phones for work probably also introduces risks for patients, such as breaking the confidentiality of their information, and may weaken the formal healthcare system by keeping important information out of official records.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it does not cover all of the types of mobile devices we were interested in; it focused mainly on mobile phones rather than other devices like tablets.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. While the core text is well-written and factually accurate, it fails to meet a critical style guide requirement: several subheadings are not phrased as questions. Additionally, some headings are redundant, and minor phrasing issues affect clarity. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions:** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to guide the reader.\n    *   **Problem:** Headings like 'How we did this review', 'Limitations of the evidence', and the unnecessary 'Search Strategy' and 'Data Synthesis' are not questions.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please rephrase them. For example, change 'How we did this review' to 'How did we do this review?' and 'Limitations of the evidence' to 'What are the limitations of the evidence?'. Remove the 'Search Strategy' and 'Data Synthesis' subheadings as the text is short enough without them.\n\n2. **Remove redundant headings:** The structure contains repetitive headings that can confuse the reader.\n    *   **Problem:** The section 'What the review found' is immediately followed by the subheading 'What did we find?'. This is unnecessary.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please remove the heading 'What the review found' and just use the question 'What did we find?' for the results section.\n\n3. **Simplify the evidence currency statement:** The final sentence has some awkward, technical phrasing.\n    *   **Problem:** The sentence 'The evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.' is clunky.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please rephrase this for clarity. For example: 'This review includes evidence published up to August 2022.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 61% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. Key indicators like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (11.50) and low passive voice count (6) are excellent. The core prose is strong; the required revisions are primarily structural."
