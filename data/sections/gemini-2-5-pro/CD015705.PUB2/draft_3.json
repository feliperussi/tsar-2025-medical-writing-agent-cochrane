  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms when healthcare workers use their own mobile phones for work?\n\n- Using personal mobile phones for work helps healthcare workers be more flexible and responsive to patients' needs.\n- However, this practice also has drawbacks: it can put patient information at risk, create extra costs for staff (especially those in lower-paid roles), and lead to important health information not being recorded in official systems.\n- Efforts to strengthen formal communication systems in healthcare should consider how to include the benefits of informal mobile phone use (such as flexibility and responsiveness) while reducing the risks to patients and the burdens on staff.\n\nWhy do healthcare workers use their own mobile phones for work?\nHealthcare workers sometimes need to find their own ways to get their work done, especially when the official communication systems at their workplace are not enough. One common solution is for them to use their personal mobile phones or other devices. While this can help them care for patients and communicate with colleagues, using personal devices in ways that are not regulated by their employer can also create new challenges for the workers, their patients, and the healthcare system.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand the views, experiences, and practices of healthcare workers and managers who use personal mobile devices informally to support their work.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that explored the views and experiences of healthcare workers who use their personal mobile devices for work. We then combined the findings from these studies and rated our confidence in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 30 studies published between 2013 and 2022. These studies were conducted in a range of high-, middle-, and low-income countries and covered various healthcare settings and different types of healthcare workers. The studies primarily described the use of mobile phones, rather than other mobile devices like tablets.\n\nHealthcare workers' informal use of their personal mobile phones for work probably helps them to be more flexible, efficient, and responsive to the needs of patients and colleagues. This can also help strengthen their relationships.\n\nHowever, this practice also probably creates new problems. It may deepen existing inequities among healthcare workers, particularly for those in lower-level roles. Using personal phones for work probably also introduces risks for patients, such as breaking the confidentiality of their information, and may weaken the formal healthcare system by keeping important information out of official records.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it does not cover all of the types of mobile devices we were interested in; it focused mainly on mobile phones rather than other devices like tablets.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence published up to August 2022.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 77.8% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. All 18 metrics are within the typical ranges (P25, P50, or P75). Key indicators like words per sentence (19.64), passive voice count (7), and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (11.03) are excellent, demonstrating a strong foundation in plain language writing."
