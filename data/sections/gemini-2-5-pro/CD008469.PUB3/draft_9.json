  "draft": "For children with asthma, can education programs at home help them manage their condition and prevent asthma attacks?\n\nKey messages\n- We are uncertain if home education programs help prevent serious asthma attacks (when symptoms suddenly get worse and require urgent medical care or treatment with steroid tablets) because there is not enough good-quality evidence. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- More intensive home education programs may reduce how often children are admitted to the hospital for asthma when compared with less intensive programs.\n- It is difficult to be certain about the results because the education programs in the studies were very different from one another. Future research should aim to find out which parts of an education program are most important for children with asthma and their families.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is education for children important?\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. It is common in children worldwide. To manage asthma well, children and their families need good education. Educating families helps them understand the condition and learn skills to manage it themselves. For example, they can learn to use an inhaler correctly and avoid things that can trigger an asthma attack. This teaching can happen in different places, including at home. Teaching families at home may help those who find it difficult to travel to clinics or hospitals, and it allows them to learn in a familiar place.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if home-based education programs help children with asthma and their families. We wanted to know if these programs were better than usual care or education delivered elsewhere, like in a clinic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based asthma education for children and their families against usual care or less-intensive education. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nThe review included 26 studies with 5122 children and adolescents with asthma, aged 1 to 18 years. The studies compared face-to-face educational programs delivered in the home against either usual care or less-intensive education programs. Researchers measured the main results after 6 months.\n\nWhat happens when home education is compared with usual care?\nCompared to usual care, asthma education at home may not change how often children have serious asthma attacks. This includes attacks that require a visit to the emergency department or treatment with steroid tablets. It is also uncertain if these programs improve a child's quality of life (their overall well-being). We have very little confidence in this evidence, so we are uncertain about these effects.\n\nWhat is the difference between more-intensive and less-intensive home education?\nChildren who receive a more-intensive home education program may be admitted to the hospital for asthma far less often than those who receive a less-intensive program. However, more-intensive programs may make little to no difference to other asthma attacks, days missed from school, or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, in many studies, families knew which type of education they were receiving, which could have affected the results. Second, the studies included different types of people and used different ways to teach them, making it hard to compare the results. Finally, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity and readability for a lay audience. The main issue is the frequent use of formal, noun-heavy language instead of simpler, more direct verbs. This makes the text wordier and harder to follow than necessary. Below are the top 3 improvements to focus on.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Use active verbs instead of noun forms (nominalizations).**\nYour text often uses noun forms of verbs, which makes sentences less direct. The linguistic analysis confirms this is a significant pattern, with a 'nominalization' score well beyond the 90th percentile compared to other summaries.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"This includes attacks that require a visit to the emergency department or treatment with steroid tablets.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** Using nouns like \"a visit\" and \"treatment\" is less direct than using the verbs \"visit\" and \"treat\".\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"This includes attacks where a child needs to visit the emergency department or be treated with steroid tablets.\"\n\n**2. Replace complex or formal words with simpler alternatives.**\nThe draft uses some formal phrasing that could be simplified for better readability. The metrics for long words and complex words are higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Children who receive a more-intensive home education program may be admitted to the hospital for asthma far less often than those who receive a less-intensive program.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** Phrases like \"receive a... program\" and \"be admitted to the hospital\" are unnecessarily formal and wordy.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Children in a more-intensive home education program may need to go to the hospital for asthma far less often than children in a less-intensive program.\"\n\n**3. Simplify sentence structure in the limitations section.**\nThe explanation of the limitations is clear but could be more concise and direct.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"First, in many studies, families knew which type of education they were receiving, which could have affected the results.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"they were receiving\" is slightly passive and wordy.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"First, because families in many studies knew which education program they got, this could have biased the results.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable in terms of sentence length and structure, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary. Four metrics are in the P90 range or beyond, most notably 'nominalization' (use of noun-form verbs), which is well beyond the 90th percentile. This is supported by higher-than-typical counts for nouns, long words, and complex words, suggesting the language could be more direct and use simpler, verb-focused phrasing."
