  "draft": "For children with asthma, can education programs at home help them manage their condition and prevent asthma attacks?\n\nKey messages\n- We are uncertain if home education programs help prevent serious asthma attacks (sudden worsening of symptoms requiring urgent medical care). This is because of a lack of good-quality evidence. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of the education programs.\n- More intensive home education programs may reduce hospital admissions for asthma when compared with less intensive programs.\n- It is difficult to draw firm conclusions because the education programs studied were very different from one another. Future research should aim to find out which parts of an education program are most important for children with asthma and their families.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is education for children important?\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. It is common in children worldwide. A key part of managing asthma is education, which helps children and their families understand the condition and learn self-management skills. These skills can include how to use an inhaler correctly and how to avoid things that can trigger an asthma attack. This education can be provided in different places, including at home. Giving education at home may help families who find it difficult to travel to clinics or hospitals and allows them to learn in a familiar environment.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective educational programs delivered at home are for children with asthma and their families. We wanted to know if these home-based programs were better than the usual care people receive or education delivered in other places, like a clinic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based asthma education for children and their families against usual care or less-intensive education. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nThe review included 26 studies with 5122 children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years with asthma. The studies compared face-to-face educational programs delivered in the home against usual care or less-intensive education programs. Researchers measured the main outcomes after six months.\n\nComparing home education to usual care, we found that home-based asthma education for children may make little to no difference to the number of asthma attacks or emergency department visits. It may also have little to no effect on quality of life.\n\nWhen we compared a more-intensive home education program to a less-intensive one, we found the more-intensive program may greatly reduce hospital admissions for asthma. However, it may make little to no difference to other asthma attacks, days missed from school, or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. First, in many studies, families knew which type of education they were receiving, which could have influenced the results. Second, the studies included different types of people and used different educational methods, making the results difficult to compare. Finally, there were not enough studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

Additionally, the summary's clarity can be significantly improved by restructuring the results section to separate the two main comparisons and by rewriting several noun-heavy sentences to be more direct and active. These changes will make the findings easier for readers to understand and align the text more closely with the source material.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is generally readable, with most metrics falling into the best quartile for PLS texts. However, it deviates significantly from typical patterns in three key areas: nominalization (BEYOND_P90), total nouns (P90), and long words (P90). The extremely high nominalization score (34 instances, where the median is under 13) strongly supports the editorial feedback to replace abstract nouns with active verbs, which will improve clarity and directness."
