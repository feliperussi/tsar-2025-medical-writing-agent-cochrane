  "draft": "For children with asthma, can education programs at home help them manage their condition and prevent asthma attacks?\n\nKey messages\n- We are uncertain if home education programs help prevent serious asthma attacks (a sudden worsening of symptoms that needs urgent medical care or steroid tablets) because there is not enough good-quality evidence. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- More intensive home education programs may reduce how often children need to go to the hospital for asthma when compared with less intensive programs.\n- It is difficult to be certain about the results because the education programs in the studies were very different from one another. Future research should aim to find out which parts of an education program are most important for children with asthma and their families.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is education for children important?\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. It is common in children worldwide. To manage asthma well, children and their families need good education. Educating families helps them understand the condition and learn skills to manage it themselves. For example, they can learn to use an inhaler correctly and avoid things that can trigger an asthma attack. This education can happen in different places, including at home. Teaching families at home may help those who find it difficult to travel to clinics or hospitals, and it allows them to learn in a familiar place.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if home-based education programs help children with asthma and their families. We wanted to know if these programs were better than usual care or education given in other places, like a clinic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based asthma education for children and their families against usual care or less-intensive education. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nThe review included 26 studies with 5122 children and adolescents with asthma, aged 1 to 18 years. The studies compared face-to-face education programs that took place in the home against either usual care or less-intensive education programs. Researchers measured the main results after 6 months.\n\nWhat happens when home education is compared with usual care?\nCompared to usual care, asthma education at home may not change how often children have serious asthma attacks. This includes attacks where children need to visit the emergency department or be treated with steroid tablets. It is also uncertain if these programs improve a child's quality of life (their overall well-being). We have very little confidence in this evidence, so we are uncertain about these effects.\n\nWhat is the difference between more-intensive and less-intensive home education?\nChildren in a more-intensive home education program may need to go to the hospital for asthma far less often than children in a less-intensive program. However, more-intensive programs may make little to no difference to other asthma attacks, days missed from school, or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, in many studies, families knew which education program they got, which could have affected the results. Second, the studies included different types of people and used different ways to teach them, making it hard to compare the results. Finally, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it can be made clearer and more direct for readers by focusing on three key areas. The primary issue is the frequent use of nouns where verbs would be more active (a style called 'nominalization'), which makes sentences less direct. Simplifying some word choices and shortening a key sentence will also improve readability.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Use More Verbs and Fewer Nouns to Make Sentences More Direct**\nYour sentences are grammatically correct, but they often use noun forms of verbs, which can make them feel passive and less engaging. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which shows a very high rate of 'nominalization'.\n\n*   **Problematic Phrase:** \"...a sudden worsening of symptoms that needs urgent medical care...\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"worsening of symptoms\" is a noun phrase. Using a verb like \"worsen\" is more direct and active.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...when symptoms suddenly worsen and need urgent medical care...\"\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This is slightly indirect. A more active construction is clearer.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies found no unwanted or harmful effects.\"\n\n**2. Simplify Word Choices for Easier Reading**\nThe analysis shows a high number of long and complex words. Replacing a few of these with more common alternatives will help a wider audience understand the text easily.\n\n*   **Problematic Word:** \"...5122 children and adolescents with asthma...\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** \"Adolescents\" is a formal term. A simpler word would be more accessible.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...5122 children and young people with asthma...\"\n\n*   **Problematic Phrase:** \"...improve a child's quality of life (their overall well-being).\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The definition is helpful, but the phrasing is a bit clunky. Leading with the simpler term can be more effective.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...improve a child's overall well-being (also known as 'quality of life').\"\n\n**3. Shorten and Clarify the First Key Message**\nThe first key message is 31 words long and contains a complex definition in parentheses, which can be hard for readers to follow in a single sentence.\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"We are uncertain if home education programs help prevent serious asthma attacks (a sudden worsening of symptoms that needs urgent medical care or steroid tablets) because there is not enough good-quality evidence.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The length and structure make it difficult to process. The reason (\"because...\") is at the very end, after a lot of other information.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"There is not enough good-quality evidence to know if home education programs help prevent serious asthma attacks. A serious attack is when symptoms suddenly worsen and need urgent medical care or steroid tablets.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns in most areas, with 72% of metrics in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence structure. The use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is beyond the 90th percentile, and the counts for total nouns, complex words (Dale-Chall), and long words are also in the 90th percentile range. This suggests the text could be made more direct and easier to understand by using more active verbs and simpler, shorter words."
