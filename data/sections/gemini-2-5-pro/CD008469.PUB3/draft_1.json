  "draft": "For children with asthma, can education programs at home help them manage their condition and prevent asthma attacks?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is unclear if education programs delivered at home for children with asthma help to prevent serious asthma attacks (sudden worsening of symptoms requiring urgent medical care) compared to usual care. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of the education programs.\n- There is some evidence that more intensive home education programs may reduce the need for children to be admitted to the hospital for their asthma when compared with less intensive programs.\n- Because the education programs studied were very different from one another, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. Future research should aim to find out which parts of an education program are most important for children with asthma and their families.\n\nWhy we did this review\nWhat is asthma and why is education for children important?\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. It is common in children worldwide. A key part of managing asthma is education, which helps children and their families understand the condition and learn self-management skills. These skills can include how to use an inhaler correctly and how to avoid things that can trigger an asthma attack. This education can be provided in different places, including at home. Giving education at home may help families who find it difficult to travel to clinics or hospitals and allows them to learn in a familiar environment.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective educational programs delivered at home are for children with asthma and their families. We wanted to know if these home-based programs were better than the usual care people receive or education delivered in other places, like a clinic.\n\nWhat we did\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based asthma education for children and their families against usual care or less-intensive education. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat we found\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 26 studies with 5122 children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years with asthma. The studies compared face-to-face educational programs delivered in the home against usual care or less-intensive education programs. The main outcomes were measured at six months.\nMain results: Comparing more-intensive with less-intensive home education\nCompared to usual care, home-based asthma education for children may make little to no difference to the number of asthma attacks or emergency department visits, and may have little to no effect on quality of life. When a more-intensive home education program is compared to a less-intensive one, the more-intensive program may cause a large reduction in hospital admissions for asthma. However, it may make little to no difference to other asthma attacks, days missed from school, or quality of life.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the education, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs some revisions to meet our style guidelines and improve clarity for the reader. The main issues are that several subheadings are not phrased as questions, and the text relies heavily on passive voice and complex noun phrases, which can make it hard to follow. The structure of the results section is also confusing. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions.** Several subheadings are currently statements, which goes against our style guide. Engaging questions help guide the reader through the summary.\n   - **Problem:** \"What we did\", \"What we found\", and \"Limitations of the evidence\".\n   - **Suggestion:** Change these to questions like \"How did we conduct this review?\", \"What did this review find?\", and \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\".\n\n2. **Use more active voice and direct verbs.** The summary has many sentences where the action is described passively or with noun forms of verbs (nominalizations). This makes the text feel academic and less direct. Using active voice makes it clearer who is doing what.\n   - **Problem:** \"The main outcomes were measured at six months.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite in the active voice: \"Researchers measured the main outcomes after six months.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the structure of the 'Main results' section.** The subheading says it compares 'more-intensive with less-intensive' education, but the first sentence discusses the comparison to 'usual care'. This is confusing.\n   - **Problem:** The subheading \"Main results: Comparing more-intensive with less-intensive home education\" is followed by results comparing home education to usual care.\n   - **Suggestion:** Separate the results into two clear paragraphs. For example:\n     - **Paragraph 1 (Home vs. Usual Care):** \"*Comparing home education to usual care*\nWe found that home-based education may make little to no difference to the number of asthma attacks or emergency department visits compared to usual care...\"\n     - **Paragraph 2 (Intensive vs. Less-Intensive):** \"*Comparing more-intensive to less-intensive home education*\nWhen we compared a more-intensive home education program to a less-intensive one, we found the more-intensive program may cause a large reduction in hospital admissions for asthma...\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows that while the summary has good overall readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is in the best 25% of the corpus), it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in key stylistic areas. The use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is exceptionally high (Beyond P90), and the counts for passive voice, total nouns, and long words are all in the highest 10% of the corpus (P90). These metrics support the editorial feedback, indicating a need to simplify sentence structures by using more active verbs and breaking up noun-heavy phrases to improve clarity and directness for the reader."
