  "plain_title": "For children with asthma, can education programs at home help them manage their condition and prevent asthma attacks?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is unclear if education programs delivered at home for children with asthma help to prevent serious asthma attacks (sudden worsening of symptoms requiring urgent medical care) compared to usual care. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of the education programs.",
    "There is some evidence that more intensive home education programs may reduce the need for children to be admitted to the hospital for their asthma when compared with less intensive programs.",
    "Because the education programs studied were very different from one another, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. Future research should aim to find out which parts of an education program are most important for children with asthma and their families."

  "background": [
    {
      "subheading": "What is asthma and why is education for children important?",
      "content": "Asthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. It is common in children worldwide. A key part of managing asthma is education, which helps children and their families understand the condition and learn self-management skills. These skills can include how to use anÂ inhaler correctly and how to avoid things that can trigger an asthma attack. This education can be provided in different places, including at home. Giving education at home may help families who find it difficult to travel to clinics or hospitals and allows them to learn in a familiar environment."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out how effective educational programs delivered at home are for children with asthma and their families. We wanted to know if these home-based programs were better than the usual care people receive or education delivered in other places, like a clinic."
    }
  ],
  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared home-based asthma education for children and their families against usual care or less-intensive education. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence."
    }
  ],
  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 26 studies with 5122 children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years with asthma. The studies compared face-to-face educational programs delivered in the home against usual care or less-intensive education programs. The main outcomes were measured at six months."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Comparing more-intensive with less-intensive home education",
      "content": "Compared to usual care, home-based asthma education for children may make little to no difference to the number of asthma attacks or emergency department visits, and may have little to no effect on quality of life. When a more-intensive home education program is compared to a less-intensive one, the more-intensive program may cause a large reduction in hospital admissions for asthma. However, it may make little to no difference to other asthma attacks, days missed from school, or quality of life."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the education, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022."
