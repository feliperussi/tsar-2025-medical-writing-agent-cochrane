  "draft": "For children with asthma, can education programs at home help them manage their condition and prevent asthma attacks?\n\nKey messages\n- We are uncertain if home education programs help prevent serious asthma attacks (when symptoms suddenly get worse and require urgent medical care) because there is not enough good-quality evidence. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- More intensive home education programs may reduce how often children are admitted to the hospital for asthma when compared with less intensive programs.\n- It is difficult to be certain about the results because the education programs in the studies were very different from one another. Future research should aim to find out which parts of an education program are most important for children with asthma and their families.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is education for children important?\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. It is common in children worldwide. Education is key to managing asthma. It helps children and their families understand the condition and learn skills to manage it themselves. These skills include using an inhaler correctly and avoiding things that can trigger an asthma attack. This education can happen in different places, including at home. Educating families at home may help those who find it difficult to travel to clinics or hospitals, and it allows them to learn in a familiar place.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if home-based education programs help children with asthma and their families. We wanted to know if these programs were better than the usual care people receive or education delivered in other places, like a clinic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based asthma education for children and their families against usual care or less-intensive education. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nThe review included 26 studies with 5122 children and adolescents with asthma, aged 1 to 18 years. The studies compared face-to-face educational programs delivered in the home against either usual care or less-intensive education programs. Researchers measured the main results after 6 months.\n\nHome education compared with usual care\nCompared to usual care, asthma education at home may make little to no difference to the number of asthma attacks or emergency department visits. It may improve a child's quality of life (which describes their overall well-being). However, we have very little confidence in the evidence, so we are uncertain about these effects.\n\nMore-intensive compared with less-intensive home education\nA more-intensive home education program may greatly reduce how often children are admitted to the hospital for asthma compared to a less-intensive program. However, it may make little to no difference to other asthma attacks, days missed from school, or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, in many studies, families knew which type of education they were receiving, which could have affected the results. Second, the studies included different types of people and used different ways to teach them, making it hard to compare the results. Finally, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well on its way, but it needs a few important revisions before it can be approved. There is a critical factual error in the results section that must be corrected, and two subheadings do not follow the required question format. Additionally, the writing could be made more direct by using more verbs instead of nouns.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Correct the Factual Inaccuracy in the Results**\n   - **The problem:** The draft's summary of findings for 'Home education compared with usual care' contradicts the provided source of truth.\n   - **Your text:** \"It may improve a child's quality of life (which describes their overall well-being).\"\n   - **The issue:** The 'SOURCE_OF_TRUTH' document, which is the basis for this draft, states the opposite: \"...and may have little to no effect on quality of life.\" This is a significant factual error and must be corrected to match the source.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"It may have little to no effect on a child's quality of life (which describes their overall well-being).\"\n\n2. **CRITICAL: Rephrase Subheadings as Questions**\n   - **The problem:** Two subheadings in the results section are statements, not questions, which violates the style guide.\n   - **Your text:** \"Home education compared with usual care\" and \"More-intensive compared with less-intensive home education\"\n   - **The issue:** The style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions to help guide the reader.\n   - **Suggested rewrites:**\n     - For the first, try: \"What happens when home education is compared with usual care?\"\n     - For the second, try: \"What is the difference between more-intensive and less-intensive home education?\"\n\n3. **Improve Clarity by Using More Verbs (Reduce Nominalization)**\n   - **The problem:** Some sentences rely heavily on nouns where verbs would be more direct and easier to read.\n   - **Your text:** \"Education is key to managing asthma. It helps children and their families understand the condition and learn skills to manage it themselves. These skills include using an inhaler correctly and avoiding things that can trigger an asthma attack. This education can happen in different places, including at home.\"\n   - **The issue:** This passage uses the noun \"education\" four times. Rewriting to use action verbs makes the text more engaging and less abstract for the reader.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"To manage asthma well, children and their families need good education. Educating families helps them understand asthma and learn how to manage it. For example, they can learn to use an inhaler correctly and avoid things that trigger asthma attacks. This teaching can happen in different places, including at home.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:**\nYour draft is very readable in terms of sentence length and word choice. However, the linguistic analysis supports the need for the third improvement, showing a very high number of 'nominalizations' (noun forms of verbs). The count is 34, which is significantly beyond the typical range for a PLS (where under 13 is common). Addressing this will make an already good draft even clearer for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable and conforms to typical patterns for most metrics, with 83% of features in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in its vocabulary, with high counts for nominalization (BEYOND_P90), nouns (P90), and long words (P90). This suggests the text may be overly formal and less action-oriented than ideal."
