  "draft": "For children with asthma, can education programs at home help them manage their condition and prevent asthma attacks?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is unclear if education programs delivered at home for children with asthma help to prevent serious asthma attacks (sudden worsening of symptoms requiring urgent medical care) compared to usual care. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of the education programs.\n- There is some evidence that more intensive home education programs may reduce the need for children to be admitted to the hospital for their asthma when compared with less intensive programs.\n- Because the education programs studied were very different from one another, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. Future research should aim to find out which parts of an education program are most important for children with asthma and their families.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is education for children important?\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. It is common in children worldwide. A key part of managing asthma is education, which helps children and their families understand the condition and learn self-management skills. These skills can include how to use an inhaler correctly and how to avoid things that can trigger an asthma attack. This education can be provided in different places, including at home. Giving education at home may help families who find it difficult to travel to clinics or hospitals and allows them to learn in a familiar environment.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective educational programs delivered at home are for children with asthma and their families. We wanted to know if these home-based programs were better than the usual care people receive or education delivered in other places, like a clinic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based asthma education for children and their families against usual care or less-intensive education. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nThe review included 26 studies with 5122 children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years with asthma. The studies compared face-to-face educational programs delivered in the home against usual care or less-intensive education programs. Researchers measured the main outcomes after six months.\n\nComparing home education to usual care, we found that home-based asthma education for children may make little to no difference to the number of asthma attacks or emergency department visits. It may also have little to no effect on quality of life.\n\nWhen we compared a more-intensive home education program to a less-intensive one, we found the more-intensive program may cause a large reduction in hospital admissions for asthma. However, it may make little to no difference to other asthma attacks, days missed from school, or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. First, people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting. Second, the studies included different types of people and used different ways to deliver the education. Finally, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it is not approved because of a consistent pattern of using complex noun phrases instead of simple verbs, which makes the text less direct and harder to read for a lay audience. The three key improvements below will make the findings much clearer.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Replace Noun Phrases with Action Verbs**\n\nYour sentences often use nouns to describe actions, which makes them feel abstract and academic. Using direct verbs will make your writing more engaging and easier to understand.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"...we found the more-intensive program may cause a large **reduction in hospital admissions** for asthma.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"cause a large reduction in\" is wordy and indirect. A simple verb is much clearer.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"...we found the more-intensive program may **greatly reduce hospital admissions** for asthma.\"\n\n**2. Simplify Complex Sentence Structures**\n\nSome sentences, especially in the key messages, start with long introductory clauses that delay the main point. Front-loading the key information helps readers grasp it immediately.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is unclear if education programs delivered at home for children with asthma help to prevent serious asthma attacks...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The most important information—that we are uncertain—is buried in the middle of the sentence.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are uncertain if home education programs help prevent serious asthma attacks. This is because of a lack of good-quality evidence.\"\n\n**3. Make the Limitations Clearer and More Direct**\n\nThe explanation of the evidence limitations is a bit vague. Using more direct language and explaining *why* something is a limitation will help readers understand the context.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"First, people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is phrased indirectly (\"may have been aware\") and doesn't explain why this awareness is a problem for the evidence.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"First, in many studies, families knew which type of education they were receiving, which could have influenced the results.\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:\n\nYour draft is very readable in terms of sentence length and word choice. However, the analysis confirms the stylistic issues noted above. The score for **nominalization** (using nouns for actions) is exceptionally high (37 instances, placing it 'Beyond the 90th percentile' for PLS texts). Addressing this single issue by converting these nouns back into verbs will significantly improve clarity and bring the text more in line with typical PLS standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns in most areas, with 83% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 10.03) and sentence length (17.6 words/sentence). However, there is a significant deviation in vocabulary style. The metric for 'nominalization' (37 instances) is beyond the 90th percentile, indicating an over-reliance on complex noun phrases instead of verbs. This is supported by high scores for 'nouns' and 'long_words' (both in the 90th percentile range), suggesting the text is denser and more abstract than typical for a PLS."
