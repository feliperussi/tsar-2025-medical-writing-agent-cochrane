  "draft": "For children with asthma, can education programs at home help them manage their condition and prevent asthma attacks?\n\nKey messages\n- We are uncertain if home education programs help prevent serious asthma attacks (when symptoms suddenly get worse and require urgent medical care) because there is not enough good-quality evidence. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- More intensive home education programs may reduce how often children are admitted to the hospital for asthma when compared with less intensive programs.\n- It is difficult to be certain about the results because the education programs in the studies were very different from one another. Future research should aim to find out which parts of an education program are most important for children with asthma and their families.\n\nWhat is asthma and why is education for children important?\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. It is common in children worldwide. To manage asthma well, children and their families need good education. Educating families helps them understand the condition and learn skills to manage it themselves. For example, they can learn to use an inhaler correctly and avoid things that can trigger an asthma attack. This teaching can happen in different places, including at home. Teaching families at home may help those who find it difficult to travel to clinics or hospitals, and it allows them to learn in a familiar place.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if home-based education programs help children with asthma and their families. We wanted to know if these programs were better than the usual care people receive or education delivered in other places, like a clinic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based asthma education for children and their families against usual care or less-intensive education. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nThe review included 26 studies with 5122 children and adolescents with asthma, aged 1 to 18 years. The studies compared face-to-face educational programs delivered in the home against either usual care or less-intensive education programs. Researchers measured the main results after 6 months.\n\nWhat happens when home education is compared with usual care?\nCompared to usual care, asthma education at home may make little to no difference to the number of asthma attacks or emergency department visits. It may have little to no effect on a child's quality of life (which describes their overall well-being). However, we have very little confidence in the evidence, so we are uncertain about these effects.\n\nWhat is the difference between more-intensive and less-intensive home education?\nA more-intensive home education program may greatly reduce how often children are admitted to the hospital for asthma compared to a less-intensive program. However, it may make little to no difference to other asthma attacks, days missed from school, or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, in many studies, families knew which type of education they were receiving, which could have affected the results. Second, the studies included different types of people and used different ways to teach them, making it hard to compare the results. Finally, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

The following suggestions focus on making the language more direct and active to further improve readability for patients and their families.\n\n1. **Use active verbs instead of noun phrases.**\nSome sentences are noun-heavy, which can make them feel abstract and harder to read. Changing these nouns back into verbs makes the writing more direct.\n- **Original sentence:** \"Compared to usual care, asthma education at home may make little to no difference to the number of asthma attacks or emergency department visits.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"the number of asthma attacks or emergency department visits\" is indirect.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Compared to usual care, asthma education at home may not change **how often children have asthma attacks or visit the emergency department**.\"\n\n2. **Simplify wordy phrases and complex terms.**\nWhile the readability scores are good, some phrases could be more concise and use more common words to help readers understand the information more quickly.\n- **Original sentence:** \"A more-intensive home education program may greatly reduce how often children are admitted to the hospital for asthma...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"how often children are admitted to the hospital\" is wordy.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"A more-intensive home education program may greatly reduce **hospital admissions for asthma**...\"\n\n3. **Ensure key terms are used consistently.**\nIn the 'Key messages', you clearly define \"serious asthma attacks\". However, this specific term isn't used in the results section, which could confuse readers.\n- **The issue:** The 'Key messages' section defines \"serious asthma attacks (when symptoms suddenly get worse and require urgent medical care)\", but the results section refers more generically to \"asthma attacks or emergency department visits.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** A reader might not realize these refer to the same important outcome, causing confusion about what the evidence actually shows.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** To improve clarity, use the same terminology in the results. For example: \"...may make little to no difference in how often children have **serious asthma attacks that require a visit to the emergency department**.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns in many areas, with 77.8% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence length. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence structure. Key metrics needing attention are nominalization (BEYOND_P90), which indicates sentences could be more direct by using verbs instead of nouns, and the number of nouns, complex words, and long words (all in the P90 range), suggesting the language could be simplified further."
