  "draft": "How well does infliximab work for keeping Crohn's disease in remission and what are its side effects?\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n– For people with Crohn's disease, infliximab probably helps keep the disease in remission (a period when symptoms are reduced or gone) better than a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n– Infliximab also probably works better when added to another type of medicine called a purine analogue (which also reduces inflammation) than when that medicine is used alone.\n– We do not have enough good-quality evidence to be certain about the side effects of infliximab. More studies are needed to compare infliximab with other treatments and to better understand its side effects.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease?\nCrohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation in the digestive system. It happens when the body makes too much of a substance called tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). This leads to inflammation, which can cause pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness. Treatment aims to reduce inflammation and keep the disease in remission, which is a period when symptoms are reduced or gone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nInfliximab is a medicine that blocks TNF-α to control inflammation. We wanted to find out how well infliximab works to keep Crohn's disease in remission after initial treatment controls symptoms, and what side effects it might cause.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with a placebo or other medicines for keeping Crohn's disease in remission. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that included a total of 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies took place between 1999 and 2022. Most studies included people who had not used this type of medicine (called biologics) before. One study focused on people with a specific type of Crohn's disease that causes fistulas (abnormal tunnels between the gut and other body parts).\n\nThe studies compared infliximab with:\n– a placebo (a dummy treatment);\n– other medicines (purine analogues or adalimumab); and\n– a biosimilar (a medicine that is very similar to infliximab).\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a placebo, infliximab probably reduces the chance of symptoms returning (a relapse). For every 5 people who take infliximab instead of a placebo, 1 fewer person experiences a relapse.\n\nCombining infliximab with another medicine (a purine analogue) probably leads to far fewer relapses than using the purine analogue alone. For every 100 people treated with a purine analogue alone, 59 experienced a relapse. This number dropped to 12 when infliximab was added.\n\nCompared to a biosimilar version, infliximab may make little to no difference to the chance of a relapse or the risk of serious side effects. However, infliximab may slightly increase the chance that the treatment stops working over time. It may also lead to many more people stopping treatment because of side effects.\n\nFor all comparisons, we are uncertain about infliximab's effect on side effects because the evidence is unclear. We also do not know how infliximab compares to another medicine called adalimumab, or if the way a biosimilar is given (under the skin or into a vein) affects how well it works or its side effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. This is because not all studies provided the data we needed, and there were too few studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to June 2023.",

However, several improvements are needed to reduce the text's complexity and make it easier for a lay audience to read.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex words and phrases.** Some sentences contain technical terms or wordy phrasing that could be simplified for clarity.\n   - **Example:** \"Infliximab also probably works better when added to another type of medicine called a purine analogue (which also reduces inflammation) than when that medicine is used alone.\"\n   - **Problem:** The definition is a bit clunky and the sentence is long.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"Infliximab also probably works better when combined with another anti-inflammatory medicine (called a purine analogue) than when the purine analogue is used alone.\"\n\n2. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun-heavy phrases.** The draft often uses nouns where a verb would be more direct and easier to read. This is sometimes called 'nominalization'.\n   - **Example:** \"Treatment aims to reduce inflammation and keep the disease in remission...\"\n   - **Problem:** This construction is less direct than using a simple verb.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"The goal of treatment is to reduce this inflammation and keep the disease in remission...\"\n\n3. **Make the limitations more specific and understandable.** The explanation for why the evidence is low-confidence is a bit vague.\n   - **Example:** \"This is because not all studies provided the data we needed, and there were too few studies to be certain about the results.\"\n   - **Problem:** This doesn't fully explain the issue to a reader. Why were there not enough data or studies?\n   - **Suggestion:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low. This is because some studies were small or had limitations in their methods, which makes the results less certain. Also, not all studies reported on the side effects we were interested in.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis. While the sentence length is good, the draft has a higher number of complex words, long words, and noun-based phrases (`nominalization`) than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, indicating its vocabulary is unnecessarily dense.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the summary has excellent sentence-level readability, with most readability scores falling in the best quartile (P25/P75). However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. The metrics for `nominalization`, `nouns`, `complex_words_dc`, `complex_words`, and `long_words` all fall in the P90 range. This indicates the text is denser and uses more technical or abstract vocabulary than is typical, which could be simplified to improve reader understanding."
