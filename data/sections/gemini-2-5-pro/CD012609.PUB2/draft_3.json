  "draft": "How infliximab helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission and what side effects it may cause\n\nKey messages\n– For people with Crohn's disease, infliximab probably helps to keep the disease in remission (a period when symptoms are reduced or gone) better than a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n– Infliximab also seems to work better when added to another type of medicine (called a purine analogue) than when that medicine is used alone.\n– We do not have enough good-quality evidence to be certain about the side effects of infliximab. More studies are needed to compare infliximab with other treatments and to better understand its side effects.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease?\nCrohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation in the digestive system. It happens when the body makes too much of a substance called tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). This leads to inflammation, which can cause pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness. The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation and keep the disease in remission.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nInfliximab is a medicine that blocks TNF-α to control inflammation. We wanted to find out how well infliximab works to keep Crohn's disease in remission after other treatments have already controlled the symptoms. We also wanted to know about its safety.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with a placebo or other medicines for keeping Crohn's disease in remission. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that included a total of 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies took place between 1999 and 2022. Most studies included people who had not used this type of medicine (called biologics) before. One study focused on people with a specific type of Crohn's disease that causes abnormal tunnels to form between the gut and other parts of the body.\n\nThe studies compared infliximab with:\n– a placebo (a dummy treatment);\n– other medicines (purine analogues or adalimumab); and\n– a biosimilar (a medicine that is very similar to infliximab).\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a placebo, infliximab probably reduces the chance of symptoms returning (a relapse). For every 5 people treated with infliximab instead of a placebo, 1 fewer person will have a relapse.\n\nCombining infliximab with another medicine (a purine analogue) probably reduces relapses by a large amount compared to using the purine analogue alone. Out of 100 people treated with a purine analogue alone, 59 had a relapse. This dropped to 12 out of 100 people when infliximab was added.\n\nCompared to a biosimilar version, infliximab may make little to no difference to the chance of a relapse or the risk of serious side effects. However, infliximab may slightly increase the chance that the treatment stops working over time. It may also cause more people to stop treatment because of side effects.\n\nFor all comparisons, we are uncertain if infliximab affects the number of side effects because the evidence was not clear. We also do not know how infliximab compares to another medicine called adalimumab, or if giving a biosimilar in different ways (under the skin versus into a vein) changes the results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. This is because not all studies provided information on all the effects we were interested in, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to June 2023.",

However, to make it even clearer for readers, I recommend focusing on 3 key areas before approval.\n\nHere are my top suggestions:\n\n1.  **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** This makes your sentences more active and easier to understand. *   **Problem:** \"The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation and keep the disease in remission.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite this to be more direct. For example: \"Treatment aims to reduce inflammation and keep the disease in remission.\"\n\n2.  **Clarify vague wording in the results.** Some phrases could be more specific to help readers understand the exact meaning.\n    *   **Problem:** \"...or if giving a biosimilar in different ways (under the skin versus into a vein) changes the results.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Specify what \"results\" might change. For example: \"...or if the way a biosimilar is given (under the skin or into a vein) affects how well it works or its side effects.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify some phrasing for better flow.** A few sentences are slightly wordy and could be more concise.\n    *   **Problem:** \"We wanted to find out how well infliximab works to keep Crohn's disease in remission after other treatments have already controlled the symptoms.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** This can be shortened without losing meaning. For example: \"We wanted to find out how well infliximab works to keep Crohn's disease in remission after initial symptoms are under control.\"\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which noted a high number of nouns and nominalizations (verbs turned into nouns). Addressing these points will make an already good summary even more accessible.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS draft shows strong conformity with typical patterns in readability and sentence length, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence structure, with high counts for nominalizations, nouns, complex words, and long words (all in the P90 range). This suggests that while sentences are short and readable, the word choice and sentence construction could be more direct and simple to improve overall clarity."
