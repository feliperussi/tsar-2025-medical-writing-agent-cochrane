  "draft": "How infliximab helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission and what side effects it may cause\n\nKey messages\n- For people with Crohn's disease, treatment with infliximab probably helps to keep the disease in remission (a period when symptoms are reduced or disappear) better than a placebo (a dummy treatment). It also seems to work better when added to another type of medicine (purine analogues) than when those medicines are used alone. However, we did not find enough good-quality evidence to be certain about its side effects.\n- Future studies are needed to compare infliximab directly with other available treatments for Crohn's disease and to better understand its potential unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease?\nCrohn's disease is a long-term condition where parts of the digestive system become inflamed. This happens when the body produces too much of a substance called tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which leads to inflammation. This can cause symptoms like pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness. Treatment aims to reduce the inflammation and keep the disease in remission, which is a period when symptoms are gone or much better.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nInfliximab is a medicine that works by blocking TNF-α to control inflammation. We wanted to find out how effective and safe infliximab is for keeping people with Crohn's disease in remission after their symptoms have already been brought under control by other medical treatments.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or other medicines for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies with a total of 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies were conducted between 1999 and 2022. 4 studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, 2 had a mix of commercial and public funding, and 2 had public funding. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 69 years. Most studies included people who were new to biologic treatments, while 2 included a mix of new and experienced patients. One study focused specifically on people with fistulating Crohn's disease (where abnormal tunnels form between the gut and other parts of the body). The studies compared infliximab to a placebo (a dummy treatment), other medicines (purine analogues or adalimumab), and a biosimilar version of infliximab.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nFor people with Crohn's disease, treatment with infliximab probably reduces the chance of symptoms returning (a relapse) compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment). For every 5 people treated with infliximab instead of a placebo, 1 fewer person will experience a relapse.\n\nCombining infliximab with another type of medicine (purine analogues) probably reduces relapses significantly compared to using purine analogues alone. For every 100 people treated with purine analogues alone, 59 experienced a relapse, compared to only 12 out of 100 people who also received infliximab.\n\nWhen comparing infliximab to a biosimilar version, infliximab may make little to no difference to the chance of a relapse or the risk of serious side effects. However, infliximab may slightly increase the chance that the treatment stops working over time and may cause more people to stop treatment due to side effects.\n\nFor all comparisons, it is unclear if infliximab affects the number of people who experience side effects because the evidence is very uncertain. We also do not know how infliximab compares to another medicine called adalimumab, or how different ways of giving a biosimilar (under the skin versus into a vein) affect symptoms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. Not all studies provided data for all the outcomes we were interested in. There were also not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to June 2023.",

Addressing these points will make the summary much clearer and more accessible for patients and their families.",

However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Six metrics, including 'nominalization', 'complex_words', 'long_words', and 'smog_index', are in the 90th percentile, indicating the text uses more complex, multi-syllable words and noun-heavy phrases than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This supports the need to simplify vocabulary and sentence structures."
