  "draft": "How infliximab helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission and what side effects it may cause\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n– For people with Crohn's disease, infliximab probably helps keep the disease in remission better than a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n– Infliximab also probably works better when combined with another anti-inflammatory medicine (called a purine analogue) than when the purine analogue is used alone.\n– We do not have enough good-quality evidence to be certain about the side effects of infliximab. More studies are needed to compare infliximab with other treatments and to better understand its side effects.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease?\nCrohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation in the digestive system. It happens when the body makes too much of a substance called tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). This leads to inflammation, which can cause pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness. The goal of treatment is to reduce this inflammation and keep the disease in remission, which is a period when symptoms are reduced or gone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nInfliximab is a medicine that blocks TNF-α to control inflammation. We wanted to find out how well infliximab works to keep Crohn's disease in remission after initial treatment controls symptoms, and what side effects it might cause.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with a placebo or other medicines for keeping Crohn's disease in remission. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that included a total of 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies took place between 1999 and 2022. Most studies included people who had not used a type of medicine called a biologic before. Biologics are complex medicines made from living sources. One study focused on people with a specific type of Crohn's disease that causes fistulas (abnormal tunnels between the gut and other body parts).\n\nThe studies compared infliximab with:\n– a placebo (a dummy treatment);\n– other medicines (purine analogues or adalimumab); and\n– a biosimilar (a medicine that is very similar to infliximab).\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a placebo, infliximab probably reduces the chance of symptoms returning (a relapse). For every 5 people who take infliximab instead of a placebo, 1 fewer person experiences a relapse.\n\nCombining infliximab with another medicine (a purine analogue) probably leads to far fewer relapses than using the purine analogue alone. For every 100 people treated with a purine analogue alone, 59 experienced a relapse. This number dropped to 12 when infliximab was added.\n\nCompared to a biosimilar version, infliximab may make little to no difference to the chance of a relapse or the risk of serious side effects. However, infliximab may slightly increase the chance that the treatment stops working over time. It may also lead to many more people stopping treatment because of side effects.\n\nFor all comparisons, we are uncertain about infliximab's effect on side effects because the evidence is unclear. We also do not know how infliximab compares to another medicine called adalimumab, or if the way a biosimilar is given (under the skin or into a vein) affects how well it works or its side effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because some studies were small or had limitations in their methods, which makes the results less certain. Also, not all studies reported on the side effects we were interested in.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it can be made significantly clearer for a lay audience by simplifying some of the vocabulary and sentence structures. The main issues are the use of technical-sounding language (even when defined), some overly long sentences that combine multiple ideas, and a vague explanation of the evidence's limitations. Addressing these points will make the summary much more accessible.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Simplify technical language and define key concepts more clearly.** Some terms, while accurate, can be intimidating for readers. Explaining them in simpler terms first can improve understanding.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"It happens when the body makes too much of a substance called tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). This leads to inflammation, which can cause pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The full name 'tumour necrosis factor-alpha' is complex medical jargon. The concept of 'inflammation' is central but is not defined.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"It happens when the body makes too much of a substance called TNF-alpha. Too much TNF-alpha causes inflammation (swelling and irritation) in the digestive system, which leads to symptoms like pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness.\"\n\n2.  **Break up long sentences that contain multiple, distinct ideas.** This helps readers process one piece of information at a time.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"We also do not know how infliximab compares to another medicine called adalimumab, or if the way a biosimilar is given (under the skin or into a vein) affects how well it works or its side effects.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** This single sentence asks the reader to consider two separate and complex uncertainties: a comparison with one drug (adalimumab) and the delivery method of another (biosimilar).\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We do not know how infliximab compares to another medicine called adalimumab. We also don't know if giving a biosimilar in different ways (under the skin or into a vein) changes how well it works or the side effects it causes.\"\n\n3.  **Make the limitations of the evidence more concrete.** Vague explanations for why evidence is uncertain can undermine trust and understanding.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"This is because some studies were small or had limitations in their methods, which makes the results less certain.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The phrase 'limitations in their methods' is jargon. It doesn't explain to a patient *why* the results are less trustworthy.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low. This is because some studies included only a small number of people. We also had concerns about how some of the studies were carried out. These issues make the results less reliable.\"\n\nAddressing these points will greatly improve the clarity and readability of the summary for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns in many areas, particularly with excellent sentence length (17.86 words/sentence) and overall readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9.76), which fall in the best quartile. However, the analysis also flags significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics are in the P90 range, indicating the text is heavier than usual in its use of nominalizations (22), nouns (177), complex words (120), and long words (184). This suggests that while sentences are short, the word choice within them could be simplified to improve accessibility."
