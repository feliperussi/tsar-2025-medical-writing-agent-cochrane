  "draft": "How infliximab helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission and what side effects it may cause\n\nKey messages\n– For people with Crohn's disease, infliximab probably keeps the disease in remission (a period when symptoms are reduced or gone) better than a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n– Infliximab also probably works better when added to another type of medicine (a purine analogue) than when that medicine is used alone.\n– We do not have enough good-quality evidence to be certain about the side effects of infliximab. More studies are needed to compare infliximab with other treatments and to better understand its side effects.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease?\nCrohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation in the digestive system. It happens when the body makes too much of a substance called tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). This leads to inflammation, which can cause pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness. Treatment aims to reduce inflammation and keep the disease in remission.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nInfliximab is a medicine that blocks TNF-α to control inflammation. We wanted to find out how well infliximab works to keep Crohn's disease in remission after initial treatment controls symptoms. We also wanted to know about its safety.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with a placebo or other medicines for keeping Crohn's disease in remission. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that included a total of 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies took place between 1999 and 2022. Most studies included people who had not used this type of medicine (called biologics) before. One study focused on people with a specific type of Crohn's disease that causes abnormal tunnels to form between the gut and other parts of the body.\n\nThe studies compared infliximab with:\n– a placebo (a dummy treatment);\n– other medicines (purine analogues or adalimumab); and\n– a biosimilar (a medicine that is very similar to infliximab).\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a placebo, infliximab probably reduces the chance of symptoms returning (a relapse). For every 5 people treated with infliximab instead of a placebo, 1 fewer person will have a relapse.\n\nCombining infliximab with another medicine (a purine analogue) probably reduces relapses by a large amount compared to using the purine analogue alone. Out of 100 people treated with a purine analogue alone, 59 had a relapse. This dropped to 12 out of 100 people when infliximab was added.\n\nCompared to a biosimilar version, infliximab may make little to no difference to the chance of a relapse or the risk of serious side effects. However, infliximab may slightly increase the chance that the treatment stops working over time. It may also cause more people to stop treatment because of side effects.\n\nFor all comparisons, we are uncertain if infliximab affects the number of side effects because the evidence was not clear. We also do not know how infliximab compares to another medicine called adalimumab, or if the way a biosimilar is given (under the skin or into a vein) affects how well it works or its side effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because not all studies provided information on all the effects we were interested in, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear and well-structured. However, it needs a few revisions to meet our guidelines and improve clarity for readers before it can be approved.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n\n*   **Subheading Format:** One subheading does not follow the required question format. According to our style guide, all subheadings must be phrased as questions to guide the reader.\n    *   **Problem:** \"Key messages\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change this to \"What are the key messages of this review?\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Define Technical Terms:** The summary uses the term \"purine analogue\" multiple times without explaining what it is. This could confuse readers who are not familiar with this specific class of medication.\n    *   **Problem:** \"Infliximab also probably works better when added to another type of medicine (a purine analogue) than when that medicine is used alone.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Add a brief, simple explanation the first time you use the term. For example: \"...when added to another type of medicine called a purine analogue (which also reduces inflammation) than when that medicine is used alone.\"\n\n2.  **Improve Accuracy of Findings:** The summary slightly downplays a key finding about side effects. The original evidence indicates a \"large increase\" in people stopping treatment, which is more significant than the draft's wording suggests.\n    *   **Problem:** \"It may also cause more people to stop treatment because of side effects.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Revise this to more accurately reflect the source data's magnitude. For example: \"It may also cause a large increase in the number of people who stop treatment because of side effects.\"\n\n3.  **Use More Direct, Active Language:** Some sentences are noun-heavy and use abstract phrasing, which can make them harder to understand. Using more direct verbs makes the text more engaging and clear.\n    *   **Problem:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low. This is because not all studies provided information on all the effects we were interested in...\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite this using a more active, first-person voice, which is also recommended in our style guide. For example: \"We have low confidence in the evidence. This is because not all studies provided information on everything we were interested in...\"\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of complex words and noun-forms ('nominalizations') compared to typical Plain Language Summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows that while the draft has excellent readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9.3) and good sentence length (17 words/sentence), it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure. Specifically, the counts for complex words (P90), long words (P90), nouns (P90), and nominalizations (P90) are unusually high. This suggests that replacing technical terms and converting noun-heavy phrases into verb-led actions would better align the text with plain language best practices."
