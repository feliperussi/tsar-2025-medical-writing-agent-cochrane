  "draft": "How infliximab helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission and what side effects it may cause\n\nKey messages\n- For people with Crohn's disease, treatment with infliximab probably helps to keep the disease in remission (a period when symptoms are reduced or disappear) better than a placebo (a dummy treatment). It also seems to work better when added to another type of medicine (purine analogues) than when those medicines are used alone. However, we did not find enough good-quality evidence to be certain about its side effects.\n- Future studies are needed to compare infliximab directly with other available treatments for Crohn's disease and to better understand its potential unwanted effects.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is Crohn's disease?\nCrohn's disease is a long-term condition where parts of the digestive system become inflamed. This happens when the body produces too much of a substance called tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which leads to inflammation. This can cause symptoms like pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness. Treatment aims to reduce the inflammation and keep the disease in remission, which is a period when symptoms are gone or much better.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nInfliximab is a medicine that works by blocking TNF-α to control inflammation. We wanted to find out how effective and safe infliximab is for keeping people with Crohn's disease in remission after their symptoms have already been brought under control by other medical treatments.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or other medicines for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found nine studies with a total of 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies were conducted between 1999 and 2022. Four studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, two had a mix of commercial and public funding, and two had public funding. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 69 years. Most studies included people who were new to biologic treatments, while two included a mix of new and experienced patients. One study focused specifically on people with fistulating Crohn's disease. The studies compared infliximab to a placebo (a dummy treatment), other medicines (purine analogues or adalimumab), and a biosimilar version of infliximab.\n\nMain results: infliximab for preventing relapse in people with Crohn's disease\nFor people with Crohn's disease, treatment with infliximab probably reduces the chance of symptoms returning (a relapse) compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment). For every 5 people treated with infliximab instead of a placebo, one fewer person will experience a relapse.\n\nCombining infliximab with another type of medicine (purine analogues) probably causes a large reduction in relapses compared to using purine analogues alone. For every 100 people treated with purine analogues alone, 59 experienced a relapse, compared to only 12 out of 100 people who also received infliximab.\n\nWhen comparing infliximab to a biosimilar version, infliximab may make little to no difference to the chance of a relapse or the risk of serious side effects. However, infliximab may slightly increase the chance of the treatment losing its effect over time and may cause a large increase in the number of people who stop treatment due to side effects.\n\nFor all comparisons, it is unclear if infliximab has an effect on the number of people who experience side effects because the evidence is very uncertain. We also do not know how infliximab compares to another medicine called adalimumab, or how different ways of giving a biosimilar (under the skin versus into a vein) affect symptoms.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it requires revisions before approval. A critical issue is that several subheadings do not follow the required question format outlined in the style guide. Additionally, the text uses some technical language and complex phrasing that could be simplified for a lay audience. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing high scores for complex and long words.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires subheadings to be questions to guide the reader. This needs to be applied consistently.\n   - **Problem:** Headings like \"Methods\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", and \"Currency of the evidence\" are not questions.\n   - **Suggestion:** Change them to \"How did we conduct this review?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", and \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n2. **Explain or replace technical terms.** To ensure all readers understand, technical terms should be defined simply.\n   - **Problem:** The term \"fistulating\" is used without explanation in the sentence: \"One study focused specifically on people with fistulating Crohn's disease.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Add a brief, simple definition. For example: \"One study focused specifically on people with fistulating Crohn's disease (where abnormal tunnels form between the gut and other parts of the body).\"\n\n3. **Simplify complex and noun-heavy sentences.** Some sentences use noun forms of verbs ('nominalizations') and extra words that make them harder to read. Using direct verbs makes the text clearer.\n   - **Problem:** The sentence \"Combining infliximab with another type of medicine (purine analogues) probably causes a large reduction in relapses...\" is a bit wordy.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite using a more direct verb. For example: \"Combining infliximab with another type of medicine (purine analogues) probably reduces relapses significantly...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While many readability and structure metrics are within the median or best quartile ranges, there is a significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics, including `long_words` (Beyond P90), `complex_words` (P90), `smog_index` (P90), and `nominalization` (P90), are much higher than is typical for a PLS. This indicates the text relies too heavily on long, technical, and abstract words, which supports the editorial recommendation to simplify vocabulary and sentence structures."
