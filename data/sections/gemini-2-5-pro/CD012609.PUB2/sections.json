  "key_messages": [
    "For people with Crohn's disease, treatment with infliximab probably helps to keep the disease in remission (a period when symptoms are reduced or disappear) better than a placebo (a dummy treatment). It also seems to work better when added to another type of medicine (purine analogues) than when those medicines are used alone. However, we did not find enough good-quality evidence to be certain about its side effects.",
    "Future studies are needed to compare infliximab directly with other available treatments for Crohn's disease and to better understand its potential unwanted effects."

      "subheading": "What is Crohn's disease?",
      "content": "Crohn's disease is a long-term condition where parts of the digestive system become inflamed. This happens when the body produces too much of a substance called tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which leads to inflammation. This can cause symptoms like pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness. Treatment aims to reduce the inflammation and keep the disease in remission, which is a period when symptoms are gone or much better."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "Infliximab is a medicine that works by blocking TNF-α to control inflammation. We wanted to find out how effective and safe infliximab is for keeping people with Crohn's disease in remission after their symptoms have already been brought under control by other medical treatments."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found nine studies with a total of 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies were conducted between 1999 and 2022. Four studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, two had a mix of commercial and public funding, and two had public funding. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 69 years. Most studies included people who were new to biologic treatments, while two included a mix of new and experienced patients. One study focused specifically on people with fistulating Crohn's disease. The studies compared infliximab to a placebo (a dummy treatment), other medicines (purine analogues or adalimumab), and a biosimilar version of infliximab."

      "subheading": "Main results: infliximab for preventing relapse in people with Crohn's disease",
      "content": "For people with Crohn's disease, treatment with infliximab probably reduces the chance of symptoms returning (a relapse) compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment). For every 5 people treated with infliximab instead of a placebo, one fewer person will experience a relapse.\n\nCombining infliximab with another type of medicine (purine analogues) probably causes a large reduction in relapses compared to using purine analogues alone. For every 100 people treated with purine analogues alone, 59 experienced a relapse, compared to only 12 out of 100 people who also received infliximab.\n\nWhen comparing infliximab to a biosimilar version, infliximab may make little to no difference to the chance of a relapse or the risk of serious side effects. However, infliximab may slightly increase the chance of the treatment losing its effect over time and may cause a large increase in the number of people who stop treatment due to side effects.\n\nFor all comparisons, it is unclear if infliximab has an effect on the number of people who experience side effects because the evidence is very uncertain. We also do not know how infliximab compares to another medicine called adalimumab, or how different ways of giving a biosimilar (under the skin versus into a vein) affect symptoms."
