  "draft": "How infliximab helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission and what side effects it may cause\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n– For people with Crohn's disease, infliximab probably helps keep the disease in remission better than a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n– Infliximab also probably works better when combined with another anti-inflammatory medicine (called a purine analogue) than when the purine analogue is used alone.\n– We do not have enough good-quality evidence to be certain about the side effects of infliximab. More studies are needed to compare infliximab with other treatments and to better understand its side effects.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease?\nCrohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation (swelling and irritation) in the digestive system. It happens when the body makes too much of a substance called TNF-alpha. This leads to symptoms like pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness. The goal of treatment is to reduce this inflammation and keep the disease in remission, which is a period when symptoms are reduced or gone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nInfliximab is a medicine that blocks TNF-alpha to control inflammation. We wanted to find out how well infliximab works to keep Crohn's disease in remission after initial treatment controls symptoms, and what side effects it might cause.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with a placebo or other medicines for keeping Crohn's disease in remission. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that included a total of 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies took place between 1999 and 2022. Most studies included people who had not used a type of medicine called a biologic before. Biologics are complex medicines made from living sources. One study focused on people with a specific type of Crohn's disease that causes fistulas (abnormal tunnels between the gut and other body parts).\n\nThe studies compared infliximab with:\n– a placebo (a dummy treatment);\n– other medicines (purine analogues or adalimumab); and\n– a biosimilar (a medicine that is very similar to infliximab).\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a placebo, infliximab probably reduces the chance of symptoms returning (a relapse). For every 5 people who take infliximab instead of a placebo, 1 fewer person experiences a relapse.\n\nCombining infliximab with another medicine (a purine analogue) probably leads to far fewer relapses than using the purine analogue alone. For every 100 people treated with a purine analogue alone, 59 experienced a relapse. This number dropped to 12 when infliximab was added.\n\nCompared to a biosimilar version, infliximab may make little to no difference to the chance of a relapse or the risk of serious side effects. However, infliximab may slightly increase the chance that the treatment stops working over time. It may also lead to many more people stopping treatment because of side effects.\n\nFor all comparisons, we are uncertain about infliximab's effect on side effects because the evidence is unclear. We do not know how infliximab compares to another medicine called adalimumab. We also don't know if giving a biosimilar in different ways (under the skin or into a vein) changes how well it works or the side effects it causes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because some studies included only a small number of people. We also had concerns about how some of the studies were carried out. These issues make the results less reliable. Also, not all studies reported on the side effects we were interested in.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. The readability scores are excellent. However, a few improvements are needed to fully meet Cochrane standards and enhance clarity for readers. The main issues are a pattern of using complex nouns instead of simpler verbs, some repeated jargon, and a title that should be rephrased as a question.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase the main title as a question.**\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"How infliximab helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission and what side effects it may cause\"\n    *   **Reason:** The style guide recommends phrasing titles and headings as questions to engage the reader. Your subheadings follow this rule, but the main title does not.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"How well does infliximab work for keeping Crohn's disease in remission and what are its side effects?\"\n\n2.  **Use more active verbs instead of abstract nouns (nominalizations).**\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"The goal of treatment is to reduce this inflammation and keep the disease in remission...\"\n    *   **Reason:** Using nouns like \"treatment\" and \"inflammation\" instead of verbs makes the writing less direct. This pattern is reflected in the evaluation results, which show high use of nouns and nominalizations.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The goal of treating Crohn's disease is to reduce this swelling and keep the disease in remission...\"\n\n3.  **Simplify repeated technical terms after they are defined.**\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"...probably leads to far fewer relapses than using the purine analogue alone.\"\n    *   **Reason:** You do a good job defining \"purine analogue\" as an \"anti-inflammatory medicine.\" However, repeating the technical term makes the text feel more clinical. Once defined, you can use the simpler term.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...probably leads to far fewer relapses than using the anti-inflammatory medicine alone.\"\n\n4.  **Make the description of limitations more specific.**\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"We also had concerns about how some of the studies were carried out.\"\n    *   **Reason:** This phrase is too vague for a reader to understand the nature of the problem. Being slightly more specific adds valuable transparency.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We were also concerned that the methods used in some studies could have made the results less reliable.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows this draft has excellent readability, with all 8 readability indices falling in the best quartile (P25). Sentence length is also ideal. However, the analysis identified significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and word choice. Five metrics were in the P90 range: `nominalization` (22.0), `nouns` (180.0), `complex_words_dc` (239.0), `complex_words` (120.0), and `long_words` (188.0). This indicates a pattern of using abstract nouns, technical terms, and long words more frequently than is typical, which can make the text feel dense despite its good readability scores."
