  "draft": "How infliximab helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission and what side effects it may cause\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n– For people with Crohn's disease, infliximab probably keeps the disease in remission (a period when symptoms are reduced or gone) better than a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n– Infliximab also probably works better when added to another type of medicine called a purine analogue (which also reduces inflammation) than when that medicine is used alone.\n– We do not have enough good-quality evidence to be certain about the side effects of infliximab. More studies are needed to compare infliximab with other treatments and to better understand its side effects.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease?\nCrohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation in the digestive system. It happens when the body makes too much of a substance called tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). This leads to inflammation, which can cause pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness. Treatment aims to reduce inflammation and keep the disease in remission, which is a period when symptoms are gone or much better.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nInfliximab is a medicine that blocks TNF-α to control inflammation. We wanted to find out how well infliximab works to keep Crohn's disease in remission after initial treatment controls symptoms. We also wanted to know about its safety.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with a placebo or other medicines for keeping Crohn's disease in remission. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that included a total of 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies took place between 1999 and 2022. Most studies included people who had not used this type of medicine (called biologics) before. One study focused on people with a specific type of Crohn's disease that causes abnormal tunnels to form between the gut and other parts of the body.\n\nThe studies compared infliximab with:\n– a placebo (a dummy treatment);\n– other medicines (purine analogues or adalimumab); and\n– a biosimilar (a medicine that is very similar to infliximab).\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a placebo, infliximab probably reduces the chance of symptoms returning (a relapse). For every 5 people treated with infliximab instead of a placebo, 1 fewer person will have a relapse.\n\nCombining infliximab with another medicine (a purine analogue) probably reduces relapses by a large amount compared to using the purine analogue alone. Out of 100 people treated with a purine analogue alone, 59 had a relapse. This dropped to 12 out of 100 people when infliximab was added.\n\nCompared to a biosimilar version, infliximab may make little to no difference to the chance of a relapse or the risk of serious side effects. However, infliximab may slightly increase the chance that the treatment stops working over time. It may also cause a large increase in the number of people who stop treatment because of side effects.\n\nFor all comparisons, we are uncertain if infliximab affects the number of side effects because the evidence was not clear. We also do not know how infliximab compares to another medicine called adalimumab, or if the way a biosimilar is given (under the skin or into a vein) affects how well it works or its side effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. This is because not all studies provided information on everything we were interested in, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to June 2023.",

The main title must be rephrased as a question to meet style guidelines. Additionally, several sentences could be more direct and active. Specifically, the draft should (1) rephrase the main title as a question, (2) replace indirect phrases with more direct verbs, (3) convert passive voice to active voice for key results, and (4) ensure the definition of 'remission' is consistent throughout the text.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft conforms well to many typical PLS patterns, particularly in readability and sentence length, with 72% of features falling in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence construction, with high scores (P90) for nominalization (24), nouns (174), complex words (120), and long words (179). This suggests that while sentences are short, the word choice within them is often unnecessarily complex and noun-heavy, supporting the need for more direct, verb-driven language."
