  "draft": "How well does infliximab work for keeping Crohn's disease in remission and what are its side effects?\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n– For people with Crohn's disease, infliximab probably helps keep the disease in remission better than a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n– Infliximab also probably works better when combined with another anti-inflammatory medicine (called a purine analogue) than when the anti-inflammatory medicine is used alone.\n– We do not have enough good-quality evidence to be certain about the side effects of infliximab. More studies are needed to compare infliximab with other treatments and to better understand its side effects.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease?\nCrohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation (swelling and irritation) in the digestive system. It happens when the body makes too much of a substance called TNF-alpha. This leads to symptoms like pain, diarrhoea, and tiredness. The goal when treating Crohn's disease is to reduce this swelling and keep the disease in remission, which is a period when symptoms are reduced or gone.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nInfliximab is a medicine that blocks TNF-alpha to control the swelling. We wanted to find out how well infliximab works to keep Crohn's disease in remission after symptoms are already under control, and what side effects it might cause.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with a placebo or other medicines for keeping Crohn's disease in remission. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that included a total of 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies took place between 1999 and 2022. Most studies included people who had not used a type of medicine called a biologic before. Biologics are complex medicines made from living sources. One study focused on people with a specific type of Crohn's disease that causes fistulas (abnormal tunnels between the gut and other body parts).\n\nThe studies compared infliximab with:\n– a placebo (a dummy treatment);\n– other medicines (purine analogues or adalimumab); and\n– a biosimilar (a medicine that is very similar to infliximab).\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a placebo, infliximab probably reduces the chance of symptoms returning (a relapse). For every 5 people who take infliximab instead of a placebo, 1 fewer person experiences a relapse.\n\nCombining infliximab with another anti-inflammatory medicine (a purine analogue) probably leads to far fewer relapses than using the anti-inflammatory medicine alone. For every 100 people treated with the anti-inflammatory medicine alone, 59 experienced a relapse. This number dropped to 12 when infliximab was added.\n\nCompared to a biosimilar, infliximab may make little to no difference to the chance of a relapse or the risk of serious side effects. However, infliximab may slightly increase the chance that the treatment stops working over time. It may also lead to many more people stopping treatment because of side effects.\n\nFor all comparisons, we are uncertain about infliximab's effect on side effects because the evidence is unclear. We do not know how infliximab compares to another medicine called adalimumab. We also don't know if giving a biosimilar in different ways (under the skin or into a vein) changes how well it works or the side effects it causes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because some studies included only a small number of people, and we were concerned that the methods used in some studies could have made the results less reliable. Also, not all studies reported on the side effects we were interested in.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up-to-date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and length. However, it needs some revisions to reduce vocabulary complexity and improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace unnecessary technical jargon.** The term 'purine analogue' is used multiple times but is too technical for this context. Simply referring to it by its function is clearer for readers.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Infliximab also probably works better when combined with another anti-inflammatory medicine (called a purine analogue) than when the anti-inflammatory medicine is used alone.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Infliximab also probably works better when combined with another type of anti-inflammatory medicine than when that medicine is used alone.\"\n\n2. **Simplify dense sentences with multiple complex ideas.** Some sentences introduce several new, complex terms at once, which can overwhelm the reader. Breaking these ideas into simpler sentences will improve comprehension.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Most studies included people who had not used a type of medicine called a biologic before. Biologics are complex medicines made from living sources. One study focused on people with a specific type of Crohn's disease that causes fistulas (abnormal tunnels between the gut and other body parts).\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Most studies included people who were new to a type of medicine called a 'biologic,' which are complex medicines made from living things. One study focused only on people with fistulas. These are abnormal tunnels that can form between the gut and other parts of the body because of Crohn's disease.\"\n\n3. **Make the limitations clearer and more direct.** The explanation of why the evidence is limited is a bit vague. Using more direct language helps readers better understand the uncertainty in the findings.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low. This is because some studies included only a small number of people, and we were concerned that the methods used in some studies could have made the results less reliable.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low. This is mainly because some studies were small, and the way they were conducted could have introduced errors into the results. Also, not all studies reported on the side effects we were interested in, leaving gaps in the evidence.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show that while the draft has excellent sentence structure and good general readability (72% of features are in the best quartile), it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Metrics for complex words (SMOG index, complex_words, long_words) are in the P90 range, indicating the text contains more difficult and technical vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. The feedback provided focuses on simplifying these specific terms and phrases to improve overall clarity."
