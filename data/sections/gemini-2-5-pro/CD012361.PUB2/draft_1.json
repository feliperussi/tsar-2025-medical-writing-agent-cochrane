  "draft": "Is dexmedetomidine (a drug to relieve pain and cause sleepiness) a safe and effective treatment for newborn babies who need a machine to help them breathe?\n\nKey messages\n\nWe do not know if dexmedetomidine (a drug to relieve pain and cause sleepiness) is a safe and effective treatment for newborn babies who need a machine to help them breathe. This is because we found no completed studies to include in our review.\n\nFurther research is needed to understand the benefits and potential harms of dexmedetomidine for newborn babies, especially its long-term effects. There are some studies under way that may help to answer this question in the future.\n\nWhy do newborn babies on breathing machines need pain relief and sedation?\n\nNewborn babies who are very ill may need help from a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation). This can be uncomfortable and painful. To keep them comfortable and free from pain, they are given medicines for sedation (to keep them calm) and analgesia (for pain relief). Strong medicines like morphine (an opioid) are often used for this. Dexmedetomidine is another medicine that is thought to be a safer option, but it is not officially approved for use in newborns. Despite this, its use is increasing.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe dexmedetomidine is for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies on breathing machines. We planned to compare it with other pain relief medicines, sedatives, or a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n\nMethods\n\nWe searched for studies that compared dexmedetomidine against other drugs or a placebo for sedation and pain relief in newborn infants on breathing machines. We planned to combine the results and assess our confidence in the evidence, but we found no eligible studies.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review authors did not find any studies to include in this review. They were looking for studies of dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn infants (less than four weeks old) who were on a machine to help them breathe (mechanical ventilation). Therefore, we do not know if dexmedetomidine is effective or safe for this purpose.\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

Additionally, there are a few opportunities to improve clarity and conciseness.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase the 'Methods' subheading as a question.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions where possible to better guide the reader.\n    *   **Current text:** \"Methods\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"How did we conduct this review?\"\n\n2.  **Clarify the 'Limitations' section.** The current wording is confusing and uses the technical term 'outcomes'. Since the main finding is a complete lack of evidence, this section feels redundant and could be clearer.\n    *   **Current text:** \"We are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Because we found no studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the effects of dexmedetomidine. We have no evidence to assess.\"\n\n3.  **Use personal pronouns consistently.** The style guide requires using 'we' to refer to the review authors. This makes the text more direct and engaging.\n    *   **Current text:** \"The review authors did not find any studies to include in this review.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We did not find any studies to include in this review.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating excellent readability, simple sentence structure (18.18 words/sentence), and appropriate vocabulary. Despite these strong quantitative results, the feedback identifies qualitative issues such as non-compliance with subheading format and minor clarity problems that require editorial attention."
