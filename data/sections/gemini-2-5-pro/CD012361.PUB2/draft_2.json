  "draft": "Is dexmedetomidine (a drug to relieve pain and cause sleepiness) a safe and effective treatment for newborn babies who need a machine to help them breathe?\n\nKey messages\n\nWe do not know if dexmedetomidine (a drug to relieve pain and cause sleepiness) is a safe and effective treatment for newborn babies who need a machine to help them breathe. This is because we found no completed studies to include in our review.\n\nFurther research is needed to understand the benefits and potential harms of dexmedetomidine for newborn babies, especially its long-term effects. There are some studies under way that may help to answer this question in the future.\n\nWhy do newborn babies on breathing machines need pain relief and sedation?\n\nNewborn babies who are very ill may need help from a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation). This can be uncomfortable and painful. To keep them comfortable and free from pain, they are given medicines for sedation (to keep them calm) and analgesia (for pain relief). Strong medicines like morphine (an opioid) are often used for this. Dexmedetomidine is another medicine that is thought to be a safer option, but it is not officially approved for use in newborns. Despite this, its use is increasing.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe dexmedetomidine is for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies on breathing machines. We planned to compare it with other pain relief medicines, sedatives, or a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared dexmedetomidine against other drugs or a placebo for sedation and pain relief in newborn infants on breathing machines. We planned to combine the results and assess our confidence in the evidence, but we found no eligible studies.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe did not find any studies to include in this review. Therefore, we do not know if dexmedetomidine is effective or safe for this purpose. Because we found no studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the effects of dexmedetomidine. We have no evidence to assess.\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved because it's missing a required section and has issues with repetition and structure. While the sentence-level writing is clear and meets statistical targets, the overall summary needs these key improvements:\n\n1. **Add the missing 'Limitations of the evidence' section.** Every PLS must state the level of confidence in the findings. Since no studies were found, this is a critical point to include.\n    - **Problem:** The draft is missing this required section, which is specified in the source material.\n    - **Suggestion:** Add a new subheading like 'How confident are we in the evidence?' and explain that because no studies were found, our confidence is very low and we cannot draw conclusions.\n\n2. **Make the 'What did we find?' section more concise.** The current version repeats the main finding four times in a row, which can frustrate readers.\n    - **Quote:** 'We did not find any studies to include in this review. Therefore, we do not know if dexmedetomidine is effective or safe for this purpose. Because we found no studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the effects of dexmedetomidine. We have no evidence to assess.'\n    - **Suggestion:** Condense this to one or two clear sentences. For example: 'We did not find any studies to include in this review. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the safety or effectiveness of dexmedetomidine for this purpose.'\n\n3. **Keep the methods section focused on methods.** The description of your methods currently includes the main result, which belongs in the next section.\n    - **Quote:** '...We planned to combine the results and assess our confidence in the evidence, but we found no eligible studies.'\n    - **Problem:** The phrase 'but we found no eligible studies' is a result, not a method. This confuses the structure of the summary.\n    - **Suggestion:** Remove that phrase from the methods section. The section should only describe what you planned to do.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating excellent sentence-level readability, simple vocabulary, and appropriate use of active voice. For example, the average words per sentence is low at 16.13 (P25) and the Flesch-Kincaid grade level is 9.08 (P25). The metrics do not highlight any areas of concern, as the issues identified are related to content completeness and structure rather than writing style."
