  "draft": "Is dexmedetomidine (a drug to relieve pain and cause sleepiness) a safe and effective treatment for newborn babies who need a machine to help them breathe?\n\nKey messages\n\nWe do not know if dexmedetomidine (a drug to relieve pain and cause sleepiness) is a safe and effective treatment for newborn babies who need a machine to help them breathe. This is because we found no completed studies to include in our review.\n\nFurther research is needed to understand the benefits and potential harms of dexmedetomidine for newborn babies, especially its long-term effects. There are some studies under way that may help to answer this question in the future.\n\nWhy do newborn babies on breathing machines need pain relief and sedation?\n\nNewborn babies who are very ill may need help from a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation). This can be uncomfortable and painful. To keep them comfortable and free from pain, they are given medicines for sedation (to keep them calm) and analgesia (for pain relief). Strong medicines like morphine (an opioid) are often used for this. Dexmedetomidine is another medicine that is thought to be a safer option, but it is not officially approved for use in newborns. Despite this, its use is increasing.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe dexmedetomidine is for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies on breathing machines. We planned to compare it with other pain relief medicines, sedatives, or a placebo (a dummy treatment).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared dexmedetomidine against other drugs or a placebo for sedation and pain relief in newborn infants on breathing machines. We planned to combine the results and assess our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe did not find any studies to include in this review. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the safety or effectiveness of dexmedetomidine for this purpose.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\n\nWe have very low confidence in the evidence. As we found no studies, we cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits and harms of dexmedetomidine for newborn babies on breathing machines.\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
