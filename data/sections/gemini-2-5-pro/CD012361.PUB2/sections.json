    "We do not know if dexmedetomidine (a drug to relieve pain and cause sleepiness) is a safe and effective treatment for newborn babies who need a machine to help them breathe. This is because we found no completed studies to include in our review.",
    "Further research is needed to understand the benefits and potential harms of dexmedetomidine for newborn babies, especially its long-term effects. There are some studies under way that may help to answer this question in the future."

      "subheading": "Why do newborn babies on breathing machines need pain relief and sedation?",
      "content": "Newborn babies who are very ill may need help from a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation). This can be uncomfortable and painful. To keep them comfortable and free from pain, they are given medicines for sedation (to keep them calm) and analgesia (for pain relief). Strong medicines like morphine (an opioid) are often used for this. Dexmedetomidine is another medicine that is thought to be a safer option, but it is not officially approved for use in newborns. Despite this, its use is increasing."

      "content": "The review authors did not find any studies to include in this review. They were looking for studies of dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn infants (less than four weeks old) who were on a machine to help them breathe (mechanical ventilation). Therefore, we do not know if dexmedetomidine is effective or safe for this purpose."
