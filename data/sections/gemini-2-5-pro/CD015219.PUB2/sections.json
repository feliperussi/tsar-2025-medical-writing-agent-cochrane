    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is uncertain whether the antiviral medicine favipiravir helps people with COVID-19 get better. It may, however, cause more unwanted effects than treatment with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or standard care.",
    "More and better-quality studies are needed to understand if favipiravir is a useful treatment for people with COVID-19."

In the search for effective treatments, researchers investigated several existing medicines. One of these was favipiravir, an antiviral drug that some experts believed could be a safe and effective treatment for people with COVID-19. However, its actual benefit remained uncertain."

The studies were conducted in various countries, including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. The duration of treatment with favipiravir ranged from five to 14 days. Most trials compared favipiravir to a placebo or standard care. For people with COVID-19, we do not know if favipiravir has an effect on the number of people who die, the number who need a machine to help them breathe, or the time it takes for symptoms ...
