  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of the antiviral medicine favipiravir for people with COVID-19?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is uncertain whether the antiviral medicine favipiravir helps people with COVID-19 get better. It may, however, cause more unwanted effects than treatment with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or standard care.\n- More and better-quality studies are needed to understand if favipiravir is a useful treatment for people with COVID-19.\n\nWhat is COVID-19 and why was favipiravir considered as a treatment?\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been a major challenge for health systems around the world. In the search for effective treatments, researchers investigated several existing medicines. One of these was favipiravir, an antiviral drug that some experts believed could be a safe and effective treatment for people with COVID-19. However, its actual benefit remained uncertain.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of favipiravir for treating people with COVID-19. We compared it against no treatment, standard supportive care, or other experimental antiviral medicines.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups). In these studies, the antiviral drug favipiravir was compared with no treatment, supportive treatment, or other antiviral drugs for people with COVID-19. We compared and summarized the results of the studies we found. We also assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 25 trials involving 5750 adults, most of whom were under 60 years of age. The majority of participants (89%) were hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19. The studies took place in various countries, including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. The duration of treatment with favipiravir ranged from 5 to 14 days. Most trials compared favipiravir to a placebo or standard care. For people with COVID-19, we do not know if favipiravir has an effect on the number of people who die, the number who need a machine to help them breathe, or the time it takes for symptoms to get better.\n\nWhat were the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. Some studies were small, and the way participants were chosen could have affected the results. Some studies also relied on data that participants reported themselves, which can be less accurate.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft is not approved because a key finding about the potential harms of favipiravir is missing from the main results section, even though it is mentioned in the key messages. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add missing results on harms:** The 'What did we find?' section summarizes the uncertain benefits but omits the finding that favipiravir may cause more unwanted effects. This is a critical piece of information for readers. Please add a sentence to this section, such as: 'However, treatment with favipiravir may lead to more unwanted effects compared to placebo or standard care.'\n\n2. **Improve readability of key outcomes:** The final sentence in the results section combines three important outcomes, making it long and dense.\n   - **QUOTE:** 'For people with COVID-19, we do not know if favipiravir has an effect on the number of people who die, the number who need a machine to help them breathe, or the time it takes for symptoms to get better.'\n   - **SUGGESTION:** Break this into a bulleted list for clarity, for example: 'We are uncertain if favipiravir affects:\\n- the number of people who die;\\n- the number of people who need a machine to help them breathe;\\n- the time it takes for symptoms to get better.'\n\n3. **Simplify vocabulary in key messages:** The term 'robust evidence' is clear to researchers but could be simpler for a lay audience.\n   - **QUOTE:** 'Due to a lack of robust evidence...'\n   - **SUGGESTION:** Replace 'robust' with a more common word, such as 'strong' or 'reliable'.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median (P50) or best quartile (P25/P75) ranges of the Cochrane PLS corpus. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (8.77) and Words Per Sentence (14.97) are excellent, indicating the text is generally very clear and easy to read. The metrics do not flag any systemic issues, supporting the conclusion that the required edits relate to specific content choices rather than overall writing style."
