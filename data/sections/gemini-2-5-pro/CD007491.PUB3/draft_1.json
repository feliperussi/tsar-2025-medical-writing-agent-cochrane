  "draft": "For older people with a sudden illness, is 'hospital-at-home' care (where people receive treatment at home instead of being admitted to hospital) a better option than staying in the hospital?\n\nKey messages\n- For certain older people with a sudden illness, receiving care at home instead of in a hospital probably makes little or no difference to their health or risk of dying, but it probably reduces their chances of needing to move into a care home. Patients may be more satisfied with at-home care, and the review did not find evidence of unwanted or harmful effects.\n- Hospital-at-home care probably costs less for the health service than care in a hospital.\n- Future research should look at the effects of hospital-at-home care on caregivers and find out which specific groups of older people benefit most from this type of care.\n\nWhat is this review about?\nWhat is 'hospital at home'?\nWhen people have an illness that requires hospital care, they are usually admitted to a hospital ward. An alternative to this is 'admission avoidance hospital at home'. This is when healthcare professionals provide active treatment in a person's own home for a limited time. This care is for people with a condition that would otherwise require them to be admitted to a hospital.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how 'hospital at home' compares with care in a hospital. We were interested in the effectiveness and cost of managing people with 'hospital at home' services compared with inpatient hospital care.\n\nHow we did this review\nSearch Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search for randomized controlled trials that directly compared home‑based treatment with hospital‑based treatment.\nEligibility Criteria\nIncluded studies were RCTs enrolling participants with the condition of interest and that reported outcomes for both home and hospital treatment arms.\nData Synthesis\nData from eligible trials were extracted, pooled using meta‑analysis where appropriate, and results were presented as combined effect estimates.\nConfidence in Evidence\nThe certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach, rating each outcome as high, moderate, low, or very low.\n\nWhat the evidence from the review shows\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 20 studies with a total of 3100 participants. The participants were adults, mainly older people, with various conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recovery from stroke, or other acute medical issues. The studies compared admission avoidance 'hospital at home' care with standard inpatient hospital care for follow-up periods of three to twelve months. For certain older people referred for hospital admission, providing hospital-level care at home may be an effective alternative. Compared to inpatient care, it probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who die within six months or are readmitted to the hospital. However, it probably reduces the number of people who need to live in residential care after their illness and probably reduces costs to the health service. It may also improve patient satisfaction, but probably makes little to no difference to a patient's self-reported health.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about a few issues. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, the studies were done in different types of people, and there were not enough studies to be certain about some results, such as the effects on caregivers.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. While the key findings are factually accurate and the text is within the word limit, there are critical issues with clarity and formatting that make it unsuitable for a lay audience. The 'How we did this review' section is filled with unexplained technical jargon. Additionally, several subheadings do not follow the required question format. The language is also unnecessarily complex and noun-heavy in places, which is supported by the linguistic analysis.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rewrite the 'Methods' section in plain language.** The current version is a list of technical terms that a patient would not understand.\n   - **Problem:** Sentences like \"Data from eligible trials were extracted, pooled using meta‑analysis where appropriate, and results were presented as combined effect estimates\" use multiple pieces of jargon ('eligible trials', 'pooled', 'meta-analysis', 'combined effect estimates') without any explanation.\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace the entire section with a simple, narrative description. For example: \"We searched for studies that compared hospital care with 'hospital at home' care. We only included high-quality studies called 'randomised controlled trials', where people were assigned to a treatment group by chance. We then collected and combined the results from all the studies to draw our conclusions.\"\n\n2. **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** Several subheadings are statements, which violates a key style rule for making the summary easy to navigate.\n   - **Problem:** Subheadings like \"How we did this review\" and \"Limitations of the evidence\" are not questions.\n   - **Suggestion:** Change them to be questions. For example: \"How did we conduct this review?\" and \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n\n3. **Simplify complex and noun-heavy sentences.** The text often uses formal, noun-based phrases instead of simpler, more direct verbs. This makes the text harder to read.\n   - **Problem:** The sentence \"We were interested in the effectiveness and cost of managing people with 'hospital at home' services compared with inpatient hospital care\" is wordy and indirect.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite it using active verbs. For example: \"We wanted to find out if 'hospital at home' care was more effective and cost less than care in a hospital.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity overall, with many readability scores falling in the best quartile. However, there are significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in key areas that support the need for revision. Five metrics are in the P90 range, indicating higher complexity than is typical. Specifically, the scores for 'complex_words' (126.0), 'long_words' (181.0), and the 'smog_index' (14.3) point to vocabulary that is too advanced for a lay audience. Furthermore, high scores for 'nominalization' (24.0) and 'nouns' (180.0) confirm that the writing style is overly formal and less direct than recommended."
