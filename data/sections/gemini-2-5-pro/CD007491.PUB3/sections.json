  "key_messages": [
    "For certain older people with a sudden illness, receiving care at home instead of in a hospital probably makes little or no difference to their health or risk of dying, but it probably reduces their chances of needing to move into a care home. Patients may be more satisfied with at-home care, and the review did not find evidence of unwanted or harmful effects.",
    "Hospital-at-home care probably costs less for the health service than care in a hospital.",
    "Future research should look at the effects of hospital-at-home care on caregivers and find out which specific groups of older people benefit most from this type of care."

      "content": "When people have an illness that requires hospital care, they are usually admitted to a hospital ward. An alternative to this is 'admission avoidance hospital at home'. This is when healthcare professionals provide active treatment in a person's own home for a limited time. This care is for people with a condition that would otherwise require them to be admitted to a hospital."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 20 studies with a total of 3100 participants. The participants were adults, mainly older people, with various conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recovery from stroke, or other acute medical issues. The studies compared admission avoidance 'hospital at home' care with standard inpatient hospital care for follow-up periods of three to twelve months. For certain older people referred for hospital admission, providing hospital-level care at home may be an effective alternative. Compared to inpatient care, it probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who die within six months or are readmitted to the hospital. However, it probably reduces the number of people who need to live in residential care after their illness and probably reduces costs to the health service. It may also improve patient satisfaction, but probably makes little to no difference to a patient's self-reported health."

  "limitations": "Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about a few issues. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, the studies were done in different types of people, and there were not enough studies to be certain about some results, such as the effects on caregivers.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022."
