  "key_messages": [
    "For newborn babies with jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and eyes caused by high levels of a substance called bilirubin), giving light therapy (phototherapy) with breaks may be as effective at lowering bilirubin levels as giving it continuously. The review found very little evidence about serious unwanted effects, such as brain damage.",
    "For babies born early (preterm infants), continuous light therapy may be more effective at lowering bilirubin levels. However, giving light therapy with breaks reduces the total number of hours a baby is exposed to the treatment.",
    "Larger, well-designed studies are needed for both term and preterm babies to be certain that giving light therapy with breaks is as safe and effective as giving it continuously."

      "subheading": "What is jaundice in newborn babies and how is it treated?",
      "content": "Jaundice is a common condition in newborn babies that causes their skin and the whites of their eyes to turn yellow. It is caused by a build-up of a substance in the blood called bilirubin. While usually harmless, very high levels of bilirubin can lead to serious complications. The most common treatment for jaundice is phototherapy, where the baby is placed under special lights. This light helps the baby's body break down the bilirubin. Traditionally, this light therapy is given continuously, without breaks. An alternative approach is intermittent phototherapy, where the treatment is given with breaks. This could offer practical advantages, such as allowing more time for feeding and for the mother and baby to bond."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 12 randomised controlled trials that involved a total of 1600 newborn infants with jaundice. The studies included both term and preterm infants up to 30 days of age and compared intermittent phototherapy against continuous phototherapy. Compared to continuous phototherapy, intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference in the rate at which bilirubin levels fall, or in the number of infant deaths. We do not know if intermittent phototherapy has an effect on bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction because the evidence is very uncertain. Similarly, intermittent phototherapy may have little to no effect on treatment failure, but we are very uncertain about this result."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. The included studies were small, used different ways of delivering the treatment, and it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2022."
