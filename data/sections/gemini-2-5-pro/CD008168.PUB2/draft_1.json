  "draft": "For newborn babies with jaundice, is light therapy (phototherapy) given with breaks as effective as light therapy given continuously?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For newborn babies with jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and eyes caused by high levels of a substance called bilirubin), giving light therapy (phototherapy) with breaks may be as effective at lowering bilirubin levels as giving it continuously. The review found very little evidence about serious unwanted effects, such as brain damage.\n- For babies born early (preterm infants), continuous light therapy may be more effective at lowering bilirubin levels. However, giving light therapy with breaks reduces the total number of hours a baby is exposed to the treatment.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed for both term and preterm babies to be certain that giving light therapy with breaks is as safe and effective as giving it continuously.\n\nWHAT IS THE ISSUE?\nWhat is jaundice in newborn babies and how is it treated?\nJaundice is a common condition in newborn babies that causes their skin and the whites of their eyes to turn yellow. It is caused by a build-up of a substance in the blood called bilirubin. While usually harmless, very high levels of bilirubin can lead to serious complications. The most common treatment for jaundice is phototherapy, where the baby is placed under special lights. This light helps the baby's body break down the bilirubin. Traditionally, this light therapy is given continuously, without breaks. An alternative approach is intermittent phototherapy, where the treatment is given with breaks. This could offer practical advantages, such as allowing more time for feeding and for the mother and baby to bond.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy to see which is safer and more effective for treating jaundice in newborn babies.\n\nWHAT DID WE DO?\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared giving phototherapy in cycles (intermittent) with giving it non-stop (continuous) for babies with jaundice. We then combined and summarized the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWHAT DID WE FIND?\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 12 randomised controlled trials that involved a total of 1600 newborn infants with jaundice. The studies included both term and preterm infants up to 30 days of age and compared intermittent phototherapy against continuous phototherapy. Compared to continuous phototherapy, intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference in the rate at which bilirubin levels fall, or in the number of infant deaths. We do not know if intermittent phototherapy has an effect on bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction because the evidence is very uncertain. Similarly, intermittent phototherapy may have little to no effect on treatment failure, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nWHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. The included studies were small, used different ways of delivering the treatment, and it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nHOW UP TO DATE IS THIS EVIDENCE?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

Addressing these issues and some minor redundancies will significantly improve the clarity of the summary.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Rephrase Subheading as a Question:** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions.\n    *   **Problem:** The subheading \"Methods\" is not a question.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change \"Methods\" to something like \"How did we conduct this review?\" or \"What did we do in this review?\"\n\n2.  **Use Active Voice:** The summary frequently uses passive voice, which can make sentences less clear and direct. The goal is to clearly state who is performing the action.\n    *   **Problem:** \"Traditionally, this light therapy is given continuously, without breaks.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please rewrite in active voice, for example: \"Traditionally, doctors give this light therapy continuously, without breaks.\"\n\n3.  **Remove Redundancy:** Some headings and phrases are repetitive, which can make the text feel clunky.\n    *   **Problem:** The heading \"WHAT DID WE FIND?\" is immediately followed by the subheading \"What did we find?\".\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please remove the second, smaller subheading \"What did we find?\" to improve the flow.",

This metric supports the editorial feedback to convert passive sentences to active voice to improve clarity and directness for the reader."
