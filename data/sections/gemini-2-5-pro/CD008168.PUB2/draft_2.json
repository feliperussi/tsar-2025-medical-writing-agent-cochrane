  "draft": "For newborn babies with jaundice, is light therapy (phototherapy) given with breaks as effective as light therapy given continuously?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For newborn babies with jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and eyes caused by high levels of a substance called bilirubin), giving light therapy (phototherapy) with breaks may be as effective at lowering bilirubin levels as giving it continuously. The review found very little evidence about serious unwanted effects, such as brain damage.\n- For babies born early (preterm infants), continuous light therapy may be more effective at lowering bilirubin levels. However, giving light therapy with breaks reduces the total number of hours the baby receives treatment.\n- Researchers need to conduct larger, well-designed studies for both term and preterm babies to be certain that giving light therapy with breaks is as safe and effective as giving it continuously.\n\nWHAT IS THE ISSUE?\nWhat is jaundice in newborn babies and how is it treated?\nJaundice is a common condition in newborn babies that causes their skin and the whites of their eyes to turn yellow. A build-up of a substance in the blood called bilirubin causes it. While usually harmless, very high levels of bilirubin can lead to serious complications. The most common treatment for jaundice is phototherapy, where doctors place the baby under special lights. This light helps the baby's body break down the bilirubin. Traditionally, doctors give this light therapy continuously, without breaks. An alternative approach is intermittent phototherapy, where doctors give the treatment with breaks. This could offer practical advantages, such as allowing more time for feeding and for the mother and baby to bond.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy to see which is safer and more effective for treating jaundice in newborn babies.\n\nWHAT DID WE DO?\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving phototherapy in cycles (intermittent) with giving it non-stop (continuous) for babies with jaundice. We then combined and summarized the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWHAT DID WE FIND?\nThe review included 12 randomised controlled trials that involved a total of 1600 newborn infants with jaundice. The studies included both term and preterm infants up to 30 days of age and compared intermittent phototherapy against continuous phototherapy. Compared to continuous phototherapy, intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference in the rate at which bilirubin levels fall, or in the number of infant deaths. We do not know if intermittent phototherapy has an effect on bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction because the evidence is very uncertain. Similarly, intermittent phototherapy may have little to no effect on treatment failure, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nWHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low because there were not enough studies to be certain about the results. The studies we found were small and used different ways of delivering the treatment. Also, the people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nHOW UP TO DATE IS THIS EVIDENCE?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

CRITICAL: Rephrase subheadings as questions.**\nSeveral subheadings do not follow the style guide requirement to be phrased as questions. This is essential for guiding the reader.\n- **Problem:** `WHAT IS THE ISSUE?` and `WHAT DID WE DO?`\n- **Suggestion:** Please change these to questions, for example: `What is newborn jaundice?` and `How did we conduct this review?`\n\n**2. Simplify and clarify the first key message.**\nThe first bullet point is 38 words long and contains complex nested information, which can be difficult for readers to process in a key summary section.\n- **Problem:** `For newborn babies with jaundice (a yellowing, a yellowing of the skin and eyes caused by high levels of a substance called bilirubin), giving light therapy (phototherapy) with breaks may be as effective at lowering bilirubin levels as giving it continuously.`\n- **Suggestion:** Simplify this for better readability. For example: `For newborn babies with jaundice (yellowing of the skin from high bilirubin levels), light therapy given with breaks may be as effective as continuous therapy at lowering bilirubin.`\n\n**3. Use consistent terminology for the treatment types.**\nThe methods section introduces new terms ('in cycles', 'non-stop') which are not used elsewhere, potentially confusing the reader.\n- **Problem:** `We searched for studies that compared giving phototherapy in cycles (intermittent) with giving it non-stop (continuous) for babies with jaundice.`\n- **Suggestion:** Use the same simple terms as the rest of the summary. For example: `We searched for studies that compared giving phototherapy with breaks (intermittent) to giving it without breaks (continuous) for babies with jaundice.`",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and style. All metrics, including readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 10.07) and sentence length (16.15 words/sentence), are within acceptable ranges. The evaluation indicates a strong statistical foundation, suggesting that only targeted editorial improvements are needed rather than a major rewrite."
