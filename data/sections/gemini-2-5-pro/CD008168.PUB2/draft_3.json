  "draft": "For newborn babies with jaundice, is light therapy (phototherapy) given with breaks as effective as light therapy given continuously?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For newborn babies with jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes from high levels of a substance called bilirubin), light therapy given with breaks may be as effective as continuous therapy at lowering bilirubin levels. We found very little evidence about serious unwanted effects, such as brain damage.\n- For babies born early (preterm infants), continuous light therapy may be more effective at lowering bilirubin levels. However, giving light therapy with breaks reduces the total number of hours the baby receives treatment.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed for both term and preterm babies to be certain that giving light therapy with breaks is as safe and effective as giving it continuously.\n\nWhat is jaundice in newborn babies and how is it treated?\nJaundice is a common condition in newborn babies that causes their skin and the whites of their eyes to turn yellow. A build-up of a substance in the blood called bilirubin causes it. While usually harmless, very high levels of bilirubin can lead to serious complications. The most common treatment for jaundice is phototherapy, where doctors place the baby under special lights. This light helps the baby's body break down the bilirubin. Traditionally, doctors give this light therapy continuously, without breaks. An alternative approach is intermittent phototherapy, where doctors give the treatment with breaks. This could offer practical advantages, such as allowing more time for feeding and for the mother and baby to bond.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy to see which is safer and more effective for treating jaundice in newborn babies.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving phototherapy with breaks (intermittent) to giving it without breaks (continuous) for babies with jaundice. We then combined and summarized the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 12 randomised controlled trials that involved a total of 1600 newborn infants with jaundice. The studies included both term and preterm infants up to 30 days of age and compared intermittent phototherapy against continuous phototherapy. Compared to continuous phototherapy, intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference in the rate at which bilirubin levels fall, or in the number of infant deaths. We do not know if intermittent phototherapy has an effect on bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction because the evidence is very uncertain. Similarly, intermittent phototherapy may have little to no effect on treatment failure, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because there were not enough studies to be certain about the results. The studies we found were small and used different ways of delivering the treatment. Also, the people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and meets all structural requirements. The readability scores are excellent. However, a few revisions are needed to improve clarity for the reader before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements:\n\n1. **Clarify the link between 'brain damage' and 'bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction'.** The Key Messages section uses the simple term 'brain damage', which is great for plain language. However, the Results section later introduces the technical term 'bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction' without explaining that it's the same thing. This could confuse readers.\n    *   **Problem Text:** 'We do not know if intermittent phototherapy has an effect on bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction because the evidence is very uncertain.'\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We do not know if intermittent phototherapy has an effect on brain damage caused by high bilirubin (known as bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction), because the evidence is very uncertain.'\n\n2. **Simplify sentences by presenting one main idea at a time.** The first sentence of the 'What did we find?' section combines two different results (bilirubin levels and infant deaths), which can make it harder to process.\n    *   **Problem Text:** 'Compared to continuous phototherapy, intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference in the rate at which bilirubin levels fall, or in the number of infant deaths.'\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Compared to continuous phototherapy, intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference in how quickly bilirubin levels fall. It also may make little to no difference in the number of infant deaths.'\n\n3. **Make the 'Limitations' section more direct.** The wording in this section is slightly passive and could be more straightforward to help the reader quickly grasp why the evidence is uncertain.\n    *   **Problem Text:** 'We have low confidence in the evidence because there were not enough studies to be certain about the results. The studies we found were small and used different ways of delivering the treatment. Also, the people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting.'\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We have low confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. The studies were small and used different treatment methods, which makes the results less certain. Also, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.'\n\nThe linguistic analysis confirms the draft is statistically strong, with excellent readability scores. These suggested edits focus on improving reader comprehension, which is not always captured by metrics alone.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 94.4% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and style. All readability scores, such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade (10.39) and words per sentence (16.59), are excellent. Metrics like passive voice and nominalization are also well within typical ranges. The analysis indicates a statistically strong draft with no significant deviations."
