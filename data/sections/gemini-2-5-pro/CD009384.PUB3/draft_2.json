  "draft": "Can zinc supplements prevent illness and death, and improve growth in children?\n\nKey messages\n- For children aged 6 months to 12 years living in areas where not getting enough zinc is common, taking zinc supplements may help prevent episodes of diarrhea and slightly improve growth. However, it is unclear if zinc prevents deaths, and it may cause vomiting.\n- While zinc supplements may reduce diarrhea, the evidence shows they probably make little to no difference in preventing lung infections (illnesses of the lungs and airways).\n- More research is needed to better understand the effects of zinc supplements on preventing deaths in children and to find out if the benefits are greater than the harms for children most at risk of zinc deficiency (a condition where the body does not have enough zinc).\n\nWhy is zinc important for children's health?\nZinc is a nutrient that is essential for staying healthy. Many children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, do not get enough zinc in their diets. This is known as zinc deficiency. Being deficient in zinc can cause serious health problems for children. It can make them more likely to get sick, stop them from growing properly, and even increase their risk of dying. One possible way to prevent these problems is to give children zinc supplements.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving zinc supplements to children aged 6 months to 12 years helps to prevent these health problems. Specifically, we wanted to know if zinc supplementation prevents deaths, reduces illness, and promotes healthy growth in children.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving zinc supplements with giving no zinc or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) to children aged 6 months to 12 years. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 96 randomized controlled trials involving 219,584 children aged 6 months to 12 years, with most participants being under five years old. The studies were conducted in 34 different countries, with the majority (87 studies) taking place in low- or middle-income countries. Zinc supplements may help prevent episodes of diarrhea and slightly improve growth. However, zinc probably makes little to no difference in preventing lung infections. On the other hand, it increases the number of children who experience vomiting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in some findings is moderate. For certain outcomes, like deaths from lung infections, the studies had very few events. This makes it difficult to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence published up to February 2022.",
