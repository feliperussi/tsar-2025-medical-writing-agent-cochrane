  "draft": "For women who leak urine, what is the best way to do pelvic floor muscle exercises?\n\nFor women who leak urine, exercises that focus only on the pelvic floor muscles may work better than general exercises. Exercising on more days per week may also lead to better results. It probably makes little difference whether women do these exercises with supervision in a group or one-on-one. Unwanted effects were not common and were mostly minor, like discomfort or spotting when using training devices.\n\nUsing electronic health tools (like a mobile app) for instructions and support may be slightly better than using written instructions alone.\n\nWe are still unsure about the best way to do many aspects of pelvic floor muscle training because of a lack of strong evidence. We need more and better-designed studies, especially to find the most effective 'dose' of exercise (for example, how many muscle squeezes to do and how often).\n\nWhat is pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence?\nUrinary incontinence is the unwanted leakage of urine. It is a common problem for women and can happen when coughing or sneezing (stress incontinence), with a sudden, strong urge to urinate (urgency incontinence), or a combination of both (mixed incontinence). Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) involves exercises to strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and is a recommended treatment. However, health professionals can teach these exercises in many different ways. This includes the type of exercise, how often women do it (the dose), and how women receive the training (for example, with a therapist in a clinic, in a group, or at home).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which approaches to pelvic floor muscle training work best for women with urinary incontinence. We compared different types of exercise, different doses of exercise, and different ways of delivering the training to see what effect they had on incontinence.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training, including the type of exercise, the dose, and how it was delivered. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur analysis included 63 studies with a total of 4920 women. The women in the studies were generally middle-aged (45 to 65 years old) and had given birth. Most had stress incontinence or a mix of stress and urgency incontinence. Researchers conducted the studies in countries around the world, mostly in middle- or high-income settings.\n\nWe compared different ways of doing pelvic floor muscle training to see how they affected women's quality of life. We found that:\n- Combining body movements with pelvic floor muscle squeezes (co-ordinated training) may improve quality of life.\n- Exercising on more days per week may also improve quality of life.\n- Exercises that focus only on the pelvic floor muscles may be better than general exercises that do not.\n- Adding general exercises to a program of pelvic floor muscle exercises may make little to no difference.\n- It probably makes little to no difference whether a health professional supervises the exercises for one person or for a group.\n- Receiving instructions through electronic health tools (like a mobile app) may be slightly better than using written instructions alone.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because many of the studies were very small, and some did not provide all the information we were interested in. Also, researchers did the studies with different types of people and provided the training in different ways. This makes the results less certain.\n\nHow up-to-date is this review?\nThis review updates a previous version. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it needs revision to improve clarity for a patient audience. The main issue is a reliance on formal, noun-heavy language instead of simpler, more direct verbs. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use simpler, more direct language in definitions.** The current definitions are a bit clinical and dense.\n    *   **Problematic text:** 'Urinary incontinence is the unwanted leakage of urine. It is a common problem for women and can happen when coughing or sneezing (stress incontinence), with a sudden, strong urge to urinate (urgency incontinence), or a combination of both (mixed incontinence).'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Urinary incontinence is when you leak urine when you don't want to. It's a common problem for women. It can happen when you cough or sneeze (this is called 'stress incontinence'), or when you feel a sudden, strong need to pee ('urgency incontinence'). Sometimes, it's a mix of both.'\n\n2. **Replace abstract nouns with active verbs.** The text frequently uses formal noun phrases where simple verbs would be clearer. This is reflected in the high nominalization score.\n    *   **Problematic text:** 'Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) involves exercises to strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and is a recommended treatment.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'To help with this, doctors often recommend exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles (called PFMT). These are the muscles that support your bladder.'\n\n3. **Explain what 'quality of life' means for patients.** This phrase is used in the results but is too abstract. It should be linked back to the specific problems caused by incontinence.\n    *   **Problematic text:** 'Combining body movements with pelvic floor muscle squeezes (co-ordinated training) may improve quality of life.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Combining body movements with pelvic floor muscle squeezes (called 'co-ordinated training') may help women feel better and more in control of their incontinence.'\n\nThese changes will make the summary more accessible and easier for readers to understand, addressing the vocabulary complexity issues identified in the linguistic analysis.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in structure, with excellent scores for sentence length, active voice, and overall readability (78% of metrics are in the best quartile). However, the analysis flags significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Four metrics—nominalization (P90), noun count (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), and long words (P90)—are unusually high, indicating the text relies too heavily on complex nouns and formal language where simpler verbs and everyday words would be more appropriate for a patient audience."
