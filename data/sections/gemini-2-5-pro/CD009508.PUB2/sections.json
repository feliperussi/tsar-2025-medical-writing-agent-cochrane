  "plain_title": "For women who leak urine, what is the best way to do pelvic floor muscle exercises?",
  "key_messages": [
    "For women who leak urine, doing exercises that focus only on the pelvic floor muscles (repeated, isolated contractions) may be better than general exercises. Doing these exercises more days per week may also improve results, while it probably makes little difference whether they are supervised in a group or one-on-one. Unwanted effects were not common and were mostly minor issues like discomfort or spotting when using training devices.",
    "Receiving instructions and support for exercises through electronic health tools (such as a mobile app) may be slightly better than using written instructions alone.",
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is still unclear what the best approach is for many aspects of pelvic floor muscle training. More and better-designed studies are needed, especially to find out the most effective 'dose' of exercise (for example, how many contractions to do and how often)."

      "content": "Urinary incontinence is the unwanted leakage of urine. It is a common problem for women and can happen when coughing or sneezing (stress incontinence), with a sudden, strong urge to urinate (urgency incontinence), or a combination of both (mixed incontinence). Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) involves exercises to strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and is a recommended treatment. However, these exercises can be taught and performed in many different ways, including the type of exercise, how often it is done (the dose), and how the training is delivered (for example, with a therapist in a clinic, in a group, or at home)."

      "content": "We wanted to find out which approaches to pelvic floor muscle training work best for women with urinary incontinence. We compared different types of exercise, different doses of exercise, and different ways of delivering the training to see what effect they had on incontinence."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The analysis included 63 trials with a total of 4920 women. The participants were generally mid-age (45 to 65 years) women who had given birth and had stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. The studies were conducted in countries around the world, mostly in middle- or high-income settings. The review compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) to see how they affected quality of life. We found that co-ordinated training (combining body movements with pelvic floor muscle contractions) and training on more days per week may improve quality of life. Training with direct, isolated pelvic floor muscle contractions may be better than indirect exercises. However, adding indirect exercises to a direct PFMT program may make little to no difference. Individual supervision probably makes little to no difference compared to group supervision, and receiving instructions via e-health may be slightly better than written instructions."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were very small and not all of them provided data about everything that we were interested in. Additionally, the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention — which makes the results less certain.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023 of search."
