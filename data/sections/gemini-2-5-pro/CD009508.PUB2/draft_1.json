  "draft": "For women who leak urine, what is the best way to do pelvic floor muscle exercises?\n\nFor women who leak urine, doing exercises that focus only on the pelvic floor muscles (repeated, isolated contractions) may be better than general exercises. Doing these exercises more days per week may also improve results, while it probably makes little difference whether they are supervised in a group or one-on-one. Unwanted effects were not common and were mostly minor issues like discomfort or spotting when using training devices.\n\nReceiving instructions and support for exercises through electronic health tools (such as a mobile app) may be slightly better than using written instructions alone.\n\nDue to a lack of robust evidence, it is still unclear what the best approach is for many aspects of pelvic floor muscle training. More and better-designed studies are needed, especially to find out the most effective 'dose' of exercise (for example, how many contractions to do and how often).\n\nWhat is pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence?\nUrinary incontinence is the unwanted leakage of urine. It is a common problem for women and can happen when coughing or sneezing (stress incontinence), with a sudden, strong urge to urinate (urgency incontinence), or a combination of both (mixed incontinence). Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) involves exercises to strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and is a recommended treatment. However, these exercises can be taught and performed in many different ways, including the type of exercise, how often it is done (the dose), and how the training is delivered (for example, with a therapist in a clinic, in a group, or at home).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which approaches to pelvic floor muscle training work best for women with urinary incontinence. We compared different types of exercise, different doses of exercise, and different ways of delivering the training to see what effect they had on incontinence.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training, including the type of exercise, the dose, and how it was delivered. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe analysis included 63 trials with a total of 4920 women. The participants were generally mid-age (45 to 65 years) women who had given birth and had stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. The studies were conducted in countries around the world, mostly in middle- or high-income settings. The review compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) to see how they affected quality of life. We found that co-ordinated training (combining body movements with pelvic floor muscle contractions) and training on more days per week may improve quality of life. Training with direct, isolated pelvic floor muscle contractions may be better than indirect exercises. However, adding indirect exercises to a direct PFMT program may make little to no difference. Individual supervision probably makes little to no difference compared to group supervision, and receiving instructions via e-health may be slightly better than written instructions.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies were very small and not all of them provided data about everything that we were interested in. Additionally, the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention — which makes the results less certain.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions to meet our plain language standards. The main issues are that several subheadings do not follow the required question format, and the text uses overly technical language and passive phrasing that can be difficult for readers to understand. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions.** Several subheadings are statements, not questions, which goes against our style guide. This makes the summary harder for readers to scan and engage with.\n   - **Problematic subheadings:** \"Methods\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Please change these to questions, for example: \"How did we conduct this review?\", \"How reliable is the evidence?\", and \"How up-to-date is this review?\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex technical terms.** The summary contains clinical language that may be unfamiliar to a general audience, making key information difficult to grasp.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The participants were generally mid-age (45 to 65 years) women who had given birth and had stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The participants were generally middle-aged women (45 to 65 years old) who had given birth. Most had stress incontinence (leaking urine when coughing or sneezing) or a mix of stress and urgency incontinence.\"\n\n3. **Use more active and direct language.** The draft often uses passive voice and converts verbs into nouns (nominalization), which makes sentences longer and less clear. The goal is to state directly who is doing what.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"However, these exercises can be taught and performed in many different ways... and how the training is delivered...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"However, health professionals can teach these exercises in many different ways... and how women receive the training...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While overall readability scores and sentence length are in the median range (P50), the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary and style. Seven metrics fall into the P90 range, indicating higher-than-typical complexity. Key areas for improvement are the high use of passive voice (20 instances), nominalizations (22 instances), and complex/long words. These factors make the text less direct and more difficult for a lay audience to understand."
