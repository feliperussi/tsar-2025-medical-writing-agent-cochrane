  "draft": "For people with schizophrenia, what are the benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy (using magnets to cause a seizure) compared to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if magnetic seizure therapy is better, worse, or the same as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia.\n- The single, small study we found provided very uncertain evidence about the effects of magnetic seizure therapy on memory and thinking skills compared to ECT.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed to provide clear answers about the benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhy are new treatments for schizophrenia needed?\nSchizophrenia is a common and serious mental health condition. The main treatment is antipsychotic medication, but these medicines do not work for about 20% of people with schizophrenia, who need other treatment options. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a treatment that uses magnetic fields to cause a seizure (a short burst of electrical activity) in the brain. It is being investigated as a potential treatment for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well MST works for people with schizophrenia and whether it has any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we carry out this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared MST with electroconvulsive therapy or other treatments for people with schizophrenia. We then compared and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that included 79 adults with schizophrenia. The study lasted for 4 weeks and compared MST with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Both groups also received standard care. The study found that MST may make little to no difference to schizophrenia symptoms. It also may not change the number of people who stopped treatment early compared with ECT. It is also unclear if MST has an effect on memory and thinking skills compared to ECT. However, because our findings are based on a single, small study, we have very little confidence in the results.\n\nWhat were the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is very low, mainly because our findings are based on a single small study. The study also had weaknesses in its methods; for example, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved because a key finding has been misrepresented, which is a critical factual error. Here are the most important changes needed to ensure accuracy and clarity for the reader:\n\n1. **Correct the finding on memory and thinking skills.** The draft incorrectly states that the effect is 'unclear', which misrepresents the source material. The original study suggested a potential benefit for MST (fewer cognitive problems), even if the evidence was very uncertain. This nuance is important for patients.\n\n    *   **Problem in Key Messages:** 'The single, small study we found provided very uncertain evidence about the effects of magnetic seizure therapy on memory and thinking skills compared to ECT.'\n    *   **Problem in Results:** 'It is also unclear if MST has an effect on memory and thinking skills compared to ECT.'\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite for Key Messages:** 'The single, small study we found suggested that magnetic seizure therapy may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking skills than ECT, but the evidence is very uncertain.'\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite for Results:** 'The study also suggested that MST may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking skills than ECT.'\n\n2. **Improve the clarity and flow of the 'What did we find?' section.** The current paragraph is a bit repetitive and lists findings without a clear narrative. Combining the findings with the statement of uncertainty can make it easier for the reader to follow.\n\n    *   **Problem Section:** 'We found one study that included 79 adults with schizophrenia. The study lasted for 4 weeks and compared MST with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Both groups also received standard care. The study found that MST may make little to no difference to schizophrenia symptoms. It also may not change the number of people who stopped treatment early compared with ECT. It is also unclear if MST has an effect on memory and thinking skills compared to ECT. However, because our findings are based on a single, small study, we have very little confidence in the results.'\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite (incorporating the correction from point 1):** 'We found one study that compared MST with ECT in 79 adults. Based on this single study, we are very uncertain about the effects of MST. The results suggested that MST may make little to no difference to schizophrenia symptoms or to the number of people who stopped treatment early. The study also suggested that MST may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking skills than ECT. However, because these findings come from one small study with design flaws, we have very little confidence in them.'\n\nCorrecting these two points will make the summary accurate and much clearer for the reader. The summary is otherwise very well‑written, with excellent readability scores.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. Most readability and sentence structure metrics, such as Flesch‑Kincaid Grade (9.81) and words per sentence (17.92), fall within the best quartile for PLS texts. No metrics show significant deviation, indicating a strong stylistic foundation. The feedback is therefore focused on factual accuracy and clarity of key findings rather than broad stylistic changes."
