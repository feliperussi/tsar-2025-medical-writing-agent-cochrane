  "draft": "For people with schizophrenia, what are the benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy (using magnets to cause a seizure) compared to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if magnetic seizure therapy (using magnets to cause a seizure) is better, worse, or the same as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia.\n- The single, small study we found provided some weak evidence that magnetic seizure therapy may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed to provide clear answers about the benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhy are new treatments for schizophrenia needed?\nSchizophrenia is a common and serious mental health condition. The main treatment is antipsychotic medication, but these medicines do not work for about 20% of people with schizophrenia, who need other treatment options. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer type of treatment that uses magnetic fields to stimulate the brain. It is being investigated as a potential treatment for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well magnetic seizure therapy works for people with schizophrenia and whether it has any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we carry out this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared magnetic seizure therapy with electroconvulsive therapy or other treatments for people with schizophrenia. We then compared and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review is based on one study that included 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy plus standard care with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care. Due to a lack of reliable evidence, we do not know if magnetic seizure therapy is effective or safe for people with schizophrenia when compared to ECT. The study found that magnetic seizure therapy may make little to no difference to schizophrenia symptoms or to the number of people who stopped treatment early. The study also provided some weak evidence that it may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT. However, all these findings come from a single, small study with design flaws. For this reason, we have very little confidence in the results and cannot draw any firm conclusions.\n\nWhat were the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because we found only one small study, and it had flaws in its design. For example, people in the study may have known which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that is well-written and easy to understand. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and accuracy have passed. However, a few minor revisions will make the key findings and limitations even clearer for the reader. Here are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Strengthen the description of evidence limitations.**\n   - **The issue:** The draft slightly understates the level of uncertainty.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** To better align with the source abstract's conclusion ('confidence in the evidence was very low'), it's important to be precise about this high level of uncertainty. \n   - **Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is **very low**.\"\n\n2. **Make the results more direct by using stronger verbs.**\n   - **The issue:** Some phrases are a bit wordy and rely on noun forms instead of direct verbs. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which flagged a high number of 'nominalizations'.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The study found that magnetic seizure therapy may make little to no difference to schizophrenia symptoms or to the number of people who stopped treatment early.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Replacing wordy phrases with more active verbs makes the sentence shorter and more direct.\n   - **Rewrite:** \"The study found that magnetic seizure therapy may **not affect** schizophrenia symptoms or **change** the number of people who stopped treatment early.\"\n\n3. **Improve the conciseness of the Key Messages.**\n   - **The issue:** The second key message is slightly repetitive, which can reduce its impact.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The single, small study we found provided some weak evidence that magnetic seizure therapy may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT, but we are very uncertain about this result.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** The terms 'weak evidence' and 'very uncertain' convey the same idea. Combining them makes the message punchier.\n   - **Rewrite:** \"The single, small study we found suggested that magnetic seizure therapy may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT, **but this evidence is very uncertain**.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 13 of 18 metrics (72.2%) in the best quartile for readability and clarity. This indicates the text is generally very easy to read. However, one metric, 'nominalization' (the use of noun forms of verbs), is in the P90 range, indicating it is higher than is typical for a PLS. This supports the editorial suggestion to replace noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs to improve clarity."
