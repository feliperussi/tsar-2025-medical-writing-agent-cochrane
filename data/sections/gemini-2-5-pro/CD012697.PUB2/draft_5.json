  "draft": "For people with schizophrenia, what are the benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy (using magnets to cause a seizure) compared to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if magnetic seizure therapy (using magnets to cause a seizure) is better, worse, or the same as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia.\n- The single, small study we found suggested that magnetic seizure therapy may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT, but this evidence is very uncertain.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed to provide clear answers about the benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhy are new treatments for schizophrenia needed?\nSchizophrenia is a common and serious mental health condition. The main treatment is antipsychotic medication, but these medicines do not work for about 20% of people with schizophrenia, who need other treatment options. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer treatment that uses magnetic fields to cause a seizure in the brain. It is being investigated as a potential treatment for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well magnetic seizure therapy works for people with schizophrenia and whether it has any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we carry out this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared magnetic seizure therapy with electroconvulsive therapy or other treatments for people with schizophrenia. We then compared and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that included 79 adults with schizophrenia. The study lasted for 4 weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Both groups also received standard care. The study found that magnetic seizure therapy may make little to no difference to schizophrenia symptoms. It also may not change the number of people who stopped treatment early compared with ECT. The study also provided some weak evidence that MST may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT. However, because our findings are based on a single, small study with design flaws, we have very little confidence in the results.\n\nWhat were the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is very low, mainly because our findings are based on a single small study. The study also had design flaws; for example, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is NOT_APPROVED. While the text is generally clear and meets readability targets, it fails a critical check for factual accuracy.\n\nHere are the most important changes needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Correct the Factual Contradiction on Cognitive Effects.** The draft's conclusion about memory and thinking effects contradicts the source material it was based on. This must be corrected to avoid misleading readers.\n    *   **Your text:** 'The study also provided some weak evidence that MST may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT.'\n    *   **Problem:** This contradicts the provided source material, which states: 'It is also unclear if MST has an effect on memory and thinking skills.' The PLS must align with its source.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'The study provided very uncertain evidence about the effects of MST on memory and thinking skills compared to ECT.'\n\n2. **Improve Consistency of Technical Terms.** The explanation for 'magnetic seizure therapy' is slightly different in the introduction than in the title and key messages. Defining it clearly once and then using the abbreviation (MST) will improve flow.\n    *   **Your text (Introduction):** 'Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer treatment that uses magnetic fields to cause a seizure in the brain.'\n    *   **Problem:** The parenthetical explanation '(using magnets to cause a seizure)' is used elsewhere. It's better to define the term and abbreviation once at its first mention.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite (in the Introduction):** 'Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a treatment that uses magnetic fields to cause a seizure (a short burst of electrical activity) in the brain. It is being investigated as a potential treatment for people with schizophrenia.' Then use 'MST' in the rest of the summary.\n\n3. **Simplify Phrasing in the Limitations Section.** The term 'design flaws' is slightly technical and can be simplified for a lay audience.\n    *   **Your text:** 'The study also had design flaws; for example, people may have known which treatment they were getting...'\n    *   **Problem:** 'Design flaws' is research jargon. While you explain it well, the initial term can be simpler.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'The study also had weaknesses in its methods. For example, people may have known which treatment they were getting...'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. Key indicators like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (10.3) and words per sentence (18.5) are excellent. The text does not have any significant statistical deviations, confirming its strong structural and linguistic foundation. The required revisions are focused on factual accuracy and consistency, not on core readability issues."
