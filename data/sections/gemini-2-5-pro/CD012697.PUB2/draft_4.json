  "draft": "For people with schizophrenia, what are the benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy (using magnets to cause a seizure) compared to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if magnetic seizure therapy (using magnets to cause a seizure) is better, worse, or the same as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia.\n- The single, small study we found suggested that magnetic seizure therapy may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT, but this evidence is very uncertain.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed to provide clear answers about the benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhy are new treatments for schizophrenia needed?\nSchizophrenia is a common and serious mental health condition. The main treatment is antipsychotic medication, but these medicines do not work for about 20% of people with schizophrenia, who need other treatment options. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer type of treatment that uses magnetic fields to stimulate the brain. It is being investigated as a potential treatment for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well magnetic seizure therapy works for people with schizophrenia and whether it has any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we carry out this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared magnetic seizure therapy with electroconvulsive therapy or other treatments for people with schizophrenia. We then compared and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review is based on one study that included 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy plus standard care with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care. Due to a lack of reliable evidence, we do not know if magnetic seizure therapy is effective or safe for people with schizophrenia when compared to ECT. The study found that magnetic seizure therapy may not affect schizophrenia symptoms or change the number of people who stopped treatment early. The study also provided some weak evidence that it may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT. However, all these findings come from a single, small study with design flaws. For this reason, we have very little confidence in the results and cannot draw any firm conclusions.\n\nWhat were the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is very low. This is because we found only one small study, and it had flaws in its design. For example, people in the study may have known which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

  "evaluation": [
    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a strong draft with excellent readability scores, but it is NOT_APPROVED because three key areas need improvement to maximize clarity for the reader.\n1. **Inconsistent explanation of the treatment:** The description of magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is inconsistent. The title describes it as 'using magnets to cause a seizure', while the introduction says it 'uses magnetic fields to stimulate the brain'. For a lay reader, these sound very different. Please choose the most direct explanation ('cause a seizure') and use it consistently. SUGGESTION: In the introduction, revise the sentence to something like: 'Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer treatment that uses magnetic fields to cause a seizure in the brain.'\n2. **Repetitive reasoning:** The justification for low confidence is repeated in the 'What did we find?' and 'What were the limitations...' sections. The limitations section should add new information, not restate the previous paragraph's conclusion. SUGGESTION: Revise the limitations section to focus on the *details* of the flaws, for example: 'Our confidence in the evidence is very low, mainly because our findings are based on a single small study. The study also had design flaws; for example, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.'\n3. **Indirect phrasing for results:** The draft uses weak, indirect language to describe a finding of no difference. SUGGESTION: Instead of '...magnetic seizure therapy may not affect schizophrenia symptoms...', use a more direct phrase like '...magnetic seizure therapy may make little to no difference to schizophrenia symptoms...'. This is clearer for readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. An impressive 83.3% of the metrics fall within the best quartile for readability and plain language, including excellent scores for sentence length (words_per_sentence: 18.76, P25), readability grade level (flesch_kincaid_grade: 10.29, P25), and use of active voice (41 instances, P75). All 18 metrics are within the typical range (P50 or better), indicating a strong structural and linguistic foundation. The editorial feedback focuses on improving clarity and consistency, issues not fully captured by the quantitative metrics."
