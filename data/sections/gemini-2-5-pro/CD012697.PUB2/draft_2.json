  "draft": "For people with schizophrenia, what are the benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy (using magnets to cause a seizure) compared to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if magnetic seizure therapy (using magnets to cause a seizure) is better, worse, or the same as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia.\n- The single, small study we found suggested that magnetic seizure therapy may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed to provide clear answers about the benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhy are new treatments for schizophrenia needed?\nSchizophrenia is a common and serious mental health condition. The main treatment is antipsychotic medication, but these medicines do not work for about 20% of people with schizophrenia, who need other treatment options. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer type of treatment that uses magnetic fields to stimulate the brain. It is being investigated as a potential treatment for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well magnetic seizure therapy works for people with schizophrenia and whether it has any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we carry out this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared magnetic seizure therapy with electroconvulsive therapy or other treatments for people with schizophrenia. We then compared and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review is based on one study that included 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy plus standard care with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care. Due to a lack of reliable evidence from this single, small study, we do not know if MST is effective or safe for people with schizophrenia when compared to ECT. When compared with ECT, MST may make little to no difference to schizophrenia symptoms or to the number of people who stopped treatment early, but we are very uncertain about the results. The study suggested that MST may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT. However, because the evidence comes from a single, small study, we are very uncertain about this result and cannot draw any firm conclusions.\n\nWhat were the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-structured and generally easy to read, but it cannot be approved due to a critical factual inconsistency and a few areas that need improved clarity.\n\n**Critical Issue: Factual Inaccuracy in Results**\nThe main issue is that the results section overstates the certainty of a key finding, contradicting the source material.\n- **Original sentence:** 'The study suggested that MST may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT.'\n- **Problem:** This statement is presented as a clear finding, but the source material for the results section states, 'It is also unclear if MST has an effect on memory and thinking skills.' Given the very low certainty of the evidence, the current wording could mislead readers.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'The study provided some weak evidence that MST may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT. However, the evidence was not clear, and we are very uncertain about this result.'\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Clarify the Finding on Cognitive Effects (Critical):** As noted above, the statement about memory and thinking needs to be revised to accurately reflect the high level of uncertainty. Please use the suggested rewrite to align the text with the source material.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Limitations Section:** The sentence explaining the limitations is a bit long and could be clearer.\n- **Original sentence:** 'We are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.'\n- **Problem:** At 32 words, this sentence combines two distinct reasons for the lack of confidence, making it harder to process.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is low. This is because we found only one small study, and it had flaws in its design. For example, people in the study may have known which treatment they were getting.'\n\n3.  **Reduce Repetition in the Results Section:** The phrase 'we are very uncertain' is used twice in close succession, which makes the text feel repetitive.\n- **Original text:** '...but we are very uncertain about the results. ... However, because the evidence comes from a single, small study, we are very uncertain about this result and cannot draw any firm conclusions.'\n- **Problem:** While emphasizing uncertainty is important, the repetition is stylistically weak.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** Combine these ideas into a stronger concluding statement for the paragraph, such as: 'However, all these findings come from a single, small study with design flaws. For this reason, we have very little confidence in the results and cannot draw any firm conclusions.'\n\nThe linguistic metrics for this draft are excellent, showing it aligns well with typical PLS patterns for readability. The key is to resolve the factual inconsistency to ensure readers are not misled.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 67% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. All metrics, including readability scores and sentence length, are within the expected ranges for a Plain Language Summary. The metrics do not indicate any significant structural or stylistic problems."
