    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if magnetic seizure therapy (using magnets to cause a seizure) is better, worse, or the same as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia.",
    "The single, small study we found suggested that magnetic seizure therapy may cause fewer problems with memory and thinking than ECT.",
    "Larger, well-designed studies are needed to provide clear answers about the benefits and harms of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia."

      "content": "Schizophrenia is a common and serious mental health condition. The main treatment is antipsychotic medication, but these medicines do not work for about 20% of people with schizophrenia, who need other treatment options. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer type of treatment that uses magnetic fields to stimulate the brain. It is being investigated as a potential treatment for people with schizophrenia."

      "content": "We searched for studies that compared magnetic seizure therapy with electroconvulsive therapy or other treatments for people with schizophrenia. We then compared and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review is based on one study that included 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy (subheading) plus standard care with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care. Due to a lack of reliable evidence from this single, small study, we do not know if MST is effective or safe for people with schizophrenia when compared to ECT. When compared with ECT, MST may make little to no difference to schizophrenia symptoms or to the number of people who stopped treatment early, but we are very uncertain about the results. It is also unclear if MST has an effect on memory and thinking skills. Because the evidence is very uncertain, we cannot draw any firm conclusions."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes, and it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search."
