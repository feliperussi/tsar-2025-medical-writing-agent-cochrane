  "plain_title": "Can TENS (a device that sends small electrical pulses through the skin) help relieve period pain?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Based on limited evidence, using a TENS device (a machine that sends small electrical pulses to the body through pads placed on the skin) may help to relieve period pain more than a dummy device or no treatment. The studies provided very little information about unwanted effects.",
    "It is not clear if one type of TENS is better than another for period pain, or if TENS is more effective than other treatments like painkillers.",
    "More and better-quality studies are needed to understand the true benefits and potential harms of TENS for period pain. Future research should also look at how TENS affects daily activities and the need for other pain-relieving medicines."

      "content": "Period pain (also known as primary dysmenorrhoea or menstrual cramps) is a common problem for many women. While medicines can be used to treat it, some people look for non-drug options. One of these options is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). A TENS machine is a small device that sends mild electrical currents to the body through sticky pads (electrodes) placed on the skin. This is intended to reduce pain. There are different types of TENS, such as high-frequency and low-frequency."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out how effective and safe TENS is for treating period pain. We compared TENS with a 'dummy' (placebo) treatment, no treatment, and other treatments for period pain."

      "content": "We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared using TENS for period pain against a fake treatment, no treatment, or other treatments. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review included 20 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 585 women between the ages of 12 and 49 with primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies compared high-frequency and low-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) with placebo, no treatment, or other treatments such as acupressure or common painkillers. For women with period pain, both high-frequency and low-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared with a pretend treatment or no treatment. It is unclear if high-frequency TENS has a different effect on pain compared with low-frequency TENS. It is also unclear if TENS has an effect on pain when compared to other treatments like acupressure or common painkillers. When comparing high-frequency TENS to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), TENS may make little to no difference to the occurrence of unwanted effects. For most other comparisons, there was not enough information to know about unwanted effects."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024."
