  "draft": "How accurate are lab tests for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the accuracy of common lab tests for vitamin A deficiency is uncertain. The available studies suggest that these tests often fail to find vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, but are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the condition.\n- The studies included in this review were not specifically designed to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic tests. Properly designed studies are needed to understand how well different lab tests can diagnose vitamin A deficiency.\n\nWhat is vitamin A deficiency?\nVitamin A is an essential nutrient that helps the body grow, fight infections, and maintain healthy eyesight. A lack of vitamin A, known as vitamin A deficiency, is a serious health problem. It can lead to poor growth, a weakened immune system, vision problems, and can increase the risk of death for mothers and children.\n\nHow is vitamin A deficiency diagnosed?\nHealth professionals can use laboratory tests, known as 'biomarkers', to measure the amount of vitamin A in a person's body. Some tests are considered very reliable for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency, but they can be complex or invasive. Other, simpler tests are more commonly used in practice to check for this condition.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how accurate the commonly used laboratory tests are for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency in people at risk. They wanted to compare the results of these simpler tests against the results of the more reliable, complex tests.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies that measured the accuracy of common laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency by comparing them to the most reliable tests. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 40 studies. The studies included people at risk for vitamin A deficiency, of any age or sex. The review looked at how accurate several laboratory tests are for finding out if a person has this condition. These tests included blood tests (for retinol and retinol-binding protein) and breast milk tests. The review compared these tests to the most accurate methods available.\n\nMain results: How accurate are laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency?\nThe available evidence shows that the tests often fail to find vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, meaning many cases may be missed. However, the tests are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the condition.\n\nFor example, when using a blood test for retinol compared to the most accurate methods, the test probably correctly identifies most people who do not have vitamin A deficiency. However, we do not know if this test can reliably find the condition in people who have it, as it may miss a large number of cases.\n\nTo put this in perspective, if 100 people at risk were tested, and 20 of them truly had a vitamin A deficiency:\n- the test would likely miss about 9 of the 20 people who actually have the condition; and\n- of the 80 people who do not have the deficiency, the test would wrongly suggest about 14 of them have it.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the included studies were not designed to find out how well these tests work for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency. Furthermore, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the available studies were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies published up to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are the use of unexplained technical terms and some inconsistent phrasing that could confuse readers. The feedback below focuses on the top 3 areas for improvement.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Explain or simplify technical terms.**\n\nThe summary introduces technical terms without explaining what they are, which could confuse readers.\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"These tests included blood tests (for retinol and retinol-binding protein) and breast milk tests.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** A lay reader is unlikely to know that \"retinol\" is another name for vitamin A, and \"retinol-binding protein\" is even more technical. This detail isn't necessary to understand the main findings.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"These tests included blood tests that measure levels of vitamin A (also called retinol) and a protein that carries it in the blood.\"\n\n**2. Use consistent terminology for the tests being compared.**\n\nThe summary uses several different phrases to describe the 'gold standard' tests, which could make it hard for a reader to follow the comparison.\n\n*   **Problematic Phrases:**\n    *   \"Some tests are considered **very reliable**...\"\n    *   \"...against the results of the **more reliable, complex tests**.\"\n    *   \"...comparing them to the **most reliable tests**.\"\n    *   \"...compared these tests to the **most accurate methods available**.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Switching between \"very reliable,\" \"more reliable,\" and \"most accurate\" is confusing. Using one clear, consistent term is better.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** Choose one term, like \"the most accurate tests,\" and use it every time you refer to the reference standard. For example: \"The review authors wanted to find out how accurate the commonly used laboratory tests are by comparing them to the most accurate tests available.\"\n\n**3. Make the language more direct and active.**\n\nSome sentences use passive voice or are unnecessarily wordy, which can make the text harder to read.\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The studies included in this review were not specifically designed to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic tests.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This is passive (\"were not designed\"). Active voice is more direct and engaging for readers.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies in this review did not set out to measure the accuracy of these diagnostic tests.\"\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"To put this in perspective, if 100 people at risk were tested, and 20 of them truly had a vitamin A deficiency...\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** \"were tested\" is passive. Phrasing this as an active scenario makes it easier to imagine.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"To put this in perspective, imagine health professionals test 100 people at risk, and 20 of them truly have a vitamin A deficiency...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows a mixed profile. While many readability scores and structural metrics fall within the best quartile for PLS texts (e.g., words_per_sentence, flesch_kincaid_grade), there is a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—'nouns', 'smog_index', 'complex_words_dc', 'complex_words', and 'long_words'—are in the P90 range, indicating the text uses more complex, long, and noun-heavy language than is typical. This data supports the editorial recommendation to simplify technical terms and use more direct, active language to improve clarity for a lay audience."
