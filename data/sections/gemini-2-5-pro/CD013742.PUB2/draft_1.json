  "draft": "How accurate are lab tests for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the accuracy of common lab tests for vitamin A deficiency is uncertain. The available studies suggest that these tests often fail to detect vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, but are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the deficiency.\n- The studies included in this review were not specifically designed to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic tests. Properly designed studies are needed to understand how well different lab tests can diagnose vitamin A deficiency.\n\nWhat is this review about?\nWhat is vitamin A deficiency?\nVitamin A is an essential nutrient that helps the body grow, fight infections, and maintain healthy eyesight. A lack of vitamin A, known as vitamin A deficiency, is a serious health problem. It can lead to poor growth, a weakened immune system, vision problems, and can increase the risk of death for mothers and children.\n\nHow is vitamin A deficiency diagnosed?\nHealth professionals can use laboratory tests, known as 'biomarkers', to measure the amount of vitamin A in a person's body. Some tests are considered very reliable for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency, but they can be complex or invasive. Other, simpler tests are more commonly used in practice to check for a deficiency.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how accurate the commonly used laboratory tests are for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency in people at risk. They wanted to compare the results of these simpler tests against the results of the more reliable, complex tests.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that measured the accuracy of common laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency by comparing them to the most reliable tests. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 40 studies. The studies included people at risk for vitamin A deficiency, of any age or sex. The review looked at how accurate several laboratory tests are for finding out if a person has vitamin A deficiency. These tests included blood tests (for retinol and retinol-binding protein) and breast milk tests. The review compared these tests to the most accurate methods available.\n\nMain results: How accurate are laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency?\nThe available evidence shows that the tests are often poor at correctly identifying people who have vitamin A deficiency, meaning many cases may be missed. However, the tests are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the deficiency.\n\nFor example, when using a blood test for retinol compared to the most accurate methods, the test probably correctly identifies most people who do not have vitamin A deficiency. However, we do not know if this test can reliably identify people who do have the deficiency, as it may miss a large number of cases.\n\nTo put this in perspective, if 100 people at risk were tested, and 20 of them truly had a vitamin A deficiency:\n• the test would likely miss about 9 of the 20 people who actually have the deficiency; and\n• of the 80 people who do not have the deficiency, the test would incorrectly suggest that about 14 of them do.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the included studies were not designed to find out how well these tests work for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency. Furthermore, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the available studies were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This summary is well-structured and factually accurate, but it needs a few revisions to improve clarity and fully align with the style guide. The main issues are two subheadings that are not phrased as questions, some complex vocabulary that is used frequently, and a couple of awkward sentences that could be clearer for a lay reader.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase subheadings as questions and simplify vocabulary.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions. Additionally, the summary uses long, technical-sounding words that make it harder to read.\n    *   **Problem:** The subheadings 'Methods' and 'Limitations of the evidence' are not questions. Separately, the word 'deficiency' is used 19 times, and phrases like 'correctly identifying people who have vitamin A deficiency' are long.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change the subheadings to 'What methods did we use?' and 'What are the limitations of the evidence?'. To simplify vocabulary, try replacing 'correctly identifying' with 'finding'. For example: 'The available evidence shows that the tests often fail to find vitamin A deficiency in people who have it...'.\n\n2.  **Clarify the evidence currency statement.** The final sentence is grammatically awkward and may confuse readers.\n    *   **Problem:** The sentence 'The evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.' is unclear.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please rewrite this for clarity. A better option would be: 'We searched for studies published up to August 2022.'\n\n3.  **Improve the clarity of the numerical example.** The example explaining the test's accuracy is a great idea, but the wording could be more direct.\n    *   **Problem:** The phrase 'incorrectly suggest that about 14 of them do' is indirect and uses passive-like phrasing.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase for directness. For example: 'Of the 80 people who do not have the deficiency, the test would wrongly suggest about 14 of them have it.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nThe need for these changes is supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the draft has high scores for complex words, long words, and the SMOG readability index. Addressing the points above will help make the text easier for a lay audience to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with over 72% of features falling in the best quartile. However, there are significant deviations in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—nouns, smog_index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words—are in the P90 range, indicating the text uses more complex, long, and unfamiliar words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This supports the editorial recommendation to simplify vocabulary."
