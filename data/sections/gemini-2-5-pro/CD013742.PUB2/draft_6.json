  "draft": "How accurate are lab tests for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of strong evidence, the accuracy of common lab tests for vitamin A deficiency is uncertain. The available studies suggest that these tests often fail to find vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, but are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the condition.\n- The studies we found were not designed to measure how accurate these tests are. Properly designed studies are needed to understand how well different lab tests can diagnose vitamin A deficiency.\n\nWhat is vitamin A deficiency?\nVitamin A is an essential nutrient that helps the body grow, fight infections, and maintain healthy eyesight. A lack of vitamin A, known as vitamin A deficiency, is a serious health problem. It can lead to poor growth, a weakened immune system, vision problems, and can increase the risk of death for mothers and children.\n\nHow is vitamin A deficiency diagnosed?\nHealth professionals can use laboratory tests, known as 'biomarkers', to measure the amount of vitamin A in a person's body. The most accurate tests for vitamin A deficiency can be complex or invasive (meaning they require a tissue sample). Other, simpler tests are more commonly used in practice to check for this condition.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how accurate the commonly used laboratory tests are for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency in people at risk. We wanted to compare the results of these simpler tests against the results of the most accurate tests.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies that measured the accuracy of common laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency by comparing them to the most accurate tests. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 40 studies. The studies included people at risk for vitamin A deficiency, of any age or sex. We looked at the accuracy of several laboratory tests for diagnosing this condition. These tests included blood tests that measure levels of vitamin A (also called retinol) and a protein that carries it in the blood, as well as breast milk tests. We compared these tests to the most accurate tests available.\n\nMain results: How accurate are laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency?\nThe tests often fail to find vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, meaning many cases may be missed. However, the tests are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the condition.\n\nFor example, when using a blood test for vitamin A (retinol) compared to the most accurate tests, the test probably correctly identifies most people who do not have vitamin A deficiency. However, this test is not reliable for finding the condition in people who have it, because it misses many cases.\n\nTo put this in perspective, imagine a group of 100 people at risk, where 20 of them truly have vitamin A deficiency:\n- Of the 20 people with the deficiency, the test would likely miss 9 cases.\n- Of the 80 people without the deficiency, the test would wrongly diagnose 14 of them as having it.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies we found were not designed to measure how well these tests work for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency. Furthermore, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the available studies were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

The feedback below focuses on 3 key areas to make the text even clearer and more direct for a lay audience. The suggested changes will help address the higher-than-usual number of complex words and nouns identified in the linguistic analysis.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Simplify the explanation of how vitamin A deficiency is diagnosed.**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"Health professionals can use laboratory tests, known as 'biomarkers', to measure the amount of vitamin A in a person's body. The most accurate tests for vitamin A deficiency can be complex or invasive (meaning they require a tissue sample). Other, simpler tests are more commonly used in practice to check for this condition.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The term 'biomarkers' is unnecessary jargon for this audience. The description of the tests is a bit abstract and could be more direct.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"To see if someone has vitamin A deficiency, health professionals can use lab tests to measure the amount of vitamin A in their body. The most accurate tests can be complex or invasive (for example, requiring a small piece of tissue). Because of this, simpler tests, like blood tests, are used more often.\"\n\n**2. Remove repetition in the main results section to improve clarity.**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"The tests often fail to find vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, meaning many cases may be missed. However, the tests are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the condition. For example, when using a blood test for vitamin A (retinol) compared to the most accurate tests, the test probably correctly identifies most people who do not have vitamin A deficiency. However, this test is not reliable for finding the condition in people who have it, because it misses many cases.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The first two sentences state the main finding, and the next two sentences repeat the same information. This repetition can make the key message less impactful.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The tests often miss cases of vitamin A deficiency in people who have it. However, they are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the condition. For example, a common blood test for vitamin A is not reliable for finding the condition because it misses many cases, but it does correctly identify most people who are not deficient.\"\n\n**3.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 61% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, the analysis also flags several vocabulary metrics as deviating from the norm (P90 range), including the SMOG index, complex words, long words, and noun count. This suggests that while the sentence structure is clear, the word choice could be simplified to further improve reader understanding, which aligns with the editorial feedback provided."
