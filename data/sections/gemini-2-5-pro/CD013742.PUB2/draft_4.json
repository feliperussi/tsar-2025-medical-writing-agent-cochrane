  "draft": "How accurate are lab tests for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of strong evidence, the accuracy of common lab tests for vitamin A deficiency is uncertain. The available studies suggest that these tests often fail to find vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, but are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the condition.\n- The studies we found did not set out to measure the accuracy of these diagnostic tests. Properly designed studies are needed to understand how well different lab tests can diagnose vitamin A deficiency.\n\nWhat is vitamin A deficiency?\nVitamin A is an essential nutrient that helps the body grow, fight infections, and maintain healthy eyesight. A lack of vitamin A, known as vitamin A deficiency, is a serious health problem. It can lead to poor growth, a weakened immune system, vision problems, and can increase the risk of death for mothers and children.\n\nHow is vitamin A deficiency diagnosed?\nHealth professionals can use laboratory tests, known as 'biomarkers', to measure the amount of vitamin A in a person's body. Some tests are considered the most accurate for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency, but they can be complex or require tissue samples. Other, simpler tests are more commonly used in practice to check for this condition.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how accurate the commonly used laboratory tests are for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency in people at risk. We wanted to compare the results of these simpler tests against the results of the most accurate tests.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies that measured the accuracy of common laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency by comparing them to the most accurate tests. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 40 studies. The studies included people at risk for vitamin A deficiency, of any age or sex. We looked at the accuracy of several laboratory tests for diagnosing this condition. These tests included blood tests that measure levels of vitamin A (also called retinol) and a protein that carries it in the blood, as well as breast milk tests. We compared these tests to the most accurate tests available.\n\nMain results: How accurate are laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency?\nThe available evidence shows that the tests often fail to find vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, meaning many cases may be missed. However, the tests are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the condition.\n\nFor example, when using a blood test for vitamin A (retinol) compared to the most accurate tests, the test probably correctly identifies most people who do not have vitamin A deficiency. However, this test is not reliable for finding the condition in people who have it, because it misses many cases.\n\nTo put this in perspective, imagine health professionals test 100 people at risk, and 20 of them truly have a vitamin A deficiency:\n– the test would likely miss about 9 of the 20 people who actually have the condition; and\n– of the 80 people who do not have the deficiency, the test would wrongly suggest about 14 of them have it.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies we found did not set out to measure how well these tests work for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency. Furthermore, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the available studies were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies published up to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that clearly explains a complex topic. The structure is excellent and all key information is present and accurate. I have three main suggestions to make the text even more accessible for a lay audience by simplifying some of the wording and phrasing.\n\n1. **Replace formal or clinical language with simpler, everyday words.** The goal is to reduce the cognitive load on the reader. This is particularly important as the vocabulary metrics are higher than usual for a PLS.\n\n   - **Quote:** \"Some tests are considered the most accurate for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency, but they can be complex or require tissue samples.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrases \"considered the most accurate\" and \"require tissue samples\" are a bit formal and clinical.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this as: \"The most accurate tests for vitamin A deficiency can be complex or invasive.\"\n\n2. **Make the example of test accuracy easier to understand.** The example is a great way to explain sensitivity and specificity, but the numbers can be confusing. Framing it more directly can improve clarity.\n\n   - **Quote:** \"– the test would likely miss about 9 of the 20 people who actually have the condition; and\\n– of the 80 people who do not have the deficiency, the test would wrongly suggest about 14 of them have it.\"\n   - **Problem:** The two bullet points describe different concepts (missed cases vs. wrong diagnoses) which can be hard to track.\n   - **Suggestion:** Combine these ideas into a more direct summary. For example: \"This means that out of 100 people tested, the test would likely miss 9 cases of vitamin A deficiency and wrongly diagnose 14 people who do not have the condition.\"\n\n3. **Remove unnecessary introductory phrases to be more direct.** Wordy lead-ins can make sentences longer and harder to process.\n\n   - **Quote:** \"The available evidence shows that the tests often fail to find vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, meaning many cases may be missed.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"The available evidence shows that...\" adds length without adding essential meaning for the reader.\n   - **Suggestion:** Be more direct: \"The tests often fail to find vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, meaning many cases may be missed.\"\n\nThese changes will help address the vocabulary complexity highlighted in the evaluation report and make an already good summary even better.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is well-structured, with good sentence length and use of active voice, placing 61% of its features in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics, including the SMOG index, complex words, long words, and noun count, are in the P90 range, indicating the language is more technical and dense than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
