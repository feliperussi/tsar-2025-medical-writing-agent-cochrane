  "draft": "How accurate are lab tests for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the accuracy of common lab tests for vitamin A deficiency is uncertain. The available studies suggest that these tests often fail to find vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, but are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the condition.\n- The studies in this review did not set out to measure the accuracy of these diagnostic tests. Properly designed studies are needed to understand how well different lab tests can diagnose vitamin A deficiency.\n\nWhat is vitamin A deficiency?\nVitamin A is an essential nutrient that helps the body grow, fight infections, and maintain healthy eyesight. A lack of vitamin A, known as vitamin A deficiency, is a serious health problem. It can lead to poor growth, a weakened immune system, vision problems, and can increase the risk of death for mothers and children.\n\nHow is vitamin A deficiency diagnosed?\nHealth professionals can use laboratory tests, known as 'biomarkers', to measure the amount of vitamin A in a person's body. Some tests are considered the most accurate for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency, but they can be complex or invasive. Other, simpler tests are more commonly used in practice to check for this condition.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how accurate the commonly used laboratory tests are for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency in people at risk. They wanted to compare the results of these simpler tests against the results of the most accurate tests.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies that measured the accuracy of common laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency by comparing them to the most accurate tests. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 40 studies. The studies included people at risk for vitamin A deficiency, of any age or sex. The review looked at how accurate several laboratory tests are for finding out if a person has this condition. These tests included blood tests that measure levels of vitamin A (also called retinol) and a protein that carries it in the blood, as well as breast milk tests. The review compared these tests to the most accurate tests available.\n\nMain results: How accurate are laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency?\nThe available evidence shows that the tests often fail to find vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, meaning many cases may be missed. However, the tests are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the condition.\n\nFor example, when using a blood test for vitamin A (retinol) compared to the most accurate tests, the test probably correctly identifies most people who do not have vitamin A deficiency. However, we do not know if this test can reliably find the condition in people who have it, as it may miss a large number of cases.\n\nTo put this in perspective, imagine health professionals test 100 people at risk, and 20 of them truly have a vitamin A deficiency:\n- the test would likely miss about 9 of the 20 people who actually have the condition; and\n- of the 80 people who do not have the deficiency, the test would wrongly suggest about 14 of them have it.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies in this review did not set out to measure how well these tests work for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency. Furthermore, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the available studies were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies published up to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity and align with Cochrane style before approval. The main issues are inconsistent use of pronouns ('we' vs. 'the review authors'), some wordy phrasing, and more complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Addressing these points will make the summary more direct and easier for readers to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use 'we' consistently instead of 'the review authors'.**\n   - **The issue:** The summary is inconsistent, sometimes using 'we' and other times using 'the review authors'. The Cochrane style guide requires using 'we' to create a more direct and personal tone.\n   - **Example from the draft:** \"What did the review authors want to find out? The review authors wanted to find out how accurate the commonly used laboratory tests are...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out how accurate the commonly used laboratory tests are...\"\n\n2. **Simplify wordy phrases and complex terms.**\n   - **The issue:** Some sentences are longer than they need to be, and some words may be unfamiliar to a lay audience. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows higher-than-typical counts for complex and long words.\n   - **Example 1 from the draft:** \"The review looked at how accurate several laboratory tests are for finding out if a person has this condition.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite 1:** \"We looked at the accuracy of several laboratory tests for diagnosing this condition.\"\n   - **Example 2 from the draft:** \"...but they can be complex or invasive.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite 2:** \"...but they can be complex or require tissue samples.\"\n\n3. **Make the main result statement more direct.**\n   - **The issue:** The sentence introducing the main result is slightly hesitant and vague. Making it more direct will strengthen the message, which is then well-supported by the excellent numerical example that follows.\n   - **Example from the draft:** \"However, we do not know if this test can reliably find the condition in people who have it, as it may miss a large number of cases.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"However, this test is not reliable for finding the condition in people who have it, because it misses many cases.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft has excellent readability scores, with very short, clear sentences (e.g., 'words_per_sentence' and multiple readability indices are in the best 25% of the corpus). However, the analysis also flags significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—'nouns', 'smog_index', 'complex_words_dc', 'complex_words', and 'long_words'—are in the P90 range, indicating the word choice is more complex and noun-heavy than is typical for a PLS. This supports the editorial feedback to simplify wordy phrases and replace complex terms."
