  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, the accuracy of common lab tests for vitamin A deficiency is uncertain. The available studies suggest that these tests often fail to detect vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, but are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the deficiency.",
    "The studies included in this review were not specifically designed to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic tests. Properly designed studies are needed to understand how well different lab tests can diagnose vitamin A deficiency."

      "subheading": "What is vitamin A deficiency?",
      "content": "Vitamin A is an essential nutrient that helps the body grow, fight infections, and maintain healthy eyesight. A lack of vitamin A, known as vitamin A deficiency, is a serious health problem. It can lead to poor growth, a weakened immune system, vision problems, and can increase the risk of death for mothers and children."

    {
      "subheading": "How is vitamin A deficiency diagnosed?",
      "content": "Health professionals can use laboratory tests, known as 'biomarkers', to measure the amount of vitamin A in a person's body. Some tests are considered very reliable for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency, but they can be complex or invasive. Other, simpler tests are more commonly used in practice to check for a deficiency."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out how accurate the commonly used laboratory tests are for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency in people at risk. They wanted to compare the results of these simpler tests against the results of the more reliable, complex tests."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that measured the accuracy of common laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency by comparing them to the most reliable tests. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 40 studies. The studies included people at risk for vitamin A deficiency, of any age or sex. The review looked at how accurate several laboratory tests are for finding out if a person has vitamin A deficiency. These tests included blood tests (for retinol and retinol-binding protein) and breast milk tests. The review compared these tests to the most accurate methods available."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: How accurate are laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency?",
      "content": "The available evidence shows that the tests are often poor at correctly identifying people who have vitamin A deficiency, meaning many cases may be missed. However, the tests are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the deficiency.\n\nFor example, when using a blood test for retinol compared to the most accurate methods, the test probably correctly identifies most people who do not have vitamin A deficiency. However, we do not know if this test can reliably identify people who do have the deficiency, as it may miss a large number of cases.\n\nTo put this in perspective, if 100 people at risk were tested, and 20 of them truly had a vitamin A deficiency:\n• the test would likely miss about 9 of the 20 people who actually have the deficiency; and\n• of the 80 people who do not have the deficiency, the test would incorrectly suggest that about 14 of them do."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the included studies were not designed to find out how well these tests work for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency. Furthermore, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the available studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search."
