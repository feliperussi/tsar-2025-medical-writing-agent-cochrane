  "draft": "How accurate are lab tests for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of strong evidence, the accuracy of common lab tests for vitamin A deficiency is uncertain. The available studies suggest that these tests often fail to find vitamin A deficiency in people who have it, but are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the condition.\n- The studies we found were not designed to measure how accurate these tests are. Properly designed studies are needed to understand how well different lab tests can diagnose vitamin A deficiency.\n\nWhat is vitamin A deficiency?\nVitamin A is an essential nutrient that helps the body grow, fight infections, and maintain healthy eyesight. A lack of vitamin A, known as vitamin A deficiency, is a serious health problem. It can lead to poor growth, a weakened immune system, vision problems, and can increase the risk of death for mothers and children.\n\nHow is vitamin A deficiency diagnosed?\nTo see if someone has vitamin A deficiency, health professionals can use lab tests to measure the amount of vitamin A in their body. The most accurate tests can be complex or invasive (for example, requiring a small piece of tissue). Because of this, simpler tests, like blood tests, are used more often.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how accurate the commonly used laboratory tests are for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency in people at risk. We wanted to compare the results of these simpler tests against the results of the most accurate tests.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies that measured the accuracy of common laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency by comparing them to the most accurate tests. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 40 studies. The studies included people at risk for vitamin A deficiency, of any age or sex. We looked at the accuracy of several laboratory tests for diagnosing this condition. These tests included blood tests that measure levels of vitamin A (also called retinol) and a protein that carries it in the blood, as well as breast milk tests. We compared these tests to the most accurate tests available.\n\nMain results: How accurate are laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency?\nThe tests often miss cases of vitamin A deficiency in people who have it. However, they are better at correctly identifying people who do not have the condition. For example, a common blood test for vitamin A is not reliable for finding the condition because it misses many cases, but it does correctly identify most people who are not deficient.\n\nTo explain what this means, imagine a group of 100 people are tested, and 20 of them really have vitamin A deficiency:\n- Of the 20 people who have the deficiency, the test would correctly find 11 but miss 9 (these are called 'false negatives').\n- Of the 80 people who do not have the deficiency, the test would correctly clear 66 but wrongly suggest 14 have it (these are called 'false positives').\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies we found were not designed to measure how well these tests work for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency. Furthermore, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the available studies were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

An impressive 78% of its features, including all readability scores and sentence length, fall within the best quartile for clarity and simplicity. The draft deviates from typical patterns on only two metrics: noun count (`nouns`) and use of less common words (`complex_words_dc`). However, these deviations are likely justified by the technical nature of the topic, which requires specific terminology. The excellent readability scores confirm that the use of short sentences effectively balances the necessary complex vocabulary, making the text accessible."
