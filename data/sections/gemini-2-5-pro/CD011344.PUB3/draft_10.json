  "draft": "For epidural pain relief during labour, which method is better: automatic, timed injections or a continuous drip?\n\nKey messages\n- For women in labour, automatic, timed injections for an epidural (pain relief in the back) likely cause less 'breakthrough pain' than a continuous drip. Breakthrough pain is pain severe enough to require a specialist pain doctor (an anaesthesiologist) to step in. Automatic, timed injections also use less pain-relieving medicine.\n- The delivery method probably does not affect whether a woman needs a caesarean delivery, or a birth using forceps or a vacuum device. Women who received automatic, timed injections may have been happier with how their pain was managed. The baby's health immediately after birth was similar for both methods.\n- We need larger studies to be more certain about how these two methods affect the need for a caesarean delivery, or a birth using forceps or a vacuum device.\n\nWhat is epidural pain relief for labour?\nAn epidural is a common way to relieve pain during labour and childbirth. It involves a specialist pain doctor placing a tiny tube in the lower back to deliver pain-killing medicine near the nerves that sense pain from the uterus. They can deliver this medicine in two main ways. One method is a continuous, slow drip. Another method gives the medicine in timed doses, like an injection every hour (automatic, timed injections). Often, women can also give themselves an extra dose of medicine if they need it.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which method of giving an epidural – the continuous drip or automatic, timed injections – is better and safer for women during labour. We wanted to know which method was more effective at preventing 'breakthrough pain' (pain severe enough that it requires a specialist pain doctor to step in). We also wanted to see if the delivery method affected the need for a caesarean delivery, or a birth using forceps or a vacuum device.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared a continuous drip with automatic, timed injections for epidural pain relief during labour. We compared and combined the results from these studies and used a standard system to rate how certain we are about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that included a total of 4590 healthy women. In 13 studies, the women were having their first baby. The other 5 studies included both first-time mothers and women who had given birth before. All studies excluded women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The studies compared giving pain relief as a continuous drip versus giving it as automatic, timed injections.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a continuous drip, women who get automatic, timed injections for an epidural probably need a specialist pain doctor less often to manage breakthrough pain. This means that for every 100 women using a continuous drip, about 28 might need extra help for pain, compared to only about 20 women using automatic, timed injections. Women who received automatic, timed injections also probably used less pain relief medicine and may have been happier with how their pain was managed. We found the delivery method probably makes little to no difference to how many women have a caesarean delivery or a birth using forceps or a vacuum device, or to how long labour lasts.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in our findings. Our confidence is not higher because of how some of the studies were designed. For example, in some studies, women and staff knew which pain relief method was being used. This knowledge could have unintentionally influenced their reports on pain or satisfaction, making the results less reliable. Also, the studies used different pain relief medicines and delivery methods, and we do not have enough evidence to be certain about some of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. We searched for evidence up to December 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it is not approved because several patterns of style reduce readability and clarity for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make the Limitations section more direct and use active voice.** The current phrasing is vague and uses passive voice, which can be confusing for readers.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** 'Our confidence is not higher because of how some of the studies were designed. For example, in some studies, women and staff knew which pain relief method was being used.'\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** 'We are only moderately confident in our findings because of weaknesses in some study designs. For example, in some studies, women and staff knew which pain relief method they were using.'\n\n2. **Simplify the definition of the key term 'breakthrough pain'.** The current definition is a bit wordy and formal, which can be a barrier to understanding this central concept.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** 'Breakthrough pain is pain severe enough to require a specialist pain doctor (an anaesthesiologist) to step in.'\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** 'Breakthrough pain is pain so severe that a specialist pain doctor (an anaesthesiologist) needs to give extra help.'\n\n3. **Improve conciseness by removing repetition.** The 'What did we want to find out?' section repeats the opening phrase, making it less engaging and slightly redundant.\n    - **Problematic sentences:** 'We wanted to find out which method... We wanted to know which method...'\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** 'We wanted to find out which method of giving an epidural is better and safer for women during labour. We also looked at whether the method was more effective at preventing 'breakthrough pain' and if it affected the chance of needing a caesarean delivery.'\n\nAddressing these points will help simplify the language and sentence structures, making the summary easier for patients to understand. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which shows a high number of passive voice constructions and complex words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 67% of features falling in the best quartile for readability (e.g., sentence length, Flesch-Kincaid grade). However, five metrics deviate significantly, falling in the 90th percentile range. These include a high number of passive voice constructions (21), a high density of nouns (188), and a high number of complex words (119), which contribute to a high SMOG index (13.7). This suggests that while the overall structure is good, the vocabulary and specific sentence constructions could be simplified to improve clarity for a lay audience."
