  "draft": "For epidural pain relief during labour, which method is better: automatic, timed injections or a continuous drip?\n\nKey messages\n- For women in labour, using automatic,timed injections for an epidural (an injection of pain-relieving medicine into the back) seems to result in less 'breakthrough pain' (pain needing extra attention from an anaesthesiologist) and uses less pain-relieving medicine compared to a continuous drip. The epidural delivery method did not appear to affect the chances of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery (one using forceps or a vacuum device).\n- Women who received automatic, timed injections may have been more satisfied with their pain relief, and the two methods did not differ in their effect on the baby's health immediately after birth.\n- Researchers need to conduct larger studies to be more certain about the effects of these two methods on the chances of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery.\n\nWhat is epidural pain relief for labour?\nAn epidural is a common way to relieve pain during labour and childbirth. It involves placing a tiny tube in the lower back to deliver pain-killing medicine (local anaesthetics) near the nerves that sense pain from the uterus. An anaesthesiologist can deliver this medicine in two main ways. One method is a continuous, slow drip, known as a 'basal infusion' (BI). Another method gives the medicine in timed doses, like an injection every hour, which we call an 'automated mandatory bolus' (AMB). Often, women can also give themselves an extra dose of medicine if they feel they need it.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which method of giving an epidural – the continuous drip (BI) or the timed doses (AMB) – is better and safer for women during labour. We were interested in which method was more effective at preventing severe pain that requires an anaesthesiologist to step in (known as 'breakthrough pain'). We also wanted to see if the delivery method affected the chances of needing a caesarean delivery, or an instrumental delivery (where forceps or a vacuum cup are used to help deliver the baby).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared two ways of giving epidural pain relief during labor: automated regular injections versus a continuous drip. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 18 studies with a total of 4590 women. The participants were either healthy women having their first baby (in 13 studies) or a mix of women having their first baby and those who had given birth before (in 5 studies). All studies excluded women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The studies compared two ways of giving pain relief during labour: using an automated pump for timed bursts of medicine versus using a continuous slow drip.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a continuous drip, using an automated bolus for epidural pain relief in labour probably reduces the need for an anaesthesiologist to manage breakthrough pain. For every 100 women using a continuous drip who might need extra help for pain, about 28 would need it, compared to only about 20 of every 100 women using an automated bolus. An automated bolus probably also slightly reduces the amount of pain relief medication women use and may improve a mother's satisfaction with her pain relief. It probably makes little to no difference to the number of caesarean or instrumental deliveries (births needing forceps or vacuum), or to the length of labour.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate. This is because of concerns about how the studies were conducted, as people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, the studies used different ways of delivering the pain relief, and we do not have enough studies to be certain about some of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to December 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. The following 3 improvements will make the key messages even clearer for readers.\n\n1. **Make the limitations easier to understand by using active voice.** The current phrasing is a bit vague and passive, which can make it hard for readers to grasp the potential weaknesses in the evidence.\n- **Current sentence:** 'This is because of concerns about how the studies were conducted, as people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting.'\n- **Suggestion:** Rewrite this more directly, for example: 'Our confidence is moderate because some studies had weaknesses in their methods. For example, in some studies it was possible for women or staff to know which pain relief method was being used, which could have influenced the results.'\n\n2. **Use one consistent, simple term for the 'automatic injection' method.** The draft uses several different phrases ('automatic, timed injections', 'timed doses', 'automated mandatory bolus', 'automated bolus'), which can be confusing for a reader trying to follow the comparison.\n- **Current phrases:** 'automatic, timed injections', 'timed doses', 'automated mandatory bolus (AMB)', 'automated bolus'\n- **Suggestion:** Choose one simple term, like 'automatic injections', define it once, and use it consistently throughout the summary. For example: 'Another method gives the medicine in timed doses, like an injection every hour (automatic injections).'\n\n3. **Simplify the sentence explaining the main result for breakthrough pain.** The current sentence is long (35 words) and its structure makes the key comparison less immediate.\n- **Current sentence:** 'For every 100 women using a continuous drip who might need extra help for pain, about 28 would need it, compared to only about 20 of every 100 women using an automated bolus.'\n- **Suggestion:** Rephrase this to state the main point first: 'This means that for every 100 women, about 8 fewer would need extra help for pain when using automatic injections compared to a continuous drip (20 women instead of 28).'\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which noted a higher-than-typical number of passive sentences and complex words. Addressing these points will significantly improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms with typical patterns, with 72% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and style. However, it deviates in five areas, notably showing a higher-than-typical use of passive voice (19 instances vs. a median of 13) and complex words (116 instances vs. a median of 84). These metrics suggest the text could be made more direct and easier to read by simplifying vocabulary and converting passive sentences to active ones."
