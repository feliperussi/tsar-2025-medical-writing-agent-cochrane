  "draft": "For epidural pain relief during labour, which method is better: automatic, timed injections or a continuous drip?\n\nKey messages\n- For women in labour, automatic, timed injections for an epidural (pain relief in the back) likely cause less 'breakthrough pain' than a continuous drip. Breakthrough pain is pain that needs extra attention from an anaesthesiologist (a specialist pain doctor). This method also uses less pain-relieving medicine.\n- The way the medicine was delivered probably does not change a woman's chance of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery (a birth using forceps or a vacuum device). Women who received automatic, timed injections may have been more satisfied with their pain relief. The baby's health immediately after birth was similar for both methods.\n- We need larger studies to be more certain about how these two methods affect the need for a caesarean or instrumental delivery.\n\nWhat is epidural pain relief for labour?\nAn epidural is a common way to relieve pain during labour and childbirth. It involves an anaesthesiologist placing a tiny tube in the lower back to deliver pain-killing medicine (local anaesthetics) near the nerves that sense pain from the uterus. They can deliver this medicine in two main ways. One method is a continuous, slow drip. Another method gives the medicine in timed doses, like an injection every hour (automatic, timed injections). Often, women can also give themselves an extra dose of medicine if they need it.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which method of giving an epidural – the continuous drip or automatic, timed injections – is better and safer for women during labour. We wanted to know which method was more effective at preventing severe pain that requires an anaesthesiologist to step in (known as 'breakthrough pain'). We also wanted to see if the delivery method affected the need for a caesarean delivery, or an instrumental delivery (where forceps or a vacuum cup help deliver the baby).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared a continuous drip with automatic, timed injections for epidural pain relief during labour. We compared and combined the results from these studies and used a standard system to rate how certain we are about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that included a total of 4590 healthy women. In 13 studies, the women were having their first baby. The other 5 studies included both first-time mothers and women who had given birth before. All studies excluded women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The studies compared giving pain relief as a continuous drip versus giving it as automatic, timed injections.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a continuous drip, women who get automatic, timed injections for an epidural probably need an anaesthesiologist less often to manage breakthrough pain. This means that for every 100 women using a continuous drip, about 28 might need extra help for pain, compared to only about 20 women using automatic, timed injections. Women who received automatic, timed injections also probably used less pain relief medicine and may have been more satisfied with their pain relief. We found the delivery method probably makes little to no difference to how many women have a caesarean or instrumental delivery, or to how long labour lasts.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate because some studies had weaknesses in their methods. For example, in some studies, women and staff knew which pain relief method was being used. This knowledge could have influenced their opinions on pain or satisfaction. The studies also used different types of pain relief medicine and delivery methods, and we do not have enough evidence to be certain about some of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. We searched for evidence up to December 2022.",

Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Clarify the 'Limitations' section.** The current explanation is a bit vague and uses jargon that may not be clear to a lay audience.\n    *   **Current text:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is moderate because some studies had weaknesses in their methods. For example, in some studies, women and staff knew which pain relief method was being used. This knowledge could have influenced their opinions on pain or satisfaction.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** 'Weaknesses in their methods' is not plain language. The connection between staff knowing the method and the evidence being less certain could be made more explicit.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We are moderately confident in our findings. Our confidence is not higher because of how some of the studies were designed. For example, in some studies, it was possible for women and staff to know which pain relief method was being used. This awareness could have influenced their reports on pain or satisfaction.'\n\n2. **Use more active voice in the 'Key messages'.** Some key findings are phrased passively, which makes them less direct and harder to process.\n    *   **Current text:** 'The way the medicine was delivered probably does not change a woman's chance of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery...'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is indirect.

A more direct definition would be clearer.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Breakthrough pain is pain severe enough that it requires an anaesthesiologist (a specialist pain doctor) to step in.'\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows a high number of passive voice constructions and complex words compared to typical plain language summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows that while the draft conforms well to typical patterns in many areas (66.7% of features are in the best quartile), there are significant deviations that impact clarity. The draft has a high number of passive voice constructions (P90), nouns (P90), and complex words (P90). These metrics support the editorial feedback to use more active voice and simplify vocabulary, particularly in the limitations section, to improve overall readability."
