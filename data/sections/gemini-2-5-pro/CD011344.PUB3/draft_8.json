  "draft": "For epidural pain relief during labour, which method is better: automatic, timed injections or a continuous drip?\n\nKey messages\n- For women in labour, automatic, timed injections for an epidural (pain relief in the back) likely cause less 'breakthrough pain' than a continuous drip. Breakthrough pain is pain severe enough to require an anaesthesiologist (a specialist pain doctor) to step in. This method also uses less pain-relieving medicine.\n- The delivery method probably does not change a woman's chance of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery (a birth using forceps or a vacuum device). Women who received automatic, timed injections may have been more satisfied with their pain relief. The baby's health immediately after birth was similar for both methods.\n- We need larger studies to be more certain about how these two methods affect the need for a caesarean or instrumental delivery.\n\nWhat is epidural pain relief for labour?\nAn epidural is a common way to relieve pain during labour and childbirth. It involves an anaesthesiologist placing a tiny tube in the lower back to deliver pain-killing medicine (local anaesthetics) near the nerves that sense pain from the uterus. They can deliver this medicine in two main ways. One method is a continuous, slow drip. Another method gives the medicine in timed doses, like an injection every hour (automatic, timed injections). Often, women can also give themselves an extra dose of medicine if they need it.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which method of giving an epidural – the continuous drip or automatic, timed injections – is better and safer for women during labour. We wanted to know which method was more effective at preventing 'breakthrough pain' (pain severe enough that it requires an anaesthesiologist to step in). We also wanted to see if the delivery method affected the need for a caesarean delivery, or an instrumental delivery (where forceps or a vacuum cup help deliver the baby).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared a continuous drip with automatic, timed injections for epidural pain relief during labour. We compared and combined the results from these studies and used a standard system to rate how certain we are about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that included a total of 4590 healthy women. In 13 studies, the women were having their first baby. The other 5 studies included both first-time mothers and women who had given birth before. All studies excluded women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The studies compared giving pain relief as a continuous drip versus giving it as automatic, timed injections.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a continuous drip, women who get automatic, timed injections for an epidural probably need an anaesthesiologist less often to manage breakthrough pain. This means that for every 100 women using a continuous drip, about 28 might need extra help for pain, compared to only about 20 women using automatic, timed injections. Women who received automatic, timed injections also probably used less pain relief medicine and may have been more satisfied with their pain relief. We found the delivery method probably makes little to no difference to how many women have a caesarean or instrumental delivery, or to how long labour lasts.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in our findings. Our confidence is not higher because of how some of the studies were designed. For example, in some studies, it was possible for women and staff to know which pain relief method was being used. This awareness could have influenced their reports on pain or satisfaction. Also, the studies used different pain relief medicines and delivery methods, and we do not have enough evidence to be certain about some of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. We searched for evidence up to December 2022.",

However, it is not approved because of several clarity issues related to complex vocabulary and phrasing that could confuse readers. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make the Key Messages crystal clear.** The second bullet point starts with an ambiguous phrase that forces the reader to look back.\n    *   **Problem:** 'This method also uses less pain-relieving medicine.'\n    *   **Reason:** It's not immediately clear which method 'This method' refers to.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase to be explicit: 'Automatic, timed injections also use less pain-relieving medicine.'\n\n2. **Simplify technical terms, even when defined.** The summary uses some medical terms that could be replaced with simpler language.\n    *   **Problem:** '...deliver pain-killing medicine (local anaesthetics)...'\n    *   **Reason:** The term 'local anaesthetics' adds complexity without adding meaning for a lay reader, as 'pain-killing medicine' is sufficient.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Remove the parenthetical: '...deliver pain-killing medicine near the nerves...'\n    *   **Also consider:** After defining 'anaesthesiologist' as a 'specialist pain doctor', you could use the simpler term in subsequent sentences to improve readability.\n\n3. **Use more direct, active language, especially in the limitations.** Some sentences rely on abstract nouns, making them harder to understand.\n    *   **Problem:** 'This awareness could have influenced their reports on pain or satisfaction.'\n    *   **Reason:** The word 'awareness' is an abstract noun. Using a direct verb makes the sentence clearer and more active.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite with an active verb: 'Knowing which pain relief method they received could have influenced how they reported their pain or satisfaction.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your draft is excellent on sentence length, but the linguistic analysis shows that the vocabulary is more complex than typical for a PLS (high scores for `complex_words`, `smog_index`, and `nouns`). The suggestions above will help address this and make the summary more accessible.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in sentence structure, with 72.2% of features in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Four metrics are in the P90 range: `nouns` (182), `smog_index` (14.0), `complex_words_dc` (252), and `complex_words` (122). This indicates the text uses more complex words, technical terms, and abstract nouns than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which could affect readability for a lay audience."
