  "draft": "For epidural pain relief during labour, which method is better: automatic, timed injections or a continuous drip?\n\nKey messages\n- For women in labour, automatic, timed injections for an epidural (pain relief in the back) likely cause less 'breakthrough pain' than a continuous drip. Breakthrough pain is pain that needs extra attention from an anaesthesiologist (a specialist pain doctor). This method also uses less pain-relieving medicine.\n- The delivery method did not seem to affect a woman's chance of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery (a birth using forceps or a vacuum device). Women who received automatic, timed injections may have been more satisfied with their pain relief. The baby's health immediately after birth was similar for both methods.\n- We need larger studies to be more certain about how these two methods affect the need for a caesarean or instrumental delivery.\n\nWhat is epidural pain relief for labour?\nAn epidural is a common way to relieve pain during labour and childbirth. It involves an anaesthesiologist placing a tiny tube in the lower back to deliver pain-killing medicine (local anaesthetics) near the nerves that sense pain from the uterus. They can deliver this medicine in two main ways. One method is a continuous, slow drip. Another method gives the medicine in timed doses, like an injection every hour (automatic, timed injections). Often, women can also give themselves an extra dose of medicine if they need it.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which method of giving an epidural – the continuous drip or automatic, timed injections – is better and safer for women during labour. We wanted to know which method was more effective at preventing severe pain that requires an anaesthesiologist to step in (known as 'breakthrough pain'). We also wanted to see if the delivery method affected the need for a caesarean delivery, or an instrumental delivery (where forceps or a vacuum cup help deliver the baby).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared a continuous drip with automatic, timed injections for epidural pain relief during labour. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 studies that included a total of 4590 healthy women. In 13 studies, the women were having their first baby. The other 5 studies included both first-time mothers and women who had given birth before. All studies excluded women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The studies compared giving pain relief as a continuous drip versus giving it as automatic, timed injections.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a continuous drip, women who get automatic, timed injections for an epidural probably need an anaesthesiologist less often to manage breakthrough pain. This means that for every 100 women using a continuous drip, about 28 might need extra help for pain, compared to only about 20 women using automatic, timed injections. Women who received automatic, timed injections also probably used less pain relief medicine and may have been more satisfied with their pain relief. The delivery method probably makes little to no difference to how many women have a caesarean or instrumental delivery, or to how long labour lasts.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate because some studies had weaknesses in their methods. For example, in some studies, it was not possible to hide which pain relief method women were getting from them or the staff. Knowing which method was used could have affected their answers about satisfaction or pain. The studies also used different types of pain relief medicine and delivery methods, and we do not have enough evidence to be certain about some of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. We searched for evidence up to December 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, a few revisions to simplify complex language and sentence structure will make it even clearer for readers. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify the explanation of study limitations.** The current wording is a bit technical and indirect.\n   - **Original sentence:** 'in some studies, it was not possible to hide which pain relief method women were getting from them or the staff. Knowing which method was used could have affected their answers about satisfaction or pain.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is clunky and uses a passive construction. It takes a moment for the reader to understand the concept of 'blinding' in research.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'For example, in some studies, women and staff knew which pain relief method was being used. This knowledge could have influenced their opinions on pain or satisfaction.'\n\n2. **Replace abstract phrases with more concrete language.** Some phrases, while technically correct, may be unclear to a lay audience.\n   - **Original sentence:** 'We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase 'rated our confidence in the evidence' is jargon. Readers may not understand what this means or why it's important.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'We compared and combined the results from these studies and used a standard system to rate how certain we are about the evidence.'\n\n3. **Make key findings more direct and active.** Some sentences are noun-heavy, which can make them less engaging and harder to process.\n   - **Original sentence:** 'The delivery method did not seem to affect a woman's chance of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery...'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is built around nouns ('delivery method', 'woman's chance'). Using more active verbs makes the finding clearer and more direct.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'We found that the way the medicine was delivered probably does not change a woman's chance of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery...'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour draft is very readable in terms of sentence length (16 words/sentence). The areas for improvement noted above are reflected in the linguistic analysis, which found the text has more complex vocabulary (SMOG Index, Complex Words) and more nouns than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Addressing these points will improve clarity and better align the text with PLS best practices.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72% of features falling in the best quartile for readability, including excellent sentence length and high use of pronouns. However, four key metrics deviate from typical patterns, indicating higher-than-usual complexity. The SMOG index, complex word counts (both general and Dale-Chall), and total noun count are all in the P90 range. This suggests that while the sentence structure is simple, the vocabulary is more technical and noun-heavy than is ideal for a lay audience, supporting the need for simplification."
