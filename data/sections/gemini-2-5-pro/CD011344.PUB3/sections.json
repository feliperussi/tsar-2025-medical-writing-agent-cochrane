  "plain_title": "For epidural pain relief during labour, which method is better: automatic, timed injections or a continuous drip?",
  "key_messages": [
    "For women in labour, using automatic, timed injections for an epidural (an injection of pain-relieving medicine into the back) seems to result in less 'breakthrough pain' (pain needing extra attention from an anaesthesiologist) and uses less pain-relieving medicine compared to a continuous drip. The way the epidural was given did not appear to affect the chances of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery (one using forceps or a vacuum device).",
    "Women who received automatic, timed injections may have been more satisfied with their pain relief, and there was no difference in the health of the baby immediately after birth between the two methods.",
    "Larger studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of these two methods on the chances of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery."

      "subheading": "What is epidural pain relief for labour?",
      "content": "An epidural is a common way to relieve pain during labour and childbirth. It involves placing a tiny tube in the lower back to deliver pain-killing medicine (local anaesthetics) near the nerves that sense pain from the uterus. This medicine can be delivered in two main ways. One method is a continuous, slow drip, known as a 'basal infusion' (BI). Another method gives the medicine in timed doses, like an injection every hour, which is called an 'automated mandatory bolus' (AMB). Often, women can also give themselves an extra dose of medicine if they feel they need it."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out which method of giving an epidural – the continuous drip (BI) or the timed doses (AMB) – is better and safer for women during labour. We were interested in which method was more effective at preventing severe pain that requires an anaesthesiologist to step in (known as 'breakthrough pain'). We also wanted to see if the delivery method affected the chances of needing a caesarean delivery, or an instrumental delivery (where forceps or a vacuum cup are used to help deliver the baby)."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 18 studies involving a total of 4590 women. The participants were either healthy women having their first baby (in 13 studies) or a mix of women having their first baby and those who had given birth before (in five studies). All studies excluded women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The studies compared using an automated pump to deliver mandatory boluses (bursts of medication) with a continuous low-dose infusion for maintaining pain relief from an epidural during labour."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: automated bolus compared with continuous infusion for epidural pain relief in labour",
      "content": "Compared to a continuous basal infusion, using an automated mandatory bolus for epidural pain relief in labour probably reduces the need for an anaesthesiologist to manage breakthrough pain. For every 100 women using a continuous infusion who might need extra help for pain, about 28 would need it, compared to only about 20 of every 100 women using an automated bolus. An automated bolus probably also slightly reduces the amount of pain relief medication used and may improve a mother's satisfaction with her pain relief. It probably makes little to no difference to the number of caesarean or instrumental deliveries (births needing forceps or vacuum), or to the duration of labour."

  "limitations": "Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about how the studies were conducted, as it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Furthermore, the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention, and there are not enough studies to be certain about some of the results.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022 of search."
