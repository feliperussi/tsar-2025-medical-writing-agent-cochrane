  "draft": "For epidural pain relief during labour, which method is better: automatic, timed injections or a continuous drip?\n\nKey messages\n- For women in labour, using automatic, timed injections for an epidural (an injection of pain-relieving medicine into the back) seems to result in less 'breakthrough pain' (pain needing extra attention from an anaesthesiologist) and uses less pain-relieving medicine compared to a continuous drip. The way the epidural was given did not appear to affect the chances of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery (one using forceps or a vacuum device).\n- Women who received automatic, timed injections may have been more satisfied with their pain relief, and there was no difference in the health of the baby immediately after birth between the two methods.\n- Larger studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of these two methods on the chances of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery.\n\nWhat is epidural pain relief for labour?\nAn epidural is a common way to relieve pain during labour and childbirth. It involves placing a tiny tube in the lower back to deliver pain-killing medicine (local anaesthetics) near the nerves that sense pain from the uterus. This medicine can be delivered in two main ways. One method is a continuous, slow drip, known as a 'basal infusion' (BI). Another method gives the medicine in timed doses, like an injection every hour, which is called an 'automated mandatory bolus' (AMB). Often, women can also give themselves an extra dose of medicine if they feel they need it.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which method of giving an epidural – the continuous drip (BI) or the timed doses (AMB) – is better and safer for women during labour. We were interested in which method was more effective at preventing severe pain that requires an anaesthesiologist to step in (known as 'breakthrough pain'). We also wanted to see if the delivery method affected the chances of needing a caesarean delivery, or an instrumental delivery (where forceps or a vacuum cup are used to help deliver the baby).\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared two ways of giving epidural pain relief during labor: automated regular injections versus a continuous drip. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 18 studies involving a total of 4590 women. The participants were either healthy women having their first baby (in 13 studies) or a mix of women having their first baby and those who had given birth before (in five studies). All studies excluded women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The studies compared using an automated pump to deliver mandatory boluses (bursts of medication) with a continuous low-dose infusion for maintaining pain relief from an epidural during labour.\n\nMain results: automated bolus compared with continuous infusion for epidural pain relief in labour\nCompared to a continuous basal infusion, using an automated mandatory bolus for epidural pain relief in labour probably reduces the need for an anaesthesiologist to manage breakthrough pain. For every 100 women using a continuous infusion who might need extra help for pain, about 28 would need it, compared to only about 20 of every 100 women using an automated bolus. An automated bolus probably also slightly reduces the amount of pain relief medication used and may improve a mother's satisfaction with her pain relief. It probably makes little to no difference to the number of caesarean or instrumental deliveries (births needing forceps or vacuum), or to the duration of labour.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about how the studies were conducted, as it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Furthermore, the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention, and there are not enough studies to be certain about some of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions to meet Cochrane standards for clarity and style before it can be approved. There is a critical issue with the subheadings, and the text is difficult to read in places due to excessive passive voice and complex, noun-heavy sentences.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. Two subheadings do not follow this rule.\n   - **Problem:** \"Methods\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite as \"How did we conduct this review?\"\n   - **Problem:** \"Main results: automated bolus compared with continuous infusion for epidural pain relief in labour\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite as \"What are the main results?\"\n\n2. **Use the active voice to make the text more direct.** The draft uses the passive voice frequently, which can make sentences feel indirect and academic. The goal is to clearly state who is doing the action.\n   - **Problem:** \"The way the epidural was given did not appear to affect the chances of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite in active voice: \"The epidural delivery method did not appear to affect the chances of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery...\"\n   - **Problem:** \"...it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite in active voice: \"...people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting.\"\n\n3. **Simplify complex and noun-heavy sentences.** Some sentences are long and filled with technical nouns, making them hard for a lay reader to follow. Try breaking them into shorter sentences and using more action verbs.\n   - **Problem:** \"The studies compared using an automated pump to deliver mandatory boluses (bursts of medication) with a continuous low-dose infusion for maintaining pain relief from an epidural during labour.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Simplify and shorten: \"The studies compare two ways of giving pain relief during labour: using an automated pump for timed bursts of medicine versus using a continuous slow drip.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your linguistic analysis supports these recommendations. The draft has 27 instances of passive voice, placing it in the 'BEYOND_P90' category, which is a significant deviation from typical PLS texts. Additionally, metrics for nouns, complex words, and long words are all in the P90 range, confirming the need to simplify vocabulary and sentence structure.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While about two-thirds of the metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, there are significant deviations in key areas that impact readability. The most notable issue is the passive voice count (27), which is well beyond the 90th percentile. Furthermore, five other metrics related to vocabulary complexity—including nouns, complex words (both types), long words, and the SMOG index—are in the P90 range, indicating the text is more dense and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
