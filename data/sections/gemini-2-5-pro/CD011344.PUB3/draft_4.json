  "draft": "For epidural pain relief during labour, which method is better: automatic, timed injections or a continuous drip?\n\nKey messages\n- For women in labour, using automatic, timed injections for an epidural (an injection of pain-relieving medicine into the back) seems to result in less 'breakthrough pain' (pain needing extra attention from a specialist pain doctor, an anaesthesiologist) and uses less pain-relieving medicine compared to a continuous drip. How the medicine was given did not seem to change the likelihood of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery (one using forceps or a vacuum device).\n- Women who received automatic, timed injections may have been more satisfied with their pain relief, and the two methods did not differ in their effect on the baby's health immediately after birth.\n- Larger studies are needed to be more certain about how these two methods affect the need for a caesarean or instrumental delivery.\n\nWhat is epidural pain relief for labour?\nAn epidural is a common way to relieve pain during labour and childbirth. It involves placing a tiny tube in the lower back to deliver pain-killing medicine (local anaesthetics) near the nerves that sense pain from the uterus. A specialist pain doctor can deliver this medicine in two main ways. One method is a continuous, slow drip. Another method gives the medicine in timed doses, like an injection every hour (automatic, timed injections). Often, women can also give themselves an extra dose of medicine if they feel they need it.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which method of giving an epidural – the continuous drip or automatic, timed injections – is better and safer for women during labour. We were interested in which method was more effective at preventing severe pain that requires a specialist doctor to step in (known as 'breakthrough pain'). We also wanted to see if the way the medicine was given affected the need for a caesarean delivery, or an instrumental delivery (where forceps or a vacuum cup are used to help deliver the baby).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared a continuous drip with automatic, timed injections for epidural pain relief during labour. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 18 studies with a total of 4590 women. The women in the studies were healthy. In 13 studies, they were having their first baby. The other 5 studies included both first-time mothers and women who had given birth before. All studies excluded women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The studies compared giving pain relief as a continuous drip versus giving it as automatic, timed injections.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a continuous drip, using automatic, timed injections for epidural pain relief in labour probably reduces the need for a specialist doctor to manage breakthrough pain. This means that for every 100 women, about 8 fewer would need extra help for pain when using automatic, timed injections compared to a continuous drip (20 women instead of 28). Automatic, timed injections probably also slightly reduce the amount of pain relief medication women use and may improve a mother's satisfaction with her pain relief. The method used probably makes little to no difference to the number of caesarean or instrumental deliveries, or to the length of labour.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate because some studies had weaknesses in their methods. For example, in some studies, women or staff could know which pain relief method was being used, which might have influenced the results. The studies also used different types of pain relief medicine and delivery methods, and we do not have enough evidence to be certain about some of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to December 2022.",

However, it is not approved because it requires revisions to address three key areas that impact clarity. First, the summary relies too heavily on passive voice, which can make sentences feel indirect and less clear. Second, some sentences are overly complex and use noun-heavy phrasing, making them difficult to parse. Finally, there is a minor inconsistency in the terminology used for the specialist doctor. Addressing these points will make the summary much easier for a lay audience to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly readable, with most metrics falling in the best quartile for PLS texts (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 10.75). However, the analysis also highlights significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in key areas. The number of passive voice constructions is exceptionally high (24 instances, 'BEYOND_P90'), which is the most critical issue to address. Additionally, the text has a high density of nouns, complex words, and a high SMOG index, all falling in the P90 range, suggesting that specific sentences are likely too technical or dense for a lay audience."
