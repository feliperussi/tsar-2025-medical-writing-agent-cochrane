  "draft": "For epidural pain relief during labour, which is better: automatic injections or a continuous drip?\n\nKey messages\n- For women in labour, using automatic injections for an epidural (an injection of pain-relieving medicine into the back) seems to result in less 'breakthrough pain' (pain needing extra attention from an anaesthesiologist) and uses less pain-relieving medicine compared to a continuous drip. The delivery method did not appear to affect the chances of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery (one using forceps or a vacuum device).\n- Women who received automatic injections may have been more satisfied with their pain relief, and the two methods did not differ in their effect on the baby's health immediately after birth.\n- Researchers need to conduct larger studies to be more certain about the effects of these two methods on the chances of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery.\n\nWhat is epidural pain relief for labour?\nAn epidural is a common way to relieve pain during labour and childbirth. It involves placing a tiny tube in the lower back to deliver pain-killing medicine (local anaesthetics) near the nerves that sense pain from the uterus. An anaesthesiologist can deliver this medicine in two main ways. One method is a continuous, slow drip. Another method gives the medicine in timed doses, like an injection every hour (automatic injections). Often, women can also give themselves an extra dose of medicine if they feel they need it.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which method of giving an epidural – the continuous drip or automatic injections – is better and safer for women during labour. We were interested in which method was more effective at preventing severe pain that requires an anaesthesiologist to step in (known as 'breakthrough pain'). We also wanted to see if the delivery method affected the chances of needing a caesarean delivery, or an instrumental delivery (where forceps or a vacuum cup are used to help deliver the baby).\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared a continuous drip with automatic injections for epidural pain relief during labour. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 18 studies with a total of 4590 women. The participants were either healthy women having their first baby (in 13 studies) or a mix of women having their first baby and those who had given birth before (in 5 studies). All studies excluded women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. The studies compared giving pain relief as a continuous drip versus giving it as automatic injections.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to a continuous drip, using automatic injections for epidural pain relief in labour probably reduces the need for an anaesthesiologist to manage breakthrough pain. This means that for every 100 women, about 8 fewer would need extra help for pain when using automatic injections compared to a continuous drip (20 women instead of 28). Automatic injections probably also slightly reduce the amount of pain relief medication women use and may improve a mother's satisfaction with her pain relief. It probably makes little to no difference to the number of caesarean or instrumental deliveries (births needing forceps or vacuum), or to the length of labour.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate because some studies had weaknesses in their methods. For example, in some studies, women or staff could know which pain relief method was being used, which might have influenced the results. The studies also used different types of pain relief medicine and delivery methods, and we do not have enough evidence to be certain about some of the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to December 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it can be made easier for readers to understand by addressing a pattern of complex vocabulary and sentence structure. Here are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Simplify repeated technical terms.** The word 'anaesthesiologist' is used multiple times. This is a long and complex term for a lay audience.\n    *   **Quote:** \"...pain needing extra attention from an anaesthesiologist...\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Define the term simply on first use and use the simpler version thereafter. For example:\n        *   First use: \"...pain needing extra attention from a specialist pain doctor (an anaesthesiologist).\"\n        *   Subsequent uses: \"...requires a specialist doctor to step in.\"\n\n2. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs.** Some sentences are built around nouns, which can make them less direct and harder to read.\n    *   **Quote:** \"The delivery method did not appear to affect the chances of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery...\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase using simpler, more active language. For example: \"How the medicine was given did not seem to change the likelihood of needing a caesarean or instrumental delivery...\"\n\n3. **Break down long, complex sentences.** The description of the study participants is packed into one long sentence.\n    *   **Quote:** \"The participants were either healthy women having their first baby (in 13 studies) or a mix of women having their first baby and those who had given birth before (in 5 studies).\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Split this into shorter sentences for better readability. For example: \"The women in the studies were healthy. In 13 studies, they were having their first baby. The other 5 studies included both first-time mothers and women who had given birth before.\"\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the number of complex words, long words, and nouns were higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to typical patterns in sentence structure and readability, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, a cluster of 5 metrics related to vocabulary complexity—including the SMOG index, complex words, and long words—deviate significantly from typical patterns (P90 range). This suggests the draft uses more complex and formal vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
