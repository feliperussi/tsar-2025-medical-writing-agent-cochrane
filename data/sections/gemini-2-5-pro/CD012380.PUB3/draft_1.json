  "draft": "What are the effects of treatments to prevent or reduce long-term kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether treatments such as hydroxyurea or ACE inhibitors (a type of medicine that lowers blood pressure) can prevent or reduce long-term kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. In very young children, hydroxyurea may improve the kidney's ability to concentrate urine, and may make little or ...? Wait, we need full string as given. Let's copy exactly.\n\nWhat is sickle cell disease and how does it affect the kidneys?\nSickle cell disease is a serious inherited blood disorder. It can cause many health problems, including severe pain and damage to major organs. The kidneys are often affected. This damage, known as chronic kidney disease, can begin in childhood and get worse over time, sometimes leading to kidney failure where the kidneys stop working.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective different treatments are for preventing or reducing kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We looked at evidence for several treatments, including a medicine called hydroxyurea, a type of blood pressure medicine called angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and red blood cell transfusions, used either alone or together.\n\nMethods\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that evaluated interventions aimed at preventing or reducing kidney complications in individuals with sickle cell disease. The search terms combined concepts related to sickle cell disease, renal outcomes, and therapeutic interventions, and we screened titles, abstracts, and full texts according to predefined inclusion criteria. Two independent reviewers extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and follow‑up duration. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. We pooled comparable outcomes using random‑effects meta‑analysis and presented summary effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals. The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was evaluated using the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. We assigned a rating of high, moderate, etc., to reflect our confidence in the estimated effects.\n\nResults\nThe review included three studies with a total of 385 people with sickle cell disease. The studies compared hydroxyurea to a placebo (a dummy treatment) in young children; a type of blood pressure medicine called an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to a placebo in adults; and an ACE inhibitor to vitamin C in children.\n\nFor young children with sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea may improve the ability of their kidneys to concentrate urine. It may make little to no difference to the number of serious problems like severe chest problems, pain, or hospital stays. We do not know if hydroxyurea has an effect on overall kidney function.\n\nFor adults with sickle cell disease, we do not know if an ACE inhibitor to a placebo. Similarly, for children with the disease, we do not know if an ACE inhibitor has an effect on the amount of protein in the urine when compared to vitamin C.\n\nThe review found no studies on using blood transfusions to prevent or reduce kidney problems. Due to a lack of research, we cannot draw conclusions about the best way to manage kidney problems for children older than 18 months or for most adults with sickle cell disease.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because of concerns about how the studies were designed. In addition, the evidence does not cover all of the people we were interested in, and the studies were very small.\n\nEvidence currency statement\nThe abstract does not specify a search date, so the evidence currency cannot be determined.",

      "feedback": "This draft has a strong foundation but requires significant revisions in three key areas before it can be approved. The most critical issue is the 'Methods' section, which is written in technical language unsuitable for a lay audience. Secondly, several subheadings do not follow the required question format. Finally, there are incomplete sentences in the 'Key messages' and 'Results' that must be corrected for clarity and accuracy.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rewrite the 'Methods' section in plain language.** The current text is dense with technical jargon that patients and the public will not understand.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"We performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that evaluated interventions aimed at preventing or reducing kidney complications... We pooled comparable outcomes using random‑effects meta‑analysis and presented summary effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals. The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was evaluated using the GRADE framework...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like 'systematic search', 'random-effects meta-analysis', and 'GRADE framework' are meaningless to a non-specialist reader. This section must explain the process in simple, everyday terms.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"To find all the relevant studies, we searched major medical databases. We looked for studies where people were randomly assigned to receive a treatment or a different treatment (or a placebo). We then compared the results from the studies and used a standard method called GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.\"\n\n2. **Correct the incomplete and unclear sentence in the 'Results' section.** One of the key findings is currently presented in a way that is grammatically incorrect and confusing.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"For adults with sickle cell disease, we do not know if an ACE inhibitor to a placebo.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is missing a verb and an outcome, leaving the reader to guess what was measured. The original abstract clarifies this was about protein in the urine.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"For adults with sickle cell disease, we do not know if an ACE inhibitor reduces protein in the urine when compared to a placebo.\"\n\n3. **Revise all subheadings to be questions.** The style guide requires subheadings to be phrased as questions to guide the reader, but several are currently simple statements.\n   - **Problematic Subheadings:** \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Evidence currency statement\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This violates a key structural rule of the PLS format, making the text less engaging and harder to navigate for the reader.\n   - **Suggested Rewrites:**\n     - For \"Methods\", use \"How did we conduct the review?\"\n     - For \"Results\", use \"What did we find?\"\n     - For \"Limitations of the evidence\", use \"How reliable is the evidence?\"\n     - For \"Evidence currency statement\", use \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:**\nThe need for these revisions is supported by the linguistic analysis. The high scores for `complex_words` (138), `long_words` (195), and `nouns` (230) are all in the P90 range or beyond, largely due to the technical language in the 'Methods' section. Addressing this single section will significantly improve the draft's clarity and bring its metrics more in line with typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows good conformity with PLS patterns in some areas, such as sentence length and readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is in the best quartile). However, there is a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics—nouns, SMOG index, Dale-Chall complex words, complex words (3+ syllables), and long words (7+ characters)—are in the P90 range or beyond. This indicates that while sentences may be of reasonable length, the word choice, particularly in the 'Methods' section, is far too technical for a lay audience and is the primary reason for the 'NOT_APPROVED' grade."
