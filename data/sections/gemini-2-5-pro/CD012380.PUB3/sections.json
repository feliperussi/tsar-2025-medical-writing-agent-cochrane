    "Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether treatments such as hydroxyurea or ACE inhibitors (a type of medicine that lowers blood pressure) can prevent or reduce long-term kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. In very young children, hydroxyurea may improve the kidney's ability to concentrate urine, and may make little or ...? Wait, we need full string as given. Let's copy exactly.\n"

      "subheading": "What is sickle cell disease and how does it affect the kidneys?",
      "content": "Sickle cell disease is a serious inherited blood disorder. It can cause many health problems, including severe pain and damage to major organs. The kidneys are often affected. This damage, known as chronic kidney disease, can begin in childhood and get worse over time, sometimes leading to kidney failure where the kidneys stop working."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out how effective different treatments are for preventing or reducing kidney problems in people with sickle cell disease. We looked at evidence for several treatments, including a medicine called hydroxyurea, a type of blood pressure medicine called angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and red blood cell transfusions, used either alone or together."

      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that evaluated interventions aimed at preventing or reducing kidney complications in individuals with sickle cell disease. The search terms combined concepts related to sickle cell disease, renal outcomes, and therapeutic interventions, and we screened titles, abstracts, and full texts according to predefined inclusion criteria."

      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "Two independent reviewers extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and follow‑up duration. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. We pooled comparable outcomes using random‑effects meta‑analysis and presented summary effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals."

      "content": "The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was evaluated using the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. We assigned a rating of high, moderate, etc., to reflect our confidence in the estimated effects."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included three studies with a total of 385 people with sickle cell disease. The studies compared hydroxyurea to a placebo (a dummy treatment) in young children; a type of blood pressure medicine called an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to a placebo in adults; and an ACE inhibitor to vitamin C in children.\n\nFor young children with sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea may improve the ability of their kidneys to concentrate urine. It may make little to no difference to the number of serious problems like severe chest problems, pain, or hospital stays. We do not know if hydroxyurea has an effect on overall kidney function.\n\nFor adults with sickle cell disease, we do not know if an ACE inhibitor to a placebo. Similarly, for children with the disease, we do not know if an ACE inhibitor has an effect on the amount of protein in the urine when compared to vitamin C.\n\nThe review found no studies on using blood transfusions to prevent or reduce kidney problems. Due to a lack of research, we cannot draw conclusions about the best way to manage kidney problems for children older than 18 months or for most adults with sickle cell disease."
