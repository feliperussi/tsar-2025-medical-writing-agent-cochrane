  "draft": "Can antibiotics prevent infection in women who have a procedure (uterine evacuation) to remove pregnancy tissue after a miscarriage?\n\nKey messages\n– For women having a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the womb after a miscarriage, antibiotics taken beforehand may reduce the risk of a womb infection. The antibiotics are unlikely to cause vomiting or diarrhoea, but it is unclear if they increase the risk of allergic reactions.\n– The evidence is not strong because of limitations in the studies. For example, some women did not take the antibiotics as instructed, and many did not return for check-ups. This makes the results less certain.\n\nBackground\nWhat happens after a miscarriage and why is infection a risk?\nWhen a woman has a miscarriage (also called early pregnancy loss), she may need a procedure to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from her womb (uterus). Like any procedure, this can cause infection. Doctors give antibiotics to women who show signs of infection. However, it is not clear if women without signs of infection should also receive antibiotics before the procedure to prevent infection (this is known as 'prophylactic' antibiotics).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving prophylactic antibiotics to women having a procedure for a miscarriage prevents infection.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving preventative antibiotics with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment to women having a procedure for a miscarriage. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with a total of 4371 women. The women were having procedures for early pregnancy loss and did not show signs of infection. The studies compared giving preventative antibiotics with either a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nWhen we included all 6 studies, the evidence suggested that preventative antibiotics may reduce the risk of a womb infection, but this evidence was of low certainty. However, when we looked only at the 3 highest-quality studies, we found high-certainty evidence that giving antibiotics reduces the risk of a womb infection.\n\nRegarding unwanted effects, preventative antibiotics:\n– probably make little to no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea.\n– may increase the risk of an allergic reaction, but the evidence for this is uncertain.\n\nWe do not know if preventative antibiotics reduce the need for a later course of antibiotics or hospitalisation to treat an infection, because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because of issues in the studies. For example, in some studies many women did not return for check-ups, and others did not take the antibiotics as instructed. This makes the results less certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It's clear, well-structured, and meets all the critical requirements for a Plain Language Summary. The readability scores are excellent. I have three suggestions to make the key findings and limitations even clearer for readers.\n\n**1. Clarify the main result to avoid confusion.**\n\nThe current text presents two different conclusions about the effectiveness of antibiotics back-to-back, which could confuse readers about the main takeaway.\n\n*   **Problematic text:** 'When we included all 6 studies, the evidence suggested that preventative antibiotics may reduce the risk of a womb infection, but this evidence was of low certainty. However, when we looked only at the 3 highest-quality studies, we found high-certainty evidence that giving antibiotics reduces the risk of a womb infection.'\n*   **Suggestion:** Combine these points and add the specific risk reduction mentioned in the abstract (43%) to make the benefit more concrete. For example: 'Overall, taking antibiotics before the procedure may reduce the risk of a womb infection. The evidence for this was strongest when we looked at the three highest-quality studies. These studies showed that antibiotics reduced the risk of infection by about 43%, and we are confident in this result.'\n\n**2. Use consistent terminology for 'miscarriage'.**\n\nThe summary introduces 'early pregnancy loss' as a synonym for miscarriage but then uses it in the results section. Sticking to the more common term is better for clarity.\n\n*   **Problematic text:** 'The women were having procedures for early pregnancy loss and did not show signs of infection.'\n*   **Suggestion:** Replace 'early pregnancy loss' with the more familiar term used elsewhere in the summary: 'The women were having procedures for a miscarriage and did not show signs of infection.'\n\n**3. Make the limitations section more direct.**\n\nThe explanation of the evidence limitations is a bit abstract and could be more direct. This is likely related to the high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) flagged in the analysis.\n\n*   **Problematic text:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is limited because of issues in the studies. For example, in some studies many women did not return for check-ups, and others did not take the antibiotics as instructed.'\n*   **Suggestion:** Rephrase to be more active and concrete: 'We are less confident in some of the results because of how the studies were run. For example, in some studies many women did not return for their check-ups, and others did not take the antibiotics as prescribed. This makes the results less certain.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is well-written and highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 94% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and structure. However, it shows a significant deviation in the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), with 32 instances, placing it beyond the 90th percentile. This may contribute to a less direct and more abstract writing style in some sections."
