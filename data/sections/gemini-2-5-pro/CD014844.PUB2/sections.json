  "key_messages": [
    "For women who have a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the womb after a miscarriage, taking antibiotics beforehand to prevent infection may reduce their risk of developing an infection in the womb. These antibiotics are unlikely to cause vomiting or diarrhoea, but it is unclear if they increase the risk of allergic reactions.",
    "Some of the studies in this review had limitations, for example, some women did not take the antibiotics as instructed. Future, well-designed studies are needed to be more certain about the benefits and potential harms of giving antibiotics to all women having this procedure."

      "subheading": "What happens after a miscarriage and why is infection a risk?",
      "content": "When a woman has a miscarriage (also called early pregnancy loss), she may need a procedure to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from her womb (uterus). Like any procedure, this carries a risk of infection. Doctors will give antibiotics to women who show signs of an infection. However, it is not clear if women who do not have signs of an infection should also be given antibiotics before the procedure to prevent an infection from starting (this is known as 'prophylactic' antibiotics)."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared giving preventative antibiotics with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment for women undergoing a procedure to manage a miscarriage. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found six randomised controlled trials that involved a total of 4371 women. The women were undergoing procedures to manage early pregnancy loss and did not show signs or symptoms of infection. The studies compared giving antibiotics as a preventive measure with either a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment. The abstract did not provide information on the duration of the studies, the countries in which they took place, or their funding sources."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Preventive antibiotics for managing miscarriage",
      "content": "For women undergoing a procedure to manage a miscarriage, giving antibiotics as a preventive measure reduces the risk of developing a uterine infection. This is based on the highest quality evidence.\n\nRegarding unwanted effects, preventive antibiotics:\n- probably make little to no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea.\n- may cause a large increase in the risk of an allergic reaction.\n\nWe do not know if preventive antibiotics reduce the need for a later course of antibiotics or hospitalisation to treat an infection, because the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.",
