  "draft": "Can antibiotics prevent infection in women who have a procedure (uterine evacuation) to remove pregnancy tissue after a miscarriage?\n\n**Key messages**\n- For women who have a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the womb after a miscarriage, taking antibiotics beforehand to prevent infection may reduce their risk of developing an infection in the womb. These antibiotics are unlikely to cause vomiting or diarrhoea, but it is unclear if they increase the risk of allergic reactions.\n- Some of the studies in this review had limitations, for example, some women did not take the antibiotics as instructed. Future, well-designed studies are needed to be more certain about the benefits and potential harms of giving antibiotics to all women having this procedure.\n\n**Background**\nWhat happens after a miscarriage and why is infection a risk?\nWhen a woman has a miscarriage (also called early pregnancy loss), she may need a procedure to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from her womb (uterus). Like any procedure, this carries a risk of infection. Doctors will give antibiotics to women who show signs of an infection. However, it is not clear if women who do not have signs of an infection should also be given antibiotics before the procedure to prevent an infection from starting (this is known as 'prophylactic' antibiotics).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving prophylactic antibiotics to women having a procedure for a miscarriage is effective at preventing infection.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared giving preventative antibiotics with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment for women undergoing a procedure to manage a miscarriage. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What we found**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found six randomised controlled trials that involved a total of 4371 women. The women were undergoing procedures to manage early pregnancy loss and did not show signs or symptoms of infection. The studies compared giving antibiotics as a preventive measure with either a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment. The abstract did not provide information on the duration of the studies, the countries in which they took place, or their funding sources.\n\nMain results: Preventive antibiotics for managing miscarriage\nFor women undergoing a procedure to manage a miscarriage, giving antibiotics as a preventive measure reduces the risk of developing a uterine infection. This is based on the highest quality evidence.\n\nRegarding unwanted effects, preventive antibiotics:\n- probably make little to no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea.\n- may cause a large increase in the risk of an allergic reaction.\n\nWe do not know if preventive antibiotics reduce the need for a later course of antibiotics or hospitalisation to treat an infection, because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-structured and highly readable, but it is not approved because of a critical factual accuracy issue that misrepresents the certainty of the main findings. The summary presents a sub-analysis as the main result, which could mislead readers. Additionally, the description of limitations is too vague, and the risk of a side effect is overstated. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Clarify the Certainty of the Main Finding:** The results section states the main conclusion with high certainty, which is not accurate for the overall evidence. This should be nuanced to reflect the difference between the full analysis and the high-quality sub-analysis.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** \"For women undergoing a procedure to manage a miscarriage, giving antibiotics as a preventive measure reduces the risk of developing a uterine infection. This is based on the highest quality evidence.\"\n    - **Reasoning:** This is misleading. The abstract states the overall evidence is of 'low-certainty'. The 'high-certainty' evidence comes only from a sensitivity analysis of the 3 best studies. The summary should reflect this important distinction.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"When we looked only at the three highest-quality studies, we found high-certainty evidence that giving antibiotics reduces the risk of a womb infection. However, when we included all six studies, the evidence was less certain.\"\n\n2. **Provide Specific Reasons for the Limitations:** The limitations section is too generic and does not explain the actual problems with the evidence.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\"\n    - **Reasoning:** The abstract identifies specific, important issues: \"poor follow-up and high non-compliance with antibiotic prophylaxis.\" Readers need to know *why* the evidence is limited.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited because of issues in the studies. For example, in some studies many women did not return for check-ups, and others did not take the antibiotics as instructed. This makes the results less certain.\"\n\n3. **Avoid Overstating the Risk of Side Effects:** The summary exaggerates the risk of an allergic reaction, which could cause undue alarm.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** \"- may cause a large increase in the risk of an allergic reaction.\"\n    - **Reasoning:** The evidence for this is low-certainty with a very wide confidence interval, meaning the effect is highly uncertain. Describing it as a \"large increase\" is an overstatement.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"- may increase the risk of an allergic reaction, but the evidence for this is uncertain.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nThe analysis shows the draft is generally well-written. However, the high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) suggests that some sentences could be more direct. For example, changing phrases like 'is effective at preventing infection' to 'prevents infection' would make the text more active and easier to read.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of its features falling within the best quartile for readability and style. However, three metrics deviate from the typical range. The 'nominalization' count is significantly higher than usual, suggesting that sentences could be more direct by using verbs instead of noun phrases. The 'smog_index' and 'complex_words' count are also slightly high, likely due to necessary medical terms. Addressing the nominalizations would further improve the draft's excellent readability."
