  "draft": "Can antibiotics prevent infection in women who have a procedure (uterine evacuation) to remove pregnancy tissue after a miscarriage?\n\nKey messages\n– For women who have a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the womb after a miscarriage, preventative antibiotics reduce the risk of a womb infection. This finding is based on the highest-quality studies.\n– The antibiotics are unlikely to cause vomiting or diarrhoea, but it is unclear if they increase the risk of allergic reactions.\n– Our confidence in some results is low because the researchers did not run some studies well. For example, many women did not return for check-ups, which makes the evidence less certain.\n\nBackground\nWhat happens after a miscarriage and why is infection a risk?\nWhen a woman has a miscarriage (also called early pregnancy loss), she may need a procedure to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from her womb (uterus). Like any procedure, this can cause infection. Doctors give antibiotics to women who show signs of infection. However, it is not clear if women without signs of infection should also receive antibiotics before the procedure to prevent infection (this is known as 'prophylactic' antibiotics).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if prophylactic antibiotics prevent infection in women who have a procedure for a miscarriage.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared preventative antibiotics with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment in women having a procedure for a miscarriage. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with a total of 4371 women. The women were having procedures for a miscarriage and did not show signs of infection. The studies compared preventative antibiotics with either a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment.\n\nWhat are the benefits and harms of preventative antibiotics?\nWhen we looked at all 6 studies, the results suggested that preventative antibiotics may reduce the risk of a womb infection, but we have low confidence in this finding. However, when we looked only at the 3 highest-quality studies, the evidence was much stronger. These studies showed that antibiotics reduced the risk of infection by about 43%, and we are confident in this result.\n\nRegarding unwanted effects, these antibiotics:\n– probably make little to no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea.\n– may increase the risk of an allergic reaction, but the evidence for this is uncertain.\n\nWe do not know if preventative antibiotics reduce the need for a later course of antibiotics or to be hospitalised to treat an infection, because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in some results is low because the researchers did not run some studies well. For example, many women did not return for check-ups or did not take the antibiotics as prescribed, which makes the evidence less certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

The scores for readability, sentence length, and active voice are all excellent. To make it even better, I have three suggestions focusing on improving the precision of the key findings and the conciseness of the language.\n\n1. **Refine the first key message for better balance.** The current message focuses only on the most positive finding, which could be misleading.\n    *   **Current text:** '– For women who have a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the womb after a miscarriage, preventative antibiotics reduce the risk of a womb infection. This finding is based on the highest-quality studies.'\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** This states the benefit as a certainty ('reduce the risk'), but the overall evidence from all six studies was of low certainty. A key message should reflect the full picture.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Lead with the more cautious overall finding, like this: '– For women who have a procedure for a miscarriage, taking antibiotics beforehand **may** reduce their risk of a womb infection. The evidence for this benefit is strongest when looking only at the highest-quality studies.'\n\n2. **Explain what 'highest-quality' means.** Readers may not understand what makes a study 'high quality'. Adding a brief explanation improves transparency.\n    *   **Current text:** '...when we looked only at the 3 highest-quality studies, the evidence was much stronger.'\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** This is a subjective term without context. The abstract refers to these as studies with a 'low risk of bias'.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Briefly define the term by linking it to the study's reliability. For example: '...when we looked only at the 3 studies that were run best (those with a 'low risk of bias'), the evidence was much stronger.'\n\n3. **Make the limitations section more direct.** The final sentence in this section repeats information, which can weaken the message.\n    *   **Current text:** 'For example, many women did not return for check-ups or did not take the antibiotics as prescribed, which makes the evidence less certain.'\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The section already began by stating confidence is low, so the final clause is redundant.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Remove the repeated phrase for a stronger statement: 'For example, in some studies many women did not return for check-ups or did not take the antibiotics as prescribed.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are excellent, with 94.4% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. This indicates the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. Scores for readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 10.27), sentence length (18.79 words/sentence), and passive voice (6 instances) are all strong. The only significant deviation is in 'nominalization' (31 instances), which is beyond the 90th percentile, suggesting a higher-than-usual use of noun-form verbs, though this does not appear to negatively impact overall readability in this case."
