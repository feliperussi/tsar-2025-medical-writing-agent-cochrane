  "draft": "Can antibiotics prevent infection in women who have a procedure (uterine evacuation) to remove pregnancy tissue after a miscarriage?\n\nKey messages\n– For women who have a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the womb after a miscarriage, preventative antibiotics reduce the risk of a womb infection. The antibiotics are unlikely to cause vomiting or diarrhoea, but it is unclear if they increase the risk of allergic reactions.\n– Our confidence in some results is low because some studies were not well run. For example, many women did not return for check-ups or did not take the antibiotics as prescribed, which makes the evidence less certain.\n\nBackground\nWhat happens after a miscarriage and why is infection a risk?\nWhen a woman has a miscarriage (also called early pregnancy loss), she may need a procedure to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from her womb (uterus). Like any procedure, this can cause infection. Doctors give antibiotics to women who show signs of infection. However, it is not clear if women without signs of infection should also receive antibiotics before the procedure to prevent infection (this is known as 'prophylactic' antibiotics).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if prophylactic antibiotics prevent infection in women who have a procedure for a miscarriage.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared preventative antibiotics with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment in women having a procedure for a miscarriage. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with a total of 4371 women. The women were having procedures for a miscarriage and did not show signs of infection. The studies compared preventative antibiotics with either a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment.\n\nWhat are the benefits and harms of preventative antibiotics?\nOverall, preventative antibiotics reduce the risk of a womb infection. The evidence for this was strongest when we looked at the 3 highest-quality studies. These studies showed that antibiotics reduced the risk of infection by about 43%, and we are confident in this result.\n\nRegarding unwanted effects, these antibiotics:\n– probably make little to no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea.\n– may increase the risk of an allergic reaction, but the evidence for this is uncertain.\n\nWe do not know if preventative antibiotics reduce the need for a later course of antibiotics or hospitalisation to treat an infection, because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in some results is low because some studies were not well run. For example, many women did not return for check-ups or did not take the antibiotics as prescribed, which makes the evidence less certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. However, a few key improvements are needed to enhance clarity for the reader, particularly around the main findings. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Clarify the main finding about womb infections.** The current text might confuse readers by stating an overall finding and then immediately focusing on a subset of studies. It's important to explain *why* you focused on the higher-quality studies.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Overall, preventative antibiotics reduce the risk of a womb infection. The evidence for this was strongest when we looked at the 3 highest-quality studies.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** This structure can make readers question the 'overall' result. The abstract clarifies that the overall analysis was low-certainty, while the analysis of the 3 high-quality studies was high-certainty. This is a crucial distinction.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"When we looked at all 6 studies, the results suggested that preventative antibiotics may reduce the risk of a womb infection, but we have low confidence in this finding. However, when we looked only at the 3 highest-quality studies, the evidence was much stronger and showed that antibiotics reduced the risk of infection by about 43%. We are confident in this result.\"\n\n2. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of nouns.** The draft has a high number of 'nominalizations' (nouns made from verbs), which can make the text less active. Changing these back to verbs makes the writing more direct.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"We do not know if preventative antibiotics reduce the need for a later course of antibiotics or **hospitalisation** to treat an infection...\"\n   - **Reasoning:** Using the verb form is more active and easier for readers to process, as recommended by the style guide's emphasis on direct verbs.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We do not know if preventative antibiotics reduce the need for a later course of antibiotics or **to be hospitalised** to treat an infection...\"\n\n3. **Use active voice to explain study limitations.** The limitations section uses a passive phrase that can be made more direct.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Our confidence in some results is low because some studies **were not well run**.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** The active voice is clearer about who is responsible. It helps the reader understand that the study design or execution by the researchers led to the limitations.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in some results is low because the **researchers did not run** some studies well.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns. 17 of 18 metrics (94.4%) fall within the best quartile for readability and plain language, indicating the text is generally very clear and easy to read. However, there is one significant deviation: the 'nominalization' count (31 instances) is well beyond the 90th percentile. This metric supports the editorial feedback to replace noun forms of verbs (like 'hospitalisation') with more direct verb phrases to improve clarity and flow."
