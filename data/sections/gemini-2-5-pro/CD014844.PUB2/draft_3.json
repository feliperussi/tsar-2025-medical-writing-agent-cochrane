  "draft": "Can antibiotics prevent infection in women who have a procedure (uterine evacuation) to remove pregnancy tissue after a miscarriage?\n\nKey messages\n– For women having a procedure to remove pregnancy tissue from the womb after a miscarriage, taking antibiotics beforehand reduces the risk of a womb infection. The antibiotics are unlikely to cause vomiting or diarrhoea, but it is unclear if they increase the risk of allergic reactions.\n– We are less confident in some of the results because of how the studies were run. For example, in some studies many women did not return for their check-ups, and others did not take the antibiotics as prescribed. This makes the results less certain.\n\nBackground\nWhat happens after a miscarriage and why is infection a risk?\nWhen a woman has a miscarriage (also called early pregnancy loss), she may need a procedure to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from her womb (uterus). Like any procedure, this can cause infection. Doctors give antibiotics to women who show signs of infection. However, it is not clear if women without signs of infection should also receive antibiotics before the procedure to prevent infection (this is known as 'prophylactic' antibiotics).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving prophylactic antibiotics to women having a procedure for a miscarriage prevents infection.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving preventative antibiotics with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment to women having a procedure for a miscarriage. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with a total of 4371 women. The women were having procedures for a miscarriage and did not show signs of infection. The studies compared giving preventative antibiotics with either a placebo (a dummy pill) or no treatment.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nOverall, taking antibiotics before the procedure reduces the risk of a womb infection. The evidence for this was strongest when we looked at the 3 highest-quality studies. These studies showed that antibiotics reduced the risk of infection by about 43%, and we are confident in this result.\n\nRegarding unwanted effects, preventative antibiotics:\n– probably make little to no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea.\n– may increase the risk of an allergic reaction, but the evidence for this is uncertain.\n\nWe do not know if preventative antibiotics reduce the need for a later course of antibiotics or hospitalisation to treat an infection, because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe are less confident in some of the results because of how the studies were run. For example, in some studies many women did not return for their check-ups, and others did not take the antibiotics as prescribed. This makes the results less certain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to October 2023.",

This phrasing is a statement disguised as a question.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What did the review find about the benefits and harms of preventative antibiotics?\"\n\n**Top 2 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Use More Direct Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases:** The text often uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which can make sentences less direct.\n    *   **Problematic Sentence:** \"We wanted to find out if giving prophylactic antibiotics to women having a procedure for a miscarriage prevents infection.\"\n    *   **Reason:** The phrase \"giving... antibiotics\" is less direct than using a simple verb. This pattern is repeated throughout the text.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if prophylactic antibiotics prevent infection for women having a procedure for a miscarriage.\"\n\n2.  **Improve Conciseness in the Limitations Section:** The explanation of the evidence limitations is slightly repetitive.\n    *   **Problematic Sentences:** \"We are less confident in some of the results because of how the studies were run. For example, in some studies many women did not return for their check-ups, and others did not take the antibiotics as prescribed. This makes the results less certain.\"\n    *   **Reason:** The first and last sentences convey the same point (\"less confident\" and \"less certain\").

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 94% of features falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. Sentence length, use of active voice, and readability scores are all excellent. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is in the 90th percentile. Reducing the count from 27 to the typical range of under 13 would address the main stylistic issue in the draft, making the text more direct and active."
