  "draft": "Can an anti‑VEGF eye injection before vitrectomy for diabetic eye disease lower the risk of complications?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people with advanced diabetic eye disease, an injection of medicine into the eye before surgery (vitrectomy) may improve vision. The injection makes tears in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) during surgery less likely and lowers the chance of bleeding inside the eye more than 4 weeks later. It also probably makes bleeding in the first 4 weeks after surgery less likely. The review found few reported unwanted effects from using this medicine.\n- Future studies should measure how the treatment affects a person's quality of life, as this was not reported in the studies we found. Researchers should also agree on the most important outcomes to measure and report them consistently to make results easier to compare.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and how is it treated?\nA serious eye problem from diabetes can cause new, weak blood vessels to grow in the back of the eye (the retina). This condition is called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. These blood vessels can bleed or create scar tissue, which can lead to vision loss. To treat these problems, surgeons often do a type of eye surgery called a vitrectomy. However, this surgery can be difficult because the weak blood vessels can bleed easily during and after the operation. This can cause further problems and may require more surgery. A medicine called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) can help. Doctors inject this medicine into the eye to shrink the weak blood vessels and make them less likely to bleed. Researchers believe that getting these injections before surgery makes the operation safer and more likely to succeed.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving anti-VEGF injections before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) helps to improve vision. We also wanted to know if it makes complications less likely compared with having the surgery alone.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) with surgery alone for people with complications from diabetic eye disease. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nWe found 28 studies that included a total of 1914 eyes. The people in these studies had serious problems from their diabetic eye disease, such as bleeding in the eye that would not clear on its own and scar tissue that pulled on the retina. The studies took place in many countries, including China, Iran, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia, and Pakistan.\n\nIn the studies, some people received an anti-VEGF injection before or during their eye surgery, while others had the surgery alone. Researchers then compared the results between the two groups, typically checking about 6 months after the surgery.\n\nCompared with surgery alone, giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during the operation:\n- greatly lowers the chance of bleeding inside the eye more than 4 weeks after surgery. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 23 had late bleeding compared to about 10 who did receive it.\n- greatly lowers the chance of tears in the retina during the operation. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 31 had a retinal tear compared to about 12 who did receive it.\n- probably greatly lowers the chance of bleeding inside the eye within the first 4 weeks after surgery.\n- may improve vision 6 months after surgery.\n\nThe medicine probably makes little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for bleeding. It also may make little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for a detached retina.\n\nWe do not know if the medicine affects whether surgeons need to use silicone oil (a substance used to support the retina) during surgery because the evidence is very uncertain. The studies did not report on how the treatment affects a person's quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not fully confident in some of the results for two main reasons. First, in many studies, the people involved knew which treatment they were getting. This can make the results less reliable, because knowing you received a new treatment can change how you report your symptoms. Second, for some outcomes, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

To make it even more accessible for patients, I have three main suggestions focusing on simplifying complex terms and making key sentences more direct.\n\n**1. Simplify complex medical terms.** Some medical terms are long and can be intimidating for readers, even when defined. Where possible, simplify them or remove unnecessary technical details.\n- **Original sentence:** 'A medicine called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) can help.'\n- **Why it's a problem:** The full name is highly technical and not necessary for a plain language summary, especially since the abbreviation 'anti-VEGF' is used thereafter.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'A medicine called anti-VEGF can help.'\n\n**2. Rephrase noun-heavy sentences to be more active and direct.** Some sentences rely on noun phrases (e.g., 'chance of bleeding') where using a direct verb would be stronger and easier to understand. This makes the text feel more active and less abstract.\n- **Original sentence:** 'The injection makes tears in the retina...less likely and lowers the chance of bleeding...'\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrasing is slightly passive and wordy. Using verbs makes the action clearer.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'The injection helps prevent the retina...from tearing and reduces the risk of bleeding...'\n\n**3. Streamline the presentation of statistics.** The sentences explaining the key findings are a bit repetitive. You can make the comparison between the two groups clearer and more concise.\n- **Original sentence:** 'For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 23 had late bleeding compared to about 10 who did receive it.'\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrasing 'who did not receive' and 'who did receive' is slightly wordy and can be streamlined.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'Out of 100 people who had surgery alone, about 23 had late bleeding, compared with about 10 who also had the injection.'\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows higher-than-usual scores for complex words, long words, and nominalizations (noun-form verbs). Addressing these points will help ensure the summary is as clear as possible for all readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is well-structured with excellent readability scores for sentence length and active voice; 11 of 18 metrics fall in the best quartile for typical PLS patterns. However, the summary shows significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Six metrics, including `complex_words`, `long_words`, `smog_index`, and `nominalization`, are in the P90 range. This indicates the text uses more technical terms, long words, and noun-heavy phrases than is typical for a PLS, suggesting the summary could be made easier to understand by simplifying key terms and rephrasing sentences to be more direct."
