  "draft": "Can an anti‑VEGF eye injection before vitrectomy for diabetic eye disease lower the risk of complications?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people with advanced diabetic eye disease, an injection of medicine into the eye before surgery (vitrectomy) may improve vision. The injection reduces the risk of tears in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) during surgery and bleeding inside the eye more than 4 weeks later. It also probably lowers the risk of bleeding in the first 4 weeks after surgery. The medicine appeared to have few unwanted effects.\n- Future studies should measure how the treatment affects a person's quality of life, as this was not reported in the studies we found. Researchers should also agree on the most important outcomes to measure and report them consistently to make results easier to compare.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and how is it treated?\nDiabetes can cause a serious eye condition called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This condition causes new, abnormal blood vessels to grow in the back of the eye (the retina). These blood vessels are weak and can bleed or create scar tissue, which can lead to vision loss. Surgeons often perform a type of eye surgery called a vitrectomy to treat these problems. However, this surgery can be difficult because the abnormal blood vessels can bleed easily during and after the operation. This can cause further problems and may require more surgery. A medicine called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) can help. Doctors inject this medicine into the eye to shrink the abnormal blood vessels and make them less likely to bleed. Researchers believe that giving these injections before surgery could make the operation safer and more successful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving anti-VEGF injections before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) helps to improve vision. We also wanted to know if it reduces the risk of problems compared with having the surgery alone.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) with surgery alone for people with complications from diabetic eye disease. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nWe found 28 studies that included a total of 1914 eyes. The people in these studies had serious problems from their diabetic eye disease. These problems included bleeding in the eye that would not clear on its own and scar tissue that pulled on the retina. The studies took place in many countries, including China, Iran, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia, and Pakistan.\n\nIn the studies, some people received an anti-VEGF injection before or during their eye surgery, while others had the surgery alone. Researchers then compared the results between the two groups, typically checking about 6 months after the surgery.\n\nCompared with surgery alone, giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during the operation:\n- greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye more than 4 weeks after surgery. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 23 had late bleeding compared to about 10 who did receive it.\n- greatly reduces the risk of tears in the retina during the operation. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 31 had a retinal tear compared to about 12 who did receive it.\n- probably greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye within the first 4 weeks after surgery.\n- may improve vision 6 months after surgery.\n\nThe medicine probably makes little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for bleeding. It also may make little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for a detached retina.\n\nWe do not know if the medicine affects whether surgeons need to use silicone oil (a substance used to support the retina) during surgery because the evidence is very uncertain. The studies did not report on how the treatment affects a person's quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. For some findings, our confidence is limited because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were receiving, which could have influenced the results. Also, for some outcomes, there were not enough studies to be certain about the effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, factually accurate draft that passes all critical checks. The structure is clear, and the key messages are correct. However, the text can be made more accessible for a lay audience by addressing a pattern of academic language. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Replace complex noun phrases with simple, active verbs.** The text often uses noun forms where direct verbs would be clearer and more engaging. This is a common habit in scientific writing that can make sentences feel dense and abstract to patients.\n   - **Example:** \"Researchers believe that giving these injections before surgery could make the operation safer and more successful.\"\n   - **Problem:** This phrasing is indirect. The high number of these constructions (called nominalizations) makes the text less reader-friendly.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"Researchers believe that getting these injections before surgery makes the operation safer and more likely to succeed.\"\n\n2. **Simplify technical vocabulary and introduce concepts before terms.** While the text defines key terms, some sentences are still dense with complex words, which can intimidate readers.\n   - **Example:** \"Diabetes can cause a serious eye condition called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This condition causes new, abnormal blood vessels to grow in the back of the eye (the retina).\"\n   - **Problem:** This opens with a long, technical term. It's better to explain the problem in simple language first, then provide the medical term.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"A serious eye problem from diabetes can cause new, weak blood vessels to grow in the back of the eye (the retina). This condition is called proliferative diabetic retinopathy.\"\n\n3. **Explain *why* limitations matter in concrete terms.** The explanation of limitations is a bit abstract and may not be clear to someone unfamiliar with clinical trials.\n   - **Example:** \"...people in the studies may have known which treatment they were receiving, which could have influenced the results.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"influenced the results\" is vague. Readers may not understand how knowing your treatment could be a problem.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"...people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. This could affect the reliability of the results, because just knowing you received a new treatment can change how you feel or report your symptoms.\"\n\nAddressing these points will help convert a factually correct summary into one that is truly easy for patients to read and understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows a mixed profile. While the draft scores very well on traditional readability metrics (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9.3, P25) due to short sentences, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and structure. Six metrics are in the P90 range or beyond, most notably 'nominalization' (BEYOND_P90), 'nouns' (P90), 'complex_words' (P90), and 'long_words' (P90). This indicates that while sentences are short, they are densely packed with complex nouns and abstract language, which supports the editorial recommendation to focus on using simpler verbs and more direct phrasing."
