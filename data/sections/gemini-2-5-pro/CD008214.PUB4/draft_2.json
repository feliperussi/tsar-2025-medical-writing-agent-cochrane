  "draft": "Can an anti‑VEGF eye injection before vitrectomy for diabetic eye disease lower the risk of complications?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people with advanced diabetic eye disease, an injection of medicine into the eye before surgery (vitrectomy) may improve vision. The injection also probably lowers the risk of bleeding inside the eye after the operation and reduces the risk of tears in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) during the operation. The review found few reported unwanted effects from using this medicine.\n- Future studies should measure how the treatment affects a person's quality of life, as this was not reported in the studies we found. Researchers should also agree on the most important outcomes to measure and report them in a consistent way to make results easier to compare.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and how is it treated?\nA serious complication of diabetes is an eye condition called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This condition can cause new, abnormal blood vessels to grow in the back of the eye (the retina). These blood vessels are weak and can bleed or create scar tissue, which can lead to vision loss. To treat these problems, a type of eye surgery called a vitrectomy is often needed. However, this surgery can be difficult because the abnormal blood vessels can bleed easily during and after the operation. This can cause further problems and may require more surgery. A type of medicine called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) can be injected into the eye to help shrink these abnormal blood vessels and make them less likely to bleed. It is thought that using these injections before surgery could make the operation safer and more successful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving anti-VEGF injections before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) helps to improve vision and reduce the risk of problems compared with having the surgery alone.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) with surgery alone for people with complications from diabetic eye disease. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nWe found 28 studies that included a total of 1914 eyes. The people in these studies had serious problems from their diabetic eye disease. These problems included bleeding in the eye that would not clear up on its own (non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage) or scar tissue that was pulling on the retina (tractional retinal detachment). The studies took place in many countries, including China, Iran, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia, and Pakistan.\n\nIn the studies, some people received an anti-VEGF injection before or during their eye surgery, while others had the surgery alone. Researchers then compared the results between the two groups, typically checking about 6 months after the surgery.\n\nCompared with surgery alone, giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during the operation:\n- greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye more than 4 weeks after surgery. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 23 had late bleeding compared to about 10 who did receive it.\n- greatly reduces the risk of tears in the retina during the operation. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 31 had a retinal tear compared to about 12 who did receive it.\n- probably greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye within the first 4 weeks after surgery.\n- may improve vision 6 months after surgery.\n\nThe medicine probably makes little to no difference to the need for a second surgery because of bleeding. It may also make little to no difference to the need for a second surgery because of a detached retina.\n\nWe do not know if the medicine affects the need to use silicone oil (a substance used to support the retina) during surgery because the evidence is very uncertain. The studies did not report on how the treatment affects a person's quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. In many studies, the people involved may have known which treatment they were receiving, which could have biased the results. Also, for some outcomes, there were not enough studies to be certain about the effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has excellent structural readability, with most readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid, ARI, etc.) and the average sentence length (18.26 words) falling in the best quartile for PLS texts. However, the analysis also reveals significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and word choice. The 'nominalization' score (32) is beyond the 90th percentile, indicating a high use of noun-form verbs. This is supported by a high noun count (193). Additionally, several vocabulary complexity metrics, including 'smog_index' (14.83), 'complex_words' (141), and 'long_words' (202), are in the 90th percentile range, suggesting the vocabulary is more complex than is typical for a PLS."
