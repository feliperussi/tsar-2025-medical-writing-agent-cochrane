  "draft": "Can an anti‑VEGF eye injection before vitrectomy for diabetic eye disease lower the risk of complications?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people with advanced diabetic eye disease, an injection of medicine into the eye before surgery (vitrectomy) may improve vision. The injection helps prevent the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) from tearing during surgery and reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye after the operation. The review found few reported unwanted effects from using this medicine.\n- Future studies should measure how the treatment affects a person's quality of life, as this was not reported in the studies we found. Researchers should also agree on the most important outcomes to measure and report them consistently to make results easier to compare.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and how is it treated?\nA serious eye problem from diabetes can cause new, weak blood vessels to grow in the back of the eye (the retina). This condition is called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. These blood vessels can bleed or create scar tissue, which can lead to vision loss. To treat these problems, surgeons often do a type of eye surgery called a vitrectomy. However, this surgery can be difficult because the weak blood vessels can bleed easily during and after the operation. This can cause further problems and may require more surgery. A medicine called anti-VEGF can help. Doctors inject this medicine into the eye to shrink the weak blood vessels and make them less likely to bleed. Researchers believe that getting these injections before surgery makes the operation safer and more likely to succeed.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving anti-VEGF injections before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) helps to improve vision and reduce complications compared with having the surgery alone.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) with surgery alone for people with complications from diabetic eye disease. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nWe found 28 studies that included a total of 1914 eyes. The people in these studies had serious problems from their diabetic eye disease, such as bleeding in the eye that would not clear on its own and scar tissue that pulled on the retina. The studies took place in many countries, including China, Iran, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia, and Pakistan.\n\nIn the studies, some people received an anti-VEGF injection before or during their eye surgery, while others had the surgery alone. Researchers then compared the results between the two groups, typically checking about 6 months after the surgery.\n\nCompared with surgery alone, giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during the operation:\n- greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye more than 4 weeks after surgery. Out of 100 people who had surgery alone, about 23 had late bleeding, compared with about 10 who also had the injection.\n- greatly reduces the risk of tears in the retina during the operation. Out of 100 people who had surgery alone, about 31 had a retinal tear, compared with about 12 who also had the injection.\n- probably greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye within the first 4 weeks after surgery.\n- may improve vision 6 months after surgery.\n\nThe medicine probably makes little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for bleeding. It also may make little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for a detached retina.\n\nWe do not know if the medicine affects whether surgeons need to use silicone oil (a substance used to support the retina) during surgery because the evidence is very uncertain. The studies did not report on how the treatment affects a person's quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not fully confident in some of the results for two main reasons. First, in many studies, the people involved knew which treatment they were getting. This can make the results less reliable, because knowing you received a new treatment can change how you report your symptoms. Second, for some outcomes, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured, factually accurate, and meets all critical requirements. The feedback below focuses on refining word choice to make it even more accessible for a lay audience. With a few adjustments to simplify complex terms and rephrase noun-heavy sentences, this summary will be ready for publication.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n**1. Simplify Complex and Abstract Language**\n\nSome sentences use technical or abstract words when simpler, more direct language would be easier for readers to understand.\n\n- **Problematic text:** \"This can make the results less reliable, because knowing you received a new treatment can change how you report your symptoms.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"knowing you received a new treatment\" is a nominalization (a verb phrase acting as a noun). This is an abstract concept that can be hard to process. Phrasing it more directly makes the cause-and-effect relationship clearer.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"This can make the results less reliable, because if people know they received a new treatment, it can change how they report their symptoms.\"\n\n**2. Introduce Technical Terms More Gently**\n\nThe summary does a good job of defining technical terms, but the initial introduction could be smoother to avoid overwhelming the reader.\n\n- **Problematic text:** \"A serious eye problem from diabetes can cause new, weak blood vessels to grow in the back of the eye (the retina). This condition is called proliferative diabetic retinopathy.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This structure presents the explanation before the term itself, which can feel disjointed. Introducing the term first and then immediately defining it is a standard plain language technique that improves flow.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Diabetes can cause a serious eye problem called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This is when new, weak blood vessels start to grow in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye).\"\n\n**3. Rephrase Wordy or Indirect Sentences**\n\nSome sentences could be more concise and direct. This helps readers grasp the main point more quickly.\n\n- **Problematic text:** \"In the studies, some people received an anti-VEGF injection before or during their eye surgery, while others had the surgery alone. Researchers then compared the results between the two groups, typically checking about 6 months after the surgery.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This phrasing is slightly passive and wordy. It describes the study setup indirectly. Using a more active structure makes the sentence clearer and more engaging.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies compared two groups of people. One group received an anti-VEGF injection before or during their eye surgery, and the other group had the surgery alone. Researchers checked the results for both groups about 6 months later.\"\n\nBy addressing these points, you will make an already good summary even clearer and more helpful for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The summary is well-structured, with excellent sentence length, readability scores, and use of active voice, with 61% of features falling in the best quartile. However, the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in its vocabulary. Six metrics related to word complexity—including `complex_words`, `long_words`, `nominalization`, and the `smog_index`—are in the 90th percentile range. This indicates the text uses more complex, long, and abstract words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, supporting the editorial recommendation to simplify vocabulary."
