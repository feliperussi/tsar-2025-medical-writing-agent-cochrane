  "key_messages": [
    "For people with advanced diabetic eye disease, an injection of medicine into the eye before surgery (vitrectomy) may improve vision. The injection also probably lowers the risk of bleeding inside the eye after the operation and reduces the risk of tears in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) during the operation. The review found few reported unwanted effects from using this medicine.",
    "Future studies should measure how the treatment affects a person's quality of life, as this was not reported in the studies we found. Researchers should also agree on the most important outcomes to measure and report them in a consistent way to make results easier to compare."

      "subheading": "What is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and how is it treated?",
      "content": "A serious complication of diabetes is an eye condition called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This condition can cause new, abnormal blood vessels to grow in the back of the eye (the retina). These blood vessels are weak and can bleed or create scar tissue, which can lead to vision loss. To treat these problems, a type of eye surgery called a vitrectomy is often needed. However, this surgery can be difficult because the abnormal blood vessels can bleed easily during and after the operation. This can cause further problems and may require more surgery. A type of medicine called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) can be injected into the eye to help shrink these abnormal blood vessels and make them less likely to bleed. It is thought that using these injections before surgery could make the operation safer and more successful."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review included 28 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1914 eyes from people with complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, such as non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage or tractional retinal detachment. The studies were conducted in various countries, including China, Iran, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia, and Pakistan. The studies compared the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections before or during vitrectomy (a type of eye surgery) with vitrectomy alone. Outcomes were typically assessed at around six months.\n\nFor people having eye surgery for complications of diabetic eye disease, an injection of an anti-VEGF medicine given before or during the operation:\n\n- causes a large reduction in the risk of bleeding inside the eye more than four weeks after surgery. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 23 had late bleeding compared to about 10 who did receive it.\n- causes a large reduction in the risk of tears in the retina during the operation. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 31 had a retinal tear compared to about 12 who did receive it.\n- probably causes a large reduction in the risk of bleeding inside the eye within the first four weeks after surgery.\n- may improve vision six months after surgery.\n\nThe medicine probably makes little to no difference to the need for a second surgery because of bleeding, and it may make little to no difference to the need for a second surgery because of a detached retina.\n\nWe do not know if using the medicine has an effect on the need to use silicone oil (a substance used to support the retina) during surgery because the evidence is very uncertain. The review did not find any information about how the treatment affects quality of life."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. In addition, for some outcomes, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to June 2022."
