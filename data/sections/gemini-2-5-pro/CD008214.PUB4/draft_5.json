  "draft": "Can an anti‑VEGF eye injection before vitrectomy for diabetic eye disease lower the risk of complications?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people with advanced diabetic eye disease, an injection of medicine into the eye before surgery (vitrectomy) may improve vision. The injection also probably lowers the risk of bleeding inside the eye after the operation. It also reduces the risk of tears in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) during the operation. The review found few reported unwanted effects from this medicine.\n- Future studies should measure how the treatment affects a person's quality of life, as this was not reported in the studies we found. Researchers should also agree on the most important outcomes to measure and report them consistently to make results easier to compare.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and how is it treated?\nDiabetes can cause a serious eye condition called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This condition causes new, abnormal blood vessels to grow in the back of the eye (the retina). These blood vessels are weak and can bleed or create scar tissue, which can lead to vision loss. Surgeons often perform a type of eye surgery called a vitrectomy to treat these problems. However, this surgery can be difficult because the abnormal blood vessels can bleed easily during and after the operation. This can cause further problems and may require more surgery. A medicine called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) can help. Doctors inject this medicine into the eye to shrink the abnormal blood vessels and make them less likely to bleed. Researchers believe that giving these injections before surgery could make the operation safer and more successful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving anti-VEGF injections before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) helps to improve vision. We also wanted to know if it reduces the risk of problems compared with having the surgery alone.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) with surgery alone for people with complications from diabetic eye disease. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nWe found 28 studies that included a total of 1914 eyes. The people in these studies had serious problems from their diabetic eye disease. These problems included bleeding in the eye that does not clear on its own (called non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage). They also included scar tissue that pulls on the retina (called tractional retinal detachment). The studies took place in many countries, including China, Iran, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia, and Pakistan.\n\nIn the studies, some people received an anti-VEGF injection before or during their eye surgery, while others had the surgery alone. Researchers then compared the results between the two groups, typically checking about 6 months after the surgery.\n\nCompared with surgery alone, giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during the operation:\n- greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye more than 4 weeks after surgery. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 23 had late bleeding compared to about 10 who did receive it.\n- greatly reduces the risk of tears in the retina during the operation. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 31 had a retinal tear compared to about 12 who did receive it.\n- probably greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye within the first 4 weeks after surgery.\n- may improve vision 6 months after surgery.\n\nThe medicine probably makes little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for bleeding. It also may make little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for a detached retina.\n\nWe do not know if the medicine affects whether surgeons need to use silicone oil (a substance used to support the retina) during surgery because the evidence is very uncertain. The studies did not report on how the treatment affects a person's quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. In many studies, the people involved may have known which treatment they were receiving, which could have influenced the results. Also, for some outcomes, there were not enough studies to be certain about the effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and structure. However, it is not approved because the language is too complex for a lay audience, which could hinder understanding. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify Complex Medical Language:** The text uses several long, technical terms that make it difficult to read, even when they are defined. This is the main reason for the high reading difficulty scores.\n    - **Problematic text:** \"These problems included bleeding in the eye that does not clear on its own (called non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage). They also included scar tissue that pulls on the retina (called tractional retinal detachment).\"\n    - **Reasoning:** While defining the terms is good practice, leading with such complex phrases can intimidate readers. The plain language explanations are clear enough to stand on their own.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"These problems included bleeding in the eye that would not clear on its own, and scar tissue that pulled on the retina.\"\n\n2. **Use More Direct Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases:** The draft often uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which can make sentences feel abstract and less direct. Changing these back to verbs will make the text more active and easier to follow.\n    - **Problematic text:** \"The review found few reported unwanted effects from this medicine.\"\n    - **Reasoning:** This phrasing is slightly passive and wordy. Using a more direct verb makes the sentence clearer and more concise.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The medicine appeared to have few unwanted effects.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the Strength of the Evidence in Key Messages:** The phrasing in the key messages and results section could be clearer about the certainty of the evidence. The distinction between different levels of certainty is too subtle.\n    - **Problematic text:** \"The injection also probably lowers the risk of bleeding inside the eye after the operation. It also reduces the risk of tears in the retina...\"\n    - **Reasoning:** This implies that the evidence for reducing tears is stronger than for reducing bleeding, but the abstract shows moderate certainty for early bleeding and high certainty for late bleeding and tears. The phrasing should be consistent and clear.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The injection reduces the risk of some complications, such as tears in the retina during surgery and bleeding inside the eye more than four weeks after surgery. It also probably lowers the risk of bleeding within the first four weeks after surgery.\"\n\nBy simplifying the vocabulary and using more direct language, you can make this summary much more accessible to patients and the public.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows a mix of excellent and problematic results. While sentence-level metrics like 'words_per_sentence' (16.70) and 'Flesch-Kincaid Grade' (9.38) are in the best quartile, indicating simple sentence structures, the vocabulary is overly complex. Six metrics related to word complexity deviate significantly from typical PLS patterns. Most notably, the 'SMOG index' (14.92) and 'nominalization' count (31.0) are beyond the 90th percentile, suggesting the vocabulary is too advanced and reliant on noun phrases, making the text difficult for a lay audience to understand despite its short sentences."
