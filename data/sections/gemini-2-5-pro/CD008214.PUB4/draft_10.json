  "draft": "Can an anti‑VEGF eye injection before vitrectomy for diabetic eye disease lower the risk of complications?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people with advanced diabetic eye disease, an injection of medicine into the eye before surgery (vitrectomy) may improve vision. The injection also probably lowers the risk of bleeding inside the eye after the operation and reduces the risk of tears in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) during the operation. The review found few reported unwanted effects from using this medicine.\n- Future studies should measure how the treatment affects a person's quality of life, as this was not reported in the studies we found. Researchers should also agree on the most important outcomes to measure and report them in a consistent way to make results easier to compare.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and how is it treated?\nDiabetes can cause a serious eye problem called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This is when new, weak blood vessels start to grow in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye). These blood vessels can bleed or create scar tissue, which can lead to vision loss. To treat these problems, surgeons often do a type of eye surgery called a vitrectomy. However, this surgery can be difficult because the weak blood vessels can bleed easily during and after the operation. This can cause further problems and may require more surgery. A medicine called anti-VEGF can help. Doctors inject this medicine into the eye to shrink the weak blood vessels and make them less likely to bleed. Researchers believe that getting these injections before surgery makes the operation safer and more likely to succeed.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving anti-VEGF injections before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) helps to improve vision and reduce complications compared with having the surgery alone.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) with surgery alone for people with complications from diabetic eye disease. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nWe found 28 studies that included a total of 1914 eyes. The people in these studies had serious problems from their diabetic eye disease, such as bleeding in the eye that would not clear on its own and scar tissue that pulled on the retina. The studies took place in many countries, including China, Iran, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia, and Pakistan.\n\nThe studies compared two groups of people. One group received an anti-VEGF injection before or during their eye surgery, and the other group had the surgery alone. Researchers checked the results for both groups about 6 months later.\n\nCompared with surgery alone, giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during the operation:\n- greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye more than 4 weeks after surgery. Out of 100 people who had surgery alone, about 23 had late bleeding, compared with about 10 who also had the injection.\n- greatly reduces the risk of tears in the retina during the operation. Out of 100 people who had surgery alone, about 31 had a retinal tear, compared with about 12 who also had the injection.\n- probably greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye within the first 4 weeks after surgery.\n- may improve vision 6 months after surgery.\n\nThe medicine probably makes little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for bleeding. It also may make little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for a detached retina.\n\nWe do not know if the medicine affects whether surgeons need to use silicone oil (a substance used to support the retina) during surgery because the evidence is very uncertain. The studies did not report on how the treatment affects a person's quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not fully confident in some of the results for two main reasons. First, in many studies, the people involved knew which treatment they were getting. This can make the results less reliable, because if people know they received a new treatment, it can change how they report their symptoms. Second, for some outcomes, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. All critical checks have passed. However, the text can be made significantly clearer for a lay audience by addressing a few key areas related to vocabulary and sentence structure. The evaluation metrics support this, showing that the draft uses more complex words, long words, and noun-based phrases than a typical Plain Language Summary. The following 3 improvements will make the summary much easier for patients to read and understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Define the main surgical procedure for the reader.**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"To treat these problems, surgeons often do a type of eye surgery called a vitrectomy.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The summary never explains what a vitrectomy is, yet it's the central procedure discussed. A patient reader may not be familiar with this term, which makes it harder to understand the context of the review.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"To treat these problems, surgeons often perform a 'vitrectomy', an operation to remove the jelly-like substance (the vitreous) from the middle of the eye.\"\n\n**2. Replace noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs.**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"- greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye more than 4 weeks after surgery.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is passive and wordy. Using a direct verb makes the sentence shorter and more active, which is easier for readers to process. This issue is reflected in the high `nominalization` score.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"- lowers the risk that the eye will bleed more than 4 weeks after surgery.\"\n\n**3. Simplify the explanation of study limitations.**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"First, in many studies, the people involved knew which treatment they were getting. This can make the results less reliable, because if people know they received a new treatment, it can change how they report their symptoms.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The explanation is a bit abstract and the sentence is long. Making the concept more concrete helps the reader understand *why* knowing the treatment is a problem.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"First, in many studies, the people involved knew which treatment they were getting. This can make results less reliable. For example, knowing you received a new treatment might change how you describe your symptoms to researchers.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly readable in many ways, with 61% of its features falling into the best quartile for PLS texts (e.g., good sentence length and use of active voice). However, the analysis also flags significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure. Six metrics are in the P90 range, indicating the text has a higher density of complex words, long words, and noun-based phrases ('nominalization') than is typical. This aligns with the editorial feedback, which focuses on simplifying technical language and rephrasing sentences to be more direct and verb-focused."
