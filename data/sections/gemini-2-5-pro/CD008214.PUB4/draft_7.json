  "draft": "Can an anti‑VEGF eye injection before vitrectomy for diabetic eye disease lower the risk of complications?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people with advanced diabetic eye disease, an injection of medicine into the eye before surgery (vitrectomy) may improve vision. The injection reduces the risk of tears in the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye) during surgery and bleeding inside the eye more than 4 weeks later. It also probably lowers the risk of bleeding in the first 4 weeks after surgery. The review found few reported unwanted effects from using this medicine.\n- Future studies should measure how the treatment affects a person's quality of life, as this was not reported in the studies we found. Researchers should also agree on the most important outcomes to measure and report them consistently to make results easier to compare.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and how is it treated?\nA serious eye problem from diabetes can cause new, weak blood vessels to grow in the back of the eye (the retina). This condition is called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. These blood vessels can bleed or create scar tissue, which can lead to vision loss. To treat these problems, surgeons often perform a type of eye surgery called a vitrectomy. However, this surgery can be difficult because the weak blood vessels can bleed easily during and after the operation. This can cause further problems and may require more surgery. A medicine called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) can help. Doctors inject this medicine into the eye to shrink the weak blood vessels and make them less likely to bleed. Researchers believe that getting these injections before surgery makes the operation safer and more likely to succeed.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if giving anti-VEGF injections before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) helps to improve vision. We also wanted to know if it reduces the risk of complications compared with having the surgery alone.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during eye surgery (vitrectomy) with surgery alone for people with complications from diabetic eye disease. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did this review find?\nWe found 28 studies that included a total of 1914 eyes. The people in these studies had serious problems from their diabetic eye disease, such as bleeding in the eye that would not clear on its own and scar tissue that pulled on the retina. The studies took place in many countries, including China, Iran, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia, and Pakistan.\n\nIn the studies, some people received an anti-VEGF injection before or during their eye surgery, while others had the surgery alone. Researchers then compared the results between the two groups, typically checking about 6 months after the surgery.\n\nCompared with surgery alone, giving an anti-VEGF injection before or during the operation:\n- greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye more than 4 weeks after surgery. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 23 had late bleeding compared to about 10 who did receive it.\n- greatly reduces the risk of tears in the retina during the operation. For every 100 people who did not receive the injection, about 31 had a retinal tear compared to about 12 who did receive it.\n- probably greatly reduces the risk of bleeding inside the eye within the first 4 weeks after surgery.\n- may improve vision 6 months after surgery.\n\nThe medicine probably makes little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for bleeding. It also may make little to no difference to whether people need a second surgery for a detached retina.\n\nWe do not know if the medicine affects whether surgeons need to use silicone oil (a substance used to support the retina) during surgery because the evidence is very uncertain. The studies did not report on how the treatment affects a person's quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is mixed. For some results, our confidence is limited for two main reasons. First, in many studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. This could affect the reliability of the results, because knowing you received a new treatment can change how you report your symptoms. Second, for some outcomes, there were not enough studies to be certain about the effects.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

First, people in the studies often knew which treatment they were getting. This can make the results less reliable, because people might report their symptoms differently if they know they received a new treatment.\"\n\n2.  **Use more direct verbs instead of noun-heavy phrases.** The text often uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which can make sentences feel abstract and less active.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"...surgeons often perform a type of eye surgery called a vitrectomy.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** \"Perform a surgery\" is a wordy phrase that can be simplified by using a more direct verb.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"...surgeons often do an eye surgery called a vitrectomy.\"\n\n3.  **Replace complex words with simpler, everyday language where possible.** While the text is generally clear, some words could be simpler to ensure the widest possible audience can understand the findings easily.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"The injection reduces the risk of tears in the retina...\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** \"Reduces the risk\" is a common phrase but can be abstract.
