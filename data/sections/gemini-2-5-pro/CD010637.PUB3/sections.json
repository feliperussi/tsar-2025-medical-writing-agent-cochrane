  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether exercise helps people with chronic venous insufficiency (poor blood flow in the leg veins). The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of exercise.",
    "Larger, well-designed studies are needed to determine if exercise is a useful treatment for this condition. Future research should investigate different types of exercise, including how hard, how often, and for how long people should exercise to see a benefit."

      "subheading": "What is chronic venous insufficiency?",
      "content": "Chronic venous insufficiency is a condition where the veins in the legs have trouble sending blood back up to the heart. This can cause symptoms like pain, swelling, and a feeling of heaviness in the legs, which can affect a person's quality of life. If the condition worsens, it can lead to open sores on the skin, known as venous leg ulcers. Physical exercise may be a useful treatment to help reduce the symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if physical exercise programmes are effective for treating people with chronic venous insufficiency that has not yet led to ulcers. We looked for evidence on both the benefits and any potential harms of using exercise as a treatment."

      "content": "We searched for studies that compared physical exercise programmes with no exercise for people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included five studies with a total of 146 people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency. The studies compared a physical exercise program to a control group that did not perform a structured exercise program, with follow-up periods ranging from eight weeks to six months. Based on these studies, it is unclear if physical exercise programmes have an effect on the signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency, quality of life, exercise ability, muscle strength, or ankle movement. We do not know if exercise affects how well the veins pump blood or how quickly they refill with blood. The review did not find any studies that looked at whether physical exercise helps to prevent leg ulcers. Overall, there is not enough evidence to understand the benefits and harms of physical exercise for people with this condition."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search."
