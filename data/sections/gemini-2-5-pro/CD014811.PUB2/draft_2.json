  "draft": "For people with acute heart failure, is it better to give diuretics (water pills) as a slow, steady drip or as single, quick injections?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n\n- For people with acute heart failure (a sudden worsening of the condition), there is not enough good-quality evidence to know if giving diuretics (water pills) as a slow, steady drip is better or worse than giving them as single, quick injections. The review found that the two methods may have similar effects on survival, length of hospital stay, and the risk of kidney problems.\n- Because the available studies were small and had some limitations, larger and better-designed studies are needed to help doctors and patients understand if one way of giving these medicines is safer or more effective than the other.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND AIMS\n\nWhat is acute heart failure and how is it treated?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood around the body as well as it should. 'Acute heart failure' is when symptoms of heart failure appear suddenly or get worse quickly. This often leads to a build-up of excess fluid in the body, causing swelling and making it hard to breathe. People with acute heart failure are usually treated in the hospital with medicines called 'loop diuretics' (often known as 'water pills'). These medicines are given directly into a vein to help the body get rid of the extra fluid quickly.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nLoop diuretics can be given into a vein in two ways: as a slow and steady drip over a period of time (a 'continuous infusion'), or as single, larger doses at set times (a 'bolus injection'). The review authors wanted to find out if one of these methods is better or safer than the other for treating adults with acute heart failure.\n\nMETHODS\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving diuretics as a continuous drip with giving them as separate injections in adults with acute heart failure.\n\nHow did we combine the results?\nWe collected and combined the results from all the studies to look for overall patterns.\n\nHow did we rate our confidence in the evidence?\nWe used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 7 studies with a total of 681 people with acute heart failure. The studies took place in 32 hospitals across 7 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. The data collection for these studies ranged from 8 months to 6 years. The studies compared giving people loop diuretics as a continuous drip (infusion) with giving them as separate, quick injections (bolus). For adults with acute heart failure, the evidence is not strong enough to show whether giving loop diuretics as a continuous drip is better or worse than giving them as separate injections. When comparing the two methods, the review found that a continuous drip may make little to no difference to how many people die from any cause, how many people need to be readmitted to the hospital, or whether they developed a sudden kidney injury. We do not know if a continuous drip affects weight loss or how long people stay in the hospital because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. Additionally, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the studies were done in different types of people.\n\nEVIDENCE CURRENCY STATEMENT\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "Hello, this is a very strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and highly readable. The evaluation metrics confirm this, showing excellent readability scores. I have just a few suggestions to make it even better. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Clarify the finding about hospital stays.**\n    *   **The issue:** The Key Message and the Results section give slightly different messages about the length of hospital stay. The Key Message says the two methods \"may have similar effects,\" while the Results section says \"we do not know\" because the evidence is \"very uncertain.\" This could be confusing for readers.\n    *   **Original text (Key Messages):** \"...the two methods may have similar effects on survival, length of hospital stay, and the risk of kidney problems.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** To be more precise, I suggest aligning the Key Message with the Results. For example: \"...the two methods may have similar effects on survival and the risk of kidney problems. It is uncertain how they affect how long people stay in the hospital.\"\n\n2. **Make the start of the Results section more concise.**\n    *   **The issue:** The first two sentences of the main results repeat the same information, which can slow the reader down.\n    *   **Original text (Results):** \"The studies compared giving people loop diuretics as a continuous drip (infusion) with giving them as separate, quick injections (bolus). For adults with acute heart failure, the evidence is not strong enough to show whether giving loop diuretics as a continuous drip is better or worse than giving them as separate injections.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** You can combine these ideas into a single, more direct sentence. For example: \"The studies compared the two methods, but for adults with acute heart failure, the evidence is not strong enough to show if one is better or worse than the other.\"\n\n3. **Improve the phrasing in the Limitations section.**\n    *   **The issue:** The explanation of the limitations is a bit wordy and could be more direct. The evaluation noted a high number of nouns in the text, and simplifying sentences like this one can help improve flow.\n    *   **Original text (Limitations):** \"...it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the studies were done in different types of people.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Consider breaking this into two shorter, more active sentences. For example: \"In some studies, people may have known which treatment they received. The studies also included different groups of people, which makes the results harder to combine.\"\n\nOverall, this is an excellent summary. These small changes will help ensure every part is as clear and accurate as possible for your readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns. 13 of 18 metrics (72.2%) are in the best quartile, indicating excellent readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9.8) and good use of plain language elements like active voice and pronouns. The only significant deviation is a high noun count (169), which falls in the P90 range, suggesting some sentences could be rephrased to be more verb-driven for better clarity."
