  "draft": "For people with acute heart failure, is it better to give diuretics (water pills) as a slow, steady drip or as single, quick injections?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n\n- For people with acute heart failure (a sudden worsening of the condition), there is not enough good-quality evidence to know if giving diuretics (water pills) as a slow, steady drip is better or worse than giving them as single, quick injections. The review found that the two methods may have similar effects on survival, length of hospital stay, and the risk of kidney problems.\n- Because the available studies were small and had some limitations, larger and better-designed studies are needed to help doctors and patients understand if one way of giving these medicines is safer or more effective than the other.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND AIMS\n\nWhat is acute heart failure and how is it treated?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood around the body as well as it should. 'Acute heart failure' is when symptoms of heart failure appear suddenly or get worse quickly. This often leads to a build-up of excess fluid in the body, causing swelling and making it hard to breathe. People with acute heart failure are usually treated in the hospital with medicines called 'loop diuretics' (often known as 'water pills'). These medicines are given directly into a vein to help the body get rid of the extra fluid quickly.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nLoop diuretics can be given into a vein in two ways: as a slow and steady drip over a period of time (a 'continuous infusion'), or as single, larger doses at set times (a 'bolus injection'). The review authors wanted to find out if one of these methods is better or safer than the other for treating adults with acute heart failure.\n\nMETHODS\n\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched for studies that compared continuous infusion of diuretics with intermittent bolus dosing in adults with acute heart failure.\n\nData Synthesis\nWe combined and summarized the results from the identified studies using meta‑analysis techniques.\n\nEvidence Assessment\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence using a systematic grading approach.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included seven studies with a total of 681 people with acute heart failure. The studies took place in 32 hospitals across seven countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. The data collection for these studies ranged from eight months to six years. The studies compared treating people with a continuous intravenous infusion of loop diuretics to treatment with intermittent bolus injections of the same medication. For adults with acute heart failure, the evidence is not strong enough to show whether giving loop diuretics as a continuous drip (infusion) is better or worse than giving them as separate injections (bolus). When comparing a continuous infusion to separate injections, the review found that a continuous infusion may make little to no difference to how many people die from any cause, how many people need to be readmitted to the hospital, or to the risk of developing a sudden kidney injury. We do not know if a continuous infusion has an effect on weight loss or on the length of time people stay in the hospital because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. Additionally, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the studies were done in different types of people.\n\nEVIDENCE CURRENCY STATEMENT\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-written and factually accurate, but it is NOT_APPROVED because it does not follow a key style guide requirement for subheadings and has some areas that could be clearer for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Rephrase 'Methods' Subheadings as Questions:** The subheadings in the Methods section do not follow the style guide rule to be phrased as questions. This makes the section less engaging and harder for readers to navigate.\n- **Problem:** The subheadings 'Search Strategy', 'Data Synthesis', and 'Evidence Assessment' are technical labels, not questions.\n- **Suggestion:** Please change them to questions to match the rest of the summary, for example:\n    - 'How did we find the studies?'\n    - 'How did we combine the results?'\n    - 'How did we rate our confidence in the evidence?'\n\n**2. Simplify Technical Language in the 'Methods' Section:** The descriptions under the subheadings use terms that are unfamiliar to a general audience, which could cause them to skip this important section.\n- **Problem:** Phrases like 'meta-analysis techniques' and 'systematic grading approach' are jargon.\n- **Suggestion:** Replace them with simpler explanations. For example, instead of 'We combined and summarized the results from the identified studies using meta‑analysis techniques,' try: 'We collected and combined the results from all the studies to look for overall patterns.'\n\n**3. Use More Direct Verbs Instead of Nouns:** Some sentences are noun-heavy, which can make them less direct and harder to read. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of nouns and nominalizations (nouns made from verbs).\n- **Problem:** 'The studies compared treating people with a continuous intravenous infusion of loop diuretics to treatment with intermittent bolus injections of the same medication.'\n- **Suggestion:** Rewrite this using more active verbs, like so: 'The studies compared giving people loop diuretics as a continuous drip (infusion) with giving them as separate, quick injections (bolus).'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 16 of 18 metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and simplicity. However, the analysis identified a high number of nouns (175) and nominalizations (21), placing these metrics in the 90th percentile. This supports the editorial feedback that some sentences could be improved by using more active verbs instead of noun forms to enhance clarity."
