  "key_messages": [
    "For people with acute heart failure (a sudden worsening of the condition), there is not enough good-quality evidence to know if giving diuretics (water pills) as a slow, steady drip is better or worse than giving them as single, quick injections. The review found that the two methods may have similar effects on survival, length of hospital stay, and the risk of kidney problems.",
    "Because the available studies were small and had some limitations, larger and better-designed studies are needed to help doctors and patients understand if one way of giving these medicines is safer or more effective than the other."

      "content": "Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood around the body as well as it should. 'Acute heart failure' is when symptoms of heart failure appear suddenly or get worse quickly. This often leads to a build-up of excess fluid in the body, causing swelling and making it hard to breathe. People with acute heart failure are usually treated in the hospital with medicines called 'loop diuretics' (often known as 'water pills'). These medicines are given directly into a vein to help the body get rid of the extra fluid quickly."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "Loop diuretics can be given into a vein in two ways: as a slow and steady drip over a period of time (a 'continuous infusion'), or as single, larger doses at set times (a 'bolus injection'). The review authors wanted to find out if one of these methods is better or safer than the other for treating adults with acute heart failure."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included seven studies with a total of 681 people with acute heart failure. The studies took place in 32 hospitals across seven countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. The data collection for these studies ranged from eight months to six years. The studies compared treating people with a continuous intravenous infusion of loop diuretics to treatment with intermittent bolus injections of the same medication. For adults with acute heart failure, the evidence is not strong enough to show whether giving loop diuretics as a continuous drip (infusion) is better or worse than giving them as separate injections (bolus). When comparing a continuous infusion to separate injections, the review found that a continuous infusion may make little to no difference to how many people die from any cause, how many people need to be readmitted to the hospital, or to the risk of developing a sudden kidney injury. We do not know if a continuous infusion has an effect on weight loss or on the length of time people stay in the hospital because the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. Additionally, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the studies were done in different types of people.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search."
