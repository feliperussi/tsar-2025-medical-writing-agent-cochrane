  "draft": "For people with acute heart failure, is it better to give diuretics (water pills) as a slow, steady drip or as single, quick injections?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n\n- For people with acute heart failure (a sudden worsening of the condition), there is not enough good-quality evidence to know if giving diuretics (water pills) as a slow, steady drip is better or worse than giving them as single, quick injections. The review found that the two methods may have similar effects on survival and the risk of kidney problems. It is uncertain how they affect how long people stay in the hospital.\n- Because the available studies were small and had some limitations, larger and better-designed studies are needed to help doctors and patients understand if one way of giving these medicines is safer or more effective than the other.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND AIMS\n\nWhat is acute heart failure and how is it treated?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood around the body as well as it should. 'Acute heart failure' is when symptoms of heart failure appear suddenly or get worse quickly. This often leads to a build-up of excess fluid in the body, causing swelling and making it hard to breathe. People with acute heart failure are usually treated in the hospital with medicines called 'loop diuretics' (often known as 'water pills'). These medicines are given directly into a vein to help the body get rid of the extra fluid quickly.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nLoop diuretics can be given into a vein in two ways: as a slow and steady drip over a period of time (a 'continuous infusion'), or as single, larger doses at set times (a 'bolus injection'). The review authors wanted to find out if one of these methods is better or safer than the other for treating adults with acute heart failure.\n\nMETHODS\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving diuretics as a continuous drip with giving them as separate injections in adults with acute heart failure.\n\nHow did we combine the results?\nWe collected and combined the results from all the studies to look for overall patterns.\n\nHow did we rate our confidence in the evidence?\nWe used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 7 studies with a total of 681 people with acute heart failure. The studies took place in 32 hospitals across 7 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. The data collection for these studies ranged from 8 months to 6 years. The studies compared the two methods, but for adults with acute heart failure, the evidence is not strong enough to show if one is better or worse than the other. When comparing the two methods, the review found that a continuous drip may make little to no difference to how many people die from any cause, how many people need to be readmitted to the hospital, or whether they developed a sudden kidney injury. We do not know if a continuous drip affects weight loss or how long people stay in the hospital because the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. In some studies, people may have known which treatment they received. The studies also included different groups of people, which makes the results harder to combine.\n\nEVIDENCE CURRENCY STATEMENT\n\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that is clear, concise, and follows most plain language principles well. The readability scores are excellent. However, I am marking it as 'NOT_APPROVED' for one critical correction and two minor improvements to ensure the highest clarity for patients.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Align the Key Message with the Results.** The Key Message is missing a key finding that is mentioned later in the summary. This inconsistency could mislead readers who only skim the main points.\n    - **Problem:** The Key Message states the two methods may have similar effects on 'survival and the risk of kidney problems'. However, the Results section also includes 'how many people need to be readmitted to the hospital' in this list of outcomes with little to no difference.\n    - **Suggestion:** Please update the first bullet point in the Key Messages to include this finding. For example: \"The review found that the two methods may have similar effects on survival, readmission to the hospital, and the risk of kidney problems.\"\n\n2. **Improve Clarity in the 'Limitations' Section.** The explanation of the limitations could be more direct and better explain *why* these issues matter.\n    - **Problem:** The sentence \"In some studies, people may have known which treatment they received\" is a bit passive and doesn't explain the implication for the reader.\n    - **Suggestion:** Consider rewriting this part to be more active and informative. For example: \"We are not confident in the evidence because there were not enough studies to be certain. Also, in some studies, people and their doctors may have known which treatment they were receiving, which can influence the results.\"\n\n3. **Strengthen Sentences by Using More Verbs.** The summary is very readable, but some parts rely heavily on nouns, which can make the text feel a bit static. This observation is supported by the linguistic analysis, which showed a high number of nouns compared to typical summaries.\n    - **Problem:** The start of the 'What did we find?' section lists facts in a series of noun-focused sentences: \"The review included 7 studies... The studies took place... The data collection for these studies ranged...\"\n    - **Suggestion:** To make this more engaging, try rephrasing with more active verbs. For example: \"We found 7 studies that included 681 people with acute heart failure. These studies took place in 32 hospitals across North America, Europe, and Asia.\"\n\nOnce the Key Message is updated to be consistent with the Results, this excellent summary will be ready for approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72.2% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. All readability scores are excellent (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 9.16). The only significant deviation is the 'nouns' metric, which is in the P90 range, suggesting the text is more noun-heavy than is typical. This supports the editorial feedback to strengthen sentences with more active verbs."
