  "draft": "What are the effects of medicines for treating reflux (the backward flow of stomach contents) in children?\n\nKey messages\n\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether medicines for reflux (the backward flow of stomach contents into the food pipe) improve symptoms in infants and children. The review did not find clear information about the unwanted or harmful effects of these treatments.\n- More and better-quality studies are needed to understand if these medicines are helpful. Future research should follow children for longer to check for long-term effects and should include specific groups, such as premature babies and children with long-term health conditions.\n\nWhat is gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?\n\nGastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is when stomach contents come back up into the food pipe (oesophagus). It is very common in babies, affecting about half of infants under three months old. In most babies, reflux is normal and gets better by itself as they grow. However, for some babies and older children, the symptoms can be more severe, causing problems like pain, crying, or difficulty feeding. When reflux is severe enough to need medical treatment, it is called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how well different medicines work to treat gastro-oesophageal reflux in infants and children, and whether they cause any unwanted effects.\n\nMethods\n\nWe searched for studies that compared drug treatments for reflux in children and infants against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another drug. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 36 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 2251 children and infants up to 16 years old with gastro-oesophageal reflux. The studies compared various pharmacological treatments, such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists, against a placebo or another medication. For infants with reflux, it is unclear if medications such as omeprazole and esomeprazole have an effect on symptoms compared to a placebo. For older children with reflux disease, it is also unclear if proton pump inhibitors improve their outcomes. Giving different doses of these medications may make little to no difference to symptoms, but we are very uncertain about the results.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the treatments, the studies were very small, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is well-written and factually accurate, but it is NOT_APPROVED because several subheadings do not follow the required question format, which is a critical style guide rule. Here are the top 3 improvements needed to meet Cochrane guidelines:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions:** The style guide requires subheadings to be questions to guide the reader. This is the primary reason for the 'NOT_APPROVED' grade.\n    - **Current:** 'Methods', 'Limitations of the evidence', 'Currency of the evidence'\n    - **Problem:** These are not questions and are less engaging for a lay audience.\n    - **Suggestion:** Please change them to 'How did we conduct this review?', 'How reliable is the evidence?', and 'How up-to-date is this evidence?'.\n\n2. **Remove unexplained technical terms:** The results section introduces complex drug classes without explanation, which can confuse readers.\n    - **Current:** 'The studies compared various pharmacological treatments, such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists, against a placebo or another medication.'\n    - **Problem:** 'Proton pump inhibitors' and 'H2 antagonists' are jargon to most people. The specific drug names are mentioned later, making these class names unnecessary here.\n    - **Suggestion:** Please simplify the sentence to: 'The studies compared different medicines for reflux against a placebo or another medication.'\n\n3. **Improve conciseness and flow:** The text repeats the definition of reflux and uses a slightly awkward phrase in the currency statement.\n    - **Current (Currency):** 'The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.'\n    - **Problem:** The phrase 'of search' is unnecessary jargon.\n    - **Suggestion:** Please simplify this to: 'The evidence is up-to-date to September 2022.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are excellent, indicating the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, with particularly strong scores for readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 11.22) and low use of passive voice (6 instances). No metrics show significant deviation, suggesting the text is already well-optimized from a linguistic standpoint. The recommended edits focus on style guide adherence and jargon removal rather than broad readability improvements."
