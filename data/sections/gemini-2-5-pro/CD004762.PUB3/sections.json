  "key_messages": [
    "For people with non-dystrophic myotonia (a genetic condition causing muscle stiffness), the drugs mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce stiffness and improve quality of life. For people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition causing muscle weakness and stiffness), mexiletine may help muscles relax faster. These treatments can cause unwanted effects, such as stomach problems, tiredness, and headache.",
    "Because the evidence comes from a small number of studies, it is not clear why some people do not respond to these treatments. Future research is needed to test other potential medicines and to find the best ways to conduct studies for these rare conditions."

      "content": "Myotonia is a condition where muscles are slow to relax after being used. This can cause symptoms like stiffness, cramps, pain, and fatigue, which can be disabling. It is the main symptom of a group of genetic conditions called myotonic disorders. The two main types are myotonic dystrophy (which also affects other parts of the body, such as the heart and eyes) and non-dystrophic myotonia (which mainly affects the muscles). Various drugs, such as sodium channel blockers, are used to help reduce the symptoms of myotonia."

      "content": "We wanted to find out how well different drugs work to improve the symptoms of myotonia and whether they cause any unwanted side effects. We looked for evidence from studies called randomised controlled trials, which are the best type of study to assess the effects of treatments."

      "content": "We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared drug treatments with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another drug in people with myotonia. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review included 17 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 392 people. The participants had either myotonic dystrophy type 1 (219 people) or non-dystrophic myotonia (173 people). The studies investigated various drug treatments, primarily mexiletine and lamotrigine, compared to a placebo. Other medications explored included phenytoin, imipramine, procainamide, clomipramine, nifedipine, tocainide, diazepam, quinine, diphenylhydantoin, and taurine. The abstract did not provide information on the duration of the studies, their funding sources, or the countries where they were conducted."

      "content": "For people with myotonic dystrophy, the drug mexiletine probably reduces the time it takes for hand muscles to relax after gripping when compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment). However, mexiletine may make little to no difference to their quality of life and may increase unwanted effects, such as stomach and gut problems, tiredness, and headache.\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia, mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and probably improves hand grip strength. Mexiletine may also improve quality of life. On the other hand, it probably makes little to no difference to the time it takes for muscles in the eyes and hands to relax and may increase unwanted effects. The drug lamotrigine probably improves quality of life and may improve the time it takes for hand and eyelid muscles to relax. However, lamotrigine probably increases unwanted effects, such as headache, fatigue, and rash.\n\nFor other drugs investigated for myotonia, it is unclear if they have an effect."

  "limitations": "Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns that most of the studies were very small. For some of the less common medicines, it is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.",
