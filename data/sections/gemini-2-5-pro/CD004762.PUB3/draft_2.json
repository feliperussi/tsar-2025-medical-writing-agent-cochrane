  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of drug treatments for myotonia (difficulty relaxing muscles)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with non-dystrophic myotonia (a genetic condition causing muscle stiffness), the drugs mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce stiffness and improve quality of life. For people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition causing muscle weakness and stiffness), mexiletine may help muscles relax faster. These treatments can cause unwanted effects, such as stomach problems, tiredness, and headache.\n- Because the evidence comes from a small number of studies, it is not clear why some people do not respond to these treatments. Future research is needed to test other potential medicines and to find the best ways to conduct studies for these rare conditions.\n\nWhat is myotonia?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles are slow to relax after being used. This can cause symptoms like stiffness, cramps, pain, and fatigue, which can be disabling. It is the main symptom of a group of genetic conditions called myotonic disorders. The two main types are myotonic dystrophy (which also affects other parts of the body, such as the heart and eyes) and non-dystrophic myotonia (which mainly affects the muscles). Various drugs, such as sodium channel blockers, are used to help reduce the symptoms of myotonia.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different drugs work to improve the symptoms of myotonia and whether they cause any unwanted side effects. We looked for evidence from studies called randomised controlled trials, which are the best type of study to assess the effects of treatments.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared drug treatments with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another drug in people with myotonia. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 17 randomized controlled trials with a total of 392 people. The participants had either myotonic dystrophy type 1 (219 people) or non-dystrophic myotonia (173 people). The studies mainly tested the drugs mexiletine and lamotrigine against a placebo. The studies also looked at several other drugs, but the evidence for them was unclear.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine probably helps hand muscles relax faster than a placebo. However, mexiletine may make little to no difference to their quality of life and may increase unwanted effects, such as stomach and gut problems, tiredness, and headache.\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia, mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness, improves hand grip strength, and may improve quality of life. However, it probably does not change how fast eye and hand muscles relax and may increase unwanted effects. The drug lamotrigine probably improves quality of life and may help hand and eyelid muscles relax faster. However, lamotrigine probably increases unwanted effects, such as headache, fatigue, and rash.\n\nFor other drugs looked at for myotonia, it is unclear if they have an effect.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate, mainly because most of the studies were very small. In some studies of less common medicines, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks have passed. However, a few key improvements to vocabulary and the explanation of a complex finding will make it even more accessible to readers. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Clarify the potentially confusing finding about hand grip.**\n   - **The issue:** The summary for non-dystrophic myotonia states that mexiletine \"improves hand grip strength\" but \"probably does not change how fast eye and hand muscles relax.\" To a lay reader, this might seem contradictory.\n   - **Quote:** \"For people with non-dystrophic myotonia, mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness, improves hand grip strength... However, it probably does not change how fast eye and hand muscles relax...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase to more clearly separate the concepts of strength versus relaxation speed. For example: \"For people with non-dystrophic myotonia, mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and makes their grip stronger. However, it may not change how quickly they can relax their hand after gripping.\"\n\n2. **Replace or explain the remaining technical term.**\n   - **The issue:** The term \"sodium channel blockers\" is used once without any explanation, which could be confusing for readers.\n   - **Quote:** \"Various drugs, such as sodium channel blockers, are used to help reduce the symptoms of myotonia.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Either remove the technical term or explain what it means in simple language. For example, you could say: \"Various drugs that affect how muscles send and receive signals are used to help reduce the symptoms of myotonia.\"\n\n3. **Simplify vocabulary to improve readability.**\n   - **The issue:** While the readability scores are good, the text uses some unnecessarily formal words. The metrics show a high number of long and complex words compared to typical summaries.\n   - **Quote:** \"We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared drug treatments...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Use more direct, active language. For example: \"We searched for studies where people were assigned to a treatment group by chance (called randomized controlled trials). These studies compared drug treatments...\" Similarly, replace \"participants\" with \"people\" or \"people in the studies\" for a more personal tone.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show that this draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of its features falling into the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. The average sentence length (16.8 words) and Flesch-Kincaid grade level (9.2) are excellent. However, the analysis flags three vocabulary-related metrics for deviation: the number of nouns, Dale-Chall complex words, and long words are all in the P90 range, indicating the vocabulary is more complex than in a typical PLS. This supports the editorial recommendation to simplify word choices where possible."
