  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of drug treatments for myotonia (difficulty relaxing muscles)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with non-dystrophic myotonia (a genetic condition causing muscle stiffness), the drugs mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce stiffness and improve quality of life. For people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition causing muscle weakness and stiffness), mexiletine may help muscles relax faster. These treatments can cause unwanted effects, such as stomach problems, tiredness, and headache.\n- Because the evidence comes from a small number of studies, it is not clear why some people do not respond to these treatments. Future research is needed to test other potential medicines and to find the best ways to conduct studies for these rare conditions.\n\nWhat is myotonia?\nMyotonia is a condition that makes it hard for muscles to relax after you use them. This can cause symptoms like stiffness, cramps, pain, and fatigue, which can be disabling. It is the main symptom of a group of genetic conditions called myotonic disorders. The two main types are myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonia. In myotonic dystrophy, other parts of the body like the heart and eyes are also affected. In non-dystrophic myotonia, the condition mainly affects the muscles. Different drugs are used to help reduce the symptoms of myotonia.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different drugs work to improve the symptoms of myotonia and whether they cause any unwanted side effects. We looked for evidence from studies called randomised controlled trials, which are the best type of study to assess the effects of treatments.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies where people were assigned to a treatment group by chance (called randomized controlled trials). These studies compared drug treatments with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another drug in people with myotonia. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 17 randomized controlled trials with a total of 392 people. The people in the studies had either myotonic dystrophy type 1 (219 people) or non-dystrophic myotonia (173 people). The studies mainly tested the drugs mexiletine and lamotrigine against a placebo. The studies also looked at several other drugs, but the evidence for them was unclear.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine probably helps hand muscles relax faster than a placebo. However, mexiletine may make little to no difference to their quality of life and may increase unwanted effects, such as stomach and gut problems, tiredness, and headache.\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia, mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and makes their grip stronger. It may also improve their quality of life. However, the drug may not change how quickly they can relax their hand after gripping, and it may increase unwanted effects. The drug lamotrigine probably improves quality of life and may help hand and eyelid muscles relax faster. However, lamotrigine probably increases unwanted effects, such as headache, fatigue, and rash.\n\nFor other drugs looked at for myotonia, it is unclear if they have an effect.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate, mainly because most of the studies were very small. Also, in some studies, people taking part may have known which treatment they were receiving. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their symptoms, which could affect the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

The key areas for improvement are simplifying some formal phrasing, using consistent terminology for side effects, and ensuring the limitations are described with full accuracy.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, three metrics related to vocabulary complexity—nouns (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), and long words (P90)—deviate from the typical range. This suggests that while the text is readable, the word choice could be simpler and less formal to better serve a lay audience."
