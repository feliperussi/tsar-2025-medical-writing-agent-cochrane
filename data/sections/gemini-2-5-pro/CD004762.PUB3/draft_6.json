  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of drug treatments for myotonia (difficulty relaxing muscles)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with non-dystrophic myotonia (a genetic condition causing muscle stiffness), the drugs mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce stiffness and improve quality of life. For people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition causing muscle weakness and stiffness), mexiletine may help muscles relax faster. These treatments can cause unwanted effects, such as stomach problems, tiredness, and headache.\n- The evidence is based on a small number of studies, so it is not clear why some people do not respond to these treatments. Future research is needed to test other medicines and to find the best ways to run studies for these rare conditions.\n\nWhat is myotonia?\nMyotonia is a condition that makes it hard for muscles to relax after you use them. This can cause symptoms like stiffness, cramps, pain, and tiredness, which can be disabling. It is the main symptom of a group of genetic conditions called myotonic disorders. The two main types are myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonia. In myotonic dystrophy, other parts of the body like the heart and eyes are also affected. In non-dystrophic myotonia, the condition mainly affects the muscles. Different drugs are used to help reduce the symptoms of myotonia.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different drugs work to improve the symptoms of myotonia and whether they cause any unwanted side effects. We looked for evidence from studies called randomised controlled trials, which are the best type of study to assess the effects of treatments.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance). These studies compared drug treatments with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another drug in people with myotonia. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 17 randomized controlled trials with a total of 392 people. The people in the studies had either myotonic dystrophy type 1 (219 people) or non-dystrophic myotonia (173 people). The studies mainly tested the drugs mexiletine and lamotrigine against a placebo. The studies also looked at several other drugs, but the evidence for them was unclear.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine probably helps hand muscles relax faster than a placebo. However, mexiletine may make little to no difference to their quality of life and may increase unwanted effects, such as stomach and gut problems, tiredness, and headache.\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia, mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and makes their grip stronger. It may also improve their quality of life. However, the drug probably makes little to no difference to how quickly their hand and eye muscles relax, and it may increase unwanted effects. The drug lamotrigine probably improves quality of life and may help hand and eyelid muscles relax faster. However, lamotrigine probably increases unwanted effects, such as headache, tiredness, and rash.\n\nFor other drugs looked at for myotonia, it is unclear if they have an effect.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate, mainly because most of the studies were very small. Also, for some of the less common drugs, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Knowing which treatment they received could have influenced how they reported their symptoms, possibly affecting the study's results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

However, a few small revisions will make it even more accessible for readers. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify the Methods section to avoid repetition.**\n   - **The issue:** The definition for \"randomized controlled trials\" is provided twice, once in the 'Aims' section and again in the 'Methods' section.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance).\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Since you've already defined the term, you can simplify this to: \"We searched for randomized controlled trials that compared drug treatments with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another drug in people with myotonia.\"\n\n2. **Use more direct, active language.**\n   - **The issue:** Some sentences use the passive voice, which can make the text feel less direct. This is often clearer.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"Different drugs are used to help reduce the symptoms of myotonia.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Doctors use different drugs to help reduce the symptoms of myotonia.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the limitations using simpler terms.**\n   - **The issue:** The explanation of bias in the limitations section is a bit long and uses academic phrasing.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"Knowing which treatment they received could have influenced how they reported their symptoms, possibly affecting the study's results.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This knowledge could have biased how people reported their symptoms and affected the results.\"\n\nThese small changes will help streamline the text and ensure it is as clear as possible for a lay audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and structure. However, four metrics deviate from the typical range, indicating a higher-than-usual number of nouns (177), long words (187), and complex words (257). This supports the editorial feedback to simplify vocabulary and sentence structure where possible to enhance the clarity."
