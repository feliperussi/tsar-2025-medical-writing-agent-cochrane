  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of drug treatments for myotonia (difficulty relaxing muscles)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with non-dystrophic myotonia (a genetic condition causing muscle stiffness), the drugs mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce stiffness and improve quality of life. For people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition causing muscle weakness and stiffness), mexiletine may help muscles relax faster. These treatments can cause unwanted effects, such as stomach problems, tiredness, and headache.\n- The evidence is based on a small number of studies, so it is not clear why some people do not respond to these treatments. Future research is needed to test other medicines and to find the best ways to run studies for these rare conditions.\n\nWhat is myotonia?\nMyotonia is a condition that makes it hard for muscles to relax after you use them. This can cause symptoms like stiffness, cramps, pain, and tiredness, which can be disabling. It is the main symptom of a group of genetic conditions called myotonic disorders. The two main types are myotonic dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonia. In myotonic dystrophy, other parts of the body like the heart and eyes are also affected. In non-dystrophic myotonia, the condition mainly affects the muscles. Different drugs are used to help reduce the symptoms of myotonia.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different drugs work to improve the symptoms of myotonia and whether they cause any unwanted side effects. We looked for evidence from studies called randomised controlled trials, which are the best type of study to assess the effects of treatments.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies where people were assigned to a treatment group by chance (called randomized controlled trials). These studies compared drug treatments with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another drug in people with myotonia. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 17 randomized controlled trials with a total of 392 people. The people in the studies had either myotonic dystrophy type 1 (219 people) or non-dystrophic myotonia (173 people). The studies mainly tested the drugs mexiletine and lamotrigine against a placebo. The studies also looked at several other drugs, but the evidence for them was unclear.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine probably helps hand muscles relax faster than a placebo. However, mexiletine may make little to no difference to their quality of life and may increase unwanted effects, such as stomach and gut problems, tiredness, and headache.\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia, mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and makes their grip stronger. It may also improve their quality of life. However, the drug may not change how quickly they can relax their hand after gripping, and it may increase unwanted effects. The drug lamotrigine probably improves quality of life and may help hand and eyelid muscles relax faster. However, lamotrigine probably increases unwanted effects, such as headache, tiredness, and rash.\n\nFor other drugs looked at for myotonia, it is unclear if they have an effect.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate, mainly because most of the studies were very small. Also, for some of the less common drugs, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have changed how they reported their symptoms, which could affect the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear and well-structured. However, a few revisions are needed to improve precision and make it easier for readers to understand the key findings.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Improve the precision of the main results.** The language used to describe the effect on muscle relaxation is inconsistent and could confuse readers. Specifically, the certainty level for one finding doesn't match the source evidence.\n    *   **Problem:** 'For people with non-dystrophic myotonia... the drug may not change how quickly they can relax their hand after gripping...'\n    *   **Reason:** This is confusing when compared to the finding for myotonic dystrophy ('probably helps hand muscles relax faster'). The phrase 'may not change' is also less precise than the source evidence, which states there is 'probably... little to no difference'.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change the sentence to: 'However, the drug probably makes little to no difference to how quickly their hand and eye muscles relax, and it may increase unwanted effects.'\n\n2. **Simplify the explanation of study limitations.** The description of potential bias is a bit abstract and uses complex vocabulary.\n    *   **Problem:** 'This knowledge could have changed how they reported their symptoms, which could affect the results.'\n    *   **Reason:** This sentence is noun-heavy and less direct than it could be. The metrics show that the summary has a higher number of complex and long words than is typical.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please consider this more direct alternative: 'Knowing which treatment they received could have influenced how they reported their symptoms, possibly affecting the study's results.'\n\n3. **Make the methods section more concise.** The description of the study search could be more direct.\n    *   **Problem:** 'We searched for studies where people were assigned to a treatment group by chance (called randomized controlled trials).'\n    *   **Reason:** This phrasing is slightly wordy and less direct than the standard definition.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please rephrase to: 'We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance).'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft is highly readable, with excellent scores for sentence length and all major readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, etc.), which fall in the best quartile. However, the analysis indicates that vocabulary complexity is higher than typical for a Plain Language Summary. Three metrics deviate from the usual pattern: the number of nouns, Dale-Chall complex words, and long words are all in the 90th percentile range, suggesting that replacing some technical or long words with simpler alternatives could further improve clarity."
