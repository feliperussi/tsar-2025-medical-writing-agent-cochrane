  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of drug treatments for myotonia (difficulty relaxing muscles)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with non-dystrophic myotonia (a genetic condition causing muscle stiffness), the drugs mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce stiffness and improve quality of life. For people with myotonic dystrophy (a condition causing muscle weakness and stiffness), mexiletine may help muscles relax faster. These treatments can cause unwanted effects, such as stomach problems, tiredness, and headache.\n- Because the evidence comes from a small number of studies, it is not clear why some people do not respond to these treatments. Future research is needed to test other potential medicines and to find the best ways to conduct studies for these rare conditions.\n\nWhat is myotonia?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles are slow to relax after being used. This can cause symptoms like stiffness, cramps, pain, and fatigue, which can be disabling. It is the main symptom of a group of genetic conditions called myotonic disorders. The two main types are myotonic dystrophy (which also affects other parts of the body, such as the heart and eyes) and non-dystrophic myotonia (which mainly affects the muscles). Various drugs, such as sodium channel blockers, are used to help reduce the symptoms of myotonia.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well different drugs work to improve the symptoms of myotonia and whether they cause any unwanted side effects. We looked for evidence from studies called randomised controlled trials, which are the best type of study to assess the effects of treatments.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared drug treatments with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another drug in people with myotonia. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 17 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 392 people. The participants had either myotonic dystrophy type 1 (219 people) or non-dystrophic myotonia (173 people). The studies investigated various drug treatments, primarily mexiletine and lamotrigine, compared to a placebo. Other medications explored included phenytoin, imipramine, procainamide, clomipramine, nifedipine, tocainide, diazepam, quinine, diphenylhydantoin, and taurine. The abstract did not provide information on the duration of the studies, their funding sources, or the countries where they were conducted.\n\nMain results: Drug treatments for myotonia\nFor people with myotonic dystrophy, the drug mexiletine probably reduces the time it takes for hand muscles to relax after gripping when compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment). However, mexiletine may make little to no difference to their quality of life and may increase unwanted effects, such as stomach and gut problems, tiredness, and headache.\n\nFor people with non-dystrophic myotonia, mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness and probably improves hand grip strength. Mexiletine may also improve quality of life. On the other hand, it probably makes little to no difference to the time it takes for muscles in the eyes and hands to relax and may increase unwanted effects. The drug lamotrigine probably improves quality of life and may improve the time it takes for hand and eyelid muscles to relax. However, lamotrigine probably increases unwanted effects, such as headache, fatigue, and rash.\n\nFor other drugs investigated for myotonia, it is unclear if they have an effect.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns that most of the studies were very small. For some of the less common medicines, it is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nEvidence currency statement\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs some revisions to meet our style guidelines and improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issue is that several subheadings do not follow the required question format. Additionally, the text contains overly complex vocabulary and some wordy phrases that make it difficult to read.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** Several subheadings are currently statements, which goes against our style guide. This is a critical fix to help readers navigate the summary.\n   - **Problematic subheadings:** \"Methods\", \"Main results: Drug treatments for myotonia\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Evidence currency statement\"\n   - **Suggested rewrites:**\n     - For \"Methods\", use: \"What did we do in this review?\"\n     - For \"Main results...\", use: \"What were the main results?\"\n     - For \"Limitations of the evidence\", use: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n     - For \"Evidence currency statement\", use: \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n2. **Simplify the long list of technical drug names.** Presenting a long, uninterrupted list of medications is overwhelming for readers and doesn't add to their understanding, especially since the evidence for them was unclear.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Other medications explored included phenytoin, imipramine, procainamide, clomipramine, nifedipine, tocainide, diazepam, quinine, diphenylhydantoin, and taurine.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies also look at several other drugs, but the evidence for them was unclear or they were found to be ineffective.\"\n\n3. **Remove redundancy and simplify sentence structure.** Some sentences are unnecessarily wordy or repeat information, which can slow the reader down.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"For people with myotonic dystrophy, the drug mexiletine probably reduces the time it takes for hand muscles to relax after gripping when compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment).\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"For people with myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine probably helps hand muscles relax faster than a placebo.\"\n   (Note: 'Placebo' is already defined in the 'Methods' section, so it doesn't need to be defined again here.)",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics like sentence length and use of pronouns are good (in the best quartile), there are significant deviations in vocabulary complexity. The metrics for Dale-Chall complex words ('complex_words_dc') and long words ('long_words') are well beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the vocabulary is much more complex than is typical for a PLS. This is supported by high scores for other complexity metrics like 'smog_index' and 'complex_words'. Additionally, the high number of nouns, passive voice constructions, and nominalizations suggests the writing could be more direct and active, which would improve readability."
