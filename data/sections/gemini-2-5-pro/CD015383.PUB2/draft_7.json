  "draft": "Can therapy that uses psychedelic drugs (such as LSD or 'magic mushrooms') help relieve anxiety and depression in people with a life-threatening illness?\n\n– For people with a life-threatening illness, therapy with certain psychedelic drugs (such as psilocybin from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) may help to relieve anxiety and depression. The therapy caused some temporary unwanted effects, like raised blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety. These effects were not serious and went away quickly. We are very unsure about the effects of therapy using a different drug, MDMA (or 'Ecstasy').\n– The studies we found were small. Because of the powerful effects of these drugs, it was obvious to people whether they had received the real treatment or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). This makes it difficult to be certain about the results. We need larger and better-designed studies to understand the true benefits and harms of this therapy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy and why is it being studied?\nPeople with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, often experience severe anxiety and depression. They may also feel hopeless or that their life has lost its meaning (sometimes called 'existential distress'). Researchers are studying if psychedelic-assisted therapy can treat these feelings. In this therapy, a person takes a psychedelic drug (like psilocybin from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) in a safe, controlled setting. Trained therapists guide them through the process, which includes therapy sessions before they take the drug to prepare, and sessions after to help them understand their experience. However, these drugs are illegal in most countries and may have risks.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy for treating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We compared it with a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or other treatments like antidepressants.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe looked for studies that compared 2 groups of people who were put into groups by chance (randomly). One group received psychedelic therapy and the other received a placebo ('dummy' treatment). Comparing groups this way is the best method to see if a treatment really works and to judge how certain we can be about the results.\n\nResults\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with a total of 149 people who had life-threatening diseases. The people in the studies were between 36 and 64 years old. The studies took place in the USA and Switzerland, and they lasted between 6 and 12 months. The studies looked at therapy using either classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) or MDMA. Organizations that promote this type of therapy funded the studies, not drug companies.\n\nFor people with life-threatening diseases, therapy with classical psychedelics (like psilocybin or LSD) may reduce anxiety and depression. The results for 'existential distress' (feelings of hopelessness) were unclear. The therapy may help, but the evidence is very uncertain and we cannot be sure. We also do not know if therapy with MDMA affects anxiety or depression.\n\nThe studies reported no serious unwanted effects. The therapy caused temporary, minor to moderate unwanted effects like increased blood pressure, feeling sick, or anxiety. These effects went away after the drug wore off or within a week.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for 2 main reasons. First, the studies included few people. Second, because the drugs have powerful effects, people likely knew if they received the real treatment or the placebo. This can affect the results and make them less reliable.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks have passed. However, a few targeted improvements will make it even more accessible to readers before final approval. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Simplify complex vocabulary and phrasing.** Some sentences use more complex words and constructions than necessary, which can slow readers down. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing a high number of long words and words outside the Dale-Chall common vocabulary list.\n   - **Example:** \"The results for 'existential distress' (feelings of hopelessness) were unclear. The therapy may help, but the evidence is very uncertain and we cannot be sure.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Try a more direct phrasing like, \"It is unclear if the therapy helped with 'existential distress' (feelings of hopelessness). The evidence is very uncertain, so we cannot be sure.\"\n\n2. **Use active voice to make sentences more direct.** Some sentences use the passive voice, which can make the text feel less personal and slightly more academic. Using the active voice makes it clearer who is doing what.\n   - **Example:** \"Unwanted effects, such as raised blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety, were reported but were not serious and did not last long.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this in the active voice: \"People who had the therapy reported unwanted effects like raised blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety. These effects were not serious and did not last long.\"\n\n3. **Make the description of the methods more concise.** The explanation of the study design is a bit wordy.\n   - **Example:** \"We looked for studies that compared 2 groups of people who were put into groups by chance (randomly). One group received psychedelic therapy and the other received a placebo ('dummy') treatment.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** This could be simplified to: \"We searched for studies that randomly put people into two groups. One group received psychedelic therapy and the other received a placebo ('dummy') treatment.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, four metrics related to vocabulary complexity deviate significantly from the norm (P90 range): 'nouns', 'smog_index', 'complex_words_dc', and 'long_words'. This indicates that while sentence structure is excellent, the word choice could be simplified by reducing the number of long, technical, or uncommon words to improve overall accessibility."
