  "draft": "Can therapy that uses psychedelic drugs (such as LSD or 'magic mushrooms') help relieve anxiety and depression in people with a life-threatening illness?\n\n- For people with a life-threatening illness, therapy with certain psychedelic drugs (such as psilocybin from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) may help to relieve anxiety and depression. People reported unwanted effects, such as raised blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety, but these were not serious and did not last long. We are very unsure about the effects of therapy using a different drug, MDMA (or 'Ecstasy').\n- The studies we found were small. Because of the powerful effects of these drugs, it was obvious to people whether they had received the real treatment or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). This makes it difficult to be certain about the results. We need larger and better-designed studies to understand the true benefits and harms of this therapy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy and why is it being studied?\nPeople with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, often experience severe anxiety and depression. They may also feel hopeless or that their life has lost its meaning (sometimes called 'existential distress'). Researchers are studying if psychedelic-assisted therapy can treat these feelings. This therapy involves taking a psychedelic drug (like psilocybin from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) in a controlled setting with trained therapists. The drug is given as part of a therapy program. This includes sessions before taking the drug to prepare, and sessions after to help the person make sense of their experience. However, these drugs are illegal in most countries and may have risks.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy for treating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We compared it with a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or other treatments like antidepressants.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe looked for studies where people were randomly assigned to receive either psychedelic therapy or a different treatment, such as a placebo ('dummy' treatment). We then compared the results from the groups to see the effects of the therapy. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence to understand how reliable the findings are.\n\nResults\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with a total of 149 people who had life-threatening diseases. The people in the studies were between 36 and 64 years old. Researchers conducted the studies in the USA and Switzerland, and they lasted between 6 and 12 months. The studies looked at therapy using either classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) or MDMA. Funding for the studies came from organizations that promote this type of therapy, not from drug companies.\n\nFor people with life-threatening diseases, therapy with classical psychedelics (like psilocybin or LSD) may reduce anxiety and depression. We do not know if this therapy affects existential distress. We also do not know if therapy with MDMA affects anxiety or depression.\n\nThe studies reported no serious unwanted effects. People who had the therapy experienced temporary, minor to moderate unwanted effects like increased blood pressure, nausea, or anxiety. These effects went away after the drug wore off or within a week.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for two main reasons. First, the studies included few people. Second, because the drugs have powerful effects, people likely knew if they received the real treatment or the placebo. This can influence the results and make them less reliable.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies published up to March 2024.",

However, I am recommending a few revisions to address a pattern of using slightly formal vocabulary, which makes the text harder to read than it needs to be. Addressing these points will make an already good summary even better for patients and the public.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Replace formal words with simpler, everyday alternatives.**\nThe draft sometimes uses words that are more complex than necessary. Choosing simpler synonyms will improve readability.\n- **Quote:** \"Researchers **conducted** the studies in the USA and Switzerland...\" and \"This can **influence** the results and make them less reliable.\"\n- **Problem:** Words like \"conducted\" and \"influence\" are formal. Simpler, more common words will make the text more accessible.\n- **Suggestion:** Change to \"The studies **took place** in the USA and Switzerland...\" and \"This can **affect** the results and make them less reliable.\"\n\n2. **Make the description of the methods more direct.**\nThe methods section is a bit long and describes the process step-by-step, which can be simplified for a lay audience.\n- **Quote:** \"We looked for studies where people were randomly assigned to receive either psychedelic therapy or a different treatment, such as a placebo ('dummy' treatment). We then compared the results from the groups to see the effects of the therapy. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence to understand how reliable the findings are.\"\n- **Problem:** This is a bit procedural. A more concise summary of the approach would be easier to follow.\n- **Suggestion:** Rewrite as: \"We searched for studies that put people into groups by chance to receive either psychedelic therapy or a different treatment (like a placebo). We then compared the results from the groups and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n3. **Use more active and direct phrasing for key findings.**\nSome sentences, particularly about the therapy's effects, could be more direct.\n- **Quote:** \"People reported unwanted effects, such as raised blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety, but these were not serious and did not last long.\"\n- **Problem:** This phrasing is slightly indirect. A more active sentence makes the cause-and-effect relationship clearer.\n- **Suggestion:** Rewrite as: \"The therapy caused some temporary unwanted effects, like raised blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety. These effects were not serious and went away quickly.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in sentence structure, with excellent readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at the 25th percentile). However, the analysis reveals a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics, including `smog_index`, `complex_words`, `long_words`, `complex_words_dc`, and `nouns`, are in the P90 range, indicating that the text uses more complex, long, and unfamiliar words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. The feedback focuses on simplifying word choice to address this."
