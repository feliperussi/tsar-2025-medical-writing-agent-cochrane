  "draft": "Can therapy that uses psychedelic drugs (such as LSD or 'magic mushrooms') help relieve anxiety and depression in people with a life-threatening illness?\n\n- For people with a life-threatening illness, therapy with certain psychedelic drugs (such as psilocybin from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) may help to relieve anxiety and depression. People reported unwanted effects, such as raised blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety, but these were not serious and did not last long. We are very unsure about the effects of therapy using a different drug, MDMA (or 'Ecstasy').\n- The studies we found were small. Because of the powerful effects of these drugs, it was obvious to people whether they had received the real treatment or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). This makes it difficult to be certain about the results. We need larger and better-designed studies to understand the true benefits and harms of this therapy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy and why is it being studied?\nPeople with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, often experience severe anxiety, depression, and existential distress (feelings of hopelessness or loss of meaning). Researchers are exploring psychedelic-assisted therapy as a possible treatment for this distress. This therapy involves taking a psychedelic drug (like psilocybin from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) in a controlled setting with trained therapists. The experience is part of a wider treatment program that includes therapy sessions before and after to help the person prepare and make sense of their experience. However, these drugs are illegal in most countries and may have risks.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy for treating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We compared it with a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or other treatments like antidepressants.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychedelic-assisted therapy with a placebo ('dummy' treatment) or other therapies. In these studies, people were randomly put into groups to receive either the psychedelic therapy or a different treatment. We then combined the results of these studies to get an overall picture of the benefits and harms and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with a total of 149 people who had life-threatening diseases. The people in the studies were between 36 and 64 years old. Researchers conducted the studies in the USA and Switzerland, and they lasted between 6 and 12 months. The studies looked at therapy using either classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) or MDMA. Organizations that promote this type of therapy funded the studies, not drug companies.\n\nFor people with life-threatening diseases, therapy with classical psychedelics (like psilocybin or LSD) may reduce anxiety and depression. We do not know if this therapy affects existential distress. We also do not know if therapy with MDMA affects anxiety or depression.\n\nThe studies reported no serious unwanted effects. People who had the therapy experienced temporary, minor to moderate unwanted effects like increased blood pressure, nausea, or anxiety. These effects went away after the drug wore off or within a week.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies were very small, and it is likely that people knew which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies published up to March 2024.",

The following 3 suggestions are intended to make it even more accessible to a lay audience by simplifying some key phrases and terms, addressing the vocabulary complexity identified in the evaluation report.\n\n1. **Simplify the introduction of 'existential distress'.** The current phrasing introduces a technical term first, which can be a barrier for some readers. The evaluation metrics support simplifying vocabulary, as the draft has a high number of complex and long words (in the top 10% compared to other summaries).\n    - **Problematic text:** \"People with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, often experience severe anxiety, depression, and existential distress (feelings of hopelessness or loss of meaning).\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"People with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, often experience severe anxiety and depression. They may also feel hopeless or that their life has lost its meaning (sometimes called 'existential distress').\"\n\n2. **Make the description of the review process more concrete.** The current explanation of the methods is a bit abstract and could better convey the rigorous process used in a Cochrane review.\n    - **Problematic text:** \"We then combined the results of these studies to get an overall picture of the benefits and harms and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We then compared and combined the results from the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence to understand how reliable the findings are.\"\n\n3. **Rephrase noun-heavy sentences to be more direct.** The metrics show a high number of nouns (159), which can sometimes make sentences feel dense. Simplifying these constructions can improve flow.\n    - **Problematic text:** \"Organizations that promote this type of therapy funded the studies, not drug companies.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Funding for the studies came from organizations that promote this type of therapy, not from drug companies.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows a mixed profile. While structural metrics like sentence length (words_per_sentence: P25) and active voice use (active_voice: P75) are excellent, the summary's vocabulary is more complex than typical for a PLS. Five metrics deviate significantly from the norm, all related to word complexity: nouns (P90), smog_index (P90), complex_words_dc (P90), complex_words (P90), and long_words (P90). This suggests the main opportunity for improvement is in simplifying word choices and reducing the density of technical terms."
