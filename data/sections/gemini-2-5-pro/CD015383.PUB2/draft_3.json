  "draft": "Can therapy that uses psychedelic drugs (such as LSD or 'magic mushrooms') help relieve anxiety and depression in people with a life-threatening illness?\n\n- For people with a life-threatening illness, therapy with certain psychedelic drugs (such as psilocybin from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) may help to relieve anxiety and depression. People reported unwanted effects, such as raised blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety, but these were not serious and did not last long. We are very unsure about the effects of therapy using a different drug, MDMA (or 'Ecstasy').\n- The studies we found were small. Because of the powerful effects of these drugs, it was obvious to people whether they had received the real treatment or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). This makes it difficult to be certain about the results. We need larger and better-designed studies to understand the true benefits and harms of this therapy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy and why is it being studied?\nPeople with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, often experience severe anxiety and depression. They may also feel hopeless or that their life has lost its meaning (sometimes called 'existential distress'). Researchers are exploring psychedelic-assisted therapy as a possible treatment for this distress. This therapy involves taking a psychedelic drug (like psilocybin from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) in a controlled setting with trained therapists. The experience is part of a wider treatment program that includes therapy sessions before and after to help the person prepare and make sense of their experience. However, these drugs are illegal in most countries and may have risks.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy for treating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We compared it with a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or other treatments like antidepressants.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychedelic-assisted therapy with a placebo ('dummy' treatment) or other therapies. In these studies, people were randomly put into groups to receive either the psychedelic therapy or a different treatment. We then compared and combined the results from the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence to understand how reliable the findings are.\n\nResults\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with a total of 149 people who had life-threatening diseases. The people in the studies were between 36 and 64 years old. Researchers conducted the studies in the USA and Switzerland, and they lasted between 6 and 12 months. The studies looked at therapy using either classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) or MDMA. Funding for the studies came from organizations that promote this type of therapy, not from drug companies.\n\nFor people with life-threatening diseases, therapy with classical psychedelics (like psilocybin or LSD) may reduce anxiety and depression. We do not know if this therapy affects existential distress. We also do not know if therapy with MDMA affects anxiety or depression.\n\nThe studies reported no serious unwanted effects. People who had the therapy experienced temporary, minor to moderate unwanted effects like increased blood pressure, nausea, or anxiety. These effects went away after the drug wore off or within a week.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies were very small, and it is likely that people knew which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies published up to March 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and accuracy have passed. To make it even more accessible for a patient audience, I recommend focusing on three key areas:\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Wording**\nSome sentences use vocabulary that could be simpler for readers without a medical background.\n- **Original:** 'Researchers are exploring psychedelic-assisted therapy as a possible treatment for this distress.'\n- **Why it's a problem:** 'Exploring' is a bit vague, and 'distress' is a formal term.\n- **Suggestion:** 'Researchers are studying if psychedelic-assisted therapy can treat these feelings.'\n\n- **Original:** 'The experience is part of a wider treatment program that includes therapy sessions before and after to help the person prepare and make sense of their experience.'\n- **Why it's a problem:** 'Wider treatment program' is slightly clunky and formal.\n- **Suggestion:** 'The drug is given as part of a therapy program. This includes sessions before taking the drug to prepare, and sessions after to help the person make sense of their experience.'\n\n**2. Clarify the 'Methods' Section**\nThe description of how the review was done is a bit dense and uses formal language.\n- **Original:** 'We searched for studies that compared psychedelic-assisted therapy with a placebo ('dummy' treatment) or other therapies. In these studies, people were randomly put into groups to receive either the psychedelic therapy or a different treatment. We then compared and combined the results from the studies.'\n- **Why it's a problem:** This section could be more direct and active, walking the reader through the process more simply.\n- **Suggestion:** 'We looked for studies where people were randomly assigned to receive either psychedelic therapy or a different treatment (like a placebo). We then compared the results from the groups to see the effects of the therapy.'\n\n**3. Better Explain the Limitations**\nThe explanation for *why* the evidence is limited could be clearer for the reader.\n- **Original:** 'We have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies were very small, and it is likely that people knew which treatment they were getting.'\n- **Why it's a problem:** It doesn't explain *why* knowing the treatment is a problem for the results. The phrase 'little confidence' is also very blunt.\n- **Suggestion:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is low for two main reasons. First, the studies included few people. Second, because the drugs have powerful effects, people likely knew if they received the real treatment or the placebo. This can influence the results and make them less reliable.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your draft is very readable overall, but the linguistic analysis supports the need to simplify vocabulary. Four metrics related to word complexity (SMOG index, complex words, and long words) were higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, indicating that replacing some longer, more technical words with everyday alternatives would improve clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and style. However, four metrics related to vocabulary complexity—smog_index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words—are in the P90 range. This indicates that while sentence structure is excellent, the text contains more long or uncommon words than is typical for a PLS, which could be simplified to improve reader understanding."
