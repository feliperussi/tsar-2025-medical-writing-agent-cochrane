  "draft": "Can therapy that uses psychedelic drugs (such as LSD or 'magic mushrooms') help relieve anxiety and depression in people with a life-threatening illness?\n\n- For people with a life-threatening illness, therapy with certain psychedelic drugs (such as psilocybin from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) may help to relieve anxiety and depression. The therapy caused some temporary unwanted effects, like raised blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety. These effects were not serious and went away quickly. We are very unsure about the effects of therapy using a different drug, MDMA (or 'Ecstasy').\n- The studies we found were small. Because of the powerful effects of these drugs, it was obvious to people whether they had received the real treatment or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). This makes it difficult to be certain about the results. We need larger and better-designed studies to understand the true benefits and harms of this therapy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy and why is it being studied?\nPeople with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, often experience severe anxiety and depression. They may also feel hopeless or that their life has lost its meaning (sometimes called 'existential distress'). Researchers are studying if psychedelic-assisted therapy can treat these feelings. This therapy involves taking a psychedelic drug (like psilocybin from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) in a controlled setting with trained therapists. The drug is given as part of a therapy program. This includes sessions before taking the drug to prepare, and sessions after to help the person make sense of their experience. However, these drugs are illegal in most countries and may have risks.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy for treating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We compared it with a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or other treatments like antidepressants.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that put people into groups by chance to receive either psychedelic therapy or a different treatment, like a placebo ('dummy' treatment). We then compared the results from the groups and rated our confidence in the evidence to understand how reliable the findings are.\n\nResults\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with a total of 149 people who had life-threatening diseases. The people in the studies were between 36 and 64 years old. The studies took place in the USA and Switzerland, and they lasted between 6 and 12 months. The studies looked at therapy using either classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) or MDMA. Funding for the studies came from organizations that promote this type of therapy, not from drug companies.\n\nFor people with life-threatening diseases, therapy with classical psychedelics (like psilocybin or LSD) may reduce anxiety and depression. We do not know if this therapy affects existential distress. We also do not know if therapy with MDMA affects anxiety or depression.\n\nThe studies reported no serious unwanted effects. The therapy caused temporary, minor to moderate unwanted effects like increased blood pressure, feeling sick, or anxiety. These effects went away after the drug wore off or within a week.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for two main reasons. First, the studies included few people. Second, because the drugs have powerful effects, people likely knew if they received the real treatment or the placebo. This can affect the results and make them less reliable.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies published up to March 2024.",

However, a few small changes can make it even easier for readers to understand.

One group received psychedelic therapy, and the other received a different treatment (like a placebo).'\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the draft has a higher number of nouns, long words, and complex words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Addressing these points will improve overall readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with over 72% of its features falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, the analysis also highlights four metrics that deviate from the typical range: the SMOG index (a readability measure), the count of nouns, the count of long words (7+ characters), and the count of complex words from the Dale-Chall list. These deviations suggest that while the sentence structure is good, the vocabulary could be simplified further to enhance reader understanding."
