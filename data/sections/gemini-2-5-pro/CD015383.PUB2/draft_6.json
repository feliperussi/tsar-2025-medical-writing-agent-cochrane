  "draft": "Can therapy that uses psychedelic drugs (such as LSD or 'magic mushrooms') help relieve anxiety and depression in people with a life-threatening illness?\n\n– For people with a life-threatening illness, therapy with certain psychedelic drugs (such as psilocybin from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) may help to relieve anxiety and depression. The therapy caused some temporary unwanted effects, like raised blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety. These effects were not serious and went away quickly. We are very unsure about the effects of therapy using a different drug, MDMA (or 'Ecstasy').\n– The studies we found were small. Because of the powerful effects of these drugs, it was obvious to people whether they had received the real treatment or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). This makes it difficult to be certain about the results. We need larger and better-designed studies to understand the true benefits and harms of this therapy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy and why is it being studied?\nPeople with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, often experience severe anxiety and depression. They may also feel hopeless or that their life has lost its meaning (sometimes called 'existential distress'). Researchers are studying if psychedelic-assisted therapy can treat these feelings. This therapy involves taking a psychedelic drug (like psilocybin from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) in a controlled setting with trained therapists. The drug is given as part of a therapy program. This includes sessions before taking the drug to prepare, and sessions after to help the person make sense of their experience. However, these drugs are illegal in most countries and may have risks.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy for treating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life-threatening diseases. We compared it with a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or other treatments like antidepressants.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies where people were randomly put into groups. One group received psychedelic therapy, and the other received a different treatment, like a placebo ('dummy' treatment). We then compared the results from the groups and judged how certain we could be about these results.\n\nResults\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies with a total of 149 people who had life-threatening diseases. The people in the studies were between 36 and 64 years old. The studies took place in the USA and Switzerland, and they lasted between 6 and 12 months. The studies looked at therapy using either classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) or MDMA. Organizations that promote this type of therapy funded the studies, not drug companies.\n\nFor people with life-threatening diseases, therapy with classical psychedelics (like psilocybin or LSD) may reduce anxiety and depression. We do not know if this therapy affects existential distress. We also do not know if therapy with MDMA affects anxiety or depression.\n\nThe studies reported no serious unwanted effects. The therapy caused temporary, minor to moderate unwanted effects like increased blood pressure, feeling sick, or anxiety. These effects went away after the drug wore off or within a week.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for two main reasons. First, the studies included few people. Second, because the drugs have powerful effects, people likely knew if they received the real treatment or the placebo. This can affect the results and make them less reliable.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies published up to March 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured, factually accurate, and meets all critical requirements. However, a few key improvements are needed to enhance clarity for a patient audience before it can be approved. The main issues are some overly complex phrasing and an oversimplification of one of the key findings. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify Complex Phrasing and Word Choice.**\nSome sentences, while technically correct, use more complex words and phrasing than necessary. Simplifying these will make the text easier for readers to process.\n- **Problematic Text:** \"This therapy involves taking a psychedelic drug (like psilocybin from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) in a controlled setting with trained therapists. The drug is given as part of a therapy program. This includes sessions before taking the drug to prepare, and sessions after to help the person make sense of their experience.\"\n- **Reasoning:** The phrasing \"involves taking\", \"given as part of a therapy program\", and the repetition of \"sessions\" is a bit clinical and wordy.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In this therapy, a person takes a psychedelic drug in a safe, controlled setting. Trained therapists guide them through the process, which includes therapy sessions before they take the drug to prepare, and sessions after to help them understand their experience.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the Finding on 'Existential Distress'.**\nThe summary introduces the concept of 'existential distress' but then simplifies the result in a way that loses important nuance from the original review.\n- **Problematic Text:** \"We do not know if this therapy affects existential distress.\"\n- **Reasoning:** The original abstract states the evidence is \"very uncertain\" and \"mixed,\" which is different from a complete lack of knowledge. This simplification might mislead readers into thinking there was no effect, when in fact the evidence was just too weak to be sure.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The results for 'existential distress' (feelings of hopelessness) were unclear. The therapy may help, but the evidence is very uncertain and we cannot be sure.\"\n\n3. **Make the Methods Section More Meaningful.**\nThe description of the methods is accurate but could better explain *why* this research method is important for readers to trust the findings.\n- **Problematic Text:** \"We searched for studies where people were randomly put into groups... We then compared the results from the groups and judged how certain we could be about these results.\"\n- **Reasoning:** This explains *what* was done, but not *why* randomizing people into groups is a reliable way to test a treatment.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We looked for studies that compared two groups of people who were put into groups by chance (randomly). One group received psychedelic therapy and the other received a placebo ('dummy' treatment). Comparing groups this way is the best method to see if a treatment really works and to judge how certain we can be about the results.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and structure. However, three metrics related to vocabulary complexity—SMOG index, Dale-Chall complex words, and long words—deviate significantly from the typical range (P90). This supports the editorial feedback that while the sentence structure is simple, the word choice could be simplified further to improve reader understanding."
