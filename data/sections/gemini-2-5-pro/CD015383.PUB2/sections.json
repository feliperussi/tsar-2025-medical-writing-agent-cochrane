  "key_messages": [
    "For people with a life-threatening illness, therapy that uses certain psychedelic drugs (such as psilocybin, from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) may help to relieve anxiety and depression. Unwanted effects, such as raised blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety, were reported but were not serious and did not last long. We are very unsure about the effects of therapy using a different drug, MDMA (or 'Ecstasy').",
    "The studies we found were small, and because of the powerful effects of these drugs, it was obvious to people whether they had received the real treatment or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). This makes it difficult to be certain about the results. Larger and better-designed studies are needed to better understand the true benefits and potential harms of this type of therapy."

      "subheading": "What is psychedelic-assisted therapy and why is it being studied?",
      "content": "People with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, often experience severe anxiety, depression, and existential distress (feelings of hopelessness or loss of meaning). Psychedelic-assisted therapy is being explored as a possible treatment for this distress. This therapy involves taking a psychedelic substance (like psilocybin, also known as 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) in a controlled setting under the supervision of trained therapists. The experience is part of a wider treatment program that includes therapy sessions before and after to help the person prepare and make sense of their experience. However, these substances are illegal in most countries and may have risks."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review included six studies with a total of 149 participants who had life-threatening diseases. The participants' ages ranged from 36 to 64 years. The studies, which lasted between 6 and 12 months, were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. The review examined psychedelic-assisted therapy using either classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) or MDMA, compared to a placebo or a low-dose psychedelic. The studies were not funded by drug companies but by organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy. For people with life-threatening diseases, psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (like psilocybin or LSD) may reduce anxiety and may reduce depression. We do not know if this therapy has an effect on existential distress. We also do not know if psychedelic-assisted therapy with MDMA has an effect on anxiety or depression. No serious unwanted effects were reported. The therapy was associated with temporary, minor to moderate unwanted effects like increased blood pressure, nausea, or anxiety, which went away after the drug's effects wore off or within a week."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the studies were very small.",
