  "draft": "Can therapy that uses psychedelic drugs (such as LSD or 'magic mushrooms') help relieve anxiety and depression in people with a life-threatening illness?\n\n- For people with a life-threatening illness, therapy that uses certain psychedelic drugs (such as psilocybin, from 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) may help to relieve anxiety and depression. Unwanted effects, such as raised blood pressure, feeling sick, and anxiety, were reported but were not serious and did not last long. We are very unsure about the effects of therapy using a different drug, MDMA (or 'Ecstasy').\n- The studies we found were small, and because of the powerful effects of these drugs, it was obvious to people whether they had received the real treatment or a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment). This makes it difficult to be certain about the results. Larger and better-designed studies are needed to better understand the true benefits and potential harms of this type of therapy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat is psychedelic-assisted therapy and why is it being studied?\nPeople with life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, often experience severe anxiety, depression, and existential distress (feelings of hopelessness or loss of meaning). Psychedelic-assisted therapy is being explored as a possible treatment for this distress. This therapy involves taking a psychedelic substance (like psilocybin, also known as 'magic mushrooms', or LSD) in a controlled setting under the supervision of trained therapists. The experience is part of a wider treatment program that includes therapy sessions before and after to help the person prepare and make sense of their experience. However, these substances are illegal in most countries and may have risks.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of psychedelic-assisted therapy for treating anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life‑threatening diseases. We compared it with a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment) or other active treatments like antidepressants.\n\nMethods\n\nSearch Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search for randomized controlled trials that evaluated psychedelic‑assisted therapy. The search was limited to studies where participants were randomly allocated to either the psychedelic intervention or a control condition.\n\nEligibility Criteria\nIncluded studies had to compare psychedelic‑assisted therapy with a placebo (dummy treatment) or with other active treatments. Only trials meeting the definition of a randomized controlled trial were eligible.\n\nData Synthesis\nResults from the eligible trials were pooled using meta‑analytic techniques to obtain combined effect estimates for the outcomes of interest.\n\nConfidence Assessment\nThe overall certainty of the evidence was evaluated using a structured rating system, taking into account risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and publication bias.\n\nResults\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included six studies with a total of 149 participants who had life-threatening diseases. The participants' ages ranged from 36 to 64 years. The studies, which lasted between 6 and 12 months, were conducted in outpatient settings in the USA and Switzerland. The review examined psychedelic-assisted therapy using either classical psychedelics (psilocybin and LSD) or MDMA, compared to a placebo or a low-dose psychedelic. The studies were not funded by drug companies but by organizations that promote psychedelic-assisted therapy. For people with life-threatening diseases, psychedelic-assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (like psilocybin or LSD) may reduce anxiety and may reduce depression. We do not know if this therapy has an effect on existential distress. We also do not know if psychedelic-assisted therapy with MDMA has an effect on anxiety or depression. No serious unwanted effects were reported. The therapy was associated with temporary, minor to moderate unwanted effects like increased blood pressure, nausea, or anxiety, which went away after the drug's effects wore off or within a week.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft has a strong foundation but requires significant revisions to meet Cochrane Plain Language Summary standards. A critical issue is that several subheadings in the 'Methods', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' sections are not phrased as questions, which is a requirement. The primary area for improvement is the 'Methods' section, which is too technical for a lay audience. Additionally, the draft frequently uses passive voice and complex vocabulary, making it difficult to read.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rewrite the technical 'Methods' section in plain language.** The current section uses jargon that patients will not understand.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Results from the eligible trials were pooled using meta-analytic techniques to obtain combined effect estimates for the outcomes of interest.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This describes a complex statistical process using inaccessible terms like 'pooled', 'meta-analytic techniques', and 'effect estimates'.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** The entire 'Methods' section should be simplified. For example, you could replace the four technical subheadings with one simple question and answer: \"**How did we conduct this review?** We searched for studies that compared psychedelic‑assisted therapy with a placebo ('dummy' treatment) or other therapies. We then combined the results of these studies to get an overall picture of the benefits and harms.\"\n\n2. **Convert passive voice to active voice.** The style guide requires active voice ('We did X'), but the draft contains many passive constructions ('X was done'), which makes the text less direct and harder to follow.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"The overall certainty of the evidence was evaluated using a structured rating system...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** It's unclear who did the evaluating. Using 'we' makes the process clearer and more engaging for the reader.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We evaluated the overall certainty of the evidence using a structured rating system...\"\n\n3. **Simplify complex words and sentence structures.** The draft uses unnecessarily complex words and noun‑heavy phrases (nominalizations) that reduce clarity.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"...psychedelic‑assisted therapy with classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) may result in a reduction in anxiety when compared to active placebo...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"result in a reduction in\" is wordy. Using a direct verb is simpler and more effective.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...therapy with classical psychedelic (psilocybin, LSD) may reduce anxiety compared to an active placebo...\"\n\nAddressing these points, particularly by rewriting the 'Methods' section and converting passive sentences to active ones, will significantly improve the summary's clarity and readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics like sentence length (P50) and active voice count (P75) are within acceptable ranges, several key indicators of complexity deviate significantly. The draft has an unusually high number of passive voice constructions, complex words, long words, and nominalizations (all ranking 'BEYOND_P90' or 'P90'). The SMOG index is also 'BEYOND_P90', indicating the text requires a higher grade level to understand than is typical for a PLS. These metrics confirm the editorial finding that the text, especially the 'Methods' section, is more technical and less direct than recommended, impacting readability for a lay audience."
