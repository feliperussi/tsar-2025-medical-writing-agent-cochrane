  "draft": "Can programs run by community or primary care health workers help to prevent mental health problems and improve mental well-being in low- and middle-income countries?\n\nKey messages\n\n- In low- and middle-income countries, programs run by community or primary care health workers may help to improve mental well-being and reduce symptoms of common mental health problems like anxiety and depression in both adults and children. The review found limited information about unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The evidence is not strong because of weaknesses in how the studies were carried out. Future, better-quality research is needed to be more certain about the benefits of these programs and to understand how to best support this type of care.\n\nHow can we improve mental health support in places with limited resources?\n\nMental health is a key part of overall well-being. However, in many low- and middle-income countries, there are not enough trained mental health specialists, like psychiatrists or psychologists, to meet the needs of the population. One possible solution is to train primary care and community health workers to deliver mental health support. This approach, sometimes called 'task-shifting', can help more people get care. This support can be for everyone (universal prevention), for people at higher risk of developing mental health problems (selective prevention), or for people already showing early signs of a problem (indicated prevention).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if mental health support delivered by primary care and community health workers is effective for adults and children in low- and middle-income countries. Specifically, we wanted to know if these interventions could help promote well-being and prevent mental health problems. We also looked at whether these programs affected costs or how often people used healthcare services.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that tested mental health support provided by primary-level or community workers. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 113 studies with 32,992 adults and children in various low- and middle-income countries. We looked at three types of programs: universal (for everyone), selective (for people at high risk), and indicated (for people with early signs of a disorder). We compared these programs to the usual care people received. For adults, interventions for people at high risk (selective prevention) probably reduce depressive symptoms. Interventions for everyone (universal prevention) probably reduce anxiety symptoms slightly. For children, interventions for everyone may improve quality of life slightly and slightly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Interventions for children at high risk probably reduce distress or post-traumatic stress (PTSD) symptoms slightly but make little to no difference to depressive symptoms. For children with early signs of a disorder, the programs slightly reduced both functional impairment and depressive symptoms.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\n\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Our confidence is also limited because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

Critical Issue: Factual Inaccuracy**\nThe results section contains a statement that contradicts the source material provided.\n- **Your Text:** 'For children with early signs of a disorder, the programs slightly reduced both functional impairment and depressive symptoms.'\n- **Source of Truth:** 'For children with early signs of a disorder, it is unclear if the interventions have an effect.'\n- **Action:** You must revise this sentence to accurately reflect the source of truth. This is the most important change required.\n\n**2. Simplify Definitions of Prevention Types**\nThe sentence defining the three types of prevention is grammatically correct but dense and uses technical terms upfront.\n- **Your Text:** 'This support can be for everyone (universal prevention), for people at higher risk of developing mental health problems (selective prevention), or for people already showing early signs of a problem (indicated prevention).'\n- **Why it's a problem:** This structure is heavy and introduces jargon before the explanation. Reversing this makes it easier for readers to absorb.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'This support can be offered in three ways: to everyone in a community (called universal prevention); to people with a higher risk of mental health problems (selective prevention); or to those already showing early signs of a problem (indicated prevention).'\n\n**3. Replace Complex and Long Words**\nThe text uses several words that are longer and more complex than necessary. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the number of long words and complex words to be unusually high (in the 90th percentile compared to other summaries).\n- **Your Text:** '...there are not enough trained mental health specialists, like psychiatrists or psychologists, to meet the needs of the population.'\n- **Why it's a problem:** 'Population' is a formal word that can be simplified.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** '...to meet the needs of all the people.'\n- **Your Text:** 'Specifically, we wanted to know if these interventions could help promote well-being...'\n- **Why it's a problem:** 'Interventions' is a technical term. The draft uses the simpler word 'programs' elsewhere, which is better for consistency and clarity.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Specifically, we wanted to know if these programs could help improve well-being...'\n\n**4. Break Up Complex Sentences in the Results**\nSome sentences in the results section combine multiple findings, which can be difficult for readers to follow.\n- **Your Text:** 'Interventions for children at high risk probably reduce distress or post-traumatic stress (PTSD) symptoms slightly but make little to no difference to depressive symptoms.'\n- **Why it's a problem:** This sentence presents a positive and a neutral finding together, which can be confusing. Separating them improves clarity.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'For children at high risk, these programs probably reduce symptoms of distress or post-traumatic stress (PTSD) slightly. However, they seem to make little to no difference for symptoms of depression.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 61% of features in the best quartile for readability and structure. However, four metrics deviate significantly from the norm: nominalization (use of noun-form verbs), total nouns, complex words from the Dale-Chall list, and long words (7+ characters) are all in the P90 range. This indicates the vocabulary and sentence structure are denser and more complex than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, supporting the need for the suggested edits."
