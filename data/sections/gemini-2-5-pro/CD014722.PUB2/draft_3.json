  "draft": "Can programs run by community or primary care health workers help to prevent mental health problems and improve mental well-being in low- and middle-income countries?\n\nKey messages\n\n- In low- and middle-income countries, programs run by community or primary care health workers may help to improve mental well-being and reduce symptoms of common mental health problems like anxiety and depression in both adults and children. The review found limited information about unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The evidence is not strong because of weaknesses in how the studies were carried out. Future, better-quality research is needed to be more certain about the benefits of these programs and to understand how to best support this type of care.\n\nHow can we improve mental health support in places with limited resources?\n\nMental health is a key part of overall well-being. However, in many low- and middle-income countries, there are not enough trained mental health specialists, like psychiatrists or psychologists, to meet the needs of all the people. One possible solution is to train primary care and community health workers to deliver mental health support. This approach, sometimes called 'task-shifting', can help more people get care. This support can be offered in three ways: to everyone in a community (called universal prevention); to people with a higher risk of mental health problems (selective prevention); or to those already showing early signs of a problem (indicated prevention).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if mental health support delivered by primary care and community health workers is effective for adults and children in low- and middle-income countries. Specifically, we wanted to know if these programs could help improve well-being and prevent mental health problems. We also looked at whether these programs affected costs or how often people used healthcare services.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that tested mental health support provided by primary-level or community workers. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 113 studies with 32,992 adults and children in various low- and middle-income countries. We looked at three types of programs: universal (for everyone), selective (for people at high risk), and indicated (for people with early signs of a disorder). We compared these programs to the usual care people received. For adults, programs for people at high risk (selective prevention) probably reduce depressive symptoms. Programs for everyone (universal prevention) probably reduce anxiety symptoms slightly. For children, programs for everyone may improve quality of life slightly and slightly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. For children at high risk, these programs probably reduce symptoms of distress or post-traumatic stress (PTSD) slightly. However, they seem to make little to no difference for symptoms of depression. For children with early signs of a disorder, it is unclear if the programs have an effect.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\n\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Our confidence is also limited because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the program.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

I am marking it as 'NOT_APPROVED' to ensure these key changes are made.\n\nHere are the top 3 suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Clarify the types of prevention by breaking up a long, complex sentence.** The sentence defining the three types of prevention is 39 words long and introduces three new concepts at once, which can be overwhelming for the reader.\n   - **Original Text:** \"This support can be offered in three ways: to everyone in a community (called universal prevention); to people with a higher risk of mental health problems (selective prevention); or to those already showing early signs of a problem (indicated prevention).\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This support can be offered in three ways. **Universal prevention** is for everyone in a community. **Selective prevention** is for people with a higher risk of mental health problems. **Indicated prevention** is for those already showing early signs of a problem.\"\n\n2. **Simplify noun-heavy phrases to make sentences more direct.** Some sentences rely heavily on nouns and wordy phrases, which can make them less direct and harder to read. Changing these to use more active verbs will improve clarity.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Our confidence is also limited because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the program.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence is also limited because the studies included different types of people and the programs were delivered in different ways.\"\n\n3. **Use active voice to make the text more engaging.** The draft uses passive voice in several places. Changing to active voice makes it clearer who is performing the action and is generally easier to read.\n   - **Original Text:** \"The evidence is not strong because of weaknesses in how the studies were carried out.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence is not strong because of weaknesses in how researchers carried out the studies.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour draft has excellent readability scores and sentence length. The suggestions above are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the text deviates from typical PLS patterns with high counts for nouns (P90), complex words (P90), and long words (P90). Addressing these vocabulary issues will bring the text more in line with best practices for plain language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of metrics in the best quartile. Readability scores and sentence length are excellent. However, the draft deviates from typical patterns on vocabulary complexity, with high counts for nouns (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), and long words (P90). This suggests that while sentences are short, the word choice could be simpler and more direct."
