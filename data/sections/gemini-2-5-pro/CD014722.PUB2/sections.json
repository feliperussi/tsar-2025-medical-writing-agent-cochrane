  "key_messages": [
    "In low- and middle-income countries, programs run by community or primary care health workers may help to improve mental well-being and reduce symptoms of common mental health problems like anxiety and depression in both adults and children. The review found limited information about unwanted or harmful effects.",
    "The evidence is not strong because of weaknesses in how the studies were carried out. Future, better-quality research is needed to be more certain about the benefits of these programs and to understand how to best support this type of care."

      "subheading": "How can we improve mental health support in places with limited resources?",
      "content": "Mental health is a key part of overall well-being. However, in many low- and middle-income countries, there are not enough trained mental health specialists, like psychiatrists or psychologists, to meet the needs of the population. One possible solution is to train primary care and community health workers to deliver mental health support. This approach, sometimes called 'task-shifting', can help more people get care. This support can be for everyone (universal prevention), for people at higher risk of developing mental health problems (selective prevention), or for people already showing early signs of a problem (indicated prevention)."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if mental health support delivered by primary care and community health workers is effective for adults and children in low- and middle-income countries. Specifically, we wanted to know if these interventions could help promote well-being and prevent mental health problems. We also looked at the impact these interventions had on costs and the use of healthcare resources."

      "content": "We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that tested mental health support provided by primary-level or community workers. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 113 studies with 32,992 adults and children in various low- and middle-income countries. Interventions were categorized as universal (for everyone), selective (for people at high risk), or indicated (for people with early signs of a disorder), and were compared to usual care. For adults, interventions for people at high risk (selective prevention) probably reduce depressive symptoms. Interventions for everyone (universal prevention) probably reduce anxiety symptoms slightly. For children, interventions for everyone may improve quality of life slightly and slightly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Interventions for children at high risk probably reduce distress or post-traumatic stress (PTSD) symptoms slightly but make little to no difference to depressive symptoms. For children with early signs of a disorder, it is unclear if the interventions have an effect."

  ],
  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Our confidence is also limited because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to November 2021."
