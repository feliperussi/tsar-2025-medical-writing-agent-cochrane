  "draft": "Can programs run by community or primary care health workers help to prevent mental health problems and improve mental well-being in low- and middle-income countries?\n\nKey messages\n\n- In low- and middle-income countries, programs run by community or primary care health workers may help to improve mental well-being and reduce symptoms of common mental health problems like anxiety and depression in both adults and children. The review found limited information about unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The evidence is not strong because of weaknesses in how researchers carried out the studies. Future, better-quality research is needed to be more certain about the benefits of these programs and to understand how to best support this type of care.\n\nHow can we improve mental health support in places with limited resources?\n\nMental health is a key part of overall well-being. However, in many low- and middle-income countries, there are not enough trained mental health specialists, like psychiatrists or psychologists, to meet the needs of all the people. One possible solution is to train primary care and community health workers to deliver mental health support. This approach, sometimes called 'task-shifting', can help more people get care. This support can be offered in 3 ways. Universal prevention is for everyone in a community. Selective prevention is for people with a higher risk of mental health problems. Indicated prevention is for those already showing early signs of a problem.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if mental health support delivered by primary care and community health workers is effective for adults and children in low- and middle-income countries. Specifically, we wanted to know if these programs could help improve well-being and prevent mental health problems. We also looked at whether these programs affected costs or how often people used healthcare services.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly put into one of 2 or more treatment groups) that tested mental health support provided by primary-level or community workers. We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included 113 studies with 32,992 adults and children in various low- and middle-income countries. We looked at 3 types of programs: universal (for everyone), selective (for people at high risk), and indicated (for people with early signs of a disorder). We compared these programs to the usual care people received. For adults, programs for people at high risk (selective prevention) probably reduce depressive symptoms. Programs for everyone (universal prevention) probably reduce anxiety symptoms slightly. For children, programs for everyone may improve quality of life slightly and slightly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. For children at high risk, these programs probably reduce symptoms of distress or post-traumatic stress (PTSD) slightly. However, they seem to make little to no difference for symptoms of depression. For children with early signs of a disorder, it is unclear if the programs have an effect.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\n\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Our confidence is also limited because the studies included different types of people and the programs were delivered in different ways.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021.",

I am recommending 'NOT_APPROVED' not because of major flaws, but because a few specific revisions will make the text significantly easier for readers to understand. Here are the top 3 improvements I suggest:\\n\\n1. **Avoid technical jargon by using plain language descriptions directly.**\\nThe draft introduces and defines three technical terms ('Universal', 'Selective', 'Indicated') prevention) and then uses them later. This requires the reader to remember the definitions. It's simpler to just use the descriptions.\\n- **Problematic Text:** \\\"This support can be offered in 3 ways. Universal prevention is for everyone in a community. Selective prevention is for people with a higher risk of mental health problems. Indicated prevention is for those already showing early signs of a problem... For adults, programs for people at high risk (selective prevention) probably reduce depressive symptoms.\\\"\\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** In the introduction, you can simplify: \\\"This support can be for everyone, for people at higher risk of mental health problems, or for people already showing early signs of a problem.\\\" Then, in the results, use those descriptions directly: \\\"For adults at high risk of mental health problems, these programs probably reduce depressive symptoms slightly.\\\"\\n\\n2. **Clarify the size of the effect for adults.**\\nThe summary of findings for adults omits a key detail from the original abstract, which could slightly overstate the benefit.\\n- **Problematic Text:** \\\"For adults, programs for people at high risk (selective prevention) probably reduce depressive symptoms.\\\"\\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \\\"For adults, programs for people at high risk (selective prevention) probably reduce depressive symptoms **slightly**.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Simplify noun-heavy sentences to make them more direct.**\\nSome sentences are grammatically correct but use many nouns, which can make them feel dense and less active. Using more direct verbs can help.\\n- **Problematic Text:** \\\"However, in many low- and middle-income countries, there are not enough trained mental health specialists, like psychiatrists or psychologists, to meet the needs of all the people.\\\"\\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \\\"However, many low- and middle-income countries do not have enough trained mental health specialists, like psychiatrists or psychologists, to care for everyone.\\\"\\n\\nMaking these changes will help address the high number of nouns and complex words identified in the evaluation, making an already good summary even more accessible to your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, the analysis identified three metrics in the P90 range, indicating deviation from typical patterns. These are: nouns (177), Dale-Chall complex words (231), and long words (184). This suggests that while the text is generally readable, it relies on more noun-heavy phrasing and contains more complex or long vocabulary than a typical PLS, supporting the editorial recommendations to simplify sentence structures and technical terms."
