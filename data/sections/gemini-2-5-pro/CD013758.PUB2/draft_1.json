  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of higher-protein versus lower-protein formula for babies?\n\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, we are unsure if infant formulas with different amounts of protein have an effect on a baby's growth (such as becoming underweight or overweight).\n- There may be little or no difference in the risk of short-term unwanted effects (like diarrhea or vomiting) between formulas with higher or lower protein content.\n- More and better studies are needed to understand the long-term effects of different protein levels in infant formula on a child's growth and overall health. The results of several ongoing studies may provide more clarity in the future.\n\nMain question\n\nWhy is the amount of protein in infant formula important?\nMany babies are fed with infant formula, either instead of or in addition to breast milk, to help them grow and develop. Formulas can contain different amounts of protein. Some formulas have a higher protein content, which is intended to help babies gain weight more quickly during their first year. However, it is not clear whether the benefits of these higher‑protein formulas outweigh any possible risks for healthy babies born on time (not prematurely).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of feeding formula with higher protein levels compared to formula with lower protein levels to healthy infants. We were particularly interested on the effects on babies' growth (including the risk of being underweight or overweight) and whether higher‑protein formulas caused any unwanted effects.\n\nHow we did the review\n\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched for studies that compared feeding healthy infants with formula that had a higher protein content against formula with a lower protein content.\n\nData Synthesis\nWe then combined the results.\n\nConfidence Assessment\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat the evidence from the review shows\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 11 studies involving 1885 healthy, formula-fed term infants from high-income countries. The studies compare different levels of protein in infant formula. For healthy infants fed with formula, we are very uncertain if using a high-protein formula compared to a standard-protein formula has any effect on their growth or their risk of becoming overweight or obese later in childhood. High-protein formula may make little to no difference to the risk of side effects like diarrhea or vomiting. Similarly, we are very uncertain if using a standard-protein formula compared to a low-protein formula has any effect on an infant's growth. Standard-protein formula may also make little to no difference to the risk of side effects.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.",

While the text is generally readable and factually accurate, it fails on a critical style guide rule and contains several areas with jargon and awkward phrasing that reduce clarity for a lay audience.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions.** Several subheadings are currently statements or labels, which violates the style guide. This makes the summary harder for readers to scan and engage with.\n   - **Problematic subheadings:** \"How we did the review\", \"Search Strategy\", \"Data Synthesis\", \"Confidence Assessment\", \"What the evidence from the review shows\", \"Limitations of the evidence\".\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Change these to questions, for example, \"How did we conduct the review?\" and \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n\n2. **Simplify the methods section.** The section titled \"How we did the review\" is overly simplistic and uses headings that are essentially jargon. It doesn't add value for the reader.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Search Strategy / We searched for studies... Data Synthesis / We then combined the results. Confidence Assessment / We rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Consider removing this section entirely, as the concepts are already covered in other parts of the summary. If you keep it, combine it into a single, more descriptive paragraph under a question like \"How did we find and analyze the evidence?\"\n\n3. **Remove jargon and awkward phrasing.** Some sentences use technical terms or are phrased unnaturally, which can confuse readers.\n   - **Problematic phrase 1:** \"...the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Delivering the intervention\" is clinical trial jargon.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Be more specific and use plain language, such as \"...the studies used different types of formula and feeding schedules...\"\n   - **Problematic phrase 2:** \"The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"of search\" is grammatically awkward.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Simply state, \"The evidence is up to date to October 2022.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. 78% of the metrics fall within the best quartile for readability and simplicity (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at P25). However, these strong quantitative results mask qualitative issues not captured by the metrics, such as the failure to follow the style guide for subheadings and the use of clinical jargon. The metrics confirm the text has a solid foundation, but the specific editorial feedback should be addressed to improve overall quality and adherence to guidelines."
