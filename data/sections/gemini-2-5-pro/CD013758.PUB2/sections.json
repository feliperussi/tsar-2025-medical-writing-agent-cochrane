  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, we are unsure if infant formulas with different amounts of protein have an effect on a baby's growth (such as becoming underweight or overweight).",
    "There may be little or no difference in the risk of short-term unwanted effects (like diarrhea or vomiting) between formulas with higher or lower protein content.",
    "More and better studies are needed to understand the long-term effects of different protein levels in infant formula on a child's growth and overall health. The results of several ongoing studies may provide more clarity in the future."

    {
      "subheading": "Why is the amount of protein in infant formula important?",
      "content": "Many babies are fed with infant formula, either instead of or in addition to breast milk, to help them grow and develop. Formulas can contain different amounts of protein. Some formulas have a higher protein content, which is intended to help babies gain weight more quickly during their first year. However, it is not clear whether the benefits of these higher‑protein formulas outweigh any possible risks for healthy babies born on time (not prematurely)."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of feeding formula with higher protein levels compared to formula with lower protein levels to healthy infants. We were particularly interested on the effects on babies' growth (including the risk of being underweight or overweight) and whether higher‑protein formulas caused any unwanted effects."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 11 studies involving 1885 healthy, formula-fed term infants from high-income countries. The studies compare different levels of protein in infant formula. For healthy infants fed with formula, we are very uncertain if using a high-protein formula compared to a standard-protein formula has any effect on their growth or their risk of becoming overweight or obese later in childhood. High-protein formula may make little to no difference to the risk of side effects like diarrhea or vomiting. Similarly, we are very uncertain if using a standard-protein formula compared to a low-protein formula has any effect on an infant's growth. Standard-protein formula may also make little to no difference to the risk of side effects."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
