  "key_messages": [
    "For women with a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (called premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD), birth control pills containing the hormone drospirenone may improve symptoms and their impact on daily life. However, these pills may also cause more unwanted effects, such as breast pain and nausea, compared to a dummy pill (placebo).",
    "The studies found that women taking a dummy pill (placebo) also reported a significant improvement in their symptoms, which makes it difficult to output? Actually, the original message: \"The studies found that women taking a dummy pill (placebo) also reported a significant improvement in their symptoms, which makes it difficult to be certain about the true effect of the birth control pills.\"",
    "It is not clear if these pills are helpful for women with less severe premenstrual symptoms, if they work for longer than three months, or how they compare with other types of birth control pills. More research is needed to answer these questions."

      "content": "Many women experience a range of physical and emotional symptoms in the days leading up to their monthly period. This is known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). A less common but more severe form of this condition is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Combined oral contraceptives (often called 'the pill') contain two types of hormones and are used for birth control. Researchers have studied whether these pills can also help relieve the symptoms of PMS. One specific type of pill, which contains the hormone drospirenone, has been approved to treat PMDD in women who also want to use it for contraception."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included five studies involving 858 women, most of whom were diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. The studies compared combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol against a placebo. The review did not find any studies that compared this type of contraceptive with other combined oral contraceptives. The abstract did not provide information on the duration of the studies, the countries where they took place, or the sources of funding."

      "subheading": "Main results: Oral contraceptives containing drospirenone for premenstrual syndrome",
      "content": "For women with severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS), oral contraceptives containing the hormone drospirenone may improve symptoms and the problems they cause with work, social activities, and relationships when compared to a placebo (a dummy pill).\n\nHowever, these oral contraceptives may also increase the risk of side effects. If 28 out of 100 people taking a placebo experience side effects, it is estimated that between 40 and 54 out of 100 people taking the oral contraceptive would experience them. These side effects probably include more breast pain, and may include more nausea, bleeding between periods, and menstrual problems. We do not know if they affect nervousness, headache, weakness, or pain.\n\nThe increased risk of side effects may lead to more people stopping the treatment. For every 100 people taking a placebo, about 3 might stop treatment due to side effects. For every 100 people taking the oral contraceptive, it is estimated that between 6 and 16 might stop for the same reason.\n\nWe are uncertain about the effect of these oral contraceptives on mood symptoms. The review did not find any studies that compared these oral contraceptives with other types of oral contraceptives."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies were also done in different types of people, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search."
