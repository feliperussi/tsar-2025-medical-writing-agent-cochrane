  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of birth control pills containing drospirenone (a type of hormone) for premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?\n\n- For women with a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (called premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD), birth control pills containing the hormone drospirenone may improve symptoms and their impact on daily life. However, these pills may also cause more unwanted effects, such as breast pain and nausea, compared to a dummy pill (placebo).\n- The studies found that women taking a dummy pill (placebo) also reported a significant improvement in their symptoms, which makes it difficult to be certain about the true effect of the birth control pills.\n- It is not clear if these pills are helpful for women with less severe premenstrual symptoms, if they work for longer than three months, or how they compare with other types of birth control pills. More research is needed to answer these questions.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is premenstrual syndrome?\nMany women experience a range of physical and emotional symptoms in the days leading up to their monthly period. This is known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). A less common but more severe form of this condition is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Combined oral contraceptives (often called 'the pill') contain two types of hormones and are used for birth control. Researchers have studied whether these pills can also help relieve the symptoms of PMS. One specific type of pill, which contains the hormone drospirenone, has been approved to treat PMDD in women who also want to use it for contraception.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone are for treating the symptoms of PMS.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared birth control pills containing drospirenone with a placebo (a dummy pill) for treating premenstrual syndrome. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included five studies involving 858 women, most of whom were diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. The studies compared combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol against a placebo. The review did not find any studies that compared this type of contraceptive with other combined oral contraceptives.\n\nMain results: Oral contraceptives containing drospirenone for premenstrual syndrome\nFor women with severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS), oral contraceptives containing the hormone drospirenone may improve symptoms and the problems they cause with work, social activities, and relationships when compared to a placebo (a dummy pill).\n\nHowever, these oral contraceptives may also increase the risk of side effects. If 28 out of 100 people taking a placebo experience side effects, it is estimated that between 40 and 54 out of 100 people taking the oral contraceptive would experience them. These side effects probably include more breast pain, and may include more nausea, bleeding between periods, and menstrual problems. We do not know if they affect nervousness, headache, weakness, or pain.\n\nThe increased risk of side effects may lead to more people stopping the treatment. For every 100 people taking a placebo, about 3 might stop treatment due to side effects. For every 100 people taking the oral contraceptive, it is estimated that between 6 and 16 might stop for the same reason.\n\nWe are uncertain about the effect of these oral contraceptives on mood symptoms. The review did not find any studies that compared these oral contraceptives with other types of oral contraceptives.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies were also done in different types of people, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start, but it fails a critical check and needs a few revisions to improve clarity and structure before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: All subheadings must be questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions to help guide the reader. Two subheadings in the draft do not follow this rule.\n   - **Problematic Text:** The subheadings \"Methods\" and \"Main results: Oral contraceptives containing drospirenone for premenstrual syndrome\" are not questions.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Please change \"Methods\" to \"How did we conduct the review?\" and remove the non-question subheading \"Main results...\" entirely (see next point).\n\n1. **Streamline the results section to avoid confusion.** The results are currently split under a repeated heading and a non-question heading, which is confusing for readers.\n   - **Problematic Structure:** The heading \"What did we find?\" appears twice, separated by the non-question heading \"Main results...\". This breaks the flow of information.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Combine all the findings under a single, clear \"What did we find?\" section. Remove the second instance of the heading and the \"Main results...\" subheading.\n\n1. **Use active voice to make the limitations clearer.** The 'Limitations' section uses passive voice, which can make the reasons for low confidence in the evidence sound indirect and less clear.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies were also done in different types of people...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low for a few reasons. First, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Second, the studies did not all provide the data we were looking for. Finally, the studies included different types of people, and there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly readable, with most metrics falling in the best quartile for PLS texts. However, the analysis also supports the need for the suggested edits. The draft deviates from typical PLS patterns with a high number of passive voice constructions (23), nouns (185), and complex/long words. Addressing the passive voice and streamlining the structure will help align the text more closely with best practices for plain language."
