  "draft": "Can changing shift work schedules improve sleep and reduce sleepiness for shift workers?\n\nKey messages\nWe found that some changes to shift work schedules may help shift workers. Limiting a single shift to 16 hours may increase how long workers sleep and probably reduces how sleepy they feel. Other changes, such as how quickly shifts change and in what direction (for example, from morning to evening shifts, known as forward rotation), may reduce sleepiness, but could also reduce the amount of sleep people get. The review did not report on other unwanted or harmful effects.\nThe evidence we found was not strong enough to be certain about the effects of most changes to shift work schedules. More and better studies are needed to understand how to best schedule shifts to improve sleep and reduce sleepiness for workers.\n\nHow can shift work affect sleep and safety?\nMany people work in jobs that require them to work in shifts, often outside of typical daytime hours. This type of work can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. As a result, shift workers often do not get enough sleep, which can affect their alertness at work. This can be a risk to their health and safety on the job. Changing how shift schedules are organised might be one way to reduce these problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what effects different changes to shift work schedules have on sleep for shift workers. We were interested in three main things: the quality of their sleep, the total amount of time they slept, and how sleepy they felt during their shifts.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that changed shift work schedules to see how this affected workers' sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness. We compared and summarized the results from the studies. We also used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.\n\nWhat did the studies find?\nWe found 11 studies that included a total of 2125 shift workers. The studies looked at changing schedules in several ways: how shifts rotated (forward vs. backward, faster vs. slower), the length of shifts (limiting them to 16 hours, or using shorter vs. longer shifts), and how workweeks were organised (more compressed vs. more spread out).\nLimiting work shifts to a maximum of 16 hours may increase how long workers sleep and probably reduces sleepiness slightly. For other types of schedule changes, the effects are less clear. Changing the direction of shift rotation from backward to forward, or using a faster rotation, may reduce sleepiness during shifts. Faster rotation may also make little to no difference to sleep quality but may reduce sleep duration. Using shorter shifts or more compressed workweeks may have little to no effect on sleep or sleepiness. We are very uncertain about the results for other changes, like how shifts are rotated, how long they last, and how they are grouped together.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different schedule groups. This means we can't be sure if the results were caused by the schedule changes or by pre-existing differences between the groups of workers. There are also not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to April 2022.",

The text demonstrates high conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of its linguistic features falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. All readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 7.9) are excellent, indicating the text is very easy to understand. The only minor deviation is a slightly high noun count (161, in the 90th percentile range), which suggests some sentences could be more verb-driven, but this does not significantly impact overall clarity. The draft is well-structured, uses active voice effectively, and is factually sound."
