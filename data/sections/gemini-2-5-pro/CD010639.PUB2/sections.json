  "plain_title": "Can changing shift work schedules improve sleep and reduce sleepiness for shift workers?",
  "key_messages": [
    "We found that some changes to shift work schedules may help shift workers. Limiting the length of a single shift to 16 hours probably increases sleep time and reduces sleepiness. Other changes, such as the speed of changing between shifts and the direction of change (for example, from morning to evening shifts, known as forward rotation), may reduce sleepiness, but could also reduce the amount of sleep people get. The review did not report on other unwanted or harmful effects.",
    "The evidence we found was not strong enough to be certain about the effects of most changes to shift work schedules. More and better studies are needed to understand how to best schedule shifts to improve sleep and reduce sleepiness for workers."

    {
      "subheading": "How can shift work affect sleep and safety?",
      "content": "Many people work in jobs that require them to work in shifts, often outside of typical daytime hours. This type of work can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. As a result, shift workers often do not get enough sleep, which can affect their alertness at work. This can be a risk to their health and safety on the job. Changing how shift schedules are organised might be one way to reduce these problems."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out what effects different changes to shift work schedules have on sleep for shift workers. We were interested in three main things: the quality of their sleep, the total amount of time they slept, and how sleepy they felt during their shifts."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We searched for studies that changed shift work schedules to see how this affected workers' sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Data Synthesis",
      "content": "We then combined the results of the studies."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 11 studies that included a total of 2125 shift workers. The studies investigated several types of changes to shift schedules, including forward versus backward rotation, faster versus slower rotation, limiting shift duration to 16 hours versus no limit, shorter versus longer shifts, and more compressed versus more spread out schedules."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Limiting shift duration",
      "content": "Limiting work shifts to a maximum of 16 hours probably reduces sleepiness slightly and may increase how long workers sleep. For other types of schedule changes, the effects are less clear. Changing the direction of shift rotation from backward to forward, or using a faster rotation, may reduce sleepiness during shifts. Faster rotation may also make little to no difference to sleep quality but may reduce sleep duration. Using shorter shifts or more compressed workweeks may have little to no effect on sleep or sleepiness. For all of these other changes—regarding rotation, duration, and compression—we are very uncertain about the results."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the treatments. There are also not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to April 2022 of search."
