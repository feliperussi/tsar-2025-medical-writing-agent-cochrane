  "draft": "Can changing shift work schedules improve sleep and reduce sleepiness for shift workers?\n\nKey messages\nWe found that some changes to shift work schedules may help shift workers. Limiting the length of a single shift to 16 hours probably increases sleep time and reduces sleepiness. Other changes, such as the speed of changing between shifts and the direction of change (for example, from morning to evening shifts, known as forward rotation), may reduce sleepiness, but could also reduce the amount of sleep people get. The review did not report on other unwanted or harmful effects.\nThe evidence we found was not strong enough to be certain about the effects of most changes to shift work schedules. More and better studies are needed to understand how to best schedule shifts to improve sleep and reduce sleepiness for workers.\n\nIntroduction\nHow can shift work affect sleep and safety?\nMany people work in jobs that require them to work in shifts, often outside of typical daytime hours. This type of work can disrupt the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. As a result, shift workers often do not get enough sleep, which can affect their alertness at work. This can be a risk to their health and safety on the job. Changing how shift schedules are organised might be one way to reduce these problems.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what effects different changes to shift work schedules have on sleep for shift workers. We were interested in three main things: the quality of their sleep, the total amount of time they slept, and how sleepy they felt during their shifts.\n\nMethods\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched for studies that changed shift work schedules to see how this affected workers' sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness.\nData Synthesis\nWe then combined the results of the studies.\nConfidence Assessment\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that included a total of 2125 shift workers. The studies investigated several types of changes to shift schedules, including forward versus backward rotation, faster versus slower rotation, limiting shift duration to 16 hours versus no limit, shorter versus longer shifts, and more compressed versus more spread out schedules.\nMain results: Limiting shift duration\nLimiting work shifts to a maximum of 16 hours probably reduces sleepiness slightly and may increase how long workers sleep. For other types of schedule changes, the effects are less clear. Changing the direction of shift rotation from backward to forward, or using a faster rotation, may reduce sleepiness during shifts. Faster rotation may also make little to no difference to sleep quality but may reduce sleep duration. Using shorter shifts or more compressed workweeks may have little to no effect on sleep or sleepiness. For all of these other changes—regarding rotation, duration, and compression—we are very uncertain about the results.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the treatments. There are also not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and has good overall readability, but it fails a critical check and needs a few key improvements for clarity and style. The main issue is that most subheadings do not follow the required question-based format. Additionally, the Methods section is too brief to be helpful, and some sentences are unnecessarily abstract.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rewrite subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. Many in the draft are just labels.\n    *   **Problematic subheadings:** \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\".\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Please change these to questions, for example: \"How did we conduct the review?\", \"What did the studies find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", and \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\".\n\n2.  **Make the Methods section more descriptive.** The current version is too brief and uses labels instead of explaining the process in plain language.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"Data Synthesis / We then combined the results of the studies. / Confidence Assessment / We rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"How did we analyze the evidence? / We compared and summarized the results from the studies. We also used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.\"\n\n3.  **Use more direct verbs instead of abstract nouns.** Some sentences are noun-heavy, which can make them harder to understand. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"For all of these other changes—regarding rotation, duration, and compression—we are very uncertain about the results.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are very uncertain about the results for other changes, like how shifts are rotated, how long they last, and how they are grouped together.\"\n\n4.  **Correct the awkward phrasing in the currency statement.** The final sentence is ungrammatical.\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"The evidence is up to date to April 2022 of search.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for evidence up to April 2022.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary fully compliant with the style guide and clearer for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft conforms well to most typical PLS patterns, with 83% of features falling in the best quartile for readability (e.g., low sentence length, low passive voice). However, the analysis also highlights significant deviation from typical patterns in two areas: 'nominalization' (P90) and 'nouns' (P90). This high count of abstract nouns supports the editorial feedback to revise sentences to be more direct and verb-focused, which will improve overall clarity."
