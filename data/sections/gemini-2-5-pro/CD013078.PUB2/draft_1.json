  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of strengthening exercises for patellar tendinopathy (pain at the front of the knee)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- For athletes with pain at the front of the knee (patellar tendinopathy), it is uncertain if strengthening exercises improve pain or function compared to no treatment, glucocorticoid injections (a type of steroid), or surgery. The included studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- Future studies of better quality are needed to determine the true benefits and harms of strengthening exercises. This research should include people who are not athletes to see if the findings apply to the general population.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy?\nPatellar tendinopathy is a common condition that causes pain in the tendon at the front of the knee. The main treatment involves different types of exercise, such as strengthening and stretching. Other treatments include injections of medicine (glucocorticoid injections) and surgery.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using exercise to treat people with patellar tendinopathy.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly put into different treatment groups) that compared strengthening exercises with no treatment or other treatments for patellar tendinopathy. We compared and summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nThe review included seven trials with 211 athletes (88% male, average age 26 years) who had chronic patellar tendinopathy. It is unclear how strengthening exercises compare with other treatments such as no treatment, glucocorticoid injections, or surgery. For all comparisons, the evidence suggested that strengthening exercises may make little to no difference to pain or function, or the evidence was too uncertain to draw conclusions. No studies reported on unwanted effects of treatment.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small and it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, the evidence focused on a specific population (athletes), so the results may not apply to the general public.\n\n**How up to date is this evidence?**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023 of search.",

However, it is not approved because it has two minor but important deviations from the Master Style Guide that need to be corrected for consistency. \n\nHere are the top 2 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions.**\n   - **Quote:** \"Methods\" and \"Limitations of the evidence\"\n   - **Problem:** The style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions to help guide the reader. These two are currently statements.\n   - **Suggestion:** Please change \"Methods\" to \"What did we do in this review?\" and \"Limitations of the evidence\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n\n2. **Clarify the evidence currency statement.**\n   - **Quote:** \"The evidence is up to date to September 2023 of search.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"of search\" is awkward and may be unclear to a lay reader.\n   - **Suggestion:** Please rewrite this for better flow. For example: \"This review includes evidence published up to September 2023.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 67% of metrics are in the best quartile, indicating excellent readability. For example, the average sentence length (14.69 words) and Flesch-Kincaid grade level (9.91) are very good. The only metric that deviates from the typical range is 'nominalization' (the use of noun-form verbs), which is slightly high. However, this does not significantly impact the draft's overall clarity."
