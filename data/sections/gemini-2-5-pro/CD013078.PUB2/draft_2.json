  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of strengthening exercises for patellar tendinopathy (pain at the front of the knee)?\n\nKey messages\n- For athletes with pain at the front of the knee (patellar tendinopathy), it is uncertain if strengthening exercises improve pain or function compared to no treatment, glucocorticoid injections (a type of steroid), or surgery. The included studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- Future studies of better quality are needed to determine the true benefits and harms of strengthening exercises. This research should include people who are not athletes to see if the findings apply to the general population.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy?\nPatellar tendinopathy is a common condition that causes pain in the tendon at the front of the knee. The main treatment involves different types of exercise, such as strengthening and stretching. Other treatments include injections of medicine (glucocorticoid injections) and surgery.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using exercise to treat people with patellar tendinopathy.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly put into different treatment groups) that compared strengthening exercises with no treatment or other treatments for patellar tendinopathy. We compared and summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 7 trials with 211 athletes (88% male, average age 26 years) who had chronic patellar tendinopathy. It is unclear how strengthening exercises compare with other treatments such as no treatment, glucocorticoid injections, or surgery. For all comparisons, the evidence suggested that strengthening exercises may make little to no difference to pain or function, or the evidence was too uncertain to draw conclusions. No studies reported on unwanted effects of treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small and it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, the evidence focused on a specific population (athletes), so the results may not apply to the general public.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review includes evidence published up to September 2023.",

The only notable deviation is in the use of nominalizations (noun forms of verbs), which is higher than typical (P90). While this suggests some sentences could be more direct, it does not significantly impact the overall high quality and clarity of the summary."
