  "draft": "What are the views and experiences of healthcare workers on bringing different primary healthcare services together (a process called integration)?\n\nKey messages\n- This review did not seek to answer what healthcare workers' views on bringing services together are. Instead, it found and mapped the available research on their views and experiences of bringing different primary healthcare services together (a process called integration).\n- The review found that the existing research is very diverse. Studies were conducted in many different countries and looked at a wide range of healthcare workers and various ways of integrating services, such as mental health, HIV, and mother and child health services.\n- This review provides a map of the available research. Future reviews can use this map to group similar studies together to better understand how different approaches to integration affect healthcare workers' experiences and the success of these programmes.\n\nWhat this review is about\nWhat is integrated primary healthcare?\nIn many health systems, different health problems are treated by separate, specialised services. For example, a person might have to go to one clinic for mental health support and another for HIV care. Integrated primary healthcare aims to bring different health services together, so people can get more of the care they need in one place. This approach is believed to be a good way to improve health for everyone (an idea known as universal health coverage), especially in countries with limited resources. However, making this change work depends heavily on the healthcare workers who deliver the care. Their experiences and opinions can determine whether these new, combined services are successful.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors knew that many studies have explored healthcare workers' experiences with integrated care. However, these studies are very diverse, looking at different countries, health conditions, and types of workers. The authors wanted to create a map of all this existing research. Their goal was to understand the range of studies available and to identify what topics have been covered and where there are gaps in the research. This map can help guide future researchers who want to combine the findings from these studies.\n\nHow we conducted the review\nWe searched for qualitative studies (studies that explore people's experiences and views) about how healthcare workers perceive the integration of primary healthcare services. We then described and mapped these studies to understand the existing research on this topic.\n\nWhat the review found\nWe found 184 studies from 37 different high-, middle-, and low-income countries. The studies included a wide range of healthcare workers, from policymakers to support staff. They looked at different ways of combining health services, such as integrating mental health into general primary care or linking HIV services with reproductive health services. The main finding is that the research on this topic is very diverse. This review provides a map of the available research but does not draw conclusions about the effects of integrating services.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention. The evidence also focused on many specific populations and interventions, whereas the question we wanted to answer was broader.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs some revisions before it can be approved. There are two critical issues to address: several subheadings do not follow the required question format, and the 'Limitations' section is misleading for this type of review. Additionally, simplifying some of the vocabulary would make the summary easier for a lay audience to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rewrite the misleading 'Limitations' section.** The current text discusses 'confidence in the evidence' as if this were a review of an intervention's effects. For a scoping review that maps existing research, this is confusing. The limitation should be relevant to the review's methods.\n    *   **Problem:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.\"\n    *   **Reason:** This misrepresents the purpose of a scoping review, which is to describe the range of evidence, not to determine an intervention's effectiveness. The diversity of studies is a finding, not a limitation.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Replace the section with a limitation that is appropriate for a scoping review. For example: \"This review mapped existing research but did not combine the results of the studies to draw overall conclusions. Therefore, it does not provide answers about the effects of integrating services. Also, we did not search for unpublished research, so we may have missed some relevant studies.\"\n\n2.  **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. Several are currently phrased as statements.\n    *   **Problem:** \"How we conducted the review\", \"What the review found\", \"Limitations of the evidence\".\n    *   **Suggestion:** Change these to: \"How did we conduct the review?\", \"What did the review find?\", and \"What are the limitations of this review?\"\n\n3.  **Simplify complex words and phrases.** The summary uses vocabulary that may be too technical for a general audience. Replacing long words and noun-heavy phrases with simpler alternatives will improve readability.\n    *   **Problem:** \"Their experiences and opinions can determine whether these new, combined services are successful.\"\n    *   **Reason:** Words like 'determine' and 'successful' can be simplified.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"Their experiences and opinions can decide if these new, combined services work well.\"\n    *   **Problem:** \"The evidence is up to date to July 2020 of search.\"\n    *   **Reason:** The phrasing \"of search\" is awkward.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"We searched for studies up to July 2020.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, particularly in sentence structure and general readability scores, with 44% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, there is a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—'nouns', 'smog_index', 'complex_words_dc', 'complex_words', and 'long_words'—are in the P90 range. This indicates that the draft contains a higher density of nouns, polysyllabic words, and long words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, supporting the editorial recommendation to simplify the vocabulary."
