  "draft": "What are the views and experiences of healthcare workers on bringing different primary healthcare services together (a process called integration)?\n\nKey messages\n– This review did not seek to answer a specific question. Instead, it mapped the existing research on healthcare workers' views and experiences of integrating different health services.\n– We found that the existing research is very diverse. Studies came from many different countries and looked at a wide range of healthcare workers and ways of integrating services, such as mental health, HIV, and mother and child health services.\n– We created a map of the existing research. Other researchers can use this map to group similar studies. This will help them better understand how combining services in different ways affects healthcare workers and whether these programs work well.\n\nWhat is integrated primary healthcare?\nPrimary healthcare is the first type of care a person usually receives, such as from a family doctor or local clinic. In many health systems, different health problems are treated by separate, special services. For example, a person might have to go to one clinic for mental health support and another for HIV care. Integrating health services means people can get more of the care they need in one place. This approach is seen as a good way to improve health for everyone (an idea known as universal health coverage), especially in countries with limited resources. However, this change depends on healthcare workers. Their experiences and opinions can affect whether these new, combined services succeed.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe knew that many studies have looked at healthcare workers' experiences with integrated care. However, these studies are very diverse, looking at different countries, health conditions, and types of workers. We wanted to create a map of all this existing research. We wanted to understand the range of available studies, see what topics they covered, and find any gaps in the research. This map can help guide future researchers who want to combine the findings from these studies.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for qualitative studies (studies that explore people's experiences and views) about how healthcare workers view the integration of health services. We then described and mapped these studies to understand the existing research on this topic.\n\nWhat did the review find?\nWe found 184 studies from 37 different high-, middle-, and low-income countries. The studies included a wide range of healthcare workers, from policymakers to support staff. They looked at different ways of integrating health services, such as combining mental health services with general primary care or linking HIV services with reproductive health services. The main finding is that the research on this topic is very diverse. This review provides a map of the existing research but does not draw conclusions about the effects of integrating services.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThis review mapped existing research rather than answering a specific question about what works. We have little confidence in the evidence from this map. This is because the included studies were very different from each other—they looked at different people, services, and countries. This diversity makes it hard to draw broad conclusions, but it helps future researchers by showing them where more focused research is needed.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured, factually accurate, and meets the word count limit. The readability scores are very good. To make it even clearer for a lay audience, here are three key improvements to focus on:\n\n1. **Clarify the 'Limitations' section to avoid confusion.**\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence from this map.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is confusing. It sounds like the map itself is flawed or untrustworthy. The key point is that a 'mapping' review isn't *designed* to produce a single, confident conclusion about whether an intervention works, which is different from the evidence being of low quality.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This review created a 'map' of existing research, so it was not designed to provide a single, confident answer about what works. Because the studies we found were so different—looking at different people, services, and countries—we cannot draw overall conclusions from them. The map's main purpose is to guide future researchers by showing them where more focused research is needed.\"\n\n2. **Explain the concept of 'mapping' research more clearly.**\n   - **Problematic phrases:** \"...it mapped the existing research...\" and \"We created a map of the existing research.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The term 'map' is used as jargon. A reader unfamiliar with scoping reviews might not understand what it means to 'map' research and may be expecting a visual or geographical map. It's better to use more descriptive, everyday language.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Instead of 'mapped', try verbs like 'collected and organized' or 'identified and grouped'. For example, in the first key message, you could say: \"Instead of answering a specific question, this review collected and organized all the existing research about healthcare workers' views...\"\n\n3. **Simplify some complex vocabulary and phrasing.**\n   - **Problematic phrases:** \"...universal health coverage...\", \"...depends on healthcare workers. Their experiences and opinions can affect whether these new, combined services succeed.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The analysis shows higher-than-typical counts of long and complex words. While the text is generally readable, simplifying key terms and phrases can reduce the cognitive load on the reader.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** For \"universal health coverage\", your parenthetical explanation is good, but you could also simplify it to 'good healthcare for everyone'. For the second phrase, you could be more direct: \"How well these new, combined services work often depends on the healthcare workers who provide the care.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The summary is well-structured and meets most readability targets, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for a PLS. However, it deviates from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. The metrics for 'nouns' (162), 'complex_words_dc' (218), and 'long_words' (181) are all in the P90 range, indicating that while sentence structure is simple, the choice of words is more complex than in a typical PLS. This supports the need to simplify key terms and jargon to improve clarity for a lay audience."
