  "draft": "What are the views and experiences of healthcare workers on bringing different primary healthcare services together (a process called integration)?\n\nKey messages\n– This review did not seek to answer a specific question. Instead, it mapped the existing research on healthcare workers' views and experiences of integrating different health services.\n– We found that the existing research is very diverse. Studies came from many different countries and looked at a wide range of healthcare workers and ways of integrating services, such as mental health, HIV, and mother and child health services.\n– We created a map of the existing research. Other researchers can use this map to group similar studies. This will help them better understand how different approaches to integration affect healthcare workers' experiences and the success of these programmes.\n\nWhat is integrated primary healthcare?\nIn many health systems, different health problems are treated by separate, special services. For example, a person might have to go to one clinic for mental health support and another for HIV care. Integrating health services aims to allow people to get more of the care they need in one place. This approach is seen as a good way to improve health for everyone (an idea known as universal health coverage), especially in countries with limited resources. However, this change depends on the healthcare workers who provide the care. Their experiences and opinions can decide if these new, combined services succeed.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe knew that many studies have looked at healthcare workers' experiences with integrated care. However, these studies are very diverse, looking at different countries, health conditions, and types of workers. We wanted to create a map of all this existing research. Our goal was to understand the range of studies available, what topics have been covered, and where there are gaps in the research. This map can help guide future researchers who want to combine the findings from these studies.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for qualitative studies (studies that explore people's experiences and views) about how healthcare workers view the integration of health services. We then described and mapped these studies to understand the existing research on this topic.\n\nWhat did the review find?\nWe found 184 studies from 37 different high-, middle-, and low-income countries. The studies included a wide range of healthcare workers, from managers to support staff. They looked at different ways of integrating health services, such as combining mental health services with general primary care or linking HIV services with reproductive health services. The main finding is that the research on this topic is very diverse. This review provides a map of the existing research but does not draw conclusions about the effects of integrating services.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies we found were very different from each other. They looked at various types of people and different ways of integrating services. The evidence also focused on many specific groups and services, which makes it difficult to answer broader questions about this topic.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020.",

      "feedback": "This is a well-written and clear summary, but it needs a few revisions to be approved. The most important issue is in the 'Limitations' section, which uses language that is confusing for this type of review. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase the 'Limitations' section to fit a scoping review.**\n   - **Problematic text:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies we found were very different from each other.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Language about 'confidence in the evidence' is used for reviews that measure treatment effects. For a scoping review, which maps existing research, this is misleading. It suggests the review failed, when its goal was to describe the diversity of research, not to produce a single, confident answer.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This review mapped existing research rather than answering a specific question about what works. The main limitation is the diversity of the studies themselves—they looked at different people, services, and countries. This makes it hard to draw broad conclusions from the map, but it helps future researchers by showing them where more focused research is needed.\"\n\n2. **Use more precise language for healthcare workers' influence.**\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Their experiences and opinions can decide if these new, combined services succeed.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The word \"decide\" is too strong and overstates their role. Many factors contribute to a program's success.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Their experiences and opinions can influence whether these new, combined services are successful.\"\n\n3. **Improve accuracy when describing the types of healthcare workers.**\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The studies included a wide range of healthcare workers, from managers to support staff.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The source material is more specific, stating \"policymakers to support staff.\" Your version is a slight oversimplification.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies included a wide range of healthcare workers, from policymakers and managers to frontline staff and support staff.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. 16 of 18 metrics (89%) are in the best quartile for readability and clarity, with excellent scores for sentence length (15 words on average) and active voice. The only minor deviation is a slightly high count of long words (7+ characters), likely due to necessary terms like 'healthcare' and 'integration'. The core issues needing attention are related to content and framing, not sentence-level style."
