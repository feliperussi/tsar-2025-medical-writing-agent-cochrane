  "draft": "What are the views and experiences of healthcare workers on bringing different primary healthcare services together (a process called integration)?\n\nKey messages\n– This review did not answer a specific question. Instead, it created a map of the available research about healthcare workers' views and experiences of bringing different primary healthcare services together.\n– We found that the existing research is very varied. Studies came from many different countries and looked at a wide range of healthcare workers and ways of bringing services together, such as mental health, HIV, and mother and child health services.\n– We created a map of the available research. Other researchers can use this map to group similar studies together. This will help them better understand how different ways of bringing services together affect healthcare workers' experiences and the success of these programmes.\n\nWhy bring primary healthcare services together?\nIn many health systems, different health problems are treated by separate, specialised services. For example, a person might have to go to one clinic for mental health support and another for HIV care. Bringing different health services together aims to allow people to get more of the care they need in one place. This approach is believed to be a good way to improve health for everyone (an idea known as universal health coverage), especially in countries with limited resources. However, making this change work depends heavily on the healthcare workers who deliver the care. Their experiences and opinions can determine whether these new services are successful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe knew that many studies have explored healthcare workers' experiences with bringing services together. However, these studies are very different from each other, looking at various countries, health conditions, and types of workers. We wanted to create a map of all this existing research. Our goal was to understand the range of studies available, what topics have been covered, and where there are gaps in the research. This map can help guide future researchers who want to combine the findings from these studies.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for qualitative studies (studies that explore people's experiences and views) about how healthcare workers view bringing primary healthcare services together. We then described and mapped these studies to understand the existing research on this topic.\n\nWhat did the review find?\nWe found 184 studies from 37 different high-, middle-, and low-income countries. The studies included a wide range of healthcare workers, from policymakers to support staff. They looked at different ways of bringing health services together, such as bringing mental health services into general primary care or linking HIV services with reproductive health services. We found that the studies on this topic were very different from each other. This review provides a map of the available research but does not draw conclusions about how well bringing services together works.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nThis review mapped existing research but did not combine the results of the studies to draw overall conclusions. Therefore, it does not provide answers about how well bringing services together works. We also did not search for unpublished research, so we may have missed some relevant studies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to July 2020.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is NOT_APPROVED due to a critical factual error in the 'Limitations' section, which does not match the provided source material. Additionally, while the summary is well-structured, its clarity can be improved by simplifying some vocabulary and phrasing.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Critical Issue: Correct the 'Limitations' Section**\n*   **Problem:** The current text describes the general limitations of a scoping review but does not reflect the specific limitations from the source document about low confidence in the evidence.\n*   **Original Text:** 'This review mapped existing research but did not combine the results of the studies to draw overall conclusions. Therefore, it does not provide answers about how well bringing services together works. We also did not search for unpublished research, so we may have missed some relevant studies.'\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies included were very different from each other, looking at various types of people and different ways of bringing services together. The evidence also focused on many specific groups and services, which makes it difficult to answer broader questions about this topic.'\n\n**2. Simplify Complex and Long Words**\n*   **Problem:** The summary uses more complex and long words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which can make it harder for some readers to understand. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the number of long words and complex words to be higher than usual.\n*   **Original Text:** 'Instead, it created a map of the available research about healthcare workers' views and experiences of bringing different primary healthcare services together.'\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Instead, this review mapped the existing research on healthcare workers' views and experiences of bringing different health services together.'\n\n**3. Use the Simpler Term 'Integration' More Often**\n*   **Problem:** The long phrase 'bringing different primary healthcare services together' is repeated frequently, making the text feel repetitive. The summary defines 'integration' but could use this simpler term more effectively.\n*   **Original Text:** 'They looked at different ways of bringing health services together, such as bringing mental health services into general primary care...'\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** After defining 'integration' in the title, use the simpler term more often. For example: 'They looked at different ways of integrating health services, such as combining mental health services with general primary care...'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and structure. Key strengths include short sentences (16 words/sentence) and low use of passive voice. However, the analysis identified deviations in vocabulary complexity. The counts for Dale-Chall complex words (217) and long words (192) are in the P90 range, indicating the vocabulary is more challenging than is typical and supporting the recommendation to simplify word choices."
