  "draft": "Combining health services: what do healthcare workers think?\n\nKey messages\n– This review provides an overview of the existing research on healthcare workers' views and experiences of combining different health services.\n– We found that the existing research is very diverse. Studies came from many different countries and looked at a wide range of healthcare workers and ways of combining services, such as mental health, HIV, and mother and child health services.\n– We organized the existing research to show what has been studied. Other researchers can use this overview to group similar studies. This will help them better understand how combining services in different ways affects healthcare workers and whether these programs work well.\n\nWhat is integrated primary healthcare?\nPrimary healthcare is the first type of care a person usually receives, such as from a family doctor or local clinic. In many health systems, different health problems are treated by separate services. For example, a person might have to go to one clinic for mental health support and another for HIV care. Integrating health services means people can get more of the care they need in one place. This approach is seen as a good way to achieve good healthcare for everyone, especially in countries with limited resources. How well these new, combined services work often depends on the healthcare workers who provide the care.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe knew that many studies have looked at healthcare workers' experiences with integrated care. However, these studies are very diverse, looking at different countries, health conditions, and types of workers. We wanted to collect and organize all this existing research. We wanted to understand the range of available studies, see what topics they covered, and find any gaps in the research. This overview can help guide future researchers who want to combine the findings from these studies.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for qualitative studies (studies that explore people's experiences and views) about how healthcare workers view the integration of health services. We then described and organized these studies to understand the existing research on this topic.\n\nWhat did the review find?\nWe found 184 studies from 37 different high-, middle-, and low-income countries. The studies included a wide range of healthcare workers, from policymakers to support staff. They looked at different ways of combining health services, such as integrating mental health services with general primary care or linking HIV services with reproductive health services. The main finding is that the research on this topic is very diverse. This review provides an overview of the existing research but does not draw conclusions about the effects of combining services.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe goal of this review was to map out the existing research, not to measure whether combining services works. Because the studies we found were so different—looking at different people, services, and countries—we cannot draw overall conclusions about their effects. The main purpose of this work is to guide future researchers by showing them which topics need to be studied in more detail.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is well-written and very readable, but it is NOT_APPROVED because of a critical factual error in the 'Limitations' section that misrepresents the review's findings. Here are the most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Rewrite the 'Limitations' section for accuracy.**\n   - **The problem:** The current text describes the *scope* of the review (that it was a mapping exercise, not an effectiveness review), not the *limitations* of the evidence it found. This is misleading. The purpose of this section is to comment on the quality or certainty of the body of evidence that was reviewed.\n   - **Your text:** \"The goal of this review was to map out the existing research, not to measure whether combining services works. Because the studies we found were so different... we cannot draw overall conclusions about their effects.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite (based on source material):** \"We have little confidence in the evidence we found. The studies were done with many different types of people and used different ways of combining services. This makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions that apply broadly.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the review's purpose in the title and key messages.**\n   - **The problem:** The title and first key message could suggest that this review explains *what* healthcare workers think. However, this is a scoping review that *maps the existing research* on that topic. This is a subtle but important distinction.\n   - **Your title:** \"Combining health services: what do healthcare workers think?\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Combining health services: what research is there on healthcare workers' views?\"\n   - **Your key message:** \"This review provides an overview of the existing research on healthcare workers' views and experiences...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This review found and mapped the available research on healthcare workers' views and experiences of combining different health services. It does not present the findings of that research.\"\n\n3. **Use more precise language for a scoping review.**\n   - **The problem:** The draft repeatedly uses the word \"organize\" to describe the review's methods. A more accurate term for a scoping review is \"map.\"\n   - **Your text:** \"We wanted to collect and organize all this existing research.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to create a map of all this existing research.\"\n\nOnce the critical issue in the 'Limitations' section is corrected, this summary will be in excellent shape.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 94% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. Scores for sentence length (16.18 words), passive voice (8 instances), and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (9.0) are excellent. The only minor deviation is a higher-than-average count of long words (7+ characters), which is likely due to necessary terms like 'healthcare' and 'integration' and does not negatively impact the overall high readability scores."
