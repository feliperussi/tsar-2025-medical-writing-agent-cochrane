  "draft": "What are the views and experiences of healthcare workers on bringing different primary healthcare services together (a process called integration)?\n\nKey messages\n– This review did not seek to answer what healthcare workers' views on bringing services together are. Instead, it found and mapped the available research on their views and experiences of bringing different primary healthcare services together (a process called integration).\n– The review found that the existing research is very diverse. Studies were conducted in many different countries and looked at a wide range of healthcare workers and various ways of integrating services, such as mental health, HIV, and mother and child health services.\n– This review provides a map of the available research. Future reviews can use this map to group similar studies together to better understand how different approaches to integration affect healthcare workers' experiences and how well these programmes work.\n\nWhat this review is about\n\nWhat is integrated primary healthcare?\nIn many health systems, different health problems are treated by separate, specialised services. For example, a person might have to go to one clinic for mental health support and another for HIV care. Integrated primary healthcare aims to bring different health services together, so people can get more of the care they need in one place. This approach is believed to be a good way to improve health for everyone (an idea known as universal health coverage), especially in countries with limited resources. However, making this change work depends heavily on the healthcare workers who deliver the care. Their experiences and opinions can decide if these new, combined services work well.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors knew that many studies have explored healthcare workers' experiences with integrated care. However, these studies are very diverse, looking at different countries, health conditions, and types of workers. The authors wanted to create a map of all this existing research. Their goal was to understand the range of studies available and to identify what topics have been covered and where there are gaps in the research. This map can help guide future researchers who want to combine the findings from these studies.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for qualitative studies (studies that explore people's experiences and views) about how healthcare workers view the integration of primary healthcare services. We then described and mapped these studies to understand the existing research on this topic.\n\nWhat did the review find?\nWe found 184 studies from 37 different high-, middle-, and low-income countries. The studies included a wide range of healthcare workers, from policymakers to support staff. They looked at different ways of combining health services, such as integrating mental health into general primary care or linking HIV services with reproductive health services. The main finding is that the research on this topic is very diverse. This review provides a map of the available research but does not draw conclusions about the effects of integrating services.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nThis review mapped existing research but did not combine the results of the studies to draw overall conclusions. Therefore, it does not provide answers about the effects of integrating services. We also did not search for unpublished research, so we may have missed some relevant studies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to July 2020.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that clearly explains the purpose of a scoping review. The structure is good and the key messages are accurate. However, it needs some revisions to improve clarity and fully align with Cochrane style guidelines before it can be approved. The main issues are wordiness in key sections, inconsistent use of 'we' versus 'the authors', and some vocabulary that could be simpler for a lay audience. Addressing these points will make the summary more direct and easier for readers to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make the Key Messages more direct and concise.** The first key message is repetitive and could be simplified to get to the point faster.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"This review did not seek to answer what healthcare workers' views on bringing services together are. Instead, it found and mapped the available research on their views and experiences of bringing different primary healthcare services together (a process called integration).\"\n   - **Reason:** This sentence uses the phrase \"bringing services together\" twice and repeats the definition of integration. It's a bit long and indirect.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Instead of answering a specific question, this review created a map of all the available research about healthcare workers' views and experiences of integrating health services.\"\n\n2. **Use a consistent first-person voice ('we') throughout the text.** The style guide requires using 'we' to refer to the review authors, but the draft sometimes switches to the third person ('the authors').\n   - **Problematic text:** \"What did the review authors want to find out? The authors knew that many studies have explored healthcare workers' experiences with integrated care... The authors wanted to create a map of all this existing research.\"\n   - **Reason:** Switching between 'we' (in the Methods section) and 'the authors' can be confusing for the reader.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"What did we want to find out? We knew that many studies have explored healthcare workers' experiences with integrated care... We wanted to create a map of all this existing research.\"\n\n3. **Simplify noun-heavy phrases and complex words.** Some sentences rely on abstract nouns and complex vocabulary where simpler, more active language would be clearer.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The main finding is that the research on this topic is very diverse.\"\n   - **Reason:** This phrasing is a bit abstract. Using a more direct and active sentence makes the finding easier to grasp.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found that the studies on this topic were very different from each other.\"\n\nFinally, please ensure all subheadings are phrased as questions, as required by the style guide. The subheading \"What this review is about\" should be rephrased (e.g., \"Why was this review done?\").",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with excellent sentence length and use of active voice. However, the analysis identified three metrics that deviate from the typical range, supporting the need for revision. The counts for 'nouns' (P90), 'complex_words_dc' (P90), and 'long_words' (P90) are all higher than usual. This suggests that focusing on simplifying vocabulary and using more direct verb-based phrasing, as outlined in the feedback, will bring the text more in line with best practices for plain language."
