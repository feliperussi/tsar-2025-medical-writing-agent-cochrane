  "draft": "What are the views and experiences of healthcare workers on bringing different primary healthcare services together (a process called integration)?\n\nKey messages\n– Instead of answering a specific question, this review collected and organized the existing research on healthcare workers' views and experiences of integrating different health services.\n– We found that the existing research is very diverse. Studies came from many different countries and looked at a wide range of healthcare workers and ways of integrating services, such as mental health, HIV, and mother and child health services.\n– We organized the existing research to show what has been studied. Other researchers can use this overview to group similar studies. This will help them better understand how combining services in different ways affects healthcare workers and whether these programs work well.\n\nWhat is integrated primary healthcare?\nPrimary healthcare is the first type of care a person usually receives, such as from a family doctor or local clinic. In many health systems, different health problems are treated by separate, special services. For example, a person might have to go to one clinic for mental health support and another for HIV care. Integrating health services means people can get more of the care they need in one place. This approach is seen as a good way to achieve good healthcare for everyone, especially in countries with limited resources. How well these new, combined services work often depends on the healthcare workers who provide the care.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe knew that many studies have looked at healthcare workers' experiences with integrated care. However, these studies are very diverse, looking at different countries, health conditions, and types of workers. We wanted to collect and organize all this existing research. We wanted to understand the range of available studies, see what topics they covered, and find any gaps in the research. This overview can help guide future researchers who want to combine the findings from these studies.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for qualitative studies (studies that explore people's experiences and views) about how healthcare workers view the integration of health services. We then described and organized these studies to understand the existing research on this topic.\n\nWhat did the review find?\nWe found 184 studies from 37 different high-, middle-, and low-income countries. The studies included a wide range of healthcare workers, from policymakers to support staff. They looked at different ways of integrating health services, such as combining mental health services with general primary care or linking HIV services with reproductive health services. The main finding is that the research on this topic is very diverse. This review provides an overview of the existing research but does not draw conclusions about the effects of integrating services.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThis review collected and organized existing research, so it was not designed to provide a single, confident answer about what works. Because the studies we found were so different—looking at different people, services, and countries—we cannot draw overall conclusions from them. The main purpose of this work is to guide future researchers by showing them where more focused research is needed.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured, and it passes all critical checks. The readability scores are very good. I have three main suggestions to make the summary even clearer and more direct for your audience.\n\n1. **Frame the Key Messages more positively.** The first key message starts by explaining what the review *didn't* do, which can be confusing for readers. It's more effective to state the review's purpose directly.\n    - **Original sentence:** \"– Instead of answering a specific question, this review collected and organized the existing research on healthcare workers' views and experiences of integrating different health services.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"– This review provides an overview of the existing research on healthcare workers' views and experiences of combining different health services.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the purpose in the 'Limitations' section.** The current text explains that the review wasn't designed to provide a 'confident answer', which is a bit abstract. It would be clearer to explain the specific goal of this type of 'mapping' review.\n    - **Original sentence:** \"This review collected and organized existing research, so it was not designed to provide a single, confident answer about what works.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The goal of this review was to map out the existing research, not to measure whether integrating services works. Because the studies we found were so different—looking at different people, services, and countries—we cannot draw overall conclusions about their effects.\"\n\n3. **Simplify some vocabulary and phrasing.** The analysis shows the text has more long words and complex terms than is typical for a PLS. Replacing a few key phrases with simpler alternatives would improve readability.\n    - **Original phrase:** \"...bringing different primary healthcare services together (a process called integration)?\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** The parenthetical definition makes the main title, which is the first thing people read, long and a bit clunky.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** Consider shortening the title and moving the definition to the first sentence of the introduction. For example: Title: \"Combining health services: what do healthcare workers think?\" then start the introduction with: \"Integrating health services means bringing different types of care together...\"\n    - **Original phrase:** \"...where more focused research is needed.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...which topics need to be studied in more detail.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of features falling within the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, the draft deviates on vocabulary complexity. The metrics for 'complex_words_dc' (words unfamiliar to a general audience) and 'long_words' are in the P90 range, indicating they are higher than is typical for a PLS. This suggests that while the sentence structure is excellent, the word choice could be simplified to improve overall clarity."
