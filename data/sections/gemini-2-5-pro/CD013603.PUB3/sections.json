    "This review did not seek to answer what healthcare workers' views on bringing services together are. Instead, it found and mapped the available research on their views and experiences of bringing different primary healthcare services together (a process called integration).",
    "The review found that the existing research is very diverse. Studies were conducted in many different countries and looked at a wide range of healthcare workers and various ways of integrating services, such as mental health, HIV, and mother and child health services.",
    "This review provides a map of the available research. Future reviews can use this map to group similar studies together to better understand how different approaches to integration affect healthcare workers' experiences and the success of these programmes."

      "subheading": "What is integrated primary healthcare?",
      "content": "In many health systems, different health problems are treated by separate, specialised services. For example, a person might have to go to one clinic for mental health support and another for HIV care. Integrated primary healthcare aims to bring different health services together, so people can get more of the care they need in one place. This approach is believed to be a good way to improve health for everyone (an idea known as universal health coverage), especially in countries with limited resources. However, making this change work depends heavily on the healthcare workers who deliver the care. Their experiences and opinions can determine whether these new, combined services are successful."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The authors knew that many studies have explored healthcare workers' experiences with integrated care. However, these studies are very diverse, looking at different countries, health conditions, and types of workers. The authors wanted to create a map of all this existing research. Their goal was to understand the range of studies available and to identify what topics have been covered and where there are gaps in the research. This map can help guide future researchers who want to combine the findings from these studies."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for qualitative studies (studies that explore people's experiences and views) about how healthcare workers perceive the integration of primary healthcare services. We then described and mapped these studies to understand the existing research on this topic."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 184 studies from 37 different high-, middle-, and low-income countries. The studies included a wide range of healthcare workers, from policymakers to support staff. They looked at different ways of combining health services, such as integrating mental health into general primary care or linking HIV services with reproductive health services. The main finding is that the research on this topic is very diverse. This review provides a map of the available research but does not draw conclusions about the effects of integrating services."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention. The evidence also focused on many specific populations and interventions, whereas the question we wanted to answer was broader.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to July 2020 of search."
