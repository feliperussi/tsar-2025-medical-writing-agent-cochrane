  "draft": "What are the views and experiences of healthcare workers on bringing different primary healthcare services together (a process called integration)?\n\nKey messages\n– This review did not seek to answer a specific question. Instead, it mapped the existing research on healthcare workers' views and experiences of integrating different health services.\n– We found that the existing research is very diverse. Studies came from many different countries and looked at a wide range of healthcare workers and ways of integrating services, such as mental health, HIV, and mother and child health services.\n– We created a map of the existing research. Other researchers can use this map to group similar studies. This will help them better understand how different approaches to integration affect healthcare workers' experiences and the success of these programmes.\n\nWhat is integrated primary healthcare?\nIn many health systems, different health problems are treated by separate, special services. For example, a person might have to go to one clinic for mental health support and another for HIV care. Integrating health services aims to allow people to get more of the care they need in one place. This approach is seen as a good way to improve health for everyone (an idea known as universal health coverage), especially in countries with limited resources. However, this change depends on the healthcare workers who provide the care. Their experiences and opinions can influence whether these new, combined services are successful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe knew that many studies have looked at healthcare workers' experiences with integrated care. However, these studies are very diverse, looking at different countries, health conditions, and types of workers. We wanted to create a map of all this existing research. Our goal was to understand the range of studies available, what topics have been covered, and where there are gaps in the research. This map can help guide future researchers who want to combine the findings from these studies.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for qualitative studies (studies that explore people's experiences and views) about how healthcare workers view the integration of health services. We then described and mapped these studies to understand the existing research on this topic.\n\nWhat did the review find?\nWe found 184 studies from 37 different high-, middle-, and low-income countries. The studies included a wide range of healthcare workers, from policymakers and managers to frontline staff and support staff. They looked at different ways of integrating health services, such as combining mental health services with general primary care or linking HIV services with reproductive health services. The main finding is that the research on this topic is very diverse. This review provides a map of the existing research but does not draw conclusions about the effects of integrating services.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThis review mapped existing research rather than answering a specific question about what works. The main limitation is the diversity of the studies themselves—they looked at different people, services, and countries. This makes it hard to draw broad conclusions from the map, but it helps future researchers by showing them where more focused research is needed.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-structured and generally very clear, but it requires revision due to a critical factual inaccuracy in the 'Limitations' section. The draft omits the source's key statement about having 'little confidence in the evidence', which significantly changes the meaning. Additionally, several sentences could be simplified to reduce wordiness and replace abstract nouns with more direct verbs, which would improve overall readability for a lay audience.\n\n**Critical Issue:**\n\n1.  **Factual Inaccuracy in Limitations:** The summary of the limitations does not match the source material.\n    *   **Quote:** \"The main limitation is the diversity of the studies themselves—they looked at different people, services, and countries. This makes it hard to draw broad conclusions from the map...\"\n    *   **Problem:** This is factually incomplete. The `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH` explicitly states, \"We have little confidence in the evidence...\". Your version removes this crucial statement of low confidence, which is a critical finding for the reader.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please revise to accurately reflect the source. For example: \"We have little confidence in the evidence from this map. This is because the included studies were very different from each other—they looked at different people, services, and countries. This diversity makes it hard to draw broad conclusions.\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Correct the 'Limitations' section (as above).** This is the most important change required.\n\n2.  **Simplify wordy and abstract phrases.** Some sentences are longer and more complex than they need to be, making them harder to process.\n    *   **Quote:** \"This will help them better understand how different approaches to integration affect healthcare workers' experiences and the success of these programmes.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This phrase is abstract. Using simpler, more direct language would be clearer for the reader.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"This will help them better understand how combining services in different ways affects healthcare workers and whether these programs work well.\"\n\n3.  **Define the term 'primary healthcare'.** The summary explains 'integration' but assumes the reader knows what 'primary healthcare' is.\n    *   **Quote:** \"What is integrated primary healthcare? In many health systems, different health problems are treated by separate, special services.\"\n    *   **Problem:** A lay reader may not know what 'primary healthcare' includes. Adding a simple definition provides important context.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Add a sentence at the beginning of this section. For example: \"Primary healthcare is the first type of care a person usually receives, such as from a family doctor or local clinic. In many health systems...\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 67% of features falling into the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis also flags three metrics in the P90 range, indicating deviation from the norm: 'nouns' (161), 'complex_words_dc' (215), and 'long_words' (178). These results support the editorial feedback to reduce noun-heavy phrases and simplify word choice to enhance clarity for a lay audience."
