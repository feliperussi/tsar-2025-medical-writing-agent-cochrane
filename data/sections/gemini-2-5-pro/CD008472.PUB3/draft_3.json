  "draft": "For people having major blood vessel surgery, does temporarily restricting blood flow to a limb (remote ischaemic preconditioning) before the operation reduce complications?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having major surgery on their blood vessels, the evidence suggests that temporarily restricting blood flow to a limb before the operation (remote ischaemic preconditioning) probably makes little to no difference to the risk of serious complications like death, heart attack, kidney problems, or stroke.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of this procedure and to focus on outcomes that are important to patients.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why is it used in major vascular surgery?\nMajor surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery) carries a significant risk of serious complications and even death. One technique that might help protect the body during these operations is called remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC). This involves temporarily blocking the blood flow to a limb, like an arm or leg, for short periods before the surgery. The theory is that this action helps prepare the body's tissues to better withstand the reduced blood flow that can occur during the main surgical procedure. However, it is not clear if this technique is truly effective or safe for people undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what the benefits and harms of using remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) are for people having major vascular surgery. We compared people who received RIPC with those who did not, to see if it made a difference to outcomes such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, and limb loss after the operation.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared remote ischaemic preconditioning with no preconditioning in people having major vascular surgery. We combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 14 studies with a total of 1295 participants undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery. The participants' age ranged from 64.5 to 76 years, and 84% were male. The studies compared remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) with no RIPC and found that RIPC probably makes little to no difference to death around the time of surgery, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, length of hospital stay, or the duration of the operation. It may make little to no difference to the risk of limb loss.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in our findings. Our confidence is limited because there were few cases of the complications we were interested in, and the studies included different types of people. Also, the studies we found may represent only a small portion of the research on this topic. It is likely that studies with positive results were more likely to be published, which could exaggerate the benefits of the treatment.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",
