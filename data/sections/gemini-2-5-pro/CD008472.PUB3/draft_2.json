  "draft": "For people having major blood vessel surgery, does temporarily restricting blood flow to a limb (remote ischaemic preconditioning) before the operation reduce complications?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having major surgery on their blood vessels, the evidence suggests that temporarily restricting blood flow to a limb before the operation (remote ischaemic preconditioning) probably makes little to no difference to the risk of serious complications like death, heart attack, kidney problems, or stroke.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of this procedure and to focus on outcomes that are important to patients.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why is it used in major vascular surgery?\nMajor surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery) carries a significant risk of serious complications and even death. One technique that might help protect the body during these operations is called remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC). This involves temporarily blocking the blood flow to a limb, like an arm or leg, for short periods before the surgery. The theory is that this action helps prepare the body's tissues to better withstand the reduced blood flow that can occur during the main surgical procedure. However, it is not clear if this technique is truly effective or safe for people undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what the benefits and harms of using remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) are for people having major vascular surgery. We compared people who received RIPC with those who did not, to see if it made a difference to outcomes such as death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, and limb loss after the operation.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared remote ischaemic preconditioning with no preconditioning in people having major vascular surgery. We combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 14 studies with a total of 1295 participants undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery. The participants' age ranged from 64.5 to 76 years, and 84% were male. The studies compared remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) with no RIPC. Compared with no preconditioning, RIPC probably makes little to no difference to death around the time of surgery, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, length of hospital stay, or the duration of the operation. It may make little to no difference to the risk of limb loss.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in our findings. Our confidence is limited because there were few cases of the complications we were interested in, and the studies included different types of people. Also, we may not have found all the studies on this topic. The results of unpublished studies could change our conclusions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

There are also structural and stylistic improvements needed to meet Cochrane standards.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Correct the misleading statement about limitations.** The current wording significantly downplays the risk of publication bias mentioned in the source documents.\n    *   **Problematic text:** 'Also, we may not have found all the studies on this topic. The results of unpublished studies could change our conclusions.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is a weak and generic statement. The source material indicates a more serious concern: that the published studies are 'likely to exaggerate the benefits'. Your version misleads the reader about the certainty of the evidence.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Also, the studies we found may only represent a portion of the research done. It is possible that studies with positive results were more likely to be published, which could make the treatment seem more effective than it really is.'\n\n2. **Add the missing subheading for the Methods section.** The paragraph describing how the review was done is currently missing a heading, which makes the summary harder to navigate.\n    *   **Problematic text:** The paragraph beginning 'We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials...' has no subheading above it.\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Subheadings are required to guide the reader through the summary. The first sentence of the paragraph appears to be a leftover from a heading that was merged into the text.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Add the subheading '**How did we conduct this review?**' above this paragraph and remove the first sentence ('How did we conduct this review?') from the paragraph itself.\n\n3. **Streamline the repetitive phrasing in the Results section.** The comparison between the two groups is stated in two consecutive sentences, which is redundant.\n    *   **Problematic text:** 'The studies compared remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) with no RIPC. Compared with no preconditioning, RIPC probably makes little to no difference to...'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is repetitive and can be made more concise for better readability, as per the style guide.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'The studies compared remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) with no RIPC. They found that RIPC probably makes little to no difference to death around the time of surgery, heart attack, kidney problems...'\n\nWhile the draft's linguistic metrics are excellent, addressing these critical factual and structural issues is essential before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating strong readability with short sentences (18.4 words/sentence), a low grade level (10.9), and good use of active voice. However, these metrics do not capture the critical factual and structural issues identified in the editorial review."
