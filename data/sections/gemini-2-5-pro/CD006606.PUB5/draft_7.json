  "draft": "For women with PCOS and fertility problems, what are the benefits and harms of maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) compared with standard IVF?\n\nKey messages\n- For women with PCOS, we are uncertain if maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) changes the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF.\n- Maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) appears to increase the risk of miscarriage compared to standard IVF, but it greatly reduces the risk of a painful and serious complication from fertility treatment called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n- We need more high-quality research to better understand how maturing eggs in the lab affects the chances of having a baby for women with PCOS.\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome and how can it affect fertility treatment?\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common health problem that can make it difficult for women to become pregnant. Many women with PCOS need fertility treatments like in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In standard IVF, doctors use hormone drugs to help a woman's ovaries produce multiple mature eggs to collect. However, in women with PCOS, these drugs can cause the ovaries to overreact. This can lead to doctors collecting many poor-quality eggs and can increase the risk of a painful and potentially serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat is in vitro maturation?\nIn vitro maturation (IVM) is a different approach to fertility treatment. Instead of using high doses of hormones to mature the eggs inside the body, doctors collect the eggs while they are still immature. Scientists then mature these eggs in a laboratory before fertilising them. IVM aims to avoid the risks of overstimulating the ovaries.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how IVM compares with standard IVF for women with PCOS. We wanted to know about the benefits and harms of each treatment, including their effects on birth rates, miscarriage, and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies (called randomised controlled trials) that compared IVM with standard IVF for women with polycystic ovary syndrome. In these studies, the treatment people receive is chosen at random. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 4 studies that included a total of 810 women with PCOS. The studies compared IVM with standard IVF. We are uncertain if IVM affects the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF for women with PCOS. IVM increases the chance of miscarriage compared to IVF. Out of 100 pregnancies from IVF, about 20 may end in miscarriage. For every 100 pregnancies from IVM, this number is between 20 and 40. IVM greatly reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a painful and potentially serious side effect of fertility treatment, compared to IVF. If 1000 women have IVF, about 35 may get moderate or severe OHSS. If 1000 women have IVM, between 0 and 24 may get it. IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of preterm birth and may make little to no difference to the risk of birth defects (congenital anomalies) compared to IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe reliability of the evidence varies. The evidence for the chance of having a baby is very uncertain because the studies were small and used different methods. However, the evidence is reliable for the increased risk of miscarriage and the reduced risk of OHSS.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and factual accuracy have passed. The readability scores are excellent. I'm marking this as 'NOT_APPROVED' to highlight a few opportunities to further refine the language, making it even more accessible for a lay audience. Addressing the following 3 points will elevate this from a good summary to a great one.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Replace Technical Terms with Simpler Alternatives**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentence:** \"IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of preterm birth and may make little to no difference to the risk of birth defects (congenital anomalies) compared to IVF.\"\n*   **Why it's an issue:** The term \"congenital anomalies\" is clinical jargon. While you've correctly defined it in parentheses, it's better to lead with the simpler term that patients will understand immediately.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of babies being born too early (preterm birth). It may also make little to no difference to the risk of birth defects compared to IVF.\"\n\n**2. Simplify the Explanation of the Methods**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentences:** \"We searched for studies (called randomised controlled trials) that compared IVM with standard IVF for women with polycystic ovary syndrome. In these studies, the treatment people receive is chosen at random. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n*   **Why it's an issue:** This section feels a bit disjointed. The phrase \"rated our confidence in the evidence\" is abstract and uses a nominalization ('confidence'), which can make text less direct.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We searched for studies, called randomised controlled trials, where women with PCOS were randomly chosen to receive either IVM or standard IVF. We then combined the results from these studies and rated how certain we were about the findings.\"\n\n**3. Improve the Flow and Clarity of Key Results**\n\n*   **Problematic Sentences:** \"IVM greatly reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a painful and potentially serious side effect of fertility treatment, compared to IVF. If 1000 women have IVF, about 35 may get moderate or severe OHSS. If 1000 women have IVM, between 0 and 24 may get it.\"\n*   **Why it's an issue:** The first sentence is quite long and packed with information. The phrase \"get it\" at the very end is a little too informal and could be clearer.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"IVM greatly reduces the risk of a painful and serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). For every 1000 women who have IVF, about 35 may develop moderate or severe OHSS. With IVM, that number drops to between 0 and 24 women.\"\n\nBy making these small changes, you will further improve the clarity and readability of an already well-written summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. The sentence length and overall readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.) are excellent. However, the analysis identified 3 features that deviate from typical patterns, supporting the need for minor revisions. The draft has a high number of long words, complex words (Dale-Chall), and nominalizations (noun-form verbs). The suggested edits focus on simplifying vocabulary and using more direct verb phrasing to address these specific deviations."
