  "draft": "For women with PCOS and fertility problems, what are the benefits and harms of maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) compared with standard IVF?\n\nKey messages\n- For women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) having fertility treatment, it is unclear if maturing eggs in the lab (in vitro maturation, or IVM) leads to a different chance of having a baby compared with standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF).\n- Maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) appears to increase the risk of miscarriage compared to standard IVF, but it greatly reduces the risk of a painful and serious complication from fertility treatment called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n- We need more high-quality research to better understand how maturing eggs in the lab affects the chances of having a baby for women with PCOS.\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome and how can it affect fertility treatment?\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common health problem that can make it difficult for women to become pregnant. Many women with PCOS need fertility treatments like in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Standard IVF treatment uses hormone drugs to help the ovaries produce multiple mature eggs that doctors can then collect. However, in women with PCOS, these drugs can cause the ovaries to overreact. This can lead to doctors collecting many poor-quality eggs and can increase the risk of a painful and potentially serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat is in vitro maturation?\nIn vitro maturation (IVM) is a different approach to fertility treatment. Instead of using high doses of hormones to mature the eggs inside the body, doctors collect the eggs while they are still immature. Scientists then mature these eggs in a laboratory before fertilising them. IVM aims to avoid the risks of overstimulating the ovaries.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how IVM compares with standard IVF for women with PCOS. We wanted to know about the benefits and harms of each treatment, including their effects on birth rates, miscarriage, and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials. In these studies, people are randomly put into different treatment groups. We looked for trials that compared in vitro maturation (IVM) with standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 4 studies that included a total of 810 women with PCOS who were having fertility treatment. The studies compared IVM with standard IVF. We are uncertain if IVM affects the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF for women with PCOS. IVM increases the chance of miscarriage compared to IVF. For every 100 women who become pregnant with IVF, about 20 may have a miscarriage. For every 100 women who become pregnant with IVM, between 20 and 40 may have a miscarriage. IVM greatly reduces the risk of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) (a complication from fertility drugs) compared to IVF. For every 1000 women undergoing IVF, about 35 may experience moderate or severe OHSS. For every 1000 women undergoing IVM, between 0 and 24 may experience this complication. IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of preterm birth and may make little to no difference to the risk of congenital anomalies compared to IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies used different methods for IVM, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for completeness and accuracy. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a patient audience before approval. The main issues are an inaccurate summary of the evidence limitations, the use of undefined technical terms, and wordy phrasing that makes some sentences difficult to follow. The feedback below outlines the top 3 improvements needed.\n\n1. **Clarify and correct the 'Limitations' section.**\nThe current text oversimplifies the findings and could mislead readers.\n- **Problematic text:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is not entirely accurate. The review found *high-certainty* evidence for the outcomes of miscarriage and OHSS, but *very low-certainty* evidence for live birth. Stating there is \"little confidence\" in all the evidence is incorrect and diminishes the strength of the key findings.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence varies. For the chance of having a baby, the evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and used different methods. However, we have high confidence in the findings about the increased risk of miscarriage and the reduced risk of OHSS.\"\n\n2. **Define technical medical terms.**\nReaders may not understand important medical terms used in the summary.\n- **Problematic text:** \"...and may make little to no difference to the risk of congenital anomalies compared to IVF.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** 'Congenital anomalies' is medical jargon. A plain language summary must explain such terms so all readers can understand the potential risks.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"...and may make little to no difference to the risk of congenital anomalies (birth defects) compared to IVF.\"\n\n3. **Use more direct language and active verbs.**\nSome sentences are wordy and use noun forms instead of direct verbs, which can make them harder to read.\n- **Problematic text:** \"Standard IVF treatment uses hormone drugs to help the ovaries produce multiple mature eggs that doctors can then collect.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is indirect. Using more direct verbs makes the information clearer and more concise, which is supported by the linguistic analysis showing an unusually high number of 'nominalizations' (noun-form verbs).\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"In standard IVF, doctors use hormone drugs to help a woman's ovaries produce multiple mature eggs for collection.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable in terms of sentence length and structure, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile for typical PLS patterns. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. The use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is exceptionally high (Beyond P90), and the text has a high number of long words (P90) and words uncommon in everyday language (Dale-Chall complex words, P90). These metrics support the editorial feedback to simplify vocabulary and use more direct, active verbs to improve clarity."
