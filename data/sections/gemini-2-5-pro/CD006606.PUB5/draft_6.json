  "draft": "For women with PCOS and fertility problems, what are the benefits and harms of maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) compared with standard IVF?\n\nKey messages\n- For women with PCOS, we are uncertain if maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) changes the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF.\n- Maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) appears to increase the risk of miscarriage compared to standard IVF, but it greatly reduces the risk of a painful and serious complication from fertility treatment called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n- We need more high-quality research to better understand how maturing eggs in the lab affects the chances of having a baby for women with PCOS.\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome and how can it affect fertility treatment?\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common health problem that can make it difficult for women to become pregnant. Many women with PCOS need fertility treatments like in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In standard IVF, doctors use hormone drugs to help a woman's ovaries produce multiple mature eggs for collection. However, in women with PCOS, these drugs can cause the ovaries to overreact. This can lead to doctors collecting many poor-quality eggs and can increase the risk of a painful and potentially serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat is in vitro maturation?\nIn vitro maturation (IVM) is a different approach to fertility treatment. Instead of using high doses of hormones to mature the eggs inside the body, doctors collect the eggs while they are still immature. Scientists then mature these eggs in a laboratory before fertilising them. IVM aims to avoid the risks of overstimulating the ovaries.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how IVM compares with standard IVF for women with PCOS. We wanted to know about the benefits and harms of each treatment, including their effects on birth rates, miscarriage, and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where people are randomly put into different treatment groups. We looked for trials that compared in vitro maturation (IVM) with standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome. We then combined the results and rated how reliable the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 4 studies that included a total of 810 women with PCOS. The studies compared IVM with standard IVF. We are uncertain if IVM affects the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF for women with PCOS. IVM increases the chance of miscarriage compared to IVF. If 100 women become pregnant with IVF, about 20 may have a miscarriage. If 100 women become pregnant with IVM, between 20 and 40 may have a miscarriage. IVM greatly reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a painful and potentially serious side effect of fertility treatment, compared to IVF. If 1000 women have IVF, about 35 may get moderate or severe OHSS. If 1000 women have IVM, between 0 and 24 may get it. IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of preterm birth and may make little to no difference to the risk of birth defects (congenital anomalies) compared to IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe reliability of the evidence varies. The evidence for the chance of having a baby is very uncertain because the studies were small and used different methods. However, the evidence is reliable for the increased risk of miscarriage and the reduced risk of OHSS.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

The following suggestions are aimed at making the text even more direct and easier for readers to follow before final approval.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Replace noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs.**\nSome sentences can be made more active and easier to read by using verbs instead of their noun forms (a style issue known as 'nominalization').\n- **Original sentence:** \"In standard IVF, doctors use hormone drugs to help a woman's ovaries produce multiple mature eggs for **collection**.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The word 'collection' is a noun. Using the verb 'collect' is more direct and active, which is easier for readers to process.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"...to help a woman's ovaries produce multiple mature eggs **to collect**.\"\n\n**2. Simplify the description of the review methods.**\nThe methods section is slightly repetitive and could be streamlined for better flow.\n- **Original text:** \"We searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where people are randomly put into different treatment groups. We looked for trials that compared in vitro maturation (IVM) with standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"We looked for trials...\" repeats the action of searching from the first sentence. The explanation of randomisation can also be made more concise.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for studies (called randomised controlled trials) that compared IVM with standard IVF for women with polycystic ovary syndrome. In these studies, the treatment people receive is chosen at random. We then combined the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n**3. Clarify the presentation of statistics for miscarriage.**\nThe current phrasing is accurate but could be made clearer to ensure readers easily grasp the comparison.\n- **Original text:** \"If 100 women become pregnant with IVF, about 20 may have a miscarriage. If 100 women become pregnant with IVM, between 20 and 40 may have a miscarriage.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The repeated \"If 100 women become pregnant...\" structure is a bit clunky. A more direct comparison can help readers see the difference more clearly.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Out of 100 pregnancies from IVF, about 20 may end in miscarriage. For every 100 pregnancies from IVM, this number is between 20 and 40.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis. The evaluation noted that the draft deviates from typical PLS patterns with a high number of **nominalizations** (26 instances), **complex words** (237), and **long words** (170). Adopting the suggested changes will help address these underlying metric issues and improve overall readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of its linguistic features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates from typical patterns in three areas: use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), complex words from the Dale-Chall list, and long words (7+ characters). These metrics suggest the text could be made more direct and easier to understand by using more active verbs and simpler, shorter words."
