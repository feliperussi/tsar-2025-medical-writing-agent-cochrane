  "draft": "For women with PCOS and fertility problems, what are the benefits and harms of maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) compared with standard IVF?\n\nKey messages\n- For women with PCOS, we are uncertain if maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) changes the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF.\n- Maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) appears to increase the risk of miscarriage compared to standard IVF, but it greatly reduces the risk of a painful and serious complication from fertility treatment called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n- We need more high-quality research to better understand how maturing eggs in the lab affects the chances of having a baby for women with PCOS.\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome and how can it affect fertility treatment?\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common health problem that can make it difficult for women to become pregnant. Many women with PCOS need fertility treatments like in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In standard IVF, doctors use hormone drugs to help a woman's ovaries produce multiple mature eggs for collection. However, in women with PCOS, these drugs can cause the ovaries to overreact. This can lead to doctors collecting many poor-quality eggs and can increase the risk of a painful and potentially serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat is in vitro maturation?\nIn vitro maturation (IVM) is a different approach to fertility treatment. Instead of using high doses of hormones to mature the eggs inside the body, doctors collect the eggs while they are still immature. Scientists then mature these eggs in a laboratory before fertilising them. IVM aims to avoid the risks of overstimulating the ovaries.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how IVM compares with standard IVF for women with PCOS. We wanted to know about the benefits and harms of each treatment, including their effects on birth rates, miscarriage, and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where people are randomly put into different treatment groups. We looked for trials that compared in vitro maturation (IVM) with standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome. We then combined the results and used a standard method to judge how reliable the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 4 studies that included a total of 810 women with PCOS who were having fertility treatment. The studies compared IVM with standard IVF. We are uncertain if IVM affects the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF for women with PCOS. IVM increases the chance of miscarriage compared to IVF. If 100 women become pregnant with IVF, about 20 may have a miscarriage. If 100 women become pregnant with IVM, between 20 and 40 may have a miscarriage. IVM greatly reduces the risk of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) (a complication from fertility drugs) compared to IVF. If 1000 women have IVF, about 35 may get moderate or severe OHSS. If 1000 women have IVM, between 0 and 24 may get it. IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of preterm birth and may make little to no difference to the risk of congenital anomalies (birth defects) compared to IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. For the chance of having a baby, the evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and used different methods. However, we have high confidence in the findings about the increased risk of miscarriage and the reduced risk of OHSS.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

To make it even clearer for patients, I recommend focusing on three areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** The text often uses nouns where verbs would be more direct. This is supported by a high 'nominalization' score, which is outside the typical range for a Plain Language Summary.\n    *   **Instead of:** '...produce multiple mature eggs for collection.'\n    *   **Consider:** '...produce multiple mature eggs that doctors can then collect.'\n    *   **Instead of:** 'We then combined the results and used a standard method to judge how reliable the evidence was.'\n    *   **Consider:** 'We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n\n2. **Place plain language terms before technical ones.** When introducing a technical term, it's best to lead with the everyday language equivalent.\n    *   **Instead of:** '...may make little to no difference to the risk of congenital anomalies (birth defects)...'\n    *   **Consider:** '...may make little to no difference to the risk of birth defects (congenital anomalies)...'\n\n3. **Refine phrasing for better flow.** Some sentences can be made more concise and active.\n    *   **Instead of:** 'Our confidence in the evidence varies.'\n    *   **Consider:** 'We have more confidence in some findings than others.'\n\nMaking these changes will make an already good summary even more direct and accessible for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 83.3% of metrics in the best quartile for readability and structure. However, it shows significant deviation in three areas: nominalization (BEYOND_P90), and both Dale-Chall complex words and long words (P90 range). This suggests that while the text is generally readable, it could be improved by using more direct verbs and simplifying some vocabulary."
