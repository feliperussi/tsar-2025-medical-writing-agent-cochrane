  "draft": "For women with PCOS and fertility problems, what are the benefits and harms of maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) compared with standard IVF?\n\nKey messages\n- For women with PCOS, we are uncertain if maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) changes the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF.\n- Maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) appears to increase the risk of miscarriage compared to standard IVF, but it greatly reduces the risk of a painful and serious complication from fertility treatment called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n- We need more high-quality research to better understand how maturing eggs in the lab affects the chances of having a baby for women with PCOS.\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome and how can it affect fertility treatment?\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common health problem that can make it difficult for women to become pregnant. Many women with PCOS need fertility treatments like in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In standard IVF, doctors use hormone drugs to help a woman's ovaries produce multiple mature eggs that doctors can then collect. However, in women with PCOS, these drugs can cause the ovaries to overreact. This can lead to doctors collecting many poor-quality eggs and can increase the risk of a painful and potentially serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat is in vitro maturation?\nIn vitro maturation (IVM) is a different approach to fertility treatment. Instead of using high doses of hormones to mature the eggs inside the body, doctors collect the eggs while they are still immature. Scientists then mature these eggs in a laboratory before fertilising them. IVM aims to avoid the risks of overstimulating the ovaries.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how IVM compares with standard IVF for women with PCOS. We wanted to know about the benefits and harms of each treatment, including their effects on birth rates, miscarriage, and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where people are randomly put into different treatment groups. We looked for trials that compared in vitro maturation (IVM) with standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 4 studies that included a total of 810 women with PCOS who were having fertility treatment. The studies compared IVM with standard IVF. We are uncertain if IVM affects the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF for women with PCOS. IVM increases the chance of miscarriage compared to IVF. If 100 women become pregnant with IVF, about 20 may have a miscarriage. If 100 women become pregnant with IVM, between 20 and 40 may have a miscarriage. IVM greatly reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a painful and potentially serious side effect of fertility treatment, compared to IVF. If 1000 women have IVF, about 35 may get moderate or severe OHSS. If 1000 women have IVM, between 0 and 24 may get it. IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of preterm birth and may make little to no difference to the risk of birth defects (congenital anomalies) compared to IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have more confidence in some findings than others. For the chance of having a baby, the evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and used different methods. However, we have high confidence in the findings about the increased risk of miscarriage and the reduced risk of OHSS.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

My top 3 recommendations focus on simplifying technical language and reducing wordiness, which will help address the high number of complex words and nominalizations identified in the analysis.\n\n1. **Replace technical jargon with simpler terms.** Phrases common in research can be confusing for a lay audience.\n    *   **Problem:** '...rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n    *   **Reason:** 'Confidence in the evidence' is a technical term. A simpler phrase would be more meaningful to patients.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Replace it with '...rated how reliable the evidence was.'\n\n2. **Make sentences more direct by using stronger verbs.** Some sentences are a bit wordy and could be more concise. This is reflected in the high `nominalization` score.\n    *   **Problem:** 'In standard IVF, doctors use hormone drugs to help a woman's ovaries produce multiple mature eggs that doctors can then collect.'\n    *   **Reason:** This sentence is slightly long and the repetition of 'doctors' makes it clunky.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite as 'In standard IVF, doctors use hormone drugs to help a woman's ovaries produce multiple mature eggs for collection.'\n\n3. **Remove redundant information to improve clarity.** Adding unnecessary words can make sentences harder to process.\n    *   **Problem:** 'We found 4 studies that included a total of 810 women with PCOS who were having fertility treatment.'\n    *   **Reason:** The context of the entire summary is fertility treatment, so this final phrase is redundant.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Simply write: 'We found 4 studies that included a total of 810 women with PCOS.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of its features falling into the best quartile for readability and structure. However, the analysis flags three metrics in the P90 range, indicating significant deviation from the norm: `nominalization` (27 instances), `complex_words_dc` (239 words), and `long_words` (173 words). This suggests that while the summary is generally readable, it could be improved by using more direct verbs instead of noun forms and replacing some longer, more complex words with simpler alternatives."
