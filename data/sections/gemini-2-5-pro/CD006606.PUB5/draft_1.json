  "draft": "For women with PCOS and fertility problems, what are the benefits and harms of maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) compared with standard IVF?\n\nKey messages\n- For women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) having fertility treatment, it is unclear if maturing eggs in the lab (in vitro maturation, or IVM) leads to a different chance of having a baby compared with standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF).\n- Maturing eggs in the output appears to increase the risk of miscarriage compared to standard IVF, but it greatly reduces the risk of a painful and serious complication from fertility treatment called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n- More high-quality research is needed to better understand the true effect of maturing eggs in the lab on the chances of having a baby for women with PCOS.\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome and how can it affect fertility treatment?\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common health problem that can make it difficult for women to become pregnant. Many women with PCOS need fertility treatments like in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Standard IVF treatment uses hormone drugs to help the ovaries produce multiple mature eggs for collection. However, in women with PCOS, these drugs can cause the ovaries to overreact. This can lead to the collection of many poor-quality eggs and increase the risk of a painful and potentially serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat is in vitro maturation?\nIn vitro maturation (IVM) is a different approach to fertility treatment. Instead of using high doses of hormones to mature the eggs inside the body, doctors collect the eggs while they are still immature. These eggs are then matured in a laboratory before being fertilised. The goal of IVM is to avoid the risks associated with overstimulating the ovaries.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how IVM compares with standard IVF for women with PCOS. We wanted to know about the benefits and harms of each treatment, including their effects on birth rates, miscarriage, and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly put into different treatment groups) that compared in vitro maturation (IVM) with standard in vitro fertilization (IVF) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included four studies involving a total of 810 subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome undergoing assisted reproductive technology. The studies compared in vitro maturation (IVM) before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with conventional IVF or ICSI. For subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, the review found that we do not know if in vitro maturation (IVM) affects the chances of a live birth or a clinical pregnancy when compared to standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF). IVM increases the chance of miscarriage compared to IVF. For every 100 women who become pregnant with IVF, about 20 may have a miscarriage. For every 100 women who become pregnant with IVM, between 20 and 40 may have a miscarriage. IVM causes a large reduction in the risk of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) (a complication from fertility drugs) compared to IVF. For every 1000 women undergoing IVF, about 35 may experience moderate or severe OHSS. For every 1000 women undergoing IVM, between 0 and 24 may experience this complication. IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of preterm birth and may make little to no difference to the risk of congenital anomalies compared to IVF.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for our main outcomes.\n\nEvidence currency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs several improvements to meet Cochrane standards for clarity and style before it can be approved. There are three critical issues: 1) several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is required by the style guide; 2) a key message contains a confusing phrase that makes it unclear; and 3) the writing style relies heavily on complex nouns and passive voice, making it difficult for a lay audience to read. \n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rewrite subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. This is a critical formatting requirement.\n   - **Problematic subheadings:** \"Methods\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Evidence currency\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"What did we do?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n2. **Clarify the confusing phrase in the key messages.** One of the key takeaways is confusing because of a likely typo.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Maturing eggs in the output appears to increase the risk of miscarriage compared to standard IVF...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"in the output\" is jargon-like and unclear. It seems to be a typo for \"in the lab\" or could be rephrased to refer the treatment itself.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) appears to increase the risk of miscarriage compared to standard IVF...\"\n\n3. **Use verbs instead of complex nouns (nominalizations).** The text frequently uses noun forms of verbs, which makes sentences more abstract and harder to read. This is reflected in the very high 'nominalization' score.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"This can lead to the collection of many poor-quality eggs...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"collection of\" is less direct than the verb \"collecting\".\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This can lead to doctors collecting many poor-quality eggs...\"\n   - **Another example:** \"IVM causes a large reduction in the risk of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"IVM greatly reduces the risk of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)...\"\n\n4. **Change passive voice to active voice.** Many sentences use the passive voice, which can make it unclear who is performing the action. The style guide requires active voice.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"These eggs are then matured in a laboratory before being fertilised.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** It's unclear who matures and fertilises the eggs. Active voice is more direct.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Scientists then mature these eggs in a laboratory before fertilising them.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics like sentence length are within the median range (P50), there are significant deviations in key areas that impact readability. The text scores in the worst 10% of the corpus for 'nominalization' (BEYOND_P90), indicating a heavy reliance on abstract nouns instead of active verbs. Additionally, metrics for 'passive_voice', 'complex_words', 'long_words', and the 'smog_index' are all in the P90 range, confirming that the text is more passive and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. These deviations support the editorial feedback to simplify sentence structure and vocabulary."
