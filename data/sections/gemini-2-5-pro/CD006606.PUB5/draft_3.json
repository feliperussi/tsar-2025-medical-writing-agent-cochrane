  "draft": "For women with PCOS and fertility problems, what are the benefits and harms of maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) compared with standard IVF?\n\nKey messages\n- For women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) having fertility treatment, it is unclear if maturing eggs in the lab (in vitro maturation, or IVM) leads to a different chance of having a baby compared with standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF).\n- Maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) appears to increase the risk of miscarriage compared to standard IVF, but it greatly reduces the risk of a painful and serious complication from fertility treatment called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n- We need more high-quality research to better understand how maturing eggs in the lab affects the chances of having a baby for women with PCOS.\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome and how can it affect fertility treatment?\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common health problem that can make it difficult for women to become pregnant. Many women with PCOS need fertility treatments like in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In standard IVF, doctors use hormone drugs to help a woman's ovaries produce multiple mature eggs for collection. However, in women with PCOS, these drugs can cause the ovaries to overreact. This can lead to doctors collecting many poor-quality eggs and can increase the risk of a painful and potentially serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat is in vitro maturation?\nIn vitro maturation (IVM) is a different approach to fertility treatment. Instead of using high doses of hormones to mature the eggs inside the body, doctors collect the eggs while they are still immature. Scientists then mature these eggs in a laboratory before fertilising them. IVM aims to avoid the risks of overstimulating the ovaries.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how IVM compares with standard IVF for women with PCOS. We wanted to know about the benefits and harms of each treatment, including their effects on birth rates, miscarriage, and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where people are randomly put into different treatment groups. We looked for trials that compared in vitro maturation (IVM) with standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 4 studies that included a total of 810 women with PCOS who were having fertility treatment. The studies compared IVM with standard IVF. We are uncertain if IVM affects the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF for women with PCOS. IVM increases the chance of miscarriage compared to IVF. For every 100 women who become pregnant with IVF, about 20 may have a miscarriage. For every 100 women who become pregnant with IVM, between 20 and 40 may have a miscarriage. IVM greatly reduces the risk of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) (a complication from fertility drugs) compared to IVF. For every 1000 women undergoing IVF, about 35 may experience moderate or severe OHSS. For every 1000 women undergoing IVM, between 0 and 24 may experience this complication. IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of preterm birth and may make little to no difference to the risk of congenital anomalies (birth defects) compared to IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. For the chance of having a baby, the evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and used different methods. However, we have high confidence in the findings about the increased risk of miscarriage and the reduced risk of OHSS.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It's well-structured, factually accurate, and the core readability scores are very good. To make it even clearer for patients, I recommend focusing on three key areas before approval:\n\n1. **Make the key statistics easier to grasp.** The current phrasing is a bit academic and uses indirect language. The linguistic analysis confirms this, flagging an unusually high number of 'nominalizations' (noun-form verbs).\n\n   - **Current text:** \"For every 1000 women undergoing IVF, about 35 may experience moderate or severe OHSS. For every 1000 women undergoing IVM, between 0 and 24 may experience this complication.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"undergoing IVF\" and \"experience this complication\" are indirect. A simpler, more active structure using \"if/then\" is easier for readers to process.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"If 1000 women have IVF, about 35 may get moderate or severe OHSS. If 1000 women have IVM, between 0 and 24 may get it.\"\n   - **Action:** Please apply this simpler structure to the miscarriage statistics as well.\n\n2. **Simplify the first two key messages.** These sentences are quite long and combine several ideas, which can be overwhelming at the very start of the summary.\n\n   - **Current text:** \"For women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) having fertility treatment, it is unclear if maturing eggs in the lab (in vitro maturation, or IVM) leads to a different chance of having a baby compared with standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF).\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is 36 words long and packed with information. Shorter, more direct messages are more effective for setting the scene.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"For women with PCOS, we are uncertain if maturing eggs in the lab (IVM) changes the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF.\"\n\n3. **Replace procedural jargon with plain language.** The summary does a great job defining clinical terms like OHSS, but some of the research-process terms could be simpler.\n\n   - **Current text:** \"We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Rated our confidence in the evidence\" is specific to review methodology and may not be clear to a lay reader. It's better to describe what was done in simpler terms.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We then combined the results and used a standard method to judge how reliable the evidence was.\"\n\nThese changes will help address the high number of nominalizations (35) and complex words (116) identified in the evaluation, bringing the summary more in line with plain language best practices.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns in many areas, with 72% of features in the best quartile for readability (e.g., sentence length, Flesch-Kincaid grade). However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence structure. Key metrics like nominalization (noun-form verbs) are beyond the 90th percentile, and several complexity scores (SMOG index, complex words, long words) are also in the 90th percentile range. This suggests that while the text is generally readable, it contains pockets of overly technical or academic language that should be simplified."
