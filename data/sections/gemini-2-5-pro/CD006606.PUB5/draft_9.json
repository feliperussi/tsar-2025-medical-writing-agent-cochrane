  "draft": "For women with PCOS and fertility problems, what are the benefits and harms of maturing eggs in the lab compared with standard IVF?\n\nKey messages\n- For women with PCOS, we are uncertain if maturing eggs in the lab changes the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF.\n- Maturing eggs in the lab appears to increase the risk of miscarriage compared to standard IVF, but it greatly reduces the risk of a painful and serious complication from fertility treatment called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n- We need more high-quality research to better understand how maturing eggs in the lab affects the chances of having a baby for women with PCOS.\n\nWhat is polycystic ovarian syndrome and how can it affect fertility treatment?\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common health problem that can make it difficult for women to become pregnant. Many women with PCOS need fertility treatments like in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In standard IVF, doctors use hormone drugs to help a woman's ovaries produce multiple mature eggs to collect. However, in women with PCOS, these drugs can cause the ovaries to overreact. This can lead to doctors collecting many poor-quality eggs and can increase the risk of a painful and potentially serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat is in vitro maturation?\nIn vitro maturation (IVM) is a different approach to fertility treatment. Instead of using high doses of hormones to mature the eggs inside the body, doctors collect the eggs while they are still immature. Scientists then mature these eggs in a laboratory before fertilising them. IVM aims to avoid the risks of overstimulating the ovaries.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how IVM compares with standard IVF for women with PCOS. We wanted to know about the benefits and harms of each treatment, including their effects on birth rates, miscarriage, and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that randomly assigned women with PCOS to receive either IVM or standard IVF. These types of studies, called randomised controlled trials, provide the most reliable evidence. We then combined the results from these studies and rated how certain we were about the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 4 studies that included a total of 810 women with PCOS. The studies compared IVM with standard IVF. We are uncertain if IVM affects the chance of having a baby compared to standard IVF for women with PCOS. IVM increases the chance of miscarriage compared to IVF. For every 1000 pregnancies using IVF, about 200 may end in miscarriage. For pregnancies using IVM, this number is between 200 and 400. IVM greatly reduces the risk of a painful and serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). For every 1000 women who have IVF, about 35 may develop moderate or severe OHSS. With IVM, that number drops to between 0 and 24 women. IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of babies being born too early (preterm birth). It may also make little to no difference to the risk of birth defects compared to IVF.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe reliability of the evidence varies. The evidence for the chance of having a baby is very uncertain because the studies were small and used different methods. However, the evidence is reliable for the increased risk of miscarriage and the reduced risk of OHSS.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and meets all critical checks for length and structure. However, a few improvements will make it even clearer and more direct for readers. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Make the language about miscarriage risk consistent.**\n   - **The issue:** In your Key Messages, you write: '- Maturing eggs in the lab appears to increase the risk of miscarriage...'. But in the Results, you state: 'IVM increases the chance of miscarriage...'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase 'appears to increase' sounds uncertain, but the evidence for this finding is high-certainty. This inconsistency could confuse readers about how strong the evidence is.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Make the Key Message more definitive to match the high-certainty evidence. For example: '- Maturing eggs in the lab increases the risk of miscarriage compared to standard IVF...'\n\n2. **Make the limitations section more direct and less abstract.**\n   - **The issue:** The first sentence of the limitations section is: 'The reliability of the evidence varies.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is abstract and doesn't clearly explain the issue to the reader. This is reflected in the high 'nominalization' score (P90), which indicates sentences are built around nouns ('reliability') instead of active verbs.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Rephrase this to be more direct and personal, explaining *why* the evidence is limited. For example: 'How reliable is the evidence? We are less certain about the evidence for the chance of having a baby. This is because the studies were small and used different methods.'\n\n3. **Vary the phrasing for 'little to no difference' to improve flow.**\n   - **The issue:** The results section says: 'IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of babies being born too early (preterm birth). It may also make little to no difference to the risk of birth defects compared to IVF.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Repeating the phrase 'makes little to no difference' is technically correct but can be clunky for readers. Varying the sentence structure improves readability.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Try rephrasing the second sentence for better flow. For example: 'The risk of babies being born too early (preterm birth) is probably about the same with either IVM or IVF. The risk of birth defects may also be similar for both treatments.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with  M 88.9% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. The text is well under the word count limit and scores excellently on readability indices like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (8.65). Two metrics show minor deviation: 'nominalization' (P90) and 'complex_words_dc' (P90), suggesting some sentences could be more direct and some vocabulary could be simplified. These metrics support the editorial suggestions to rephrase abstract sentences and improve sentence flow."
