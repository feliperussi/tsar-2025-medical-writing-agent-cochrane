  "key_messages": [
    "For women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) having fertility treatment, it is unclear if maturing eggs in the lab (in vitro maturation, or IVM) leads to a different chance of having a baby compared with standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF).",
    "Maturing eggs in the output appears to increase the risk of miscarriage compared to standard IVF, but it greatly reduces the risk of a painful and serious complication from fertility treatment called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).",
    "More high-quality research is needed to better understand the true effect of maturing eggs in the lab on the chances of having a baby for women with PCOS."

      "subheading": "What is polycystic ovarian syndrome and how can it affect fertility treatment?",
      "content": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common health problem that can make it difficult for women to become pregnant. Many women with PCOS need fertility treatments like in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Standard IVF treatment uses hormone drugs to help the ovaries produce multiple mature eggs for collection. However, in women with PCOS, these drugs can cause the ovaries to overreact. This can lead to the collection of many poor-quality eggs and increase the risk of a painful and potentially serious side effect called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)."

      "subheading": "What is in vitro maturation?",
      "content": "In vitro maturation (IVM) is a different approach to fertility treatment. Instead of using high doses of hormones to mature the eggs inside the body, doctors collect the eggs while they are still immature. These eggs are then matured in a laboratory before being fertilised. The goal of IVM is to avoid the risks associated with overstimulating the ovaries."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review included four studies involving a total of 810 subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome undergoing assisted reproductive technology. The studies compared in vitro maturation (IVM) before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with conventional IVF or ICSI. For subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, the review found that we do not know if in vitro maturation (IVM) affects the chances of a live birth or a clinical pregnancy when compared to standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF). IVM increases the chance of miscarriage compared to IVF. For every 100 women who become pregnant with IVF, about 20 may have a miscarriage. For every 100 women who become pregnant with IVM, between 20 and 40 may have a miscarriage. IVM causes a large reduction in the risk of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) (a complication from fertility drugs) compared to IVF. For every 1000 women undergoing IVF, about 35 may experience moderate or severe OHSS. For every 1000 women undergoing IVM, between 0 and 24 may experience this complication. IVM probably makes little to no difference to the risk of preterm birth and may make little to no difference to the risk of congenital anomalies compared to IVF."
