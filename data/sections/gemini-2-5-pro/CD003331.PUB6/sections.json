  "key_messages": [
    "For adults with heart failure (a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should), exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education) likely reduces hospital admissions and may improve their quality of life. There was no evidence of a difference in the number of deaths up to one year of follow-up. The studies did not provide clear information about potential harmful effects.",
    "The benefits of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation appear to be similar whether the program is delivered in a hospital, at home, or with digital support.",
    "Future research should include more older people, women, and people with a specific type of heart failure where the heart muscle becomes stiff (known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), as these groups have not been well-studied."

      "content": "Heart failure is a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood around the body as well as it should. This can make people feel breathless and tired, reduce their ability to exercise, and negatively affect their overall well-being (known as 'health-related quality of life'). People with heart failure are also more likely to be admitted to the hospital. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a program of exercise and education and designed to help people with heart conditions improve their health."

      "content": "The authors of this Cochrane Review wanted to find out about the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure. They looked at its impact on the risk of death, the number of hospital admissions, and people's health-related quality of life."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 60 trials with a total of 8728 adult participants with heart failure. The studies had a median follow-up of six months. The participants were predominantly people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II and III. The review noted that women, older people, and those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) were under-represented. Most studies were conducted in a hospital or centre-based setting, although a growing number were home-based. The studies compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation against a no-exercise control group, which typically received usual medical care."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart failure",
      "content": "For adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of being admitted to hospital for any reason within one year. Out of 100 people who do not have rehabilitation, about 24 are admitted to the hospital, compared to probably only about 16 of 100 people who do have rehabilitation. Rehabilitation also probably results in important improvements in quality of life. However, it may make little to no difference to the risk of dying from any cause within one year."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because the evidence does not cover all of the people we were interested in, and it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021 of search."
