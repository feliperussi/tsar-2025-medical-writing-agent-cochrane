  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education) for adults with heart failure?\n\nKey messages\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces hospital admissions and may improve their quality of life. We found no difference in the number of deaths up to 1 year of follow-up. The studies did not provide clear information about potential harmful effects.\n\nThe benefits of this rehabilitation appear to be similar whether the program is in a hospital, at home, or uses digital support.\n\nFuture research should include more older people, women, and people with a specific type of heart failure where the heart muscle becomes stiff (known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), as these groups have not been well-studied.\n\nWhat is heart failure and how can exercise help?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood around the body as well as it should. This can cause breathlessness and tiredness, reduce a person's ability to exercise, and lower their overall well-being (health-related quality of life). People with heart failure are also more likely to be admitted to the hospital. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a program of exercise and education designed to help people with heart conditions improve their health.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure. We looked at how it affected the risk of death, hospital admissions, and people's health-related quality of life.\n\nHow did we conduct our search?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials, where researchers put people into treatment groups by chance. These studies compared exercise programs with usual care for adults with heart failure. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 60 trials that included a total of 8728 adults with heart failure. The studies followed people for 6 months, on average. Most participants had a type of heart failure where the heart muscle doesn't contract effectively (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction). Their symptoms were mostly mild to moderate. We noted that the studies included too few women, older people, and people with a type of heart failure where the heart muscle is stiff (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction). Most studies took place in a hospital, but a growing number were based at home. The studies compared cardiac rehabilitation against usual medical care without a formal exercise program.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of being admitted to the hospital for any reason within 1 year. For every 100 people who receive usual care, about 24 are admitted to the hospital, compared to probably only 16 who receive cardiac rehabilitation. Rehabilitation also probably improves quality of life in an important way. However, it may make little to no difference to the risk of dying from any cause within 1 year.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies did not include enough women, older people, or people with a specific type of heart failure, so the results may not apply to everyone. Second, in many studies, people knew whether they were getting the exercise program or usual care. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their quality of life, potentially making the exercise program seem more effective than it actually was.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start and meets all critical requirements for length, accuracy, and structure. The main areas for improvement involve making the language more direct and active for the reader, which will enhance clarity. Here are the top 3 suggestions to improve the text:\n\n1. **Use more direct, active language.**\n   - **Quote:** \"How did we conduct our search? We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials, where researchers put people into treatment groups by chance... We then combined the results...\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** This section is less clear because it switches between describing what 'researchers' did and what 'we' (the review authors) did. Using 'we' consistently and employing active verbs makes it clearer who performed the actions.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"How did we find the evidence? We searched for studies (randomized controlled trials) that randomly assigned adults with heart failure to either an exercise program or usual care. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n2. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with simple verbs.**\n   - **Quote:** \"The studies did not provide clear information about potential harmful effects.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** Phrases like 'provide information' are less direct than simple verbs. This pattern, called 'nominalization', makes sentences longer and less engaging. The metrics show this is a frequent issue in the draft.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies did not clearly report potential harmful effects.\"\n\n3. **Simplify and standardize descriptions of heart failure types.**\n   - **Quote:** \"...a type of heart failure where the heart muscle doesn't contract effectively (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction).\" and \"...a type of heart failure where the heart muscle is stiff (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction).\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** While it's excellent that you've explained these technical terms, the descriptions are still a bit clinical ('contract effectively', 'preserved ejection fraction'). Using simpler, more everyday language can help readers grasp these important concepts more easily.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Consider simplifying to: \"...heart failure where the heart muscle is weak and doesn't pump strongly\" and \"...heart failure where the heart muscle is stiff and doesn't fill with blood properly.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has an unusually high number of passive voice constructions, nominalizations, and complex words compared to typical Plain Language Summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable in terms of sentence length and grade level, with 12 of 18 metrics (66.7%) falling in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in key areas of style and vocabulary. Metrics for passive voice, nominalizations (noun-form verbs), and total nouns are all 'Beyond P90', indicating a less direct, noun-heavy writing style. The number of complex and long words is also high ('P90'), suggesting opportunities to simplify terminology."
