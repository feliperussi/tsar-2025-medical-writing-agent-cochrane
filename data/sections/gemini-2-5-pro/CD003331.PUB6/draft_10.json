  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education) for adults with heart failure?\n\nKey messages\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces their hospital admissions and may improve their quality of life. We found no difference in the number of deaths up to 1 year of follow-up. The studies did not provide clear information about harmful effects.\n\nThe benefits seem to be the same whether the program is in a hospital, at home, or uses digital support.\n\nFuture research should include more older people, women, and people with the 'stiff heart' type of heart failure, as past studies have not included enough of these people.\n\nWhat is heart failure and how can exercise help?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood around the body as well as it should. There are 2 main types. In one, the heart muscle is weak and doesn't pump strongly. In the other, the muscle is stiff and doesn't fill with blood properly.\n\nThis condition can cause breathlessness and tiredness, make it harder for a person to exercise, and lower their health-related quality of life. People with heart failure are also more likely to be admitted to the hospital. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a program of exercise and education that aims to help people with heart conditions improve their health.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure. We looked at how it affected the risk of death, hospital admissions, and people's health-related quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials, where people are assigned to treatment groups by chance. These studies compared exercise programs with usual care for adults with heart failure. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 60 studies that included 8728 adults with heart failure. On average, the studies followed people for 6 months. Most participants had the 'weak heart' type of failure with mild to moderate symptoms. We noted that the studies included too few women, older people, and people with the 'stiff heart' type of failure. Most programs took place in a hospital, but a growing number were based at home or used digital support. The studies compared cardiac rehabilitation against usual medical care without a formal exercise program.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces hospital admissions for any reason within 1 year. To put this in perspective: for every 100 people who receive usual care, about 24 are admitted to the hospital. With cardiac rehabilitation, this number likely drops to about 16 people. Rehabilitation also probably improves quality of life in an important way. However, it may make little to no difference to the risk of dying from any cause within 1 year.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for 2 main reasons.\n\nFirst, the results may not apply to everyone with heart failure. Most people in the studies were men with the 'weak heart' type of failure. The studies included too few women, older people, and people with the 'stiff heart' type.\n\nSecond, the results for quality of life might be unreliable. In many studies, people knew they were in the exercise group. This awareness might have influenced how they answered questions about their well-being, possibly making the programs seem more effective than they were.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

The main opportunity for improvement is to simplify some of the vocabulary and sentence phrasing to make it even more accessible to a lay audience. While the sentence length is excellent, the word choice is sometimes more formal and noun-heavy than necessary. Addressing the 3 points below will make a great summary even better.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Replace abstract nouns with active verbs.** Some sentences rely on abstract nouns (nominalizations) which can make them feel formal and less direct.\n    *   **Original Text:** \"This awareness might have influenced how they answered questions about their well-being...\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"This awareness\" is indirect. It's clearer to state who is aware and what they are doing.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Knowing they were in the exercise group might have influenced how they answered questions about their well-being...\"\n\n2.  **Simplify noun-heavy phrases.** The text sometimes uses multiple nouns where a simple verb would be more direct and easier to read.\n    *   **Original Text:** \"The studies did not provide clear information about harmful effects.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly formal. A more direct, verb-focused sentence is easier to process.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies did not clearly report any harmful effects.\"\n\n3.  **Explain semi-technical terms.** The summary does a good job of simplifying complex ideas, but some terms could still benefit from a brief explanation.\n    *   **Original Text:** \"Most participants had the 'weak heart' type of failure with mild to moderate symptoms.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** A lay reader may not know what \"mild to moderate symptoms\" means in the context of heart failure. This leaves the severity of their condition unclear.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Most participants had the 'weak heart' type of failure with mild to moderate symptoms, meaning they were generally comfortable at rest but had some limits on physical activity.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft has excellent structural readability, with short sentences (15.3 words/sentence) and high scores on readability indices like Flesch-Kincaid (grade level 7.95). However, the summary deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in its vocabulary choices. Five key metrics—nominalization, noun count, complex words (Dale-Chall), complex words (3+ syllables), and long words—are in the P90 range. This indicates the text is more noun-heavy and uses more formal, multi-syllable words than is typical for this format, supporting the need to simplify phrasing and word choice."
