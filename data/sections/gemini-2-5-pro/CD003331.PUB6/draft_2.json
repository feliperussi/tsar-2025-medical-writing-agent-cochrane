  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education) for adults with heart failure?\n\nKey messages\nFor adults with heart failure (a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should), exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces hospital admissions and may improve their quality of life. We found no difference in the number of deaths up to 1 year of follow-up. The studies did not provide clear information about potential harmful effects. The benefits of this rehabilitation appear to be similar whether the program is in a hospital, at home, or uses digital support. Future research should include more older people, women, and people with a specific type of heart failure where the heart muscle becomes stiff (known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), as these groups have not been well-studied.\n\nWhat is heart failure and how can exercise help?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood around the body as well as it should. This can cause breathlessness and tiredness, reduce a person's ability to exercise, and lower their overall well-being (health-related quality of life). People with heart failure are also more likely to be admitted to the hospital. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a program of exercise and education designed to help people with heart conditions improve their health.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure. We looked at its impact on the risk of death, the number of hospital admissions, and people's health-related quality of life.\n\nHow did we conduct our search?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials, where people are put into treatment groups by chance. These studies compared exercise programs with usual care for adults with heart failure. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 60 trials that included a total of 8728 adults with heart failure. The studies followed people for 6 months, on average. Most participants had a type of heart failure where the heart muscle doesn't contract effectively (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction). Their symptoms were mostly mild to moderate. We noted that the studies included too few women, older people, and people with a type of heart failure where the heart muscle is stiff (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction). Most studies took place in a hospital, but a growing number were based at home. The studies compared cardiac rehabilitation against usual medical care without a formal exercise program.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of being admitted to the hospital for any reason within 1 year. For every 100 people, about 24 who receive usual care are admitted to the hospital, compared to probably only 16 who receive cardiac rehabilitation. Rehabilitation also probably leads to important improvements in quality of life. However, it may make little to no difference to the risk of dying from any cause within 1 year.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies did not include enough women, older people, or people with a specific type of heart failure, so the results may not apply to everyone. Second, in many studies, people knew whether they were getting the exercise program or usual care. This knowledge could have influenced their feelings about their own health, which might affect the results for quality of life.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

To make it even better, I have three main suggestions focused on making the language more direct and concise for the reader.\n\n**1. Make the 'Key messages' more concise by removing repeated information.**\nThe first key message defines heart failure, but this is explained again in the very next section. Removing the definition from the key messages will make them quicker for readers to scan.\n- **Current text:** 'For adults with heart failure (a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should), exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces hospital admissions...'\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'For adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces hospital admissions...'\n\n**2. Use more active and direct language.**\nThe draft often uses nouns where verbs would be more direct (a style called 'nominalization') and uses passive voice. This makes the text less engaging and can make it harder to understand who is doing what. The evaluation metrics support this, showing counts for passive voice, nominalizations, and nouns that are much higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary.\n- **Example 1 (Noun to Verb):** 'Rehabilitation also probably leads to important **improvements** in quality of life.'\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'Rehabilitation also probably **improves** quality of life in an important way.'\n- **Example 2 (Passive to Active):** '...where people **are put into** treatment groups by chance.'\n- **Suggested rewrite:** '...where researchers **put people into** treatment groups by chance.'\n\n**3. Clarify the explanation of bias in the 'How reliable is this evidence?' section.**\nThe current explanation of why knowing the treatment group is a problem could be more specific about the impact on the results.\n- **Current text:** 'This knowledge could have influenced their feelings about their own health, which might affect the results for quality of life.'\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their quality of life, potentially making the exercise program seem more effective than it actually was.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft has excellent readability, with most metrics like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and words per sentence falling in the best quartile (P25). However, the analysis also highlights significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in key stylistic areas. The counts for passive voice (25.0), nominalizations (30.0), and total nouns (208.0) are all in the 'BEYOND_P90' category, indicating a writing style that is less direct and more descriptive than is optimal for this format. The number of complex and long words are also slightly high (P90), though this is likely due to necessary medical terminology."
