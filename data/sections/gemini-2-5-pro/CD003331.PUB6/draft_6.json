  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education) for adults with heart failure?\n\nKey messages\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces the risk of being admitted to the hospital and may improve their quality of life. We found no difference in the number of deaths up to 1 year of follow-up. The studies did not clearly report potential harmful effects.\n\nThe benefits of this rehabilitation appear to be similar whether the program is in a hospital, at home, or uses digital support.\n\nFuture research should include more older people, women, and people with the type of heart failure caused by a stiff heart muscle (called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF), as studies have not included enough of these people.\n\nWhat is heart failure and how can exercise help?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood around the body as well as it should. This can cause breathlessness and tiredness, make it harder for a person to exercise, and lower their overall well-being (health-related quality of life). People with heart failure also have a higher risk of being admitted to the hospital. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a program of exercise and education designed to help people with heart conditions improve their health.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure. We looked at how it affected the risk of death, the risk of being admitted to the hospital, and people's health-related quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies (randomized controlled trials, where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared exercise programs with usual care for adults with heart failure. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 60 studies that included 8728 adults with heart failure. On average, the studies followed people for 6 months. Most participants had the type of heart failure where the heart muscle is weak and doesn't pump strongly (called heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF). Their symptoms were mostly mild to moderate. We noted that the studies included too few women, older people, and people with the other main type of heart failure, where the heart muscle is stiff and doesn't fill with blood properly (called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF). Most programs took place in a hospital, but a growing number were based at home or used digital support. The studies compared cardiac rehabilitation against usual medical care without a formal exercise program.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of being admitted to the hospital for any reason within 1 year. For every 100 people who receive usual care, about 24 are admitted to the hospital, compared to probably only 16 who receive cardiac rehabilitation. Rehabilitation also probably leads to important improvements in quality of life. However, it may make little to no difference to the risk of dying from any cause within 1 year.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies did not include enough women, older people, or people with the stiff-heart-muscle type of heart failure. This means the results may not apply to everyone with the condition. Second, because people in many studies knew which treatment they were getting, they might have reported a better quality of life. This could make the exercise program seem more effective than it really was.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions to improve clarity and adopt a more direct style before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Define key medical terms upfront and clearly.** The two types of heart failure (HFrEF and HFpEF) are introduced late in the text. This makes it hard for readers to follow the results.\n    *   **Problem:** In the 'What did we find?' section, you introduce complex terms like 'heart failure with reduced ejection fraction' for the first time.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Introduce and explain both types of heart failure in the 'What is heart failure and how can exercise help?' section. For example: 'Heart failure means the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should. There are two main types. In one, the heart muscle is weak and doesn't pump strongly (heart failure with **reduced** ejection fraction, or HFrEF). In the other, the muscle is stiff and doesn't fill properly (heart failure with **preserved** ejection fraction, or HFpEF).'\n\n2. **Use more active and direct language.** The draft often uses passive voice and noun-heavy phrases, which can make the text feel formal and indirect.\n    *   **Problem:** Sentences like 'The studies did not clearly report potential harmful effects' are passive. The actor (the researchers) is missing.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite sentences to be more active. For example: 'The researchers did not clearly report potential harmful effects.' Similarly, change 'Our confidence in the evidence is limited...' to 'We have limited confidence in the evidence...'\n\n3. **Replace research jargon with simpler phrases.** Some phrases are common in research but are not clear for a lay audience.\n    *   **Problem:** In the 'How did we find the evidence?' section, the phrase 'rated our confidence in the evidence' is technical.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Use a plainer alternative. For example: '...and judged how reliable the overall evidence was.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft deviates from typical PLS patterns with very high rates of passive voice (29 instances), nominalizations (31 instances), and total nouns (204), all of which are 'Beyond P90'.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable in many ways, with 67% of metrics in the best quartile for readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 9.4). However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in key areas of style. The use of passive voice (29 instances), nominalizations (31 instances), and total nouns (204) are all beyond the 90th percentile, indicating a style that is less direct and active than is typical for a PLS. The number of complex and long words is also high (P90), likely related to the technical terms used."
