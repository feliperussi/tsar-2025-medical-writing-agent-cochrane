  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education) for adults with heart failure?\n\nKey messages\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces their risk of being admitted to the hospital and may improve their quality of life. We found no difference in the number of deaths up to 1 year of follow-up. The studies we found did not clearly report on potential harmful effects.\n\nThe benefits of this rehabilitation appear to be similar whether the program is in a hospital, at home, or uses digital support.\n\nFuture research should include more older people, women, and people with the 'stiff heart' type of heart failure (HFpEF), as past studies have not included enough of these people.\n\nWhat is heart failure and how can exercise help?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood around the body as well as it should. There are 2 main types. In one, the heart muscle is weak and doesn't pump strongly (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF). In the other, the muscle is stiff and doesn't fill with blood properly (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF).\n\nThis condition can cause breathlessness and tiredness, make it harder for a person to exercise, and lower their well-being (health-related quality of life). People with heart failure are also more likely to be admitted to the hospital. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a program of exercise and education that aims to help people with heart conditions improve their health.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure. We looked at how it affected the risk of death, the risk of being admitted to the hospital, and people's health-related quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials, which assign people to treatment groups by chance. These studies compared exercise programs with usual care for adults with heart failure. We then combined the results of these studies and judged how reliable the overall evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 60 studies that included 8728 adults with heart failure. On average, the studies followed people for 6 months. Most participants had the 'weak heart' type of failure (HFrEF) with mild to moderate symptoms. We noted that the studies included too few women, older people, and people with the 'stiff heart' type of failure (HFpEF). Most programs took place in a hospital, but a growing number were based at home or used digital support. The studies compared cardiac rehabilitation against usual medical care without a formal exercise program.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of being admitted to the hospital for any reason within 1 year. For example, out of 100 people who receive usual care, about 24 are admitted to the hospital. This compares to probably only 16 out of 100 people who receive cardiac rehabilitation. Rehabilitation also probably leads to important improvements in quality of life. However, it may make little to no difference to the risk of dying from any cause within 1 year.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for 2 main reasons. First, the studies did not include enough women, older people, or people with the 'stiff heart' type of failure (HFpEF). This means the results may not apply to everyone with the condition. Second, in many studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. This awareness could have biased their reports on quality of life, making the exercise program seem more effective than it really was.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start and meets all critical requirements for accuracy, completeness, and length. However, it is not approved because several patterns of complex language and abstract phrasing reduce its clarity for a patient audience. The text relies heavily on abstract nouns instead of direct verbs and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Addressing the 3-5 improvements below will make the summary much easier for readers to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns with active verbs.** The text often uses noun forms of verbs (a practice called 'nominalization'), which makes sentences less direct and harder to follow.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** \"Rehabilitation also probably leads to important improvements in quality of life.\"\n    - **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"leads to improvements\" is wordy and less direct than a simple verb.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Rehabilitation also probably improves quality of life in an important way.\"\n    - **Problematic sentence:** \"This awareness could have biased their reports on quality of life, making the exercise program seem more effective than it really was.\"\n    - **Why it's an issue:** Starting with an abstract noun like \"awareness\" makes the concept of bias difficult to grasp.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Because people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, they might have reported better quality of life. This could have made the exercise program seem more effective than it really was.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex words and phrases.** Some of the vocabulary is more technical than it needs to be, which can create barriers for readers.\n    - **Problematic phrase:** \"...did not clearly report on potential harmful effects.\"\n    - **Why it's an issue:** This phrasing is common in technical writing but is jargony for a lay audience.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...did not clearly report if the programs caused any harm.\"\n    - **Problematic phrase:** \"The benefits of this rehabilitation appear to be similar...\"\n    - **Why it's an issue:** \"Rehabilitation\" is a long, complex word. While it's a key term, varying it with simpler words like \"program\" can help. \"Appear to be similar\" is also a bit wordy.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The benefits seem to be the same...\"\n\n3. **Clarify and simplify the limitations section.** The paragraph explaining the reliability of the evidence is dense and combines two separate issues. Breaking it apart and simplifying the language will improve comprehension.\n    - **Problematic paragraph:** \"We have limited confidence in the evidence for 2 main reasons. First, the studies did not include enough women, older people, or people with the 'stiff heart' type of failure (HFpEF). This means the results may not apply to everyone with the condition. Second, in many studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. This awareness could have biased their reports on quality of life, making the exercise program seem more effective than it really was.\"\n    - **Why it's an issue:** This is a wall of text that explains complex concepts (applicability, bias) in an abstract way.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:**\n    \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for two main reasons.\n\n    First, the results may not apply to everyone with heart failure. Most people in the studies were men with the 'weak heart' type of failure. The studies included too few women, older people, and people with the 'stiff heart' type.\n\n    Second, the results for quality of life might be unreliable. In many studies, people knew they were in the exercise group. Knowing this might have influenced how they answered questions about their well-being, which could make the programs seem better than they really were.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour draft is very readable in terms of sentence length and structure. However, the analysis supports the need for vocabulary simplification. The metrics for **nominalization** (BEYOND_P90), **total nouns** (BEYOND_P90), **complex words** (P90), and **long words** (P90) are all higher than is typical for a PLS, confirming that the text would benefit from more direct verbs and simpler word choices.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable in terms of sentence length and structure, with 67% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, the draft deviates from typical PLS patterns in its vocabulary. Metrics for nominalization (BEYOND_P90), total nouns (BEYOND_P90), complex words (P90), and long words (P90) are all higher than usual, suggesting the text relies too heavily on abstract nouns and complex terms, which could be simplified for better clarity."
