  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education) for adults with heart failure?\n\nKey messages\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces their risk of being admitted to the hospital and may improve their quality of life. We found no difference in the number of deaths up to 1 year of follow-up. We could not tell from the studies if the programs caused any harm.\n\nThe benefits seem to be the same whether the program is in a hospital, at home, or uses digital support.\n\nFuture research should include more older people, women, and people with the 'stiff heart' type of heart failure, as past studies have not included enough of these people.\n\nWhat is heart failure and how can exercise help?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood around the body as well as it should. There are 2 main types. In one, the heart muscle is weak and doesn't pump strongly. Doctors call this 'heart failure with reduced ejection fraction' (HFrEF). In the other, the muscle is stiff and doesn't fill with blood properly. This is called 'heart failure with preserved ejection fraction' (HFpEF).\n\nThis condition can cause breathlessness and tiredness, make it harder for a person to exercise, and lower their well-being (health-related quality of life). People with heart failure are also more likely to be admitted to the hospital. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a program of exercise and education that aims to help people with heart conditions improve their health.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure. We looked at how it affected the risk of death, the risk of being admitted to the hospital, and people's health-related quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials, where people are assigned to treatment groups by chance. These studies compared exercise programs with usual care for adults with heart failure. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 60 studies that included 8728 adults with heart failure. On average, the studies followed people for 6 months. Most participants had the 'weak heart' type of failure (HFrEF) with mild to moderate symptoms. We noted that the studies included too few women, older people, and people with the 'stiff heart' type of failure (HFpEF). Most programs took place in a hospital, but a growing number were based at home or used digital support. The studies compared cardiac rehabilitation against usual medical care without a formal exercise program.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of being admitted to the hospital for any reason within 1 year. To put this in perspective: for every 100 people who receive usual care, about 24 are admitted to the hospital. With cardiac rehabilitation, this number likely drops to about 16 people. Rehabilitation also probably improves quality of life in an important way. However, it may make little to no difference to the risk of dying from any cause within 1 year.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for 2 main reasons.\n\nFirst, the results may not apply to everyone with heart failure. Most people in the studies were men with the 'weak heart' type of failure. The studies included too few women, older people, and people with the 'stiff heart' type.\n\nSecond, the results for quality of life might be unreliable. In many studies, people knew which treatment group they were in. Knowing they were in the exercise group might have influenced how they answered questions about their well-being. This could make the programs seem better than they really were.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a patient audience. The main issues are the overuse of complex wording, noun-heavy sentences (nominalizations), and some awkward phrasing. These issues are reflected in the linguistic analysis, which shows the text deviates from typical PLS patterns for nominalization, noun count, and complex words.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations) with direct verbs.** This makes sentences more active and easier to understand.\n   - **Original:** '...exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces their **risk of being admitted** to the hospital...'\n   - **Problem:** 'risk of being admitted' is an indirect, noun-based phrase.\n   - **Suggestion:** '...exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces **how often they are admitted** to the hospital...'\n\n2. **Remove unnecessary technical jargon.** Even when defined, acronyms can be distracting for a lay audience if they aren't used repeatedly.\n   - **Original:** '...the 'weak heart' type of failure (HFrEF)... people with the 'stiff heart' type of failure (HFpEF).'\n   - **Problem:** The acronyms HFrEF and HFpEF are jargon that add no value for the reader in this context.\n   - **Suggestion:** '...the 'weak heart' type of failure... people with the 'stiff heart' type of failure.'\n\n3. **Simplify phrasing in the limitations section.** The explanation of bias can be made more direct.\n   - **Original:** 'In many studies, people knew which treatment group they were in. Knowing they were in the exercise group might have influenced how they answered questions about their well-being. This could make the programs seem better than they really were.'\n   - **Problem:** The connection between the points is slightly indirect.\n   - **Suggestion:** 'In many studies, people knew they were in the exercise group. This awareness might have influenced how they answered questions about their well-being, possibly making the programs seem more effective than they were.'\n\nBy addressing these points, the summary will be much clearer and more accessible for people with heart failure and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has excellent sentence-level readability, with most metrics like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and words-per-sentence falling in the best quartile (P25). However, the analysis also reveals significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure. The draft has an unusually high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) and total nouns, both falling 'Beyond P90'. It also scores in the P90 range for passive voice, complex words, and long words. This indicates that while sentences are short, they are dense with complex, noun-heavy language that can reduce clarity for a lay audience."
