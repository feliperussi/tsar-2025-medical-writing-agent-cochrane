  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education) for adults with heart failure?\n\nKey messages\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces hospital admissions and may improve their quality of life. We found no difference in the number of deaths up to 1 year of follow-up. The studies did not clearly report potential harmful effects.\n\nThe benefits of this rehabilitation appear to be similar whether the program is in a hospital, at home, or uses digital support.\n\nFuture research should include more older people, women, and people with the type of heart failure caused by a stiff heart muscle, as studies have not included enough of these people.\n\nWhat is heart failure and how can exercise help?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood around the body as well as it should. This can cause breathlessness and tiredness, make it harder for a person to exercise, and lower their overall well-being (health-related quality of life). People with heart failure are also more likely to be admitted to the hospital. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a program of exercise and education designed to help people with heart conditions improve their health.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure. We looked at how it affected the risk of death, hospital admissions, and people's health-related quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies (randomized controlled trials, where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared exercise programs with usual care for adults with heart failure. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 60 studies that included 8728 adults with heart failure. On average, the studies followed people for 6 months. Most participants had the type of heart failure where the heart muscle is weak and doesn't pump strongly. Their symptoms were mostly mild to moderate. We noted that the studies included too few women, older people, and people with the other main type of heart failure, where the heart muscle is stiff and doesn't fill with blood properly. Most programs took place in a hospital, but a growing number were based at home or used digital support. The studies compared cardiac rehabilitation against usual medical care without a formal exercise program.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces hospital admissions for any reason within 1 year. For every 100 people who receive usual care, about 24 are admitted to the hospital, compared to probably only 16 who receive cardiac rehabilitation. Rehabilitation also probably leads to important improvements in quality of life. However, it may make little to no difference to the risk of dying from any cause within 1 year.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for two main reasons. First, the studies did not include enough women, older people, or people with the stiff-heart-muscle type of heart failure. This means the results may not apply to everyone with the condition. Second, in many studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. This awareness could have influenced how they reported their quality of life, possibly making the exercise program seem more effective than it was.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it needs a few revisions to make it clearer and more direct for patients. The main issues are some passive and indirect phrasing, a high number of formal nouns where verbs would be simpler, and a missed opportunity to define key medical terms that would empower patients. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make phrasing more direct and active, especially when describing limitations.**\n   - **Quote:** \"This awareness could have influenced how they reported their quality of life, possibly making the exercise program seem more effective than it was.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** The phrase \"This awareness could have influenced\" is indirect and abstract. It's clearer to state directly what might have happened in simpler terms.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Because people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, they might have reported a better quality of life. This could make the exercise program seem more effective than it really was.\"\n\n2. **Replace formal nouns with more active verb phrases.**\n   - **Quote:** \"...exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces hospital admissions...\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** The term \"hospital admissions\" is a formal noun phrase (a nominalization). Using a more active, verb-based description is often easier for readers to understand. This pattern appears several times and contributes to the formal tone.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces how often people are admitted to the hospital...\" or \"...likely reduces the risk of being admitted to the hospital.\"\n\n3. **Define key medical terms to help patients understand their condition.**\n   - **Quote:** \"...people with the other main type of heart failure, where the heart muscle is stiff and doesn't fill with blood properly.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** This is an excellent plain language description, but it misses an opportunity to connect it to the medical term (HFpEF) that patients may hear from their doctor. Adding the term helps patients understand their own diagnosis better.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...people with the other main type of heart failure, where the heart muscle is stiff and doesn't fill with blood properly (called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF).\" You could do the same for the 'weak heart muscle' type (HFrEF).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly readable in terms of sentence length and grade level (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9.1). However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns with a high number of passive voice constructions (20), nominalizations (25), and complex/long words. These metrics support the editorial feedback, indicating that the vocabulary and sentence construction could be simplified to be more direct and active for a lay audience."
