  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education) for adults with heart failure?\n\nKey messages\nFor adults with heart failure (a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should), exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education) likely reduces hospital admissions and may improve their quality of life. There was no evidence of a difference in the number of deaths up to one year of follow-up. The studies did not provide clear information about potential harmful effects. The benefits of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation appear to be similar whether the program is delivered in a hospital, at home, or with digital support. Future research should include more older people, women, and people with a specific type of heart failure where the heart muscle becomes stiff (known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), as these groups have not been well-studied.\n\nWhat is heart failure and how can exercise help?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood around the body as well as it should. This can make people feel breathless and tired, reduce their ability to exercise, and negatively affect their overall well-being (known as 'health-related quality of life'). People with heart failure are also more likely to be admitted to the hospital. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a program of exercise and education designed to help people with heart conditions improve their health.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nThe authors of this Cochrane Review wanted to find out about the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure. They looked at its impact on the risk of death, the number of hospital admissions, and people's health-related quality of life.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared exercise programs with usual care for adults with heart failure. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 60 trials with a total of 8728 adult participants with heart failure. The studies had a median follow-up of six months (the length of time people were monitored for). The participants were predominantly people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), a type of heart failure where the heart muscle doesn't contract effectively, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II and III (a scale used to classify the severity of heart failure symptoms; classes II and III represent mild to moderate symptoms). The review noted that women, older people, and those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a specific type of heart failure where the heart muscle becomes stiff, were under-represented. Most studies were conducted in a hospital or centre-based setting, although a growing number were home-based. The studies compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation against a no-exercise control group, which typically received usual medical care.\n\nMain results: exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart failure\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of being admitted to hospital for any reason within one year. Out of 100 people who do not have rehabilitation, about 24 are admitted to the hospital, compared to probably only about 16 of 100 people who do have rehabilitation. Rehabilitation also probably results in important improvements in quality of life. However, it may make little to no difference to the risk of dying from any cause within one year.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the evidence does not cover all of the people we were interested in, and it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It fails a critical check because several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is required by the style guide. Additionally, there are three main areas for improvement to enhance clarity for a lay audience. First, the 'What did we find?' section contains a very long and technical sentence describing the study participants; this should be broken down into shorter, simpler sentences to avoid overwhelming the reader. Second, the text relies heavily on passive voice and academic phrasing (e.g., 'The review noted that...'). Rewriting these sentences in the active voice (e.g., 'We noted that...') will make the summary more direct and easier to follow, as recommended in the style guide. Third, the 'Limitations of the evidence' section is unclear; it should explain *why* it matters that participants knew which treatment they were getting. These issues are reflected in the linguistic analysis, which shows the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in its high use of passive voice, nominalizations, and complex words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 61.1% of features falling within the median or best quartile ranges. However, there are significant deviations in key areas that impact readability. The draft is in the 'BEYOND_P90' range for passive voice (32 instances), nominalizations (37 instances), and total nouns (218), indicating a style that is more academic than is typical for a PLS. Furthermore, multiple vocabulary complexity metrics, including the SMOG index, complex words, and long words, are in the P90 range, suggesting the language is more technical and difficult than usual for this format."
