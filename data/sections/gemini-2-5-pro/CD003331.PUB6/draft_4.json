  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education) for adults with heart failure?\n\nKey messages\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces hospital admissions and may improve their quality of life. We found no difference in the number of deaths up to 1 year of follow-up. The studies did not clearly report potential harmful effects.\n\nThe benefits of this rehabilitation appear to be similar whether the program is in a hospital, at home, or uses digital support.\n\nFuture research should include more older people, women, and people with the type of heart failure where the heart muscle is stiff and doesn't fill with blood properly (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), as studies have not included enough of these people.\n\nWhat is heart failure and how can exercise help?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood around the body as well as it should. This can cause breathlessness and tiredness, make it harder for a person to exercise, and lower their overall well-being (health-related quality of life). People with heart failure are also more likely to be admitted to the hospital. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is a program of exercise and education designed to help people with heart conditions improve their health.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure. We looked at how it affected the risk of death, hospital admissions, and people's health-related quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies (randomized controlled trials) that randomly assigned adults with heart failure to either an exercise program or usual care. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 60 studies that included 8728 adults with heart failure. On average, the studies followed people for 6 months. Most participants had the type of heart failure where the heart muscle is weak and doesn't pump strongly (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction). Their symptoms were mostly mild to moderate. We noted that the studies included too few women, older people, and people with the type of heart failure where the heart muscle is stiff and doesn't fill with blood properly (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction). Most programs took place in a hospital, but a growing number were based at home. The studies compared cardiac rehabilitation against usual medical care without a formal exercise program.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor adults with heart failure, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the risk of being admitted to the hospital for any reason within 1 year. For every 100 people who receive usual care, about 24 are admitted to the hospital, compared to probably only 16 who receive cardiac rehabilitation. Rehabilitation also probably improves quality of life in an important way. However, it may make little to no difference to the risk of dying from any cause within 1 year.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for two main reasons. First, the studies did not include enough women, older people, or people with a specific type of heart failure, so the results may not apply to everyone. Second, in many studies, people knew whether they were getting the exercise program or usual care. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their quality of life, potentially making the exercise program seem more effective than it actually was.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

However, it is not approved because of three key areas that need improvement to enhance clarity for a lay audience. The main issue is the use of long, repetitive technical explanations for the types of heart failure, which makes key sentences difficult to read. Additionally, the text relies on wordy noun phrases (nominalizations) instead of more direct verbs, and the section on evidence limitations could be clearer. Addressing these points will significantly improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 67% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, the analysis also flags significant deviations that support the need for revision. The score for 'nominalization' (using noun forms of verbs) is beyond the 90th percentile, indicating wordy phrasing. Metrics for vocabulary complexity, including 'complex_words', 'long_words', and 'complex_words_dc', are also in the 90th percentile range, largely due to the long, repeated technical definitions. These metrics confirm that simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure are the highest-priority edits."
