  "key_messages": [
    "In people with sudden, severe dizziness, the HINTS and HINTS-Plus tests (a series of eye-movement examinations) seem to help trained clinicians correctly identify if a stroke is the cause. However, the evidence we found is not strong enough to be certain. The review did not report on any harmful effects from the tests.",
    "More high-quality research is needed to confirm how accurate these tests are. Future studies should investigate how well the tests work when performed by different types of healthcare professionals and compare them directly to other diagnostic approaches, such as MRI scans (a type of body scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images)."

      "subheading": "Why is it important to find the cause of sudden, severe dizziness?",
      "content": "Dizziness is a common reason people seek medical help. A specific type of severe dizziness is called acute vestibular syndrome (AVS), which can involve intense vertigo (a spinning sensation), nausea, and unsteadiness. AVS can be caused by a problem in the inner ear (a 'peripheral' cause) or a more serious problem in the brain, such as a stroke (a 'central' cause). It is very important to tell the difference between these two causes because they require different treatments and have different outcomes."

    {
      "subheading": "What is the HINTS examination?",
      "content": "The HINTS examination is a three-part physical test that clinicians can use to help find the cause of AVS. It involves: 1) checking how the eyes move when the head is turned quickly (head impulse); 2) looking at the direction of involuntary, jerky eye movements (nystagmus); and 3) checking if the eyes are properly aligned with each other (test of skew). A variation called the HINTS Plus examination also includes a hearing test."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out how accurate the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations are for identifying a 'central' cause (a problem in the brain) for people with acute vestibular syndrome. We also looked at whether using video to assist with the examination made a difference to its accuracy."

      "content": "The review included 16 studies with a total of 2024 participants (981 women and 1043 men) with a mean age of 60 years. The studies evaluated the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for diagnosing a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome. Most studies were conducted in the emergency department setting. When performed by trained clinicians, the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations may be good tests for diagnosing a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome. Using video to help with the HINTS Plus test probably correctly identifies most people who have a central cause, but it may also wrongly suggest a central cause in many people who do not have one. It is unclear how accurate the HINTS examination is when using video assistance. Overall, there was not enough high-quality information to be certain about these results, or to know how the tests perform in different situations or when used by different types of healthcare providers."
