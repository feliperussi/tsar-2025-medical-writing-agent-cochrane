  "draft": "How well do the HINTS and HINTS‑Plus eye‑movement tests detect stroke in people with sudden, severe dizziness?\n\nKey messages\n\n- In people with sudden, severe dizziness, the HINTS and HINTS-Plus tests (a series of eye-movement examinations) seem to help trained clinicians correctly identify if a stroke is the cause. However, the evidence we found is not strong enough to be certain. The review did not report on any harmful effects from the tests.\n- More high-quality research is needed to confirm how accurate these tests are. Future studies should investigate how well the tests work when performed by different types of healthcare professionals and compare them directly to other diagnostic approaches, such as MRI scans (a type of body scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images).\n\nWhy is it important to find the cause of sudden, severe dizziness?\nDizziness is a common reason people seek medical help. A specific type of severe dizziness is called acute vestibular syndrome (AVS), which can involve intense vertigo (a spinning sensation), nausea, and unsteadiness. AVS can be caused by a problem in the inner ear (a 'peripheral' cause) or a more serious problem in the brain, such as a stroke (a 'central' cause). It is very important to tell the difference between these two causes because they require different treatments and have different outcomes.\n\nWhat is the HINTS examination?\nThe HINTS examination is a three-part physical test that clinicians can use to help find the cause of AVS. It involves: 1) checking how the eyes move when the head is turned quickly (head impulse); 2) looking at the direction of involuntary, jerky eye movements (nystagmus); and 3) checking if the eyes are properly aligned with each other (test of skew). A variation called the HINTS Plus examination also includes a hearing test.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how accurate the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations are for identifying a 'central' cause (a problem in the brain) for people with acute vestibular syndrome. We also looked at whether using video to assist with the examination made a difference to its accuracy.\n\nMethods\n\nWe searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for identifying a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome. We combined the results of these studies and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\n\nThe review included 16 studies with a total of 2024 participants (981 women and 1043 men) with a mean age of 60 years. The studies evaluated the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for diagnosing a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome. Most studies were conducted in the emergency department setting. When performed by trained clinicians, the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations may be good tests for diagnosing a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome. Using video to help with the HINTS Plus test probably correctly identifies most people who have a central cause, but it may also wrongly suggest a central cause in many people who do not have one. It is unclear how accurate the HINTS examination is when using video assistance. Overall, there was not enough high-quality information to be certain about these results, or to know how the tests perform in different situations or when used by different types of healthcare providers.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start and factually accurate, but it requires revisions before approval. The main issues are structural: several subheadings do not follow the Master Style Guide's requirement to be phrased as questions. Additionally, some sentences are overly complex and noun-heavy, which can be simplified for better clarity.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions:** Several subheadings are simple labels rather than questions, which makes the summary harder for readers to navigate. This is a direct violation of the Master Style Guide.\n   - **Problematic Subheadings:** \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrites:**\n     - Change \"Methods\" to \"How did we conduct this review?\"\n     - Change \"Results\" to \"What did we find?\"\n     - Change \"Limitations of the evidence\" to \"How reliable is the evidence?\"\n     - Change \"Currency of the evidence\" to \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n    2. **Simplify noun-heavy sentences by using more direct verbs:** Some sentences rely on noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), making them less direct and harder to read.\n   - **Quote:** \"The studies evaluated the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for diagnosing a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** The phrase \"examinations for diagnosing\" is less direct than using a simple verb. This pattern contributes to the high number of nouns and nominalizations identified in the evaluation.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies tested how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations diagnosed a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome.\"\n\n3. **Break up long sentences to improve readability:** One key sentence is over 45 words long, which can be difficult for readers to follow.\n   - **Quote:** \"Future studies should investigate how well the tests work when performed by different types of healthcare professionals and compare them directly to other diagnostic approaches, such as MRI scans (a type of body scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images).\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** This sentence combines two distinct ideas. Splitting it would make the recommendations clearer.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Future studies should test how well different healthcare professionals can use these tests. They should also compare the tests directly to other methods, like MRI scans.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72% of features falling into the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis also flags four features that deviate significantly from the norm: nominalization (P90), nouns (P90), complex words (Dale-Chall) (P90), and long words (P90). These metrics support the editorial feedback, indicating that while the text is generally readable, it could be improved by using more direct verbs and simplifying sentence structure to reduce the density of complex vocabulary and nouns."
