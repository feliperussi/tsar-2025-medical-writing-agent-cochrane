  "draft": "After surgery for a burst appendix, does placing a tube in the belly (a drain) prevent a collection of pus?\n\n– It is very uncertain if placing a tube in the belly (a drain) after surgery for a burst appendix prevents a collection of pus. The evidence suggests that using a drain probably increases the risk of death and may lead to a longer hospital stay.\n– Larger and better-designed studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of using drains after this type of surgery, particularly on the risk of death.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis?\nAppendicitis is when the appendix (a small organ attached to the large intestine) becomes swollen and needs to be surgically removed in an operation called an appendectomy. Appendicitis is 'complicated' if the appendix is very swollen, has started to decay (called 'gangrenous'), or has burst (called 'perforated'). After surgery for complicated appendicitis, people have a higher risk of developing infections inside their belly, such as a collection of pus (an abscess). To try and prevent this, surgeons sometimes place a small tube, called a drain, to let fluid out of the belly. However, it is not clear if this practice is helpful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using an abdominal drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis. We wanted to know if using a drain prevents abscesses from forming inside the belly compared to not using a drain. We also wanted to compare different types of drains and find out the best time to remove a drain.\n\nHow did we answer this question?\nWe searched for studies that randomly put people who had surgery for complicated appendicitis into one of two groups: one group had a drain put in, and the other did not. This type of study, called a randomized controlled trial, provides the most reliable evidence. We then collected and combined the results from all the studies we found. We used a method called GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence for each outcome, such as infection rates and how long people stayed in the hospital.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur search found 8 studies with a total of 739 children and adults with complicated appendicitis. The studies took place in North America, Asia, and Africa. They followed people for up to 30 days. The main comparison was using an abdominal drain versus no drain. We found no studies that compared different types of drains or different schedules for removing them.\n\nWhat did the studies show?\nFor people having surgery for complicated appendicitis, using an abdominal drain probably increases the risk of death within 30 days. This is based on evidence where 7 deaths occurred in the group of people who had a drain, compared to 1 death in the group without a drain.\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain about other effects of using a drain. We do not know if using a drain affects the risk of developing a collection of pus inside the belly, a wound infection, or other problems. Using a drain may increase how long people stay in the hospital, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low because in some studies, people knew which treatment they received, which could affect the results. Also, the studies included different types of people and were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates a previous version. The evidence is current to October 2023.",

All readability scores, such as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (9.39), are excellent. The only metric deviating from typical patterns is the count of Dale-Chall complex words (221.0), which is in the P90 range. However, this is likely due to necessary medical terms (e.g., 'gangrenous', 'perforated'), which the author has effectively defined in plain language, justifying the deviation."
