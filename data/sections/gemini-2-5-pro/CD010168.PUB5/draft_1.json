  "draft": "After surgery for a burst appendix, does placing a tube in the belly (a drain) prevent a collection of pus?\n\n- It is very uncertain if placing a tube in the belly (a drain) after surgery for a burst appendix prevents a collection of pus. The evidence suggests that using a drain probably increases the risk of death and may lead to a longer hospital stay.\n- Larger and better-designed studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of using drains after this type of surgery, particularly on the risk of death.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis?\nAppendicitis is when the appendix (a small organ attached to the large intestine) becomes swollen and needs to be surgically removed in an operation called an appendectomy. Sometimes, appendicitis becomes 'complicated', which means the appendix is severely inflamed, has started to decay (gangrenous), or has burst (perforated). After surgery for complicated appendicitis, people have a higher risk of developing infections inside their abdomen, such as a collection of pus (an abscess). To try and prevent this, surgeons sometimes place a small tube, called a drain, to let fluid out of the abdomen. However, it is not clear if this practice is helpful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using an abdominal drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis. We wanted to know if using a drain prevents abscesses from forming inside the abdomen compared to not using a drain. We also wanted to compare different types of drains and find out the best time to remove a drain.\n\nSearch Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that compared the use of a surgical drain versus no drain, different types of drains, or varying timings of drain removal after surgery for complicated appendicitis.\n\nEligibility Criteria\nEligible studies were randomized controlled trials or observational studies that reported postoperative outcomes for patients with complicated appendicitis and addressed at least one of the following comparisons: drain vs. no drain, type of drain, or timing of drain removal.\n\nData Synthesis\nData from the included studies were extracted, pooled, and analyzed using meta‑analytic techniques to estimate pooled effect sizes for relevant clinical outcomes such as infection rates, intra‑abdominal collections, and length of hospital stay.\n\nConfidence in Evidence\nThe certainty of the evidence for each outcome was evaluated using the GRADE approach, taking into account for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included eight studies with a total of 739 children and adults with complicated appendicitis. The studies took place in North America, Asia, and Africa, and followed participants for up to 30 days. The main comparison was the use of an abdominal drain versus no drain after surgery. No studies were found that compared different types of drains or different schedules for drain removal.\n\nMain results: Abdominal drains for complicated appendicitis\nFor people having surgery for a complicated appendicitis, using an abdominal drain probably increases the risk of death within 30 days. This is based on evidence where seven deaths occurred in the group of people who had a drain, compared to one death in the group without a drain.\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of using a drain on other outcomes. Therefore, we do not know if using a drain affects the risk of developing an abscess inside the abdomen, wound infection, or overall complications. Using a drain may increase how long people stay in the hospital, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people, and the studies were very small.\n\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. While factually accurate, it fails a critical check because several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is required by the style guide. Additionally, the entire methods section is written in technical language that is not suitable for a lay audience, and there are multiple instances of passive voice and complex vocabulary that reduce clarity. The high SMOG index and complex word counts confirm these readability issues.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rewrite the Methods section in plain language.** The current methods section is written for researchers, not patients. It uses unexplained jargon and complex sentences.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Data from the included studies were extracted, pooled, and analyzed using meta‑analytic techniques to estimate pooled effect sizes for relevant clinical outcomes such as infection rates, intra‑abdominal collections, and length of hospital stay.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We gathered and combined the results from all the studies to understand the overall effects of using a drain. We looked at outcomes like infection rates and how long people stayed in the hospital.\"\n\n2. **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** Several subheadings are simple statements, which makes the text harder for readers to scan and understand. All subheadings must be questions.\n   - **Problematic subheadings:** \"Search Strategy\", \"Eligibility Criteria\", \"Data Synthesis\", \"Confidence in Evidence\", \"Main results: Abdominal drains for complicated appendicitis\"\n   - **Suggested rewrites:** \"How did we find the studies?\", \"What types of studies did we look for?\", \"How did we combine the results?\", \"How confident are we in the evidence?\", \"What are the main results?\"\n\n3. **Use active voice and simpler words.** The draft frequently uses passive voice and unnecessarily complex terms, making sentences dense and difficult to follow. This is supported by the high passive voice and complex word counts in the evaluation.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials or observational studies that reported postoperative outcomes for patients with complicated appendicitis...\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We looked for studies that reported on the health of people after surgery for complicated appendicitis...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 44% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, there are significant deviations in key areas affecting readability. The SMOG index (15.04) is beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the text requires a high level of education to understand. This is supported by high counts for complex words (P90), Dale-Chall unfamiliar words (P90), and long words (P90). Additionally, the use of passive voice (23 instances) is in the 90th percentile, suggesting the text is often indirect and less engaging than is typical for a PLS."
