  "draft": "After surgery for a burst appendix, does placing a tube in the belly (a drain) prevent a collection of pus?\n\n– It is very uncertain if placing a tube in the belly (a drain) after surgery for a burst appendix prevents a collection of pus. The evidence suggests that using a drain probably increases the risk of death and may lead to a longer hospital stay.\n– Larger and better-designed studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of using drains after this type of surgery, particularly on the risk of death.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis?\nAppendicitis is when the appendix (a small organ attached to the large intestine) becomes swollen and needs to be surgically removed in an operation called an appendectomy. Appendicitis becomes 'complicated' when the appendix is severely swollen, starts to decay (which doctors call gangrenous), or bursts (perforated). After surgery for complicated appendicitis, people have a higher risk of developing infections inside their belly, such as a collection of pus (an abscess). To try and prevent this, surgeons sometimes place a small tube, called a drain, to let fluid out of the belly. However, it is not clear if this practice is helpful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using an abdominal drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis. We wanted to know if using a drain prevents abscesses from forming inside the belly compared to not using a drain. We also wanted to compare different types of drains and find out the best time to remove a drain.\n\nHow did we answer this question?\nWe searched for studies where people who had surgery for complicated appendicitis were randomly assigned to either have a drain put in or not. This type of study, called a randomized controlled trial, provides the most reliable evidence. We then collected and combined the results from all the studies we found. We used a method called GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence for each outcome, such as infection rates and how long people stayed in the hospital.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur search found 8 studies with a total of 739 children and adults with complicated appendicitis. The studies took place in North America, Asia, and Africa. They followed people for up to 30 days. The main comparison was using an abdominal drain versus no drain. We found no studies that compared different types of drains or different schedules for removing them.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people having surgery for complicated appendicitis, using an abdominal drain probably increases the risk of death within 30 days. This is based on evidence where 7 deaths occurred in the group of people who had a drain, compared to 1 death in the group without a drain.\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain about other effects of using a drain. We do not know if using a drain affects the risk of developing a collection of pus inside the belly, a wound infection, or other problems. Using a drain may increase how long people stay in the hospital, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, the studies included different types of people and were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates a previous version. The evidence is current to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. However, it cannot be approved because it has one critical issue that violates the style guide, along with a few opportunities to further improve clarity for readers.\n\n**Critical Issue: Subheading Format**\nOne subheading does not follow the required question format. The style guide states all subheadings must be phrased as questions.\n- **Text:** \"What were the main results?\"\n- **Suggestion:** Please change this to a question, for example: \"What did the studies show?\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Simplify the definition of 'complicated appendicitis' for easier reading.**\n    -   **Text:** \"Appendicitis becomes 'complicated' when the appendix is severely swollen, starts to decay (which doctors call gangrenous), or bursts (perforated).\"\n    -   **Problem:** While the definitions are helpful, the sentence structure is a bit complex for a lay reader to follow.\n    -   **Suggestion:** Consider breaking this down or rephrasing for clarity. For example: \"Appendicitis is 'complicated' if the appendix is very swollen, has started to decay (called 'gangrenous'), or has burst (called 'perforated').\"\n\n2.  **Make the methods section more direct.**\n    -   **Text:** \"We searched for studies where people who had surgery for complicated appendicitis were randomly assigned to either have a drain put in or not.\"\n    -   **Problem:** This phrasing is slightly indirect. Using a more active structure can make the process clearer.\n    -   **Suggestion:** Consider a more direct alternative: \"We searched for studies that randomly put people who had surgery for complicated appendicitis into one of two groups: one group had a drain put in, and the other did not.\"\n\n3.  **Use more direct language in the limitations section.**\n    -   **Text:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting.\"\n    -   **Problem:** The phrase \"may have known which treatment they were getting\" is a bit wordy and passive.\n    -   **Suggestion:** A more direct statement would be easier to understand. For example: \"We have low confidence in the evidence because in some studies, people may have known which treatment they received, which can affect the results.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of words unfamiliar to a general audience. Simplifying sentence structure and word choice will help address this.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 17 of 18 metrics (94.4%) falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, the analysis identified one deviation: the count of Dale-Chall complex words (words unfamiliar to a general audience) is 221, which is higher than 90% of PLS texts in the corpus. This suggests that while the text is generally readable, focusing on replacing less common words with simpler alternatives could further improve comprehension."
