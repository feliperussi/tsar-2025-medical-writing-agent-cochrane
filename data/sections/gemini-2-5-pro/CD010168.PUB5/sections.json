    "It is very uncertain if placing a tube in the belly (a drain) after surgery for a burst appendix prevents a collection of pus. The evidence suggests that using a drain probably increases the risk of death and may lead to a longer hospital stay.",
    "Larger and better-designed studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of using drains after this type of surgery, particularly on the risk of death."

      "subheading": "What is complicated appendicitis?",
      "content": "Appendicitis is when the appendix (a small organ attached to the large intestine) becomes swollen and needs to be surgically removed in an operation called an appendectomy. Sometimes, appendicitis becomes 'complicated', which means the appendix is severely inflamed, has started to decay (gangrenous), or has burst (perforated). After surgery for complicated appendicitis, people have a higher risk of developing infections inside their abdomen, such as a collection of pus (an abscess). To try and prevent this, surgeons sometimes place a small tube, called a drain, to let fluid out of the abdomen. However, it is not clear if this practice is helpful."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using an abdominal drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis. We wanted to know if using a drain prevents abscesses from forming inside the abdomen compared to not using a drain. We also wanted to compare different types of drains and find out the best time to remove a drain."

      "subheading": "Eligibility Criteria",
      "content": "Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials or observational studies that reported postoperative outcomes for patients with complicated appendicitis and addressed at least one of the following comparisons: drain vs. no drain, type of drain, or timing of drain removal."

      "subheading": "Data Synthesis",

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included eight studies with a total of 739 children and adults with complicated appendicitis. The studies took place in North America, Asia, and Africa, and followed participants for up to 30 days. The main comparison was the use of an abdominal drain versus no drain after surgery. No studies were found that compared different types of drains or different schedules for drain removal."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Abdominal drains for complicated appendicitis",
      "content": "For people having surgery for a complicated appendicitis, using an abdominal drain probably increases the risk of death within 30 days. This is based on evidence where seven deaths occurred in the group of people who had a drain, compared to one death in the group without a drain.\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of using a drain on other outcomes. Therefore, we do not know if using a drain affects the risk of developing an abscess inside the abdomen, wound infection, or overall complications. Using a drain may increase how long people stay in the hospital, but we are very uncertain about this result."
    }

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023 of search."
