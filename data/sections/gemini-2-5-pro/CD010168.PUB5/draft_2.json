  "draft": "After surgery for a burst appendix, does placing a tube in the belly (a drain) prevent a collection of pus?\n\n- It is very uncertain if placing a tube in the belly (a drain) after surgery for a burst appendix prevents a collection of pus. The evidence suggests that using a drain probably increases the risk of death and may lead to a longer hospital stay.\n- Larger and better-designed studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of using drains after this type of surgery, particularly on the risk of death.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis?\nAppendicitis is when the appendix (a small organ attached to the large intestine) becomes swollen and needs to be surgically removed in an operation called an appendectomy. Sometimes, appendicitis becomes 'complicated', which means the appendix is severely inflamed, has started to decay (gangrenous), or has burst (perforated). After surgery for complicated appendicitis, people have a higher risk of developing infections inside their abdomen, such as a collection of pus (an abscess). To try and prevent this, surgeons sometimes place a small tube, called a drain, to let fluid out of the abdomen. However, it is not clear if this practice is helpful.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using an abdominal drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis. We wanted to know if using a drain prevents abscesses from forming inside the abdomen compared to not using a drain. We also wanted to compare different types of drains and find out the best time to remove a drain.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases for studies that compared using a drain versus no drain, different types of drains, or different timings for drain removal after surgery for complicated appendicitis.\n\nWhat kinds of studies did we include?\nWe looked for studies, known as randomized controlled trials, that reported on the health of people after surgery for complicated appendicitis. In these studies, people are assigned to treatment groups at random.\n\nHow did we analyze the evidence?\nWe gathered and combined the results from all the included studies. We looked at key outcomes like infection rates, collections of pus inside the belly, and how long people stayed in the hospital.\n\nHow certain is the evidence?\nWe used a method called GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence. This involved looking at how the studies were conducted, how consistent the results were, and how big the studies were.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur search found 8 studies with a total of 739 children and adults with complicated appendicitis. The studies took place in North America, Asia, and Africa. They followed people for up to 30 days. The main comparison was using an abdominal drain versus no drain. We found no studies that compared different types of drains or different schedules for removing them.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people having surgery for complicated appendicitis, using an abdominal drain probably increases the risk of death within 30 days. This is based on evidence where 7 deaths occurred in the group of people who had a drain, compared to 1 death in the group without a drain.\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of using a drain on other outcomes. We do not know if using a drain affects the risk of developing a collection of pus inside the belly, wound infection, or other complications. Using a drain may increase how long people stay in the hospital, but we are very uncertain about this result.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. Also, the studies included different types of people and were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThis review updates a previous version. The evidence is current to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and meets all the critical requirements for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity and readability for a patient audience before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Words and Phrases**\n\nSome of the medical language, while defined, makes sentences dense and hard to follow. Replacing or rephrasing these will make the text more accessible. The high number of complex and long words (SMOG Index, Complex Words, and Long Words metrics are all in the 90th percentile) supports this need for simplification.\n\n*   **Example 1:** 'Sometimes, appendicitis becomes 'complicated', which means the appendix is severely inflamed, has started to decay (gangrenous), or has burst (perforated).'\n*   **Suggestion:** 'Appendicitis becomes 'complicated' when the appendix is severely swollen, starts to decay (which doctors call gangrenous), or bursts (perforated).'\n\n*   **Example 2:** 'The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of using a drain on other outcomes.'\n*   **Suggestion:** 'The evidence is very uncertain about other effects of using a drain.'\n\n**2. Use More Active Voice**\n\nThe summary uses passive voice frequently, which can make the writing feel indirect. Using active voice makes it clearer who is performing the action. The analysis shows a high use of passive voice (21 instances, in the 90th percentile).\n\n*   **Example:** 'In these studies, people are assigned to treatment groups at random.'\n*   **Suggestion:** 'In these studies, researchers assign people to treatment groups at random.'\n\n*   **Example:** 'We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.'\n*   **Suggestion:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is low because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting.'\n\n**3. Restructure the Methods Section for Better Flow**\n\nThe four short subheadings in the methods section ('How did we find the evidence?', 'What kinds of studies did we include?', etc.) make the text feel choppy. Combining them under a single, more comprehensive heading would improve readability.\n\n*   **Current Structure:** Four separate, short paragraphs under four headings.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite (under one heading):**\n    '**How did we answer this question?**\n\n    We searched for studies where people who had surgery for complicated appendicitis were randomly assigned to either have a drain put in or not. This type of study, called a randomized controlled trial, provides the most reliable evidence. We then collected and combined the results from all the studies we found. We used a method called GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence for each outcome, such as infection rates and how long people stayed in the hospital.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows high conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 67% of features falling into the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, it deviates significantly in key areas related to complexity and style. Six metrics are in the P90 range, indicating higher-than-typical complexity. These include the `smog_index` (14.14), `complex_words` (121), `long_words` (173), and `passive_voice` (21 instances). These deviations support the need to simplify vocabulary and convert passive sentences to active voice to improve clarity for the intended audience."
