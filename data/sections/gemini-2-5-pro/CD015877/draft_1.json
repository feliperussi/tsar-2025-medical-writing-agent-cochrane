  "draft": "Can precision nutrition (diet plans tailored to a person's individual characteristics like genes, health, and lifestyle) help children and teenagers manage obesity?\n\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence from a very small number of studies, it is unclear whether diet plans tailored to a person's individual characteristics (precision nutrition) help children and teenagers manage their weight. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- More and better-quality studies are needed to understand if this approach is helpful. Future studies should look at the effects on well-being, not just weight, and should include different age groups of children and teenagers.\n\nWhat is precision nutrition for managing obesity in children?\nObesity in children and adolescents is a significant health issue. Standard advice for managing weight often follows a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, where the same general dietary recommendations are given to everyone. However, different people can have very different responses to the same diet. A newer approach, called precision nutrition, aims to create personalized diet plans. This method considers individual factors like a person's genetics, lifestyle, gut bacteria (microbiome), and other unique health details to provide tailored advice that may work better for them.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using precision nutrition helps children and adolescents with obesity manage their weight more effectively than standard, one-size-fits-all dietary advice.\n\nWhat we did\nWe searched for studies that compared personalized nutrition plans with standard 'one-size-fits-all' advice for managing obesity in children and adolescents. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included two studies with a total of 105 children and adolescents up to 19 years old with overweight or obesity, conducted in Ukraine and Greece. The interventions involved precision nutrition-based approaches, which were compared to 'one-size-fits-all' or standard care interventions. One study reported nonprofit funding sources; the other did not provide this information. There was not enough information from the available studies to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effect of precision nutrition‐based interventions on body weight or body mass index (BMI).\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the available studies were very small. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search.",

Here are the 3 most important improvements needed to meet Cochrane standards:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. Two of yours are currently statements.\n   - **Quote:** \"What we did\" and \"Limitations of the evidence\"\n   - **Problem:** These are statements, not questions, making the structure inconsistent.\n   - **Suggestion:** Change \"What we did\" to \"What did we do?\" and \"Limitations of the evidence\" to \"How reliable is the evidence?\"\n\n2. **Simplify the currency statement.** The final sentence contains technical phrasing that may be unclear to a lay audience.\n   - **Quote:** \"The evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"of search\" is internal jargon and sounds unnatural.\n   - **Suggestion:** Simply write, \"The evidence is up to date to July 2024.\"\n\n3. **Improve conciseness in the results section.** One key sentence is long and uses complex phrasing, which can make the main finding harder to grasp.\n   - **Quote:** \"There was not enough information from the available studies to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effect of precision nutrition‐based interventions on body weight or body mass index (BMI).\"\n   - **Problem:** At 33 words, this sentence is long and a bit dense for a key finding.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this more directly, for example: \"The studies did not provide enough information for us to be certain about the effects of precision nutrition on body weight or body mass index (BMI).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median (P50) or best quartile (P25/P75) ranges, indicating strong statistical alignment with the reference corpus. Key readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (11.64) and Dale-Chall (7.18) are in the best quartile, and sentence length is average. The metrics do not flag any significant deviations, suggesting the text is structurally sound and uses appropriate vocabulary."
