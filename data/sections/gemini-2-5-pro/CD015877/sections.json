  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of good-quality evidence from a very small number of studies, it is unclear whether diet plans tailored to a person's individual characteristics (precision nutrition) help children and teenagers manage their weight. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.",
    "More and better-quality studies are needed to understand if this approach is helpful. Future studies should look at the effects on well-being, not just weight, and should include different age groups of children and teenagers."

      "subheading": "What is precision nutrition for managing obesity in children?",
      "content": "Obesity in children and adolescents is a significant health issue. Standard advice for managing weight often follows a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, where the same general dietary recommendations are given to everyone. However, different people can have very different responses to the same diet. A newer approach, called **precision nutrition**, aims to create personalized diet plans. This method considers individual factors like a person's genetics, lifestyle, gut bacteria (microbiome), and other unique health details to provide tailored advice that may work better for them."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if using precision nutrition helps children and adolescents with obesity manage their weight more effectively than standard, one-size-fits-all dietary advice."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included two studies with a total of 105 children and adolescents up to 19 years old with overweight or obesity, conducted in Ukraine and Greece. The interventions involved precision nutrition-based approaches, which were compared to 'one-size-fits-all' or standard care interventions. One study reported nonprofit funding sources; the other did not provide this information. There was not enough information from the available studies to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effect of precision nutrition‚Äêbased interventions on body weight or body mass index (BMI)."
    }

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the available studies were very small. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search."
