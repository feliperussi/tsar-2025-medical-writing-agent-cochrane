  "draft": "For family members, is it helpful or harmful to be present during a loved one's resuscitation (emergency life-saving procedures)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether it is helpful or harmful for family members to be present during a loved one's resuscitation (emergency life-saving procedures).\n- The available evidence suggests that offering family members the choice to be present may reduce their symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; a condition causing anxiety and flashbacks after a stressful event), but we cannot be certain of this finding.\n- Larger and better-designed studies are needed to provide more reliable evidence about the effects of this practice on family members, patients, and healthcare staff.\n\nWhat is this review about?\nWhat is family presence during resuscitation?\nWhen a person has a life‑threatening medical emergency, such as their heart stopping, healthcare professionals perform emergency procedures to try and save their life. This is called resuscitation. Traditionally, family members are asked to wait outside the room. However, some family members may want to stay with their loved one, and some patients may want them there. This practice is known as 'family presence during resuscitation'. It creates a complex situation that affects the patient, their family, and the healthcare team, and the well‑being of all three groups needs to be considered.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how offering family members the option to be present during resuscitation affects them. The main question was whether being present affects the family members' risk of developing post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental health condition that can occur after a distressing event. We also wanted to know about other effects on the family's mental well‑being, such as anxiety or depression. In addition, we looked at the effects on the patient's chances of survival and recovery, the medical care they received, and the stress levels and attitudes of the healthcare professionals involved.\n\nHow we conducted the review\nSearch Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL) and trial registries from inception to the present. The search combined terms related to resuscitation, family presence, and outcomes for patients, relatives, and healthcare staff. No language restrictions were applied.\nEligibility Criteria\nWe included randomized controlled trials, quasi‑experimental studies, and observational cohort studies that compared outcomes when relatives were offered the choice to be present during a resuscitation versus when they were not. Outcomes of interest were psychological impact on relatives, patient survival or functional status, and staff stress or performance.\nData Extraction and Synthesis\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, participant numbers, interventions, and outcomes. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Results were summarized narratively and, where appropriate, pooled using random‑effects meta‑analysis.\nConfidence in Evidence\nThe certainty of the evidence was assessed with the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Findings were presented with corresponding confidence ratings (high, moderate, low, or very low).\n\nWhat the review found\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 2 trials with a total of 595 participants. The studies took place in France and the UK. The participants were relatives of patients undergoing resuscitation. The studies compared a systematic offer for a relative to witness cardiopulmonary resuscitation against the traditional practice of not offering this option. Due to a lack of reliable evidence, we do not know if offering family members the option to be present during a resuscitation attempt affects their long-term psychological well-being, such as post-traumatic stress, anxiety, or depression. It is also unclear whether family presence has an effect on the duration of the resuscitation attempt or on the stress levels of healthcare professionals.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. There are two critical issues that must be addressed. First, the 'How we conducted the review' section is a generic template that is factually inaccurate; it incorrectly states the types of studies included and is filled with technical jargon unsuitable for a lay audience. Second, several subheadings do not follow the mandatory question format required by the style guide. Additionally, the text has significant clarity issues due to a high number of complex words, noun-heavy sentences (nominalizations), and passive voice constructions, making it difficult for a non-medical reader to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rewrite the entire 'How we conducted the review' section.**\n   - **Problem:** This section appears to be a generic template. It is factually incorrect (it lists study types like 'quasi-experimental' and 'observational cohort studies' which were not included in the actual review) and filled with technical jargon like 'random-effects meta-analysis' and 'publication bias' that is meaningless to a lay reader.\n   - **Quote:** \"We included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and observational cohort studies... Results were summarized narratively and, where appropriate, pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Replace the entire section with a simple, accurate description of what you actually did. For example: \"**How did we conduct this review?**\\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials, where the decision to offer family presence was made by chance. These studies provide the most reliable evidence. We found 2 trials and combined their results to see what effect offering the choice to be present had on family members, patients, and staff. We also rated our confidence in the evidence found.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex sentences and replace technical terms.**\n   - **Problem:** Many sentences are long and use complex, multi-syllable words instead of simpler alternatives. This makes the text dense and hard to read.\n   - **Quote:** \"The studies compared a systematic offer for a relative to witness cardiopulmonary resuscitation against the traditional practice of not offering this option.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies compared two approaches: one group of family members was automatically offered the choice to be present during resuscitation, while the other group was not (which is the usual practice).\"\n\n3. **Change passive voice to active voice and use verbs instead of nouns.**\n   - **Problem:** The text frequently uses passive voice and noun forms of verbs ('nominalizations'), which makes the writing less direct and harder to follow. The style guide requires active voice.\n   - **Quote:** \"It is also unclear whether family presence has an effect on the duration of the resuscitation attempt or on the stress levels of healthcare professionals.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We also don't know if having family present changes how long the resuscitation takes or how stressed the healthcare staff feel.\"\n\nFinally, please review all subheadings and ensure they are phrased as questions as required by the style guide (e.g., change 'Limitations of the evidence' to 'How reliable is this evidence?').",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, but this is misleading. While sentence length and some general readability scores are within the median range, there is a significant deviation in vocabulary and style. Six key metrics are in the 'BEYOND_P90' category, indicating the text is far more complex than a typical PLS. These include `nominalization` (noun-heavy phrases), `nouns`, `smog_index` (a measure of complexity), `complex_words_dc` (unfamiliar words), `complex_words` (3+ syllables), and `long_words`. Additionally, the use of `passive_voice` is high (P90). These metrics confirm the editorial finding that the draft is overly academic and needs significant simplification to be accessible to a lay audience."
