  "draft": "For family members, is it helpful or harmful to be present during a loved one's resuscitation (emergency life-saving procedures)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether it is helpful or harmful for family members to be present during a loved one's resuscitation (emergency life-saving procedures).\n- The available evidence suggests that offering family members the choice to be present may reduce their symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; a condition causing anxiety and flashbacks after a stressful event), but we cannot be certain of this finding.\n- We need larger, better-designed studies to provide more trustworthy evidence about how this affects family members, patients, and healthcare staff.\n\nWhat is family presence during resuscitation?\nWhen a person has a life‑threatening medical emergency, such as their heart stopping, healthcare professionals perform emergency procedures to try and save their life. This is called resuscitation. Traditionally, family members are asked to wait outside the room. However, some family members may want to stay with their loved one, and some patients may want them there. This practice is known as 'family presence during resuscitation'. It creates a complex situation that affects the patient, their family, and the healthcare team. We need to consider the well-being of all three groups.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what happens when family members are offered the choice to be present during a resuscitation. Our main question was whether being present affects if a family member develops post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental health condition that can occur after a distressing event. We also wanted to know how it affects the family's mental health, for example, if it causes anxiety or depression. We also looked at whether family presence affected if the patient survived and recovered, the medical care they received, or how stressed the healthcare staff felt.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that randomly decided whether to offer family members the choice to be present during a resuscitation. This type of study, called a randomized controlled trial, provides the most trustworthy evidence. We found 2 such studies. We compared and summarized their results to see how offering the choice affected family members, patients, and healthcare staff. We also rated how confident we were in the evidence we found.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies with a total of 595 family members. The studies took place in France and the UK. The studies compared two approaches: one group of family members was automatically offered the choice to be present during resuscitation, while the other group was not (which is the usual practice). Because the evidence is not good-quality, we do not know if offering family members the choice to be present affects their long-term mental health, such as causing post-traumatic stress, anxiety, or depression. We also don't know if having family present changes how long the resuscitation takes or how stressed the healthcare staff feel.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because people in the studies knew which group they were in, which could have affected the results. Also, with only 2 small studies, we cannot be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to March 2022.",

The text is well within the word count limit. Two metrics, nominalization (P90) and long_words (P90), deviate slightly from typical patterns, suggesting that some sentences could be made more direct by using verbs instead of noun forms and by choosing shorter words where possible. However, these are minor issues in an otherwise strong draft."
