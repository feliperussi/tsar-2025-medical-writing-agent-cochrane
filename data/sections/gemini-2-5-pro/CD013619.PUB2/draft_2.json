  "draft": "For family members, is it helpful or harmful to be present during a loved one's resuscitation (emergency life-saving procedures)?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether it is helpful or harmful for family members to be present during a loved one's resuscitation (emergency life-saving procedures).\n- The available evidence suggests that offering family members the choice to be present may reduce their symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; a condition causing anxiety and flashbacks after a stressful event), but we cannot be certain of this finding.\n- We need larger, better-designed studies to provide more reliable evidence about the effects on family members, patients, and healthcare staff.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is family presence during resuscitation?\nWhen a person has a life‑threatening medical emergency, such as their heart stopping, healthcare professionals perform emergency procedures to try and save their life. This is called resuscitation. Traditionally, family members are asked to wait outside the room. However, some family members may want to stay with their loved one, and some patients may want them there. This practice is known as 'family presence during resuscitation'. It creates a complex situation that affects the patient, their family, and the healthcare team. We need to consider the well-being of all three groups.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how offering family members the option to be present during resuscitation affects them. Our main question was whether being present affects a family member's risk of developing post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental health condition that can occur after a distressing event. We also wanted to know about other effects on the family's mental well‑being, such as anxiety or depression. In addition, we looked at how family presence affects the patient's chances of survival and recovery, the medical care they received, and the stress and attitudes of the healthcare staff.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that randomly decided whether to offer family members the choice to be present during a resuscitation. This type of study, called a randomized controlled trial, provides the most reliable evidence. We found 2 such studies. We compared and summarized their results to see what effect offering the choice had on family members, patients, and healthcare staff. We also rated how confident we were in the evidence we found.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies with a total of 595 family members. The studies took place in France and the UK. The studies compared two approaches: one group of family members was automatically offered the choice to be present during resuscitation, while the other group was not (which is the usual practice). Because the evidence is not reliable, we do not know if offering family members the choice to be present affects their long-term mental health, such as causing post-traumatic stress, anxiety, or depression. We also don't know if having family present changes how long the resuscitation takes or how stressed the healthcare staff feel.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because people in the studies knew which group they were in, which could have affected the results. Also, with only 2 small studies, we cannot be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to March 2022.",

However, a few key improvements would make it even more accessible to readers by addressing a pattern of noun-heavy sentences and slightly complex vocabulary.\n\nHere are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** Some sentences rely on abstract nouns where a simple verb would be more direct and easier to understand. This makes the text feel more formal and less active.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"In addition, we looked at how family presence affects the patient's chances of survival and recovery, the medical care they received, and the stress and attitudes of the healthcare staff).\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrases \"chances of survival and recovery\" and \"stress and attitudes\" are noun-heavy and a bit abstract for a lay audience.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We also looked at whether family presence affected if the patient survived and recovered, the medical care they received, or how stressed the healthcare staff felt.\"\n\n2. **Simplify sentence structure for key concepts.** The structure of some sentences can make the main point slightly less impactful.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"We wanted to find out how offering family members the option to be present during resuscitation affects them.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"offering family members the option\" is a bit wordy and indirect.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out what happens when family members are offered the choice to be present during a resuscitation.\"\n\n3. **Choose simpler, more common words.** While the text is generally clear, some word choices could be simplified to ensure the widest possible audience can understand them easily.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"This type of study, called a randomized controlled trial, provides the most reliable evidence.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The word \"reliable\" is less common in everyday language than simpler alternatives.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This type of study, called a randomized controlled trial, provides the most trustworthy evidence.\"\n\nBy making these changes, the summary will be even more direct and easier for patients and their families to read and understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability, sentence length, and use of active voice. However, three metrics deviate from typical patterns, falling into the P90 range: nominalization (27 instances), nouns (160), and Dale-Chall complex words (214). This statistical pattern supports the editorial feedback, indicating that the text is more noun-heavy and uses slightly more uncommon vocabulary than a typical PLS, which can be addressed by converting noun phrases to verbs and simplifying some word choices."
