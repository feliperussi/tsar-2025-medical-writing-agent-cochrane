  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether it is helpful or harmful for family members to be present during a loved one's resuscitation (emergency life-saving procedures).",
    "The available evidence suggests that offering family members the choice to be present may reduce their symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; a condition causing anxiety and flashbacks after a stressful event), but we cannot be certain of this finding.",
    "Larger and better-designed studies are needed to provide more reliable evidence about the effects of this practice on family members, patients, and healthcare staff."

      "subheading": "What is family presence during resuscitation?",
      "content": "When a person has a life‑threatening medical emergency, such as their heart stopping, healthcare professionals perform emergency procedures to try and save their life. This is called resuscitation. Traditionally, family members are asked to wait outside the room. However, some family members may want to stay with their loved one, and some patients may want them there. This practice is known as 'family presence during resuscitation'. It creates a complex situation that affects the patient, their family, and the healthcare team, and the well‑being of all three groups needs to be considered."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out how offering family members the option to be present during resuscitation affects them. The main question was whether being present affects the family members' risk of developing post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental health condition that can occur after a distressing event. We also wanted to know about other effects on the family's mental well‑being, such as anxiety or depression. In addition, we looked at the effects on the patient's chances of survival and recovery, the medical care they received, and the stress levels and attitudes of the healthcare professionals involved."

    {
      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL) and trial registries from inception to the present. The search combined terms related to resuscitation, family presence, and outcomes for patients, relatives, and healthcare staff. No language restrictions were applied."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Eligibility Criteria",
      "content": "We included randomized controlled trials, quasi‑experimental studies, and observational cohort studies that compared outcomes when relatives were offered the choice to be present during a resuscitation versus when they were not. Outcomes of interest were psychological impact on relatives, patient survival or functional status, and staff stress or performance."

    {
      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, participant numbers, interventions, and outcomes. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Results were summarized narratively and, where appropriate, pooled using random‑effects meta‑analysis."

    {
      "subheading": "Confidence in Evidence",
      "content": "The certainty of the evidence was assessed with the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Findings were presented with corresponding confidence ratings (high, moderate, low, or very low)."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 2 trials with a total of 595 participants. The studies took place in France and the UK. The participants were relatives of patients undergoing resuscitation. The studies compared a systematic offer for a relative to witness cardiopulmonary resuscitation against the traditional practice of not offering this option. Due to a lack of reliable evidence, we do not know if offering family members the option to be present during a resuscitation attempt affects their long-term psychological well-being, such as post-traumatic stress, anxiety, or depression. It is also unclear whether family presence has an effect on the duration of the resuscitation attempt or on the stress levels of healthcare professionals."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.",
