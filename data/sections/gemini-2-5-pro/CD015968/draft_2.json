  "draft": "Can technology like apps, websites, or active video games help children and adolescents manage obesity?\n\nKey messages\n- When used alongside usual care, digital technology (such as apps, websites, or active video games) may slightly reduce body fat in children and adolescents in the short term. The effect of using digital technology on its own is unclear. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- Due to the limited number of small, short-term studies, the long-term benefits and potential harms of using these technologies are uncertain. Larger and longer studies are needed to understand the effects better and to check for any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and how can digital technology help?\nObesity in children and teenagers is a major health problem worldwide, affecting millions of young people and increasing their risk of long-term diseases. To help manage this, researchers are exploring the use of digital technology. These 'digital health interventions' can include things like websites, mobile phone apps, text messages, and active video games ('exergaming'). They are often used to support young people in making changes to their diet and physical activity, sometimes alongside usual care from healthcare professionals.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe digital technology is for managing obesity in children and adolescents. We looked at two main comparisons: 1. Digital technology combined with usual care versus usual care alone. 2. Digital technology used on its own versus usual care alone.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using digital health tools for managing obesity in children and adolescents (either alone or with usual care) against usual care alone. We then combined and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review found 15 studies with 911 children and adolescents (aged 0 to 19 years) living with obesity. The studies compared digital technologies (like apps or websites) combined with diet and physical activity advice against usual care alone. Most studies were short, lasting less than six months. The studies took place in several countries, including the USA and Sweden. No studies reported on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor children and adolescents managing obesity, using digital health tools in addition to their usual care probably reduces body fat slightly. It is uncertain if this combination of treatments affects other health outcomes. When digital health tools are used on their own compared to usual care, it is also uncertain if they have an effect on any health outcomes.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and there are not enough studies to be certain about these findings.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to April 2025.",

  "evaluation": [
    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is well-written and meets most plain language guidelines, but it is NOT_APPROVED because of a key factual inaccuracy that oversimplifies the review's findings. Here are the 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the description of the studies.** The summary of what you found misrepresents the study designs, which is a critical factual error.\n- **The problem:** The sentence, 'The studies compared digital technologies (like apps or websites) combined with diet and physical activity advice against usual care alone,' incorrectly implies all 15 studies had the same design. This contradicts the 'What did we want to find out?' section, which correctly states there were two different comparisons.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'The studies were set up in two main ways. Some studies compared digital technology plus usual care against usual care alone. Other studies compared digital technology used on its own against usual care alone.'\n\n2. **Clarify the main results with better structure.** The main results are presented in a single paragraph, which makes it hard to distinguish between the findings for the two different comparisons.\n- **The problem:** The paragraph beginning 'For children and adolescents managing obesity...' combines two separate findings, which could confuse the reader.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** Use bullet points to clearly separate the findings:\n  '- When digital tools were used *in addition* to usual care, they probably reduce body fat slightly. It is uncertain if this combination affects other health outcomes.\n  - When digital tools were used *on their own* compared to usual care, it is uncertain if they affect any health outcomes.'\n\n3. **Make the limitations statement more direct.** The explanation of the evidence reliability is slightly clunky.\n- **The problem:** The phrase 'there are not enough studies to be certain about these findings' is a bit weak and indirect.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is moderate. The findings are uncertain because the review included only a few small studies.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 94.4% of all metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. Metrics such as words per sentence (15.44), passive voice instances (9), and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (9.87) are excellent. This indicates a strong foundation in plain language writing. The required edits focus on factual precision and structural clarity—nuances not fully captured by statistical metrics."
