  "key_messages": [
    "When used alongside usual care, digital technology (such as apps, websites, or active video games) may slightly reduce body fat in children and adolescents in the short term. The effect of using digital technology on its own is unclear. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.",
    "Due to the limited number of small, short-term studies, the long-term benefits and potential harms of using these technologies are uncertain. Larger and longer studies are needed to understand the effects better and to check for any unwanted effects."

      "subheading": "What is childhood obesity and how can digital technology help?",
      "content": "Obesity in children and teenagers is a major health problem worldwide, affecting millions of young people and increasing their risk of long-term diseases. To help manage this, researchers are exploring the use of digital technology. These 'digital health interventions' can include things like websites, mobile phone apps, text messages, and active video games ('exergaming'). They are often used to support young people in making changes to their diet and physical activity, sometimes alongside usual care from healthcare professionals."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out how effective and safe digital technology is for managing obesity in children and adolescents. We looked at two main comparisons: 1. Digital technology combined with usual care versus usual care alone. 2. Digital technology used on its own versus usual care alone."

      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared using digital health tools for managing obesity in children and adolescents (either alone or with conventional care) against conventional care alone. We then combined and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review found 15 studies with 911 children and adolescents (aged 0 to 19 years) living with obesity. The studies compared digital technologies (like apps or websites) combined with diet and physical activity advice against conventional care alone. Most studies were short, lasting less than six months. The studies took place in several countries, including the USA and Sweden. No studies reported on any unwanted or harmful effects."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Digital health tools for children and adolescents with obesity",
      "content": "For children and adolescents managing obesity, using digital health tools in addition to their usual care probably reduces body fat slightly. It is uncertain if this combination of treatments affects other health outcomes. When digital health tools are used on their own compared to usual care, it is also uncertain if they have an effect on any health outcomes."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.",
