  "draft": "Can technology like apps, websites, or active video games help children and adolescents manage obesity?\n\nKey messages\n- When used alongside usual care, digital technology (such as apps, websites, or active video games) may slightly reduce body fat in children and adolescents in the short term. The effect of using digital technology on its own is unclear. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- Due to the limited number of small, short-term studies, the long-term benefits and potential harms of using these technologies are uncertain. Larger and longer studies are needed to understand the effects better and to check for any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is this review about?\nWhat is childhood obesity and how can digital technology help?\nObesity in children and teenagers is a major health problem worldwide, affecting millions of young people and increasing their risk of long-term diseases. To help manage this, researchers are exploring the use of digital technology. These 'digital health interventions' can include things like websites, mobile phone apps, text messages, and active video games ('exergaming'). They are often used to support young people in making changes to their diet and physical activity, sometimes alongside usual care from healthcare professionals.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe digital technology is for managing obesity in children and adolescents. We looked at two main comparisons: 1. Digital technology combined with usual care versus usual care alone. 2. Digital technology used on its own versus usual care alone.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using digital health tools for managing obesity in children and adolescents (either alone or with conventional care) against conventional care alone. We then combined and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review found 15 studies with 911 children and adolescents (aged 0 to 19 years) living with obesity. The studies compared digital technologies (like apps or websites) combined with diet and physical activity advice against conventional care alone. Most studies were short, lasting less than six months. The studies took place in several countries, including the USA and Sweden. No studies reported on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nMain results: Digital health tools for children and adolescents with obesity\nFor children and adolescents managing obesity, using digital health tools in addition to their usual care probably reduces body fat slightly. It is uncertain if this combination of treatments affects other health outcomes. When digital health tools are used on their own compared to usual care, it is also uncertain if they have an effect on any health outcomes.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025 of search.",

There are also a few minor phrasing issues that could be improved for clarity. Please address the following points:\n\n1. **Subheading Format:** One subheading is not phrased as a question, which is required by the style guide to help guide readers.\n   - **Current text:** \"Main results: Digital health tools for children and adolescents with obesity\"\n   - **Problem:** This is a statement, not a question.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"What were the main results?\"\n\n2. **Inconsistent Terminology:** The summary uses two different terms for the same concept, which could confuse readers.\n   - **Current text:** The text alternates between \"usual care\" (in Key Messages) and \"conventional care\" (in the 'What did we do?' section).\n   - **Problem:** Using one term consistently improves readability.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Replace all instances of \"conventional care\" with \"usual care\" for consistency.\n\n3. **Awkward Phrasing in Currency Statement:** The date statement is phrased in a way that is unnatural for a lay audience.\n   - **Current text:** \"The evidence is up to date to April 2025 of search.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"of search\" is jargon and unclear.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is current to April 2025.\" or \"We searched for studies up to April 2025.\"\n\n4. **Redundant Wording in Limitations:** The explanation of the evidence limitations is slightly repetitive.\n   - **Current text:** \"...there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"results of our outcomes\" is redundant. The outcomes are the results.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...there are not enough studies to be certain about these findings.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 94.4% of metrics fall within the best quartile, indicating excellent readability, simple sentence structures (words_per_sentence in P25), and strong use of active voice (active_voice in P75). The text provides a strong linguistic foundation that will be further improved by addressing the specific editorial points in the feedback."
