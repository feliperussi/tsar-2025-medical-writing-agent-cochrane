  "draft": "Can technology like apps, websites, or active video games help children and adolescents manage obesity?\n\nKey messages\n- When used alongside usual care, digital technology (such as apps, websites, or active video games) may slightly reduce body fat in children and adolescents in the short term. The effect of using digital technology on its own is unclear. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- Due to the limited number of small, short-term studies, the long-term benefits and potential harms of using these technologies are uncertain. Larger and longer studies are needed to understand the effects better and to check for any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and how can digital technology help?\nObesity in children and teenagers is a major health problem worldwide, affecting millions of young people and increasing their risk of long-term diseases. To help manage this, researchers are exploring the use of digital technology. These 'digital health interventions' can include things like websites, mobile phone apps, text messages, and active video games ('exergaming'). They are often used to support young people in making changes to their diet and physical activity, sometimes alongside usual care from healthcare professionals.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe digital technology is for managing obesity in children and adolescents. We looked at two main comparisons: 1. Digital technology combined with usual care versus usual care alone. 2. Digital technology used on its own versus usual care alone.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using digital health tools for managing obesity in children and adolescents (either alone or with usual care) against usual care alone. We then combined and summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review found 15 studies with 911 children and adolescents (aged 0 to 19 years) living with obesity. The studies were set up in two main ways. Some studies compared digital technology plus usual care against usual care alone. Other studies compared digital technology used on its own against usual care alone. Most studies were short, lasting less than 6 months. The studies took place in several countries, including the USA and Sweden. No studies reported on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n- When digital tools were used in addition to usual care, they probably reduce body fat slightly. It is uncertain if this combination affects other health outcomes.\n- When digital tools were used on their own compared to usual care, it is uncertain if they affect any health outcomes.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. The findings are uncertain because the review included only a few small studies.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to April 2025.",
