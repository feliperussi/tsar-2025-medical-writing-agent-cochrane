  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether taking colchicine (a medicine that reduces inflammation) helps to prevent heart attacks and strokes in people who have not had them before. The evidence suggests it may increase the risk of diarrhoea.",
    "The studies included in this review were not reliable enough to provide a clear answer, and many focused on people with other health conditions. Larger, well-designed studies are needed to understand the true benefits and harms of colchicine for preventing heart problems in the general population."

      "subheading": "What is cardiovascular disease and how might colchicine help?",
      "content": "Cardiovascular diseases, which affect the heart and blood vessels, are a leading cause of death and illness around the world. One common type is caused by atherosclerosis, a condition where fatty deposits build up in the walls of arteries. This process is often worsened by long-term inflammation. Colchicine is an inexpensive drug that has been used for centuries to reduce inflammation. Because of this property, researchers believe it might help prevent cardiovascular diseases before they start, which is known as 'primary prevention'."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out what the benefits and harms of using colchicine are for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in the general population (people without existing cardiovascular disease). We were interested in whether colchicine could prevent deaths, heart attacks, and strokes, and if it was associated with any unwanted effects."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared colchicine against a placebo (a dummy pill), other drugs, or usual care for preventing heart problems in people without existing heart disease. We then collected and combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 15 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1721 participants. The participants were adults without pre-existing cardiovascular disease; however, many of the included trials focused on individuals with liver disease. The studies compared oral colchicine against a placebo, immunomodulating drugs, or usual care/no treatment. For people without known cardiovascular disease, the effects of taking colchicine to prevent heart problems are very uncertain because the available research is not strong enough to draw clear conclusions. When compared to a placebo or usual care, colchicine may have little to no effect on the risk of death, heart attack, or stroke. It may, however, increase the chance of having diarrhoea. The review authors are very uncertain about all these results."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Furthermore, the evidence focused on specific groups of people, such as those with liver disease, whereas the question we wanted to answer was broader, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search."
