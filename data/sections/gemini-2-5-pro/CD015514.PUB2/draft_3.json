  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of lying face-down after surgery for a detached retina?\n\nKey messages\n- For people who have had surgery for a detached retina, the evidence about the benefits and harms of lying face-down is very uncertain. This position may reduce the risk of the retina shifting from its correct position, developing wrinkles, or of seeing double. However, it may also increase the pressure inside the eye.\n- Better and larger studies are needed to provide more certain evidence about the effects of different positions after this type of eye surgery. Future research should also look at how positioning affects people's quality of life.\n\nWhat is a detached retina and how is it treated?\nA detached retina is a serious eye problem where the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye (the retina) pulls away from its normal position. When this involves the central part of the retina (the macula), it is a medical emergency that can cause severe vision loss. A common treatment is a type of surgery (called a vitrectomy) where a gas bubble is placed in the eye to push the retina back into place so it can heal. After surgery, some eye doctors recommend that people hold their head in a face-down position. The theory is that this helps the gas bubble press on the correct part of the retina, preventing the retina from healing in the wrong spot (called retinal displacement). Retinal displacement can cause distorted vision (where straight lines look wavy) and double vision.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if positioning your head face-down after surgery for a detached retina reduces the risk of the retina becoming displaced.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that compared face-down positioning with other positions after surgery for a detached retina. We then combined and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 3 randomized controlled trials with 368 participants who had surgery for a detached retina involving the macula (the central part of the retina). The studies compared different positioning strategies after surgery, such as positioning face-down versus 'support-the-break' positioning (a different head position designed to help the tear in the retina heal).\n\nAfter surgery, positioning face-down immediately may reduce the chance of the retina moving out of place, developing folds, or causing double vision when compared to 'support-the-break' positioning. However, it may also increase the chance of high pressure inside the eye. Positioning face-down may have little to no effect on vision, visual distortion, or quality of life. We are very uncertain about all these results.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small and there are not enough of them to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

Some sentences, while technically correct, could be simpler and more direct for a lay audience.\n    *   **Example:** 'We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that compared face-down positioning with other positions after surgery for a detached retina.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this into shorter sentences with simpler words, like: 'We looked for specific studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are assigned to a treatment group by chance. The studies we found compared lying face-down with other positions after surgery for a detached retina.'\n\n2. **feedback**\n\n3. **Refine phrasing for key information.** Some statements could be phrased more directly.\n    *   **Example:** 'This evidence is up to date to November 2022.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** A more active and common phrasing would be: 'This review includes evidence published up to November 2022.' or 'We searched for studies up to November 2022.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows this draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 89% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and structure. However, the analysis flags a high number of complex words (words with 3+ syllables), which is in the 90th percentile compared to other summaries. This suggests that while sentence length is good, the vocabulary could be simplified to further improve clarity for a lay audience."
