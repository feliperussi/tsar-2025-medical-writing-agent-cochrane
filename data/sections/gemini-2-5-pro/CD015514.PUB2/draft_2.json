  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of lying face-down after surgery for a detached retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people who have had surgery for a detached retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye), the evidence about the benefits and harms of lying face-down is very uncertain. This position may reduce the risk of the retina shifting from its correct position, developing wrinkles, or of seeing double. However, it may also increase the pressure inside the eye.\n- Better and larger studies are needed to provide more certain evidence about the effects of different positions after this type of eye surgery. Future research should also look at how positioning affects people's quality of life.\n\nWhat is a detached retina and how is it treated?\nA detached retina is a serious eye problem where the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye (the retina) pulls away from its normal position. When this involves the central part of the retina (the macula), it is a medical emergency that can cause severe vision loss. A common treatment is a type of surgery (called a vitrectomy) where a gas bubble is placed in the eye to push the retina back into place so it can heal. After surgery, some eye doctors recommend that people hold their head in a face-down position. The theory is that this helps the gas bubble press on the correct part of the retina, preventing it from reattaching in a slightly shifted position (retinal displacement). Retinal displacement can cause distorted vision (where straight lines look wavy) and double vision.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if positioning your head face-down after surgery for a detached retina reduces the risk of the retina becoming displaced.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that compared face-down positioning with other positions after surgery for a detached retina. We then combined and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 3 randomized controlled trials with 368 participants who had surgery for a detached retina involving the macula (the central part of the retina). The studies compared different positioning strategies after surgery, such as positioning face-down versus other positions intended to support the tear in the retina.\n\nAfter surgery, positioning face-down immediately may reduce the chance of the retina moving out of place, developing folds, or causing double vision when compared to other positions intended to support the tear in the retina. However, it may also increase the chance of high pressure inside the eye. Positioning face-down may have little to no effect on vision, visual distortion, or quality of life. We are very uncertain about all these results.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small and there are not enough of them to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and factually accurate. The readability scores are excellent. To make it even better for patients, here are three improvements focusing on simplifying technical concepts and removing repetition.\n\n1. **Remove repeated definitions.**\n   - **Quote:** \"For people who have had surgery for a detached retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye)...\"\n   - **Problem:** The definition of \"retina\" is repeated in the title, the first key message, and the introduction. This is distracting for the reader. It's best to define a term once where it makes the most sense.\n   - **Suggestion:** Keep the excellent definition in the 'What is a detached retina...?' section and remove the parenthetical definitions from the main title and the first key message.\n\n2. **Clarify the comparison treatment.**\n   - **Quote:** \"...when compared to other positions intended to support the tear in the retina.\"\n   - **Problem:** This phrase is vague and uses technical language. A reader won't understand what this alternative position is or why it's being compared to lying face-down. The source material uses a specific name for this.\n   - **Suggestion:** Use the specific term from the review and provide a simple explanation. For example, in the 'What did we find?' section, change the sentence to: \"...when compared to 'support-the-break' positioning (a different head position designed to help the tear in the retina heal).\"\n\n3. **Simplify complex phrasing.**\n   - **Quote:** \"The theory is that this helps the gas bubble press on the correct part of the retina, preventing it from reattaching in a slightly shifted position (retinal displacement).\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"reattaching in a slightly shifted position\" is a bit wordy and abstract.\n   - **Suggestion:** Use simpler, more direct language that clearly explains the concept. For example: \"...preventing the retina from healing in the wrong spot (called retinal displacement).\"\n\nThese changes will help address the vocabulary complexity highlighted by the evaluation metrics and make the summary even more accessible to a lay audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 83% of metrics in the best quartile for readability. Sentence length and structure are excellent. However, the summary deviates from typical patterns on vocabulary complexity, with the SMOG Index and complex word count in the 90th percentile. This indicates that while the text is structurally simple, the word choice could be simplified further to improve reader understanding."
