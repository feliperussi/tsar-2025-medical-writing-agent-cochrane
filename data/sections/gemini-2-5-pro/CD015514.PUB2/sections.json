  "key_messages": [
    "For people who have had surgery for a detached retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye), the evidence about the benefits and harms of lying face-down is very uncertain. This position may reduce the risk of the retina shifting from its correct position, developing wrinkles, or of seeing double. However, it may also increase the pressure inside the eye.",
    "Better and larger studies are needed to provide more certain evidence about the effects of different positions after this type of eye surgery. Future research should also look at how positioning affects people's quality of life."

      "subheading": "What is a detached retina and how is it treated?",
      "content": "A detached retina is a serious eye problem where the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye (the retina) pulls away from its normal position. When this involves the central part of the retina (the macula), it is a medical emergency that can cause severe vision loss. A common treatment is a type of surgery (called a vitrectomy) where a gas bubble is placed in the eye to push the retina back into place so it can heal. After surgery, some eye doctors recommend that people hold their head in a face-down position. The theory is that this helps the gas bubble press on the correct part of the retina, preventing it from reattaching in a slightly shifted position (retinal displacement). Retinal displacement can cause distorted vision (where straight lines look wavy) and double vision."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that compared face-down positioning with other positions after surgery for a detached retina. We then combined and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included three randomized controlled trials with 368 participants who had surgery for a detached retina involving the macula (the central part of the retina). The studies compared different positioning strategies after surgery, such as positioning face-down versus 'support-the-break' positioning.\n\nAfter surgery, positioning face-down immediately may reduce the chance of the retina moving out of place, developing folds, or causing double vision when compared to a 'support-the-break' position. However, it may also increase the chance of high pressure inside the eye. Positioning face-down may have little to no effect on vision, visual distortion, or quality of life. We are very uncertain about all these results."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small and there are not enough of them to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to November 2022 of search."
