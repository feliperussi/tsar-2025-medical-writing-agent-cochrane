  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of lying face-down after surgery for a detached retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people who have had surgery for a detached retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye), the evidence about the benefits and harms of lying face-down is very uncertain. This position may reduce the risk of the retina shifting from its correct position, developing wrinkles, or of seeing double. However, it may also increase the pressure inside the eye.\n- Better and larger studies are needed to provide more certain evidence about the effects of different positions after this type of eye surgery. Future research should also look at how positioning affects people's quality of life.\n\nWhat is a detached retina and how is it treated?\nA detached retina is a serious eye problem where the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye (the retina) pulls away from its normal position. When this involves the central part of the retina (the macula), it is a medical emergency that can cause severe vision loss. A common treatment is a type of surgery (called a vitrectomy) where a gas bubble is placed in the eye to push the retina back into place so it can heal. After surgery, some eye doctors recommend that people hold their head in a face-down position. The theory is that this helps the gas bubble press on the correct part of the retina, preventing it from reattaching in a slightly shifted position (retinal displacement). Retinal displacement can cause distorted vision (where straight lines look wavy) and double vision.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if positioning your head face-down after surgery for a detached retina reduces the risk of the retina becoming displaced.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups) that compared face-down positioning with other positions after surgery for a detached retina. We then combined and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included three randomized controlled trials with 368 participants who had surgery for a detached retina involving the macula (the central part of the retina). The studies compared different positioning strategies after surgery, such as positioning face-down versus 'support-the-break' positioning.\n\nAfter surgery, positioning face-down immediately may reduce the chance of the retina moving out of place, developing folds, or causing double vision when compared to a 'support-the-break' position. However, it may also increase the chance of high pressure inside the eye. Positioning face-down may have little to no effect on vision, visual distortion, or quality of life. We are very uncertain about all these results.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small and there are not enough of them to be certain about the results.\n\nDate of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022 of search.",

Additionally, there are a few key areas that need improvement to enhance clarity for the reader.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions.**\n   - **Issue:** The subheadings 'Methods', 'Limitations of the evidence', and 'Date of the evidence' do not comply with the style guide rule to phrase subheadings as questions.\n   - **Suggestion:** Please change them to be more engaging and consistent with the other headings.\n     - Change 'Methods' to 'What did we do?'\n     - Change 'Limitations of the evidence' to 'How reliable is the evidence?'\n     - Change 'Date of the evidence' to 'How up-to-date is this evidence?'\n\n2. **Explain or replace technical jargon.**\n   - **Issue:** The term 'support-the-break' positioning is introduced without any explanation, which will be meaningless to a lay reader.\n   - **Quote:** \"...when compared to a 'support-the-break' position.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace this term with a simpler description. For example: \"...when compared to other positions recommended by doctors to support the tear in the retina.\"\n\n3. **Improve conciseness and phrasing.**\n   - **Issue:** The final sentence is phrased awkwardly and is unnecessarily wordy.\n   - **Quote:** \"The evidence is up to date to November 2022 of search.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Please simplify this for better flow. A better version would be: \"This evidence is up to date to November 2022.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. All 18 metrics fall within acceptable ranges, with nearly 90% of features scoring in the best quartile for readability and clarity (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade at P25). This indicates the text is generally easy to read, with good sentence structure and vocabulary choices. The required revisions are related to style guide adherence and clarity of specific terms, which are nuances not fully captured by the metrics."
