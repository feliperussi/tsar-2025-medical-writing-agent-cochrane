  "draft": "What is the best way to provide nutrition for adults after a Whipple surgery?\n\nKey messages\nFor adults who have a Whipple surgery, feeding through a tube placed into the small intestine during the operation (jejunostomy feeding) likely helps them leave the hospital sooner compared to feeding through a vein (parenteral nutrition). We are uncertain if the way a person is fed affects their risk of problems after surgery.\nBecause the evidence is limited and uncertain, more research is needed to find the best way to feed patients after this surgery and to understand the effects on their recovery and risk of complications.\n\nWhat is a Whipple procedure and why is nutrition important afterwards?\nA Whipple procedure (also known as a pancreaticoduodenectomy) is a major operation to remove the head of the pancreas. Doctors perform this surgery most often to treat cancer. The surgery changes how the body digests food. This can make it hard for people to get enough nutrients. Poor nutrition (malnutrition) can slow how a person gets better and increase their risk of problems.\nTo prevent this, patients receive nutritional support in several ways:\n– Oral feeding: eating and drinking normally.\n– Enteral feeding: receiving liquid food through a tube that goes into the stomach or intestine. This can be a tube placed into the small intestine during surgery (jejunostomy feeding) or a tube passed through the nose into the intestine (nasojejunal feeding).\n– Parenteral nutrition: receiving liquid nutrients directly into a vein.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how different ways of feeding affect how adults get better and their risk of problems after a Whipple procedure.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of feeding adults after a Whipple procedure. We compared and summarized the results of these studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 studies with 1897 adults who had a Whipple procedure. The studies compared different ways of providing nutrition after the operation, including enteral feeding, parenteral nutrition, and normal oral feeding. We do not know how long the studies lasted, who funded them, or where they were conducted.\n\nWhat did the studies find?\n\nFeeding through a tube into the intestine versus feeding through a vein\n– Feeding through a tube placed in the intestine during surgery (jejunostomy feeding) likely helps a person leave the hospital slightly sooner compared to feeding through a vein. This type of feeding may make little to no difference to the risk of some problems after surgery, but the evidence for other problems is very uncertain.\n– Feeding through a tube that goes through the nose into the intestine (nasojejunal feeding) may slightly increase the risk of fluid leaking from the pancreas compared to feeding through a vein. It may make little to no difference in how long they stay in the hospital or their risk of other problems, but these findings are very uncertain.\n\nFeeding through a tube into the intestine versus eating normally\n– Compared to eating normally, feeding through a tube in the intestine may have little to no effect on how long they stay in the hospital or their risk of problems. However, our confidence in these results is very low.\n\nIt is unclear if the type of feeding after surgery affects the risk of death. The evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies fed people in different ways, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

However, a few improvements can make the text more direct and easier for readers to understand. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\\n\\n1. **Use stronger, more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** The text sometimes uses noun-heavy phrases where a simple verb would be clearer. This is reflected in the high 'nominalization' score.\\n   - **Original sentence:** \\\"Poor nutrition (malnutrition) can slow how a person gets better and increase their risk of problems.\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \\\"slow how a person gets better\\\" is indirect. Using a direct verb makes the sentence punchier and easier to read.\\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \\\"Poor nutrition (malnutrition) can slow recovery and increase the risk of problems.\\\"\\n\\n2. **Avoid vague language when describing results.** While the evidence is uncertain, using overly vague terms can leave the reader confused about what was actually studied.\\n   - **Original sentence:** \\\"This type of feeding may make little to no difference to the risk of some problems after surgery, but the evidence for other problems is very uncertain.\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \\\"some problems... other problems\\\" is imprecise. Briefly mentioning the types of problems assessed provides more value to the reader without adding too much complexity.\\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \\\"This type of feeding may make little to no difference to the risk of certain problems, like fluid leaks from the pancreas or bleeding after surgery, but the evidence is very uncertain.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Make definitions easier to scan.** The definitions for different feeding types are good, but breaking them down with sub-bullets can make them easier to digest, especially for complex terms.\\n   - **Original text:** \\\"– Enteral feeding: receiving liquid food through a tube that goes into the stomach or intestine. This can be a tube placed into the small intestine during surgery (jejunostomy feeding) or a tube passed through the nose into the intestine (nasojejunal feeding).\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This format combines the main definition with two sub-types in a single paragraph, which can be dense for readers.\\n   - **Suggested rewrite:**\\n     \\\"– **Enteral feeding:** receiving liquid food through a tube into the stomach or intestine. The two types mentioned in this review are:\\n       - **Jejunostomy feeding:** a tube placed into the small intestine during surgery.\\n       - **Nasojejunal feeding:** a tube passed through the nose into the intestine.\\\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates significantly in three areas related to vocabulary complexity: nominalization (use of noun forms instead of verbs), complex words from the Dale-Chall list, and long words. These metrics support the editorial feedback, suggesting the text could be made more direct and easier to understand by using more active verbs and simplifying phrasing."
