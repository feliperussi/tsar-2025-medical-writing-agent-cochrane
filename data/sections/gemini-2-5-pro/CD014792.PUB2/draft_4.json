  "draft": "What is the best way to provide nutrition for adults after a Whipple surgery?\n\nKey messages\nFor adults who have a Whipple surgery, feeding through a tube placed into the small intestine during the operation (jejunostomy feeding) may help them leave the hospital sooner compared to feeding through a vein (parenteral nutrition). We are uncertain if the way a person is fed affects their risk of problems after surgery.\nBecause the evidence is limited and uncertain, more research is needed to find the best way to feed patients after this surgery. This will help us learn more about how patients get better and what problems they might have.\n\nWhat is a Whipple procedure and why is nutrition important afterwards?\nA Whipple procedure (also known as a pancreaticoduodenectomy) is a major operation to remove the head of the pancreas. Doctors perform this surgery most often to treat cancer. The surgery changes how the body digests food. This can make it hard for people to get enough nutrients. Poor nutrition (malnutrition) can slow how a person gets better and increase their risk of problems.\nTo prevent this, patients receive nutritional support in several ways:\n– Oral feeding: eating and drinking normally.\n– Enteral feeding: receiving liquid food through a tube that goes into the stomach or intestine. This can be a tube placed into the small intestine during surgery (jejunostomy feeding) or a tube passed through the nose into the intestine (nasojejunal feeding).\n– Parenteral nutrition: receiving liquid nutrients directly into a vein.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how different ways of feeding affect how adults get better and their risk of problems after a Whipple procedure.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of feeding adults after a Whipple procedure. We compared and summarized the results of these studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 studies with 1897 adults who had a Whipple procedure. The studies compared different ways of providing nutrition after the operation, including enteral feeding, parenteral nutrition, and normal oral feeding. We do not know how long the studies lasted, who funded them, or where they were conducted.\n\nWhat did the studies find?\n\nFeeding through a tube into the intestine versus feeding through a vein\n– Feeding through a tube placed in the intestine during surgery (jejunostomy feeding) likely helps a person leave the hospital slightly sooner compared to feeding through a vein. This type of feeding may make little to no difference to the risk of some problems after surgery, but we are very uncertain about the results for other problems.\n– Feeding through a tube that goes through the nose into the intestine (nasojejunal feeding) may slightly increase the risk of fluid leaking from the pancreas compared to feeding through a vein. It may make little to no difference in how long they stay in the hospital or their risk of other problems, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nFeeding through a tube into the intestine versus eating normally\n– Compared to eating normally, feeding through a tube in the intestine may have little to no effect on how long they stay in the hospital or their risk of problems. However, we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nIt is unclear if the type of feeding after surgery affects the risk of death. The evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies fed people in different ways, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and factually accurate. All critical checks have passed. However, a few minor revisions are needed to ensure the key messages are perfectly consistent and the language is as concise as possible for the reader.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Make the Key Message Consistent with the Main Results**\n\nThe certainty of the main finding is described differently in the Key Messages and the Results section. This could confuse a reader.\n\n- **Problematic Sentences:**\n  - *Key Message:* \"...jejunostomy feeding) **may help** them leave the hospital sooner...\"\n  - *Results Section:* \"...jejunostomy feeding) **likely helps** a person leave the hospital slightly sooner...\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** The term 'likely' corresponds to moderate-certainty evidence, which is a stronger finding than 'may'. The Key Message should reflect the strongest, most certain finding from the review accurately.\n- **Suggested Rewrite (in Key Messages):**\n  - \"For adults who have a Whipple surgery, feeding through a tube placed into the small intestine during the operation (jejunostomy feeding) **likely helps them leave the hospital sooner** compared to feeding through a vein (parenteral nutrition).\"\n\n**2. Replace Vague Language with More Specific Information**\n\nThe final sentence of the Key Messages section is a bit generic and could be more informative and concise.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:**\n  - \"This will help us learn more about how patients get better and what problems they might have.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This is a general statement about all research. We can be more specific about what this review concluded is needed, making the summary more impactful.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:**\n  - \"More research is needed to find the best way to feed patients after this surgery and to understand the effects on their recovery and risk of complications.\"\n\n**3. Reduce Repetitive Phrasing about Uncertainty**\n\nThe phrase \"we are very uncertain about the results\" is used multiple times in the results section. While accurate, the repetition can make the text feel hesitant and cumbersome.\n\n- **Problematic Phrases:**\n  - \"...but we are very uncertain about the results for other problems.\"\n  - \"...but we are very uncertain about these results.\"\n  - \"However, we are very uncertain about these results.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** Repeating the exact same phrase can tire the reader. Varying the language will improve flow while maintaining the crucial message about the low certainty of the evidence.\n- **Suggested Rewrite (example for one instance):**\n  - Instead of: \"It may make little to no difference in how long they stay in the hospital or their risk of other problems, but we are very uncertain about these results.\"\n  - Try: \"It may make little to no difference in how long they stay in the hospital or their risk of other problems, but **these findings are very uncertain**.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nThe analysis confirms this is a high-quality draft, with most readability scores falling in the best quartile. The metrics for `complex_words_dc` (224.0) and `long_words` (191.0) are slightly higher than typical, which supports the recommendations to refine word choices for maximum clarity and conciseness.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, it deviates from typical patterns on three vocabulary metrics: nominalization (22.0), Dale-Chall complex words (224.0), and long words (191.0). These suggest that while generally clear, the text could be improved by simplifying some word choices and sentence structures."
