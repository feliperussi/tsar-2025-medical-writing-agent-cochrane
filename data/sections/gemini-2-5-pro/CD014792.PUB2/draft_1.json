  "draft": "How to Ensure Proper Nutrition After a Whipple Surgery for Adults\n\nKey messages\nFor adults recovering from Whipple surgery, providing nutrition through a tube placed into the small intestine during the operation (jejunostomy feeding) likely shortens the time spent in the hospital compared to feeding through a vein (parenteral nutrition). The evidence was unclear about whether the type of feeding affects the risk of complications after surgery.\nDue to the limited and uncertain evidence, more high-quality research is needed to determine the best way to provide nutritional support after Whipple surgery and to better understand the effects on patient recovery and complications.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is a pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is nutrition important afterwards?\nA pancreaticoduodenectomy (also known as a Whipple procedure) is a major operation to remove the head of the pancreas. It is most often performed to treat cancer. Because this surgery changes the digestive system, it can be difficult for people to get enough nutrition afterwards. Poor nutrition (malnutrition) can slow down recovery and increase the risk of complications. To prevent this, patients are given nutritional support in several ways. They may eat and drink normally (oral feeding), be given liquid food through a tube that goes directly into the intestine (enteral feeding), or be given liquid nutrients directly into a vein (parenteral nutrition).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how these different ways of feeding patients after a pancreaticoduodenectomy affect their recovery and their risk of complications.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of feeding adults after surgery to remove the head of the pancreas. We then compared and summarized the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 studies that included 1897 adults who had surgery on their pancreas (pancreaticoduodenectomy). The studies looked at different ways of providing nutrition after the operation, including feeding through a tube into the intestine (enteral feeding), feeding directly into a vein (total parenteral nutrition), and normal eating and drinking (oral intake). We do not know how long the studies lasted, who funded them, or in which countries they were conducted.\n\nMain results: How people are fed after surgery\nTube feeding into the intestine versus feeding through a vein\nFeeding through a tube placed directly into the small intestine probably reduces the length of a person's hospital stay slightly compared to feeding through a vein. This type of tube feeding may make little to no difference to the risk of complications like fluid leakage from the pancreas, but for other complications, we are very uncertain about the results.\nFeeding through a tube that goes from the nose to the intestine may slightly increase the risk of fluid leakage from the pancreas compared to feeding through a vein. It may make little to no difference to the length of hospital stay or other complications, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nTube feeding into the intestine versus eating normally\nCompared to eating normally, feeding through a tube in the small intestine may have little to no effect on the length of hospital stay or the risk of complications, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nIt is unclear if the type of feeding after surgery has an effect on the risk of death, as the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies used different ways of delivering the nutritional support, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nEvidence currency\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs some revisions to meet Cochrane standards and improve clarity for readers. The main issues are that several subheadings are not phrased as questions, some sentences are too long and complex, and the language could be more direct.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase subheadings as questions:** Several subheadings do not follow the required question format, which helps guide the reader.\n    *   **Problem:** \"Methods\", \"Main results: How people are fed after surgery\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", and \"Evidence currency\".\n    *   **Suggestion:** Change these to questions, such as \"How did we conduct this review?\", \"What were the main results?\", \"What are the evidence?\", and \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n2.  **Shorten long sentences:** Some sentences are very long, making them difficult for readers to follow. The analysis shows an average sentence length of over 25 words, which is higher than typical for a PLS.\n    *   **Problem:** \"Due to the limited and uncertain evidence, more high-quality research is needed to determine the best way to provide nutritional support after Whipple surgery and to better understand the effects on patient recovery and complications.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this into shorter sentences. For example: \"The evidence was limited and uncertain. We need more high-quality research to find the best way to provide nutrition after Whipple surgery. This will help us better understand the effects on patient recovery and complications.\"\n\n3.  **Use more direct, active language:** The text sometimes uses noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations) where a simple verb would be clearer and more direct.\n    *   **Problem:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies used different ways of delivering the nutritional support...\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Replace the noun phrase with a verb. For example: \"We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies provided nutrition in different ways...\"\n\n4.  **Clarify and simplify terminology for feeding types:** The text introduces different types of feeding but then describes them in long phrases throughout the results, which can be confusing.\n    *   **Problem:** The results repeatedly use long descriptions like \"Feeding through a tube placed directly into the small intestine\" and \"Feeding through a tube that goes from the nose to the intestine\".\n    *   **Suggestion:** Define the different types of enteral feeding clearly in the introduction (e.g., jejunostomy and nasojejunal tubes). Then, use these shorter, consistent terms in the results section to make the comparisons easier to follow.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 50% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, there are significant deviations in key areas that impact readability. The average sentence length ('words_per_sentence' at 25.3) is high, supporting the need to shorten complex sentences. The text is also dense with nouns and nominalizations ('nouns' and 'nominalization' metrics are in the P90 range), indicating that using more direct verbs would improve the clarity. Finally, high scores for 'long_words' and 'complex_words_dc' suggest that simplifying vocabulary where possible would make the text more accessible."
