  "draft": "How to Ensure Proper Nutrition After a Whipple Surgery for Adults\n\nKey messages\nAfter a Whipple surgery, adults may spend less time in the hospital if they are fed through a tube placed into the small intestine during the operation (jejunostomy feeding). This is compared to being fed through a vein (parenteral nutrition). We are uncertain if the type of feeding affects the risk of complications after surgery.\nThe evidence is limited and uncertain. More high-quality research is needed to find the best way to provide nutrition after this surgery. This will help us better understand the effects on patient recovery and complications.\n\nWhat is a Whipple procedure and why is nutrition important afterwards?\nA pancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a major operation to remove the head of the pancreas. Doctors perform this surgery most often to treat cancer. The surgery changes the digestive system, which can make it hard for people to get enough nutrition. Poor nutrition (malnutrition) can slow recovery and increase the risk of complications.\nTo prevent this, patients receive nutritional support in several ways:\n- Oral feeding: eating and drinking normally.\n- Enteral feeding: receiving liquid food through a tube that goes into the stomach or intestine. This can be done with a tube placed into the small intestine during surgery (jejunostomy feeding) or a tube passed through the nose into the intestine (nasojejunal feeding).\n- Parenteral nutrition: receiving liquid nutrients directly into a vein.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how different ways of feeding affect recovery and the risk of complications for adults after a Whipple procedure.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of feeding adults after a Whipple procedure. We compared and summarized the results of these studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 studies with 1897 adults who had a Whipple procedure. The studies compared different ways of providing nutrition after the operation, including enteral feeding, parenteral nutrition, and normal oral feeding. We do not know how long the studies lasted, who funded them, or where they were conducted.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nWe looked at 3 main comparisons.\n\nEnteral feeding versus parenteral nutrition\n- Jejunostomy feeding (tube placed in the intestine during surgery) likely reduces a person's hospital stay slightly compared to parenteral nutrition. This type of feeding may make little to no difference to the risk of some complications, but we are very uncertain about the results for other complications.\n- Nasojejunal feeding (tube through the nose) may slightly increase the risk of fluid leakage from the pancreas compared to parenteral nutrition. It may make little to no difference to the length of hospital stay or other complications, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nEnteral feeding versus eating normally\n- Compared to eating normally, jejunostomy feeding may have little to no effect on the length of hospital stay or the risk of complications. However, we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nIt is unclear if the type of feeding after surgery affects the risk of death. The evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies provided nutrition in different ways, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs a few revisions to meet our style guidelines and improve clarity for readers. The main issues are that the title and one subheading are not phrased as questions, and the text relies too heavily on complex noun forms instead of simple verbs.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase the title and a key subheading as questions.**\nThe Cochrane style guide requires the main title and all subheadings to be questions to better engage the reader.\n- **Original Title:** \"How to Ensure Proper Nutrition After a Whipple Surgery for Adults\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What is the best way to provide nutrition for adults after a Whipple surgery?\"\n- **Original Subheading:** \"What were the main results?\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What did the studies find?\"\n\n2. **Use verbs instead of complex nouns (nominalizations).**\nThe text often uses noun forms of verbs, which can make sentences abstract and harder to follow. Changing these back to action verbs makes the writing more direct.\n- **Original Sentence:** \"This will help us better understand the effects on patient recovery and complications.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"Recovery\" is a noun that hides the action. Focusing on the verb makes it clearer for the reader.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This will help us better understand how patients recover and what complications might occur.\"\n\n3. **Simplify sentences with multiple technical terms.**\nSome sentences, while technically correct, are dense with multi-syllable words. Breaking them into shorter, simpler sentences can improve readability.\n- **Original Sentence:** \"The surgery changes the digestive system, which can make it hard for people to get enough nutrition.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This sentence combines several complex ideas and terms. Separating them makes the information easier to process.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The surgery changes how the body digests food. This can make it hard for people to get enough nutrients.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns in many areas, with 78% of features in the best quartile for readability and sentence length. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity and sentence structure. Key metrics needing attention are the high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which is beyond the 90th percentile, and several indicators of vocabulary difficulty (SMOG index, Dale-Chall complex words, and long words), which are all in the 90th percentile range. These metrics suggest the text could be made more direct and easier to understand by using more action verbs and simpler, shorter words."
