  "draft": "What is the best way to provide nutrition for adults after a Whipple surgery?\n\nKey messages\nFor adults who have a Whipple surgery, feeding through a tube placed into the small intestine during the operation (jejunostomy feeding) likely shortens their hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein (parenteral nutrition). The way a person is fed may make little to no difference to the risk of complications after surgery, but the evidence is very uncertain.\nBecause the evidence is limited and uncertain, more research is needed to find the best way to feed patients after this surgery and to understand the effects on their recovery and risk of complications.\n\nWhat is a Whipple procedure and why is nutrition important afterwards?\nA Whipple procedure (also known as a pancreaticoduodenectomy) is a major operation to remove the head of the pancreas. Doctors perform this surgery most often to treat cancer. The surgery changes how the body digests food, which can make it hard for people to get enough nutrients. Poor nutrition (malnutrition) can slow recovery and increase the risk of problems.\nTo prevent this, patients receive nutritional support in several ways:\n– Oral feeding: eating and drinking normally.\n– Enteral feeding: receiving liquid food through a tube into the stomach or intestine. The two types mentioned in this review are:\n  - Jejunostomy feeding: a tube placed into the small intestine during surgery.\n  - Nasojejunal feeding: a tube passed through the nose into the intestine.\n– Parenteral nutrition: receiving liquid nutrients directly into a vein.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how different ways of feeding affect recovery and the risk of problems for adults after a Whipple procedure.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of feeding adults after a Whipple procedure. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 studies with 1897 adults who had a Whipple procedure. The studies compared different ways of providing nutrition after the operation, including enteral feeding, parenteral nutrition, and normal oral feeding. We do not know how long the studies lasted, who funded them, or where they were conducted.\n\nWhat did the studies find?\n\nFeeding through a tube into the intestine versus feeding through a vein\n– Feeding through a tube placed in the intestine during surgery (jejunostomy feeding) likely shortens a person's hospital stay slightly compared to feeding through a vein. This type of feeding may make little to no difference to the risk of problems like fluid leaks from the pancreas (pancreatic fistula) or delayed stomach emptying, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n– Feeding through a tube that goes through the nose into the intestine (nasojejunal feeding) may slightly increase the risk of fluid leaks from the pancreas compared to feeding through a vein. It may make little to no difference to how long they stay in the hospital or their risk of other problems like delayed stomach emptying or bleeding, but these findings are very uncertain.\n\nFeeding through a tube into the intestine versus eating normally\n– Compared to eating normally, feeding through a tube in the intestine may have little to no effect on how long they stay in the hospital or their risk of complications. However, our confidence in these results is very low.\n\nIt is unclear if the type of feeding after surgery affects the risk of death. The evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies used different ways to feed people, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

The analysis flagged four features in the P90 range for potential review: nominalization (use of noun-forms of verbs), total nouns, Dale-Chall complex words, and long words. The high number of complex and long words is likely justified by the necessary medical terms, which have been clearly defined in the text."
