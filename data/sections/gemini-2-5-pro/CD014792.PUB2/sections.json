  "key_messages": [
    "For adults recovering from Whipple surgery, providing nutrition through a tube placed into the small intestine during the operation (jejunostomy feeding) likely shortens the time spent in the hospital compared to feeding through a vein (parenteral nutrition). The evidence was unclear about whether the type of feeding affects the risk of complications after surgery.",
    "Due to the limited and uncertain evidence, more high-quality research is needed to determine the best way to provide nutritional support after Whipple surgery and to better understand the effects on patient recovery and complications."

      "content": "A pancreaticoduodenectomy (also known as a Whipple procedure) is a major operation to remove the head of the pancreas. It is most often performed to treat cancer. Because this surgery changes the digestive system, it can be difficult for people to get enough nutrition afterwards. Poor nutrition (malnutrition) can slow down recovery and increase the risk of complications. To prevent this, patients are given nutritional support in several ways. They may eat and drink normally (oral feeding), be given liquid food through a tube that goes directly into the intestine (enteral feeding), or be given liquid nutrients directly into a vein (parenteral nutrition)."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 17 studies that included 1897 adults who had surgery on their pancreas (pancreaticoduodenectomy). The studies looked at different ways of providing nutrition after the operation, including feeding through a tube into the intestine (enteral feeding), feeding directly into a vein (total parenteral nutrition), and normal eating and drinking (oral intake). We do not know how long the studies lasted, who funded them, or in which countries they were conducted."

      "subheading": "Main results: How people are fed after surgery",
      "content": "**Tube feeding into the intestine versus feeding through a vein**\n• Feeding through a tube placed directly into the small intestine probably reduces the length of a person's hospital stay slightly compared to feeding through a vein. This type of tube feeding may make little to no difference to the risk of complications like fluid leakage from the pancreas, but for other complications, we are very uncertain about the results.\n• Feeding through a tube that goes from the nose to the intestine may slightly increase the risk of fluid leakage from the pancreas compared to feeding through a vein. It may make little to no difference to the length of hospital stay or other complications, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n\n**Tube feeding into the intestine versus eating normally**\n• Compared to eating normally, feeding through a tube in the small intestine may have little to no effect on the length of hospital stay or the risk of complications, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nIt is unclear if the type of feeding after surgery has an effect on the risk of death, as the evidence is very uncertain."
