  "draft": "What is the best way to provide nutrition for adults after a Whipple surgery?\n\nKey messages\nFor adults who have a Whipple surgery, feeding through a tube placed into the small intestine during the operation (jejunostomy feeding) may shorten their hospital stay compared to feeding through a vein (parenteral nutrition). We are uncertain if the way a person is fed affects their risk of problems after surgery.\nThe evidence is limited and uncertain. More high-quality research is needed to find the best way to provide nutrition after this surgery. This will help us better understand how patients recover and what complications might occur.\n\nWhat is a Whipple procedure and why is nutrition important afterwards?\nA Whipple procedure (also known as a pancreaticoduodenectomy) is a major operation to remove the head of the pancreas. Doctors perform this surgery most often to treat cancer. The surgery changes how the body digests food. This can make it hard for people to get enough nutrients. Poor nutrition (malnutrition) can slow how a person recovers and increase their risk of problems.\nTo prevent this, patients receive nutritional support in several ways:\n– Oral feeding: eating and drinking normally.\n– Enteral feeding: receiving liquid food through a tube that goes into the stomach or intestine. This can be a tube placed into the small intestine during surgery (jejunostomy feeding) or a tube passed through the nose into the intestine (nasojejunal feeding).\n– Parenteral nutrition: receiving liquid nutrients directly into a vein.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how different ways of feeding affect how adults recover and their risk of complications after a Whipple procedure.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of feeding adults after a Whipple procedure. We compared and summarized the results of these studies. We also rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 17 studies with 1897 adults who had a Whipple procedure. The studies compared different ways of providing nutrition after the operation, including enteral feeding, parenteral nutrition, and normal oral feeding. We do not know how long the studies lasted, who funded them, or where they were conducted.\n\nWhat did the studies find?\n\nFeeding through a tube into the intestine versus feeding through a vein\n– Feeding through a tube placed in the intestine during surgery (jejunostomy feeding) likely shortens a person's hospital stay slightly compared to feeding through a vein. This type of feeding may make little to no difference to the risk of some problems after surgery, but we are very uncertain about the results for other problems.\n– Feeding through a tube that goes through the nose into the intestine (nasojejunal feeding) may slightly increase the risk of fluid leaking from the pancreas compared to feeding through a vein. It may make little to no difference to the length of the hospital stay or other problems, but we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nFeeding through a tube into the intestine versus eating normally\n– Compared to eating normally, feeding through a tube in the intestine may have little to no effect on the length of the hospital stay or the risk of problems. However, we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nIt is unclear if the type of feeding after surgery affects the risk of death. The evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies provided nutrition in different ways, and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

However, to make it even more accessible for patients, I'm recommending three improvements focused on using more direct language and simplifying vocabulary, which will address the high number of noun phrases and complex words identified in the analysis.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** The summary often uses nouns to describe actions, which can make sentences feel abstract. Using verbs makes the writing more direct and easier to follow.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"...feeding through a tube placed into the small intestine during the operation (jejunostomy feeding) may shorten their hospital stay...\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"shorten their hospital stay\" is a bit formal and abstract. A more patient-centric phrasing would focus on the outcome for the person.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"...feeding through a tube placed into the small intestine during the operation (jejunostomy feeding) may help them leave the hospital sooner...\"\n\n2.  **Replace complex or formal words with simpler alternatives.** While the summary does a good job of explaining technical terms, some everyday words are more formal than they need to be, which can slow down reading.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"This will help us better understand how patients recover and what complications might occur.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The words \"recover\" and \"complications might occur\" are slightly formal. Using simpler, more common words makes the message more direct.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"This will help us learn more about how patients get better and what problems they might have.\"\n\n3.  **Improve conciseness by combining related sentences.** Some sections use multiple sentences to convey a single idea, which can be streamlined.\n    *   **Problematic sentences:** \"The evidence is limited and uncertain. More high-quality research is needed to find the best way to provide nutrition after this surgery. This will help us better understand how patients recover and what complications might occur.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** These three sentences repeat the core message of uncertainty and the need for more research. Combining them makes the point more efficiently.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Because the current evidence is limited and uncertain, more research is needed to find the best way to feed patients after this surgery and to better understand its effects on their recovery.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, the analysis also flags four features that deviate significantly from the norm (in the P90 range): nominalization (using nouns instead of verbs), total nouns, complex words (Dale-Chall), and long words. This statistical evidence supports the editorial feedback to focus on using more direct verbs and simpler, everyday vocabulary to enhance clarity for the reader."
