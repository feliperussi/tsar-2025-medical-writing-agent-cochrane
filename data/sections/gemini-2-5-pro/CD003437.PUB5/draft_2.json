  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medicines, talking therapies, and non-invasive brain stimulation (using magnetic fields or electrical currents to stimulate the brain), alone or in combination, for treating depression after a stroke?\n\nKey messages\nDue to a lack of strong evidence, the effects of most treatments for depression after a stroke are uncertain. Medicines and talking therapies may help reduce depression, but medicines may cause unwanted effects on the brain, nerves, stomach, and gut.\nBrain stimulation (using magnetic fields or electrical currents) on its own did not appear to have an effect on depression.\nMore and better-quality research is needed to understand the true benefits and harms of these treatments, both alone and in combination.\n\nWhy is treating depression after a stroke important?\nHaving a stroke is a life-changing event, and many people experience depression afterwards. This depression can make it harder for people to recover from their stroke. Unfortunately, depression after a stroke is often not identified or not treated effectively.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nIn this Cochrane Review, we wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments for depression after a stroke. We looked at evidence for medicines (pharmacological treatments), talking therapies (psychological therapy), non-invasive brain stimulation (using electrical currents or magnetic fields to stimulate the brain), and combinations of these treatments.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested different treatments for depression after a stroke. We combined the results of these studies to see how well the treatments worked and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 65 trials with 5831 people who had depression after a stroke. The studies compared several types of treatments, including drug treatments (compared with a placebo), non-invasive brain stimulation (compared with a sham stimulation or usual care), and talking therapies (compared with usual care or an attention control). The review also looked at combinations of these treatments.\n\nWe found that:\n- Drug treatments and talking therapies may reduce the number of people with depression.\n- Drug treatments may cause side effects related to the nervous system and stomach.\n- Non-invasive brain stimulation on its own may have little to no effect on depression.\n\nHowever, we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nAdding non-invasive brain stimulation to drug treatment may reduce the number of people with depression compared to using drug treatment alone.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, clear draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. The following suggestions focus on refining a few key areas to make the findings even easier for a lay audience to understand before final approval.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Explain Technical Comparison Groups**\n\n*   **Quote:** \"...non-invasive brain stimulation (compared with a sham stimulation or usual care), and talking therapies (compared with usual care or an attention control).\"\n    **Why it's a problem:** The terms 'sham stimulation' and 'attention control' are technical jargon that will likely be unfamiliar to readers. Without a simple explanation, it's unclear what the treatments were being compared against, which is essential for understanding the results.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** Define these terms in simple language. For example: \"...non-invasive brain stimulation (compared with a **fake stimulation**) and talking therapies (compared with usual care or **general support that was not a specific therapy**).\"\n\n**2. Integrate Uncertainty Directly with Findings**\n\n*   **Quote:** \"We found that:\n- Drug treatments and talking therapies may reduce the number of people with depression.\n- Drug treatments may cause side effects related to the nervous system and stomach.\n- Non-invasive brain stimulation on its own may have little to no effect on depression.\n\nHowever, we are very uncertain about these results.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Placing the statement about uncertainty at the end of the list disconnects it from the specific findings. A reader might miss this crucial caveat. It is more transparent and effective to link the uncertainty directly to each result.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** Integrate the uncertainty into each bullet point to reinforce the message. For example: \"- Drug treatments and talking therapies may reduce the number of people with depression, **but the evidence is very uncertain.**\"\n\n**3. Use More Direct, Action-Oriented Language in the Methods**\n\n*   **Quote:** \"We combined the results of these studies to see how well the treatments worked and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly indirect. Using more active verbs can make the research process clearer and more engaging. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which noted a high number of 'nominalizations' (using nouns instead of verbs), suggesting an opportunity to be more direct.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** Consider rephrasing to use stronger verbs that describe the actions taken. For example: \"We then compared and combined the study results to assess the benefits and harms of each treatment. We also rated how certain we were about the evidence.\"\n\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 17 of 18 metrics (94.4%) falling within the best quartile for readability and style. Read and readability scores, sentence length, and use of active voice are excellent. The only notable deviation is in the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which is higher than typical (P90), suggesting that some sentences could be phrased more directly using action verbs."
