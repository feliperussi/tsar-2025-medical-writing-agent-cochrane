  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of strong evidence, the effects of most treatments for depression after a stroke are uncertain. Medicines and talking therapies may help reduce depression, but medicines may cause unwanted effects on the brain, nerves, stomach, and gut.",
    "Brain stimulation (using magnetic fields or electrical currents) on its own did not appear to have an effect on depression.",
    "More and better-quality research is needed to understand the true benefits and harms of these treatments, both alone and in combination."

      "subheading": "Why is treating depression after a stroke important?",
      "content": "Having a stroke is a life-changing event, and many people experience depression afterwards. This depression can make it harder for people to recover from their stroke. Unfortunately, depression after a stroke is often not identified or not treated effectively."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "In this Cochrane Review, we wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments for depression after a stroke. We looked at evidence for medicines (pharmacological treatments), talking therapies (psychological therapy), non-invasive brain stimulation (using electrical currents or magnetic fields to stimulate the brain), and combinations of these treatments."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 65 trials with a total of 5831 participants who had depression after a stroke. The studies compared several types of treatments. These included pharmacological interventions (compared with a placebo), non-invasive brain stimulation (compared with a sham stimulation or usual care), and psychological therapy (compared with usual care or an attention control). The review also looked at combinations of these treatments. For people with depression after a stroke, drug treatments and psychological therapy may reduce the number of people with depression, but we are very uncertain about these results. Drug treatments may also cause more side effects related to the nervous system and stomach, but we are very uncertain. Non-invasive brain stimulation may have little to no effect on depression, but we are very uncertain about this result. Adding non-invasive brain stimulation to drug treatment may reduce the number of people with depression compared to using drug treatment alone."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.",
