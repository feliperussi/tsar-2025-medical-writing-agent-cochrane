  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medicines, talking therapies, and non-invasive brain stimulation (using magnetic fields or electrical currents to stimulate the brain), alone or in combination, for treating depression after a stroke?\n\nKey messages\nDue to a lack of strong evidence, the effects of most treatments for depression after a stroke are uncertain. Medicines and talking therapies may help reduce depression, but medicines may cause unwanted effects on the brain, nerves, stomach, and gut.\nBrain stimulation (using magnetic fields or electrical currents) on its own did not appear to have an effect on depression.\nMore and better-quality research is needed to understand the true benefits and harms of these treatments, both alone and in combination.\n\nWhy is treating depression after a stroke important?\nHaving a stroke is a life-changing event, and many people experience depression afterwards. This depression can make it harder for people to recover from their stroke. Unfortunately, depression after a stroke is often not identified or not treated effectively.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nIn this Cochrane Review, we wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments for depression after a stroke. We looked at evidence for medicines (pharmacological treatments), talking therapies (psychological therapy), non-invasive brain stimulation (using electrical currents or magnetic fields to stimulate the brain), and combinations of these treatments.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that tested different treatments for depression after a stroke. We combined the results of these studies to see how well the treatments worked and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 65 trials with a total of 5831 participants who had depression after a stroke. The studies compared several types of treatments. These included pharmacological interventions (compared with a placebo), non-invasive brain stimulation (compared with a sham stimulation or usual care), and psychological therapy (compared with usual care or an attention control). The review also looked at combinations of these treatments. For people with depression after a stroke, drug treatments and psychological therapy may reduce the number of people with depression, but we are very uncertain about these results. Drug treatments may also cause more side effects related to the nervous system and stomach, but we are very uncertain. Non-invasive brain stimulation may have little to no effect on depression, but we are very uncertain about this result. Adding non-invasive brain stimulation to drug treatment may reduce the number of people with depression compared to using drug treatment alone.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. However, it cannot be approved because it fails one of the critical style guide checks. I've detailed this issue below, along with two other suggestions to improve clarity for the reader.\n\n**1. CRITICAL: Rephrase the 'Methods' subheading as a question.**\n- **Quote:** \"Methods\"\n- **Problem:** The Cochrane style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions to guide the reader. This subheading breaks that pattern, making the structure inconsistent.\n- **Suggestion:** Change \"Methods\" to \"How did we conduct this review?\"\n\n**2. Simplify the repetitive sentences in the results section.**\n- **Quote:** \"For people with depression after a stroke, drug treatments and psychological therapy may reduce the number of people with depression, but we are very uncertain about these results. Drug treatments may also cause more side effects related to the nervous system and stomach, but we are very uncertain. Non-invasive brain stimulation may have little to no effect on depression, but we are very uncertain about this result.\"\n- **Problem:** Repeating \"but we are very uncertain\" makes this section clunky and harder to read. The information can be presented more efficiently.\n- **Suggestion:** Consolidate the uncertainty statement and use bullet points for clarity. For example: \"We found that: \n- Drug treatments and talking therapies may reduce depression. \n- Brain stimulation on its own may have little to no effect on depression. \n- Drug treatments may cause side effects affecting the nervous system and stomach. \nHowever, we are very uncertain about all these results.\"\n\n**3. Replace technical terms with simpler, consistent language.**\n- **Quote:** \"These included pharmacological interventions (compared with a placebo)...\"\n- **Problem:** The draft already defines \"pharmacological treatments\" as \"medicines\" and uses the simpler term \"drug treatments\" elsewhere. Reverting to the technical term \"pharmacological interventions\" is unnecessary and inconsistent.\n- **Suggestion:** Replace \"pharmacological interventions\" with \"drug treatments\" for consistency and ease of reading. For example: \"These included drug treatments (compared with a placebo)...\"\n\nThis feedback is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of nominalizations (noun-heavy phrases like 'interventions'), suggesting that using more direct verbs and simpler terms would improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows excellent conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 16 of 18 metrics (88.9%) falling within the best quartile for readability and style. However, there is a significant deviation in the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which is in the 90th percentile. This suggests that replacing some noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs could further improve clarity."
