  "draft": "For premature babies with breathing problems, is high-flow therapy (giving warm, moist air and oxygen through small tubes in the nose) a good first choice for breathing support?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For premature babies born after 28 weeks, using high-flow therapy first probably makes little to no difference to their risk of death or developing a long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) compared to other types of breathing support.\n- Compared to a common type of breathing support called CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure), high-flow therapy fails more often, meaning more babies need to be switched to another treatment. However, high-flow therapy also causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).\n- There is not enough evidence to know if high-flow therapy is a good first choice for very premature babies (born before 28 weeks of pregnancy), as the studies included very few of these babies.\n\nWhat breathing problems do preterm babies have and what is nasal high flow therapy?\nBabies who are born too early (preterm) often have underdeveloped lungs and can have trouble breathing. Doctors call this respiratory distress syndrome. To help them, they may need breathing support. One way to provide this support is with 'nasal high flow' therapy. This treatment delivers warm, moist air and oxygen through 2 small prongs that sit just inside the baby's nose. This is 'non-invasive' support, meaning doctors do not need to insert a breathing tube down the baby's throat into their lungs (a process called mechanical ventilation).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as the first breathing support for premature babies. We compared it with other types of non-invasive breathing support, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using nasal high flow therapy against other types of non-invasive breathing support in premature babies. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 13 studies with a total of 2540 babies. The studies included premature babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) who had breathing problems soon after birth. Very few of these babies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks).\n\nThe studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other types of non-invasive breathing support: CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure) or NIPPV. We found no studies that compared high-flow therapy with giving standard oxygen or with low-flow nasal tubes.\n\nCompared with CPAP, high-flow therapy may make little to no difference to the risk of death or developing a long-term lung condition. However, high-flow therapy probably fails more often in the first few days. For every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, one extra baby's treatment will likely fail, requiring a switch to another type of support.\n\nEven though treatment with high-flow therapy failed more often, a similar number of babies in both groups ultimately needed a breathing tube. On the other hand, high-flow therapy probably causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung.\n\nCompared with a different type of breathing support (NIPPV), we are very uncertain if high-flow therapy affects the risk of death or long-term lung disease. High-flow therapy probably makes little to no difference to the risk of treatment failure or the need for a breathing tube compared with NIPPV. However, it probably causes much less injury to the nose.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies used different ways of delivering the treatment and did not include many very premature babies. Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received. Knowing which treatment a baby received could have unintentionally changed their care, possibly affecting the study's results. We also need more studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it needs some revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are overly complex vocabulary and sentence structures that make key findings difficult to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex sentences in the 'Limitations' section.** The explanation of study limitations is a bit too academic and indirect for a plain language summary.\n   - **Current sentence:** 'Knowing which treatment a baby received could have unintentionally changed their care, possibly affecting the study's results.'\n   - **Problem:** This phrasing is indirect and uses formal language ('unintentionally changed their care', 'affecting the study's results').\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'This knowledge could have influenced how they cared for the babies, which might have affected the results.'\n\n2. **Clarify the key statistic on treatment failure.** The current wording is slightly awkward and could be more direct and easier for a reader to process.\n   - **Current sentence:** 'For every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, one extra baby's treatment will likely fail, requiring a switch to another type of support.'\n   - **Problem:** The phrase 'one extra baby's treatment will likely fail' is clunky. The sentence combines the finding and its consequence in a complex way.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'This means that for every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, one additional baby will need to be switched to another type of support because the first treatment failed.'\n\n3. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs.** The text often uses nouns where verbs would be simpler and more active. This is a stylistic issue known as 'nominalization'.\n   - **Current sentence:** 'Compared with a different type of breathing support (NIPPV), we are very uncertain if high-flow therapy affects the risk of death or long-term lung disease.'\n   - **Problem:** The phrase 'affects the risk of death' is a noun-heavy and abstract way to communicate the idea.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'Compared with a different type of breathing support (NIPPV), we are very uncertain if high-flow therapy changes whether babies die or develop long-term lung disease.'\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the summary uses a high number of complex/unfamiliar words (`complex_words_dc`), noun-heavy phrases (`nominalization`, `nouns`), and has a high `smog_index`, indicating it may be difficult for some readers to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns in many areas, with 61 the 61% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence length. However, there are significant deviations in vocabulary and sentence structure. The metrics for Dale-Chall complex words (`complex_words_dc`) and total nouns (`nouns`) are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the vocabulary is much more complex and noun-heavy than a typical PLS. Additionally, the `smog_index`, `passive_voice`, `nominalization`, and `long_words` metrics are in the P90 range, supporting the need to simplify word choice and use more direct, active sentence constructions."
