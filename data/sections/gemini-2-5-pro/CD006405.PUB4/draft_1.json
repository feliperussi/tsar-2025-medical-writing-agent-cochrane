  "draft": "For premature babies with breathing problems, is high-flow therapy (giving warm, moist air and oxygen through small tubes in the nose) a good first choice for breathing support?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For premature babies born after 28 weeks of pregnancy, using high-flow therapy (warm, moist air and oxygen given through small tubes in the nose) as the first choice for breathing support probably makes little to no difference to the risk of death or developing a long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) compared to other types of breathing support.\n- Compared to one common type of breathing support called CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure), high-flow therapy leads to more babies needing to be switched to another treatment. However, it also causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).\n- There is not enough evidence to know if high-flow therapy is a good first choice for very premature babies (born before 28 weeks of pregnancy), as very few were included in the studies.\n\nWHY WE DID THIS REVIEW\nWhat breathing problems do preterm babies have and what is nasal high flow therapy?\nBabies who are born too early (preterm) often have underdeveloped lungs and can have trouble breathing. This is known as respiratory distress syndrome. To help them, they may need support with their breathing. One way to provide this support is with 'nasal high flow' therapy. This treatment delivers warm, moist air and oxygen through two small prongs that sit just inside the baby's nose. It is a form of 'non-invasive' support, meaning it does not require a breathing tube to be inserted down the baby's throat into their lungs (a process called mechanical ventilation).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as the first breathing support for preterm infants. They compared it with other types of non-invasive breathing support, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).\n\nWHAT WE DID\nWe searched for studies that compared using nasal high flow therapy against other types of non-invasive breathing support in preterm infants. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\nThis review included 13 studies involving a total of 2540 infants. The participants were preterm infants born at less than 37 weeks' gestation who had respiratory distress shortly after birth, although very few infants were extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks' gestation). The studies compared nasal high flow (nHF) therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, specifically continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The review found no studies that compared nHF with ambient oxygen or with low flow nasal cannulae. For preterm infants needing breathing support, using nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference to the combined risk of death or developing a chronic lung condition when compared with another type of support called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, nasal high flow therapy probably increases the risk that the treatment will fail within the first few days. For every 11 infants treated with nasal high flow therapy instead of CPAP, one additional infant will likely experience treatment failure. Despite this, this increase in treatment failure probably makes little to no difference to the number of infants who ultimately need a breathing tube inserted. On the other hand, nasal high flow therapy probably reduces the risk of injury to the infant's nose and probably reduces the risk of a collapsed lung. When compared with a different type of breathing support (nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation, or NIPPV), it is unclear if nasal high flow therapy has an effect on death or chronic lung disease because the results are very uncertain. Nasal high flow therapy probably makes little to no difference to the risk of treatment failure or the need for a breathing tube compared with NIPPV, but it probably causes a large reduction in the risk of injury to the nose.\n\nHOW RELIABLE IS THIS EVIDENCE?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies used different ways of delivering the treatment and did not include many very premature babies. Additionally, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHOW UP-TO-DATE IS THIS EVIDENCE?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

The main problems are that some subheadings do not follow the question format, and the text uses too many complex words, passive constructions, and noun-heavy phrases, which makes it difficult for a lay audience to read.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to guide the reader. Three of your main subheadings are currently statements.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"WHY WE DID THIS REVIEW\", \"WHAT WE DID\", \"WHAT WE FOUND\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Why did we do this review?\", \"What did we do?\", \"What did we find?\"\n\n2.  **Replace complex and technical words with simpler alternatives.** The summary contains many long, multi-syllable words that make it hard to understand. This is particularly true in the 'What we found' section.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"The participants were preterm infants born at less than 37 weeks' gestation who had respiratory distress shortly after birth, although very few infants were extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks' gestation).\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies included premature babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) who had breathing problems soon after birth. Very few of these babies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks).\"\n\n3.  **Use active voice and verbs instead of passive voice and nouns.** Many sentences are written in a passive, noun-heavy style ('nominalization') which makes them wordy and less direct. Using active verbs makes the text clearer and more engaging.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"nasal high flow therapy probably causes a large reduction in the risk of injury to the nose.\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"nasal high flow therapy probably greatly reduces the risk of injury to the nose.\"\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"it does not require a breathing tube to be inserted down the baby's throat\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"it does not require doctors to insert a breathing tube down the baby's throat\"\n\n4.  **Use personal pronouns consistently.** The summary starts by referring to \"The review authors\" and \"They\" but later switches to \"We\". Using \"we\" and \"our\" consistently makes the summary more direct and easier to follow.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"The review authors wanted to find out...

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows MODERATE CONFORMITY with typical PLS patterns. While some readability scores (like Coleman-Liau and Gunning-Fog) are in the best quartile, there are significant deviations in key areas that support the need for revision. Seven metrics fall outside the typical range, with four being 'Beyond P90'. Specifically, the draft has an unusually high number of passive voice constructions, nominalizations (noun-form verbs), and complex/long words. These high scores for `passive_voice`, `nominalization`, `complex_words_dc`, and `long_words` directly correspond to the clarity issues identified in the feedback, confirming that the text is less direct and uses more complex vocabulary than a typical Plain Language Summary."
