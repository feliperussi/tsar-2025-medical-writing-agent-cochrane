  "draft": "For premature babies with breathing problems, is high-flow therapy (giving warm, moist air and oxygen through small tubes in the nose) a good first choice for breathing support?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For premature babies born after 28 weeks, using high-flow therapy first probably makes little to no difference in whether they die or develop a long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) compared to other types of breathing support.\n- Compared to a common type of breathing support called CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure), high-flow therapy fails more often, meaning doctors need to switch more babies to another treatment. However, high-flow therapy also causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).\n- There is not enough evidence to know if high-flow therapy is a good first choice for very premature babies (born before 28 weeks of pregnancy), as the studies included very few of these babies.\n\nWhat breathing problems do preterm babies have and what is nasal high flow therapy?\nBabies who are born too early (preterm) often have underdeveloped lungs and can have trouble breathing. Doctors call this respiratory distress syndrome. To help them, they may need breathing support. One way to provide this support is with 'nasal high flow' therapy. This treatment delivers warm, moist air and oxygen through 2 small prongs that sit just inside the baby's nose. This is 'non-invasive' support, meaning doctors do not need to insert a breathing tube down the baby's throat into their lungs (a process called mechanical ventilation).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as the first breathing support for premature babies. We compared it with other types of non-invasive breathing support, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using nasal high flow therapy against other types of non-invasive breathing support in premature babies. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 13 studies with a total of 2540 babies. The studies included premature babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) who had breathing problems soon after birth. Very few of these babies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks).\n\nThe studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other types of non-invasive breathing support: CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure) or NIPPV. We found no studies that compared high-flow therapy with giving standard oxygen or with low-flow nasal tubes.\n\nCompared with CPAP, high-flow therapy may make little to no difference in whether babies die or develop a long-term lung condition. However, high-flow therapy probably fails more often in the first few days. This means that for every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, doctors will need to switch one additional baby to another type of support because the first treatment failed.\n\nEven though treatment with high-flow therapy failed more often, a similar number of babies in both groups ended up needing a breathing tube. On the other hand, high-flow therapy probably causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung.\n\nCompared with a different type of breathing support (NIPPV), we are very uncertain if high-flow therapy changes whether babies die or develop long-term lung disease. High-flow therapy probably makes little to no difference to how often the treatment fails or to how many babies need a breathing tube compared with NIPPV. However, it probably causes much less injury to the nose.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies used different ways of delivering the treatment and did not include many very premature babies. Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received. Knowing which treatment a baby received could have changed their care and affected the results. We also need more studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

However, it cannot be approved because of a critical factual inconsistency in the Key Messages regarding the certainty of the evidence. I have also identified two other areas where we can improve clarity and readability for your audience.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. CRITICAL: Correct the Certainty of Evidence in Key Messages**\n\nYour first key message misrepresents the certainty of the evidence. This is a critical issue that must be corrected.\n\n- **The sentence:** \"- For premature babies born after 28 weeks, using high-flow therapy first **probably** makes little to no difference in whether they die or develop a long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) compared to other types of breathing support.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The source abstract states this finding is based on \"low-certainty evidence.\" Per Cochrane guidelines, \"probably\" should be used for moderate-certainty evidence, while \"may\" should be used for low-certainty evidence. This wording overstates our confidence in the finding.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"- For premature babies born after 28 weeks, using high-flow therapy first **may make** little to no difference in whether they die or develop a long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) compared to other types of breathing support.\"\n\n**2. Simplify Noun-Heavy Sentences**\n\nThe text has a very high number of nouns, which can make sentences feel dense and passive. Replacing noun phrases with stronger verbs will make the text more direct and easier to read.\n\n- **The sentence:** \"Even though treatment with high-flow therapy failed more often, a similar number of babies in both groups ended up needing a breathing tube.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is a bit wordy and indirect. The focus is on \"treatment\" and \"number of babies\" rather than the action.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Although high-flow therapy failed more often, a similar number of babies in both groups ultimately needed a breathing tube.\"\n\n**3. Make the Limitations Section More Direct**\n\nThe explanation of bias in the limitations section is slightly repetitive and could be more concise.\n\n- **The sentences:** \"Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received. Knowing which treatment a baby received could have changed their care and affected the results.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The second sentence repeats the idea of the first using a less direct structure (\"Knowing which treatment...\"). This is a pattern known as nominalization, which the metrics flagged as high.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received. This knowledge could have influenced their care and affected the results.\"\n\nBy addressing the critical correction in the key message and refining the sentence structure in these few areas, this summary will be ready for publication.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in many areas, particularly in readability scores and sentence length, which are all in the best quartile. However, the analysis also flags significant deviations from typical patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure. The count of nouns, Dale-Chall complex words, long words, nominalizations, and passive voice constructions are all in the P90 range or beyond. These metrics support the editorial feedback to focus on simplifying sentence structures and making the language more direct to improve overall clarity."
