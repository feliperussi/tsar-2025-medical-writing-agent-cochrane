  "draft": "For premature babies with breathing problems, is high-flow therapy (giving warm, moist air and oxygen through small tubes in the nose) a good first choice for breathing support?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For premature babies born after 28 weeks, using high-flow therapy first may make little to no difference in whether they die or develop a long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) compared to other types of breathing support.\n- Compared to a common type of breathing support called CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure), high-flow therapy fails more often, meaning doctors need to switch more babies to another treatment. However, high-flow therapy also causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).\n- There is not enough evidence to know if high-flow therapy is a good first choice for very premature babies (born before 28 weeks of pregnancy), as the studies included very few of these babies.\n\nWhat breathing problems do preterm babies have and what is nasal high flow therapy?\nBabies who are born too early (preterm) often have underdeveloped lungs and can have trouble breathing. Doctors call this respiratory distress syndrome. To help them, they may need breathing support. One way to provide this support is with 'nasal high flow' therapy. This treatment delivers warm, moist air and oxygen through 2 small prongs that sit just inside the baby's nose. This is 'non-invasive' support, meaning doctors do not need to insert a breathing tube down the baby's throat into their lungs (a process called mechanical ventilation).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as the first breathing support for premature babies. We compared it with other types of non-invasive breathing support, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using nasal high flow therapy against other types of non-invasive breathing support in premature babies. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 13 studies with a total of 2540 babies. The studies included premature babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) who had breathing problems soon after birth. Very few of these babies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks).\n\nThe studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other types of non-invasive breathing support: CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure) or NIPPV (nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation). We found no studies that compared high-flow therapy with giving standard oxygen or with low-flow nasal tubes.\n\nCompared with CPAP, high-flow therapy may make little to no difference in whether babies die or develop a long-term lung condition. However, high-flow therapy probably fails more often in the first few days. This means that for every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, doctors will need to switch one additional baby to another type of support because the first treatment failed.\n\nAlthough high-flow therapy failed more often, a similar number of babies in both groups ultimately needed a breathing tube. On the other hand, high-flow therapy probably causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung.\n\nCompared with a different type of breathing support (NIPPV), we are very uncertain if high-flow therapy changes whether babies die or develop long-term lung disease. High-flow therapy probably makes little to no difference to how often the treatment fails or to how many babies need a breathing tube compared with NIPPV. However, it probably causes much less injury to the nose.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies used different ways of delivering the treatment and did not include many very premature babies. Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received. This knowledge could have influenced their care and affected the results. We also need more studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it is not approved because several clarity issues make it more difficult for a lay audience to read than necessary. The main problems are a high number of complex words and noun-heavy sentences that create a dense, academic tone. Addressing the 3-4 improvements below will significantly enhance readability.\n\n**Top 4 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Simplify sentence structure by using verbs instead of abstract nouns (nominalizations).**\nThis makes the writing more direct and easier to follow.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"This knowledge could have influenced their care and affected the results.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"This knowledge\" is an abstract and indirect way to describe the action. Using a direct verb makes it clearer.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Knowing which treatment a baby received could have influenced the care they were given and affected the results.\"\n\n**2. Replace complex and long words with simpler, more common alternatives.**\nYour summary has a high number of words that are uncommon in everyday language, which can be a barrier for readers.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"The studies included premature babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) who had breathing problems soon after birth.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** While not overly complex, words like \"premature\" and \"pregnancy\" can be replaced with simpler terms to improve flow and ease of reading, especially when used repeatedly.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies included babies born early (before 37 weeks) who had trouble breathing soon after birth.\"\n\n**3. Improve conciseness by removing unnecessary words.**\nSome sentences are longer than they need to be, which can make them harder to process.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"This means that for every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, doctors will need to switch one additional baby to another type of support because the first treatment failed.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This 36-word sentence is long and contains redundant phrases like \"additional baby\" and \"because the first treatment failed.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"This means for every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, one will likely need to switch to another support when the first treatment doesn't work.\"\n\n**4. Clarify the definition of CPAP and NIPPV on first use.**\nWhile you define the acronyms, you don't explain what they *are* in simple terms until later. This can confuse readers in the \"What did we want to find out?\" section.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"We compared it with other types of non-invasive breathing support, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** The reader encounters these technical terms and acronyms without any immediate explanation of what they mean.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We compared it with other types of non-invasive breathing support, such as CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure) and NIPPV (which provides breaths of air at set intervals).\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour draft is more complex than a typical PLS. The metrics show a high number of nouns (217, BEYOND_P90), nominalizations (21, P90), and long words (196, P90). The vocabulary is also challenging, as indicated by the high SMOG index (13.7, P90) and the number of words not on the Dale-Chall common word list (296, BEYOND_P90). The suggested edits will help bring these metrics closer to the typical range for a Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in many areas, with 66.7% of features falling within the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, there are significant deviations in vocabulary and word choice. Five metrics fall outside the typical range: `nominalization` (P90), `smog_index` (P90), `long_words` (P90), `nouns` (BEYOND_P90), and `complex_words_dc` (BEYOND_P90). These results indicate that the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex, long, and uncommon words than is typical for a PLS, which supports the editorial recommendation to simplify vocabulary and sentence structures."
