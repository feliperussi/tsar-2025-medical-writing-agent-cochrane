  "key_messages": [
    "For premature babies born after 28 weeks of pregnancy, using high-flow therapy (warm, moist air and oxygen given through small tubes in the nose) as the first choice for breathing support probably makes little to no difference to the risk of death or developing a long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) compared to other types of breathing support.",
    "Compared to one common type of breathing support called CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure), high-flow therapy leads to more babies needing to be switched to another treatment. However, it also causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).",
    "There is not enough evidence to know if high-flow therapy is a good first choice for very premature babies (born before 28 weeks of pregnancy), as very few were included in the studies."

      "content": "Babies who are born too early (preterm) often have underdeveloped lungs and can have trouble breathing. This is known as respiratory distress syndrome. To help them, they may need support with their breathing. One way to provide this support is with 'nasal high flow' therapy. This treatment delivers warm, moist air and oxygen through two small prongs that sit just inside the baby's nose. It is a form of 'non-invasive' support, meaning it does not require a breathing tube to be inserted down the baby's throat into their lungs (a process called mechanical ventilation)."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review included 13 studies involving a total of 2540 infants. The participants were preterm infants born at less than 37 weeks' gestation who had respiratory distress shortly after birth, although very few infants were extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks' gestation). The studies compared nasal high flow (nHF) therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support, specifically continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The review found no studies that compared nHF with ambient oxygen or with low flow nasal cannulae. For preterm infants needing breathing support, using nasal high flow therapy may make little to no difference to the combined risk of death or developing a chronic lung condition when compared with another type of support called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, nasal high flow therapy probably increases the risk that the treatment will fail within the first few days. For every 11 infants treated with nasal high flow therapy instead of CPAP, one additional infant will likely experience treatment failure. Despite this, this increase in treatment failure probably makes little to no difference to the number of infants who ultimately need a breathing tube inserted. On the other hand, nasal high flow therapy probably reduces the risk of injury to the infant's nose and probably reduces the risk of a collapsed lung. When compared with a different type of breathing support (nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation, or NIPPV), it is unclear if nasal high flow therapy has an effect on death or chronic lung disease because the results are very uncertain. Nasal high flow therapy probably makes little to no difference to the risk of treatment failure or the need for a breathing tube compared with NIPPV, but it probably causes a large reduction in the risk of injury to the nose."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies used different ways of delivering the treatment and did not include many very premature babies. Additionally, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022."
