  "draft": "For premature babies with breathing problems, is high-flow therapy (giving warm, moist air and oxygen through small tubes in the nose) a good first choice for breathing support?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For premature babies born after 28 weeks of pregnancy, using high-flow therapy as the first choice for breathing support probably makes little to no difference to the risk of death or developing a long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) compared to other types of breathing support.\n- Compared to a common type of breathing support called CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure), high-flow therapy leads to more treatment failures, meaning more babies need to be switched to another treatment. However, high-flow therapy also causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).\n- There is not enough evidence to know if high-flow therapy is a good first choice for very premature babies (born before 28 weeks of pregnancy), as the studies included very few of these babies.\n\nWhy did we do this review?\n\nWhat breathing problems do preterm babies have and what is nasal high flow therapy?\nBabies who are born too early (preterm) often have underdeveloped lungs and can have trouble breathing. This is known as respiratory distress syndrome. To help them, they may need breathing support. One way to provide this support is with 'nasal high flow' therapy. This treatment delivers warm, moist air and oxygen through 2 small prongs that sit just inside the baby's nose. It is a form of 'non-invasive' support, meaning it does not require doctors to insert a breathing tube down the baby's throat into their lungs (a process called mechanical ventilation).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as the first breathing support for premature babies. We compared it with other types of non-invasive breathing support, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using nasal high flow therapy against other types of non-invasive breathing support in premature babies. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 13 studies with a total of 2540 babies. The studies included premature babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) who had breathing problems soon after birth. Very few of these babies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks).\n\nThe studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other types of non-invasive breathing support: CPAP or NIPPV. We found no studies that compared high-flow therapy with giving standard oxygen or with low-flow nasal tubes.\n\nCompared with CPAP, high-flow therapy may make little to no difference to the combined risk of death or developing a long-term lung condition. However, high-flow therapy probably leads to treatment failure more often in the first few days. For every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, the treatment is likely to fail for 1 additional baby. Despite this, this increase in treatment failure probably makes little to no difference to the number of babies who need a breathing tube. On the other hand, high-flow therapy probably reduces the risk of injury to the baby's nose and the risk of a collapsed lung.\n\nCompared with a different type of breathing support (NIPPV), we are very uncertain if high-flow therapy affects the risk of death or long-term lung disease. High-flow therapy probably makes little to no difference to the risk of treatment failure or the need for a breathing tube compared with NIPPV. However, it probably greatly reduces the risk of injury to the nose.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies used different ways of delivering the treatment and did not include many very premature babies. Also, people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

I have a few suggestions to make the text even more direct and accessible for readers by simplifying some sentences and using more active language. Addressing these points will elevate the summary from good to great.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with active verbs.**\n   - **Quote:** \"Despite this, this increase in treatment failure probably makes little to no difference to the number of babies who need a breathing tube.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** This sentence relies on several nouns ('increase', 'failure', 'difference', 'number') which can make it dense and harder to process. Using more direct verbs makes the meaning clearer and the sentence more active.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"However, even though treatment failed more often, this probably did not change the number of babies who ultimately needed a breathing tube.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex phrasing in the limitations section.**\n   - **Quote:** \"Also, people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** The phrase 'may have been aware of which treatment they were getting' is an indirect way to explain a study limitation (lack of blinding). A more direct explanation is easier for readers to grasp.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received, which could have influenced the results. We also need more studies to be certain about the findings.\"\n\n3. **Use more common, everyday words.**\n   - **Quote:** \"We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n   - **Why it's problematic:** Phrases like 'rated our confidence' can feel like research jargon. Explaining the concept in simpler terms helps build reader trust and understanding.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We compared and summarized the results of these studies to see what the overall evidence says. We also assessed how certain we could be about the findings.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of nouns, passive constructions, and words less common in everyday language. Addressing these points will help make an already strong summary even more reader-friendly.",
