  "draft": "For premature babies with breathing problems, is high-flow therapy (giving warm, moist air and oxygen through small tubes in the nose) a good first choice for breathing support?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For premature babies born after 28 weeks of pregnancy, using high-flow therapy as the first choice for breathing support probably makes little to no difference to the risk of death or developing a long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) compared to other types of breathing support.\n- Compared to a common type of breathing support called CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure), treatment with high-flow therapy fails more often, meaning more babies need to be switched to another treatment. However, high-flow therapy also causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).\n- There is not enough evidence to know if high-flow therapy is a good first choice for very premature babies (born before 28 weeks of pregnancy), as the studies included very few of these babies.\n\nWhat breathing problems do preterm babies have and what is nasal high flow therapy?\nBabies who are born too early (preterm) often have underdeveloped lungs and can have trouble breathing. This is known as respiratory distress syndrome. To help them, they may need breathing support. One way to provide this support is with 'nasal high flow' therapy. This treatment delivers warm, moist air and oxygen through 2 small prongs that sit just inside the baby's nose. It is a form of 'non-invasive' support, meaning it does not require doctors to insert a breathing tube down the baby's throat into their lungs (a process called mechanical ventilation).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as the first breathing support for premature babies. We compared it with other types of non-invasive breathing support, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using nasal high flow therapy against other types of non-invasive breathing support in premature babies. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and assessed how certain we could be about the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 13 studies with a total of 2540 babies. The studies included premature babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) who had breathing problems soon after birth. Very few of these babies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks).\n\nThe studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other types of non-invasive breathing support: CPAP or NIPPV. We found no studies that compared high-flow therapy with giving standard oxygen or with low-flow nasal tubes.\n\nCompared with CPAP, high-flow therapy may make little to no difference to the combined risk of death or developing a long-term lung condition. However, treatment with high-flow therapy probably fails more often in the first few days. For every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, the treatment is likely to fail for 1 additional baby. However, even though treatment failed more often, this probably did not change the number of babies who ultimately needed a breathing tube. On the other hand, high-flow therapy probably causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung.\n\nCompared with a different type of breathing support (NIPPV), we are very uncertain if high-flow therapy affects the risk of death or long-term lung disease. High-flow therapy probably makes little to no difference to the risk of treatment failure or the need for a breathing tube compared with NIPPV. However, it probably causes much less injury to the nose.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies used different ways of delivering the treatment and did not include many very premature babies. Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received, which could have influenced the results. We also need more studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it is NOT_APPROVED because a few key areas can be made clearer for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\n\n1. **Make the first key message easier to digest.** The first bullet point is long and packed with technical terms, which can be overwhelming for readers at the very start.\n   - **Current sentence:** \"For premature babies born after 28 weeks of pregnancy, using high-flow therapy as the first choice for breathing support probably makes little to no difference to the risk of death or developing a long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) compared to other types of breathing support.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Break it into two shorter sentences or simplify the wording. For example: \"For premature babies born after 28 weeks, using high-flow therapy first probably does not change their risk of death or long-term lung problems. This outcome was similar when compared to other types of breathing support.\"\n\n2. **Use more direct, active language to explain concepts.** Some explanations are a bit wordy or use noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations), which can make them less clear.\n   - **Current sentence:** \"It is a form of 'non-invasive' support, meaning it does not require doctors to insert a breathing tube down the baby's throat into their lungs (a process called mechanical ventilation).\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase to be more direct. For example: \"This is 'non-invasive' support, meaning doctors do not need to insert a breathing tube down the baby's throat. Putting in a breathing tube is called mechanical ventilation.\"\n\n3. **Explain *why* the limitations matter.** In the limitations section, you mention that medical teams knew which treatment babies received, but it's not clear to a lay reader why this is a problem.\n   - **Current sentence:** \"Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received, which could have influenced the results.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Briefly explain the concept of bias. For example: \"Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received. This knowledge could have unintentionally influenced their actions or the study's results, creating a risk of bias.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:** Your draft is very readable overall, but the analysis shows a high number of complex words (Dale-Chall beyond 90th percentile) and noun-heavy sentences (nominalizations and nouns in the 90th percentile). The suggestions above will help address these specific patterns and make an already good summary even better.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical patterns in most areas, with 72% of metrics in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence structure. The number of nouns, Dale-Chall complex words, nominalizations, and passive voice constructions are all higher than is typical for a PLS, suggesting the text could be simplified by using more common words and active, verb-driven sentences."
