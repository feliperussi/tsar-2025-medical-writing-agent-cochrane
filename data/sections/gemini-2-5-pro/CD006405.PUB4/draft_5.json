  "draft": "For premature babies with breathing problems, is high-flow therapy (giving warm, moist air and oxygen through small tubes in the nose) a good first choice for breathing support?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For premature babies born after 28 weeks, using high-flow therapy first probably makes little to no difference to their risk of death or developing a long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) compared to other types of breathing support.\n- Compared to a common type of breathing support called CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure), high-flow therapy fails more often, meaning more babies need to be switched to another treatment. However, high-flow therapy also causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).\n- There is not enough evidence to know if high-flow therapy is a good first choice for very premature babies (born before 28 weeks of pregnancy), as the studies included very few of these babies.\n\nWhat breathing problems do preterm babies have and what is nasal high flow therapy?\nBabies who are born too early (preterm) often have underdeveloped lungs and can have trouble breathing. Doctors call this respiratory distress syndrome. To help them, they may need breathing support. One way to provide this support is with 'nasal high flow' therapy. This treatment delivers warm, moist air and oxygen through 2 small prongs that sit just inside the baby's nose. This is 'non-invasive' support, meaning doctors do not need to insert a breathing tube down the baby's throat into their lungs (a process called mechanical ventilation).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as the first breathing support for premature babies. We compared it with other types of non-invasive breathing support, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using nasal high flow therapy against other types of non-invasive breathing support in premature babies. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 13 studies with a total of 2540 babies. The studies included premature babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) who had breathing problems soon after birth. Very few of these babies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks).\n\nThe studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other types of non-invasive breathing support: CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure) or NIPPV. We found no studies that compared high-flow therapy with giving standard oxygen or with low-flow nasal tubes.\n\nCompared with CPAP, high-flow therapy may make little to no difference to the risk of death or developing a long-term lung condition. However, high-flow therapy probably fails more often in the first few days. For every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, one more baby is likely to have the treatment fail.\n\nEven though treatment failed more often, this probably did not change the number of babies who ultimately needed a breathing tube. On the other hand, high-flow therapy probably causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung.\n\nCompared with a different type of breathing support (NIPPV), we are very uncertain if high-flow therapy affects the risk of death or long-term lung disease. High-flow therapy probably makes little to no difference to the risk of treatment failure or the need for a breathing tube compared with NIPPV. However, it probably causes much less injury to the nose.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because the studies used different ways of delivering the treatment and did not include many very premature babies. Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received. This could have unintentionally influenced how they cared for the babies, which might have affected the study's results. We also need more studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

The summary is not approved at this stage because there are a few opportunities to further improve clarity and readability by simplifying sentence structures and word choices, which will make the text even more accessible to a lay audience.\n\nHere are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n**1. Simplify wordy and indirect phrasing.** Some sentences can be made more direct by using stronger verbs and fewer nouns.\n*   **Quote:** 'Even though treatment failed more often, this probably did not change the number of babies who ultimately needed a breathing tube.'\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase 'did not change the number of babies who ultimately needed' is indirect and wordy.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Even though treatment with high-flow therapy failed more often, a similar number of babies in both groups ultimately needed a breathing tube.'\n\n**2. Make the explanation of treatment failure more concrete.** The explanation of the statistic is good, but could be even clearer by stating the consequence of 'failure'.\n*   **Quote:** 'For every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, one more baby is likely to have the treatment fail.'\n*   **Why it's a problem:** A reader might not know what 'treatment fail' means in practice.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'This means that for every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, one extra baby's treatment will likely fail, requiring a switch to another type of support.'\n\n**3. Streamline complex sentences in the limitations section.** This section explains a complex idea (bias) that can be simplified.\n*   **Quote:** 'This could have unintentionally influenced how they cared for the babies, which might have affected the study's results.'\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly convoluted and could be more direct.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Knowing which treatment a baby received could have unintentionally changed their care, possibly affecting the study's results.'\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which noted higher-than-typical use of nouns, nominalizations, and complex words. Addressing these points will bring the summary more in line with typical PLS patterns and enhance its clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable, with most readability scores falling in the best quartile (P25/P75). However, the analysis also indicates significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure. Five metrics, including `nouns`, `complex_words_dc`, `nominalization`, `passive_voice`, and `long_words`, are in the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range, suggesting the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex or uncommon words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
