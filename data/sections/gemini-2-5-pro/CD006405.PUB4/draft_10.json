  "draft": "For premature babies with breathing problems, is high-flow therapy (giving warm, moist air and oxygen through small tubes in the nose) a good first choice for breathing support?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For babies born early (after 28 weeks), using high-flow therapy first may make little to no difference in whether they die or get a long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) compared to other types of breathing support.\n- Compared to a common type of breathing support called CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure), high-flow therapy fails more often, meaning doctors need to switch more babies to another treatment. However, high-flow therapy also causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).\n- There is not enough evidence to know if high-flow therapy is a good first choice for babies born very early (before 28 weeks), as the studies looked at very few of these babies.\n\nWhat breathing problems do preterm babies have and what is nasal high flow therapy?\nBabies who are born too early (preterm) often have lungs that are not fully formed and can have trouble breathing. Doctors call this respiratory distress syndrome. To help them, they may need breathing support. One way to give this support is with 'nasal high flow' therapy. This treatment sends warm, moist air and oxygen through 2 small prongs that sit just inside the baby's nose. This is 'non-invasive' support, meaning doctors do not need to put a breathing tube down the baby's throat into their lungs (which is called mechanical ventilation).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as the first breathing support for babies born early. We compared it with other types of non-invasive breathing support, such as CPAP (which gives continuous air pressure) and NIPPV (which gives breaths of air at set times).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using nasal high flow therapy against other types of non-invasive breathing support in babies born early. We looked at and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review looked at 13 studies with a total of 2540 babies. The studies included babies born early (before 37 weeks) who had trouble breathing soon after birth. Very few of these babies were born extremely early (before 28 weeks).\n\nThe studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other types of non-invasive breathing support: CPAP or NIPPV. We found no studies that compared high-flow therapy with giving standard oxygen or with low-flow nasal tubes.\n\nCompared with CPAP, high-flow therapy may make little to no difference in whether babies die or get a long-term lung condition. However, high-flow therapy probably fails more often in the first few days. This means for every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, one will likely need to switch to another support when the first treatment doesn't work.\n\nAlthough high-flow therapy failed more often, a similar number of babies in both groups needed a breathing tube in the end. On the other hand, high-flow therapy probably causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung.\n\nCompared with a different type of breathing support (NIPPV), we are very uncertain if high-flow therapy changes whether babies die or develop long-term lung disease. High-flow therapy probably makes little to no difference to how often the treatment fails or to how many babies need a breathing tube compared with NIPPV. However, it probably causes much less injury to the nose.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because the studies used different ways of giving the treatment and did not include many very early babies. Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received. Knowing which treatment a baby received could have influenced the care they were given and affected the results. We also need more studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Make sentences more direct by using the active voice.** The summary has a high number of passive sentences, which can make it harder to understand who is doing what. This is especially important in the limitations section.\n    *   **Instead of:** 'Knowing which treatment a baby received could have influenced the care they were given and affected the results.'\n    *   **Consider this:** 'If the medical teams knew which treatment a baby was getting, it could have influenced the care they provided and affected the results.'\n\n2. **Simplify long, complex sentences.** Some sentences contain multiple ideas, which can be difficult to follow. Breaking them up or rephrasing can help.\n    *   **Instead of:** 'This means for every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, one will likely need to switch to another support when the first treatment doesn't work.'\n    *   **Consider this:** 'This means that for every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, one extra baby will likely have the treatment fail and need to be switched to another type of support.'\n\n3. **Use consistent terms for key concepts.** The summary uses several different phrases for the same lung condition, which could confuse readers. Using the same term consistently improves clarity.\n    *   **You use:** 'long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia)', 'long-term lung condition', and 'long-term lung disease'.\n    *   **Consider this:** After defining it the first time, stick to one phrase, such as 'this long-term lung problem', throughout the summary for consistency.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable, with most metrics (83.3%) falling in the best quartile for typical PLS patterns. The word count is within limits, and readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (8.77) are excellent. However, the analysis highlights three areas for improvement. The number of passive voice constructions (24) is significantly higher than typical (BEYOND_P90), as is the total noun count (210), which can make sentences less direct. The count of complex words from the Dale-Chall list (267) is also high (P90), suggesting some vocabulary could be simplified or standardized."
