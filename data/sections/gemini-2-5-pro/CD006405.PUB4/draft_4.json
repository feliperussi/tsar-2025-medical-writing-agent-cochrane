  "draft": "For premature babies with breathing problems, is high-flow therapy (giving warm, moist air and oxygen through small tubes in the nose) a good first choice for breathing support?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For premature babies born after 28 weeks, using high-flow therapy first probably does not change their risk of death or developing a long-term lung problem (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). This outcome was similar when compared to other types of breathing support.\n- Compared to a common type of breathing support called CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure), high-flow therapy fails more often. This means more babies need to be switched to another treatment. However, high-flow therapy also causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).\n- There is not enough evidence to know if high-flow therapy is a good first choice for very premature babies (born before 28 weeks of pregnancy), as the studies included very few of these babies.\n\nWhat breathing problems do preterm babies have and what is nasal high flow therapy?\nBabies who are born too early (preterm) often have underdeveloped lungs and can have trouble breathing. This is known as respiratory distress syndrome. To help them, they may need breathing support. One way to provide this support is with 'nasal high flow' therapy. This treatment delivers warm, moist air and oxygen through 2 small prongs that sit just inside the baby's nose. This is 'non-invasive' support, which means doctors do not need to insert a breathing tube down the baby's throat into their lungs. Inserting a breathing tube is called mechanical ventilation.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using nasal high flow therapy as the first breathing support for premature babies. We compared it with other types of non-invasive breathing support, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared using nasal high flow therapy against other types of non-invasive breathing support in premature babies. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 13 studies with a total of 2540 babies. The studies included premature babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) who had breathing problems soon after birth. Very few of these babies were extremely premature (born before 28 weeks).\n\nThe studies compared nasal high flow therapy with other types of non-invasive breathing support: CPAP (which provides continuous air pressure) or NIPPV. We found no studies that compared high-flow therapy with giving standard oxygen or with low-flow nasal tubes.\n\nCompared with CPAP, high-flow therapy may make little to no difference to the combined risk of death or developing a long-term lung condition. However, high-flow therapy probably fails more often in the first few days. For every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, the treatment is likely to fail for 1 additional baby.\n\nEven though treatment failed more often, this probably did not change the number of babies who ultimately needed a breathing tube. On the other hand, high-flow therapy probably causes less injury to the baby's nose and may reduce the risk of a collapsed lung.\n\nCompared with a different type of breathing support (NIPPV), we are very uncertain if high-flow therapy affects the risk of death or long-term lung disease. High-flow therapy probably makes little to no difference to the risk of treatment failure or the need for a breathing tube compared with NIPPV. However, it probably causes much less injury to the nose.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. This is because the studies used different ways of delivering the treatment and did not include many very premature babies. Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received. This knowledge could have unintentionally influenced their actions or the study's results, creating a risk of bias. We also need more studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

However, it can be made clearer and more direct for readers by addressing a few key areas. The main issues are the frequent use of passive voice, noun-heavy sentences, and some unnecessarily complex words, which make the text less engaging and slightly harder to read than it could be. The following 3 improvements will make the summary more accessible.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Use more active verbs and fewer abstract nouns.**\nSome sentences are difficult to follow because they rely on abstract nouns instead of direct verbs. Changing these to an active voice makes it clearer who is doing what.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received. This knowledge could have unintentionally influenced their actions or the study's results, creating a risk of bias.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is abstract and uses many nouns ('knowledge', 'actions', 'results', 'risk', 'bias'). It's not immediately clear how this affects the evidence.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Also, in some studies, the medical teams knew which treatment each baby received. This could have unintentionally influenced how they cared for the babies, which might have affected the study's results.\"\n\n**2. Replace technical phrasing with simpler, everyday language.**\nThe draft does a great job defining key terms, but some statistical language remains that could be simplified.\n\n- **Problematic phrase:** \"...high-flow therapy may make little to no difference to the **combined risk** of death or developing a long-term lung condition.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"Combined risk\" is a technical term from statistics. Readers may not understand what is being 'combined', creating confusion.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"...high-flow therapy may make little to no difference to the **risk** of death or developing a long-term lung condition.\"\n\n**3. Simplify sentence structure and word choice.**\nSome sentences contain long or uncommon words where simpler alternatives exist. Choosing more common words improves readability.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"For every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, the treatment is likely to fail for 1 **additional** baby.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** While correct, \"additional\" is a slightly more complex word than needed. Simpler phrasing can make the point just as effectively.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"For every 11 babies treated with high-flow therapy instead of CPAP, **one more** baby is likely to have the treatment fail.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of features in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary and style, with high counts for passive voice (P90), long words (P90), total nouns (Beyond P90), and complex Dale-Chall words (Beyond P90). These suggest the text could be made more direct and easier to understand by using more active verbs and simpler, more common words."
