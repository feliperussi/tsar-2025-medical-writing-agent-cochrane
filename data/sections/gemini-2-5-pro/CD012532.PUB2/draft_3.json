  "draft": "What impact do immune checkpoint inhibitors have on treating glioma?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For people with glioma (the most common and aggressive type of brain tumour), immune checkpoint inhibitors probably do not help them live longer or stop their tumour from growing. These medicines are designed to help the body's immune system fight cancer. The evidence on their serious unwanted effects was unclear.\n- We found very limited evidence from one small study that giving an immune checkpoint inhibitor before and after surgery might help people whose brain tumour has returned.\n- Because the evidence is limited and uncertain, we need larger and better-designed studies to understand if immune checkpoint inhibitors have a role in treating glioma.\n\nWhat is glioma?\n\nGlioma is a type of brain cancer. The most common and aggressive type is called glioblastoma, and people diagnosed with it have a very short life expectancy. One reason this cancer is so difficult to treat is that it suppresses the body's immune system, preventing it from fighting the cancer effectively. A type of treatment called 'immune checkpoint inhibitors' (ICIs) are drugs designed to help the immune system recognise and attack cancer cells. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies are two types of these drugs.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if using the immune checkpoint inhibitors anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 to treat adults with glioma is effective and safe. We were interested in whether these treatments helped people live longer, stopped the cancer from growing for longer, and if they caused any serious unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials. In these studies, researchers assign people to different treatment groups by chance. We looked for trials that compared immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs against other treatments or a placebo (a dummy treatment) for adults with glioma. We then compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 7 studies that included a total of 1953 adults with glioblastoma. The number of people in the studies ranged from 35 to 716. 4 studies involved people whose glioblastoma had returned, and 3 studies involved people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, including one study specifically in older adults.\n\nThe studies looked at anti-PD-1 treatments (nivolumab or pembrolizumab), given either alone or combined with other therapies. We compared these treatments against other treatments, a placebo, or different timings of the same treatment.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n\nFor people whose glioblastoma has returned, treatment with the drug nivolumab alone probably makes little to no difference to how long they live or how long they live without the cancer growing. This is compared to treatment with bevacizumab, another drug used to treat brain tumours. Giving another immune-based drug, pembrolizumab, both before and after surgery may improve how long people live, but we are very uncertain about this result. For other combinations of these treatments, it is unclear if they affect survival or cause serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, adding nivolumab to standard radiation therapy probably makes little to no difference to how long they live or how long they live without the cancer growing. When nivolumab is added to standard radiation and chemotherapy, it also probably makes little to no difference to survival, but it probably increases serious unwanted effects. It makes little to no difference to less serious unwanted effects.\n\nOverall, the evidence we reviewed does not support using these specific immune-based treatments for glioblastoma. They probably offer no benefit for survival and may increase serious unwanted effects in some situations. For many outcomes, the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results. Also, the studies included different types of people, and we did not find enough studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

The main issues are overly complex vocabulary and a writing style that is less direct than it could be. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\\n\\n1. **Simplify complex vocabulary throughout the text.** The draft uses many words that are uncommon in everyday language, which can make it harder for readers to understand the key messages.\\n   - **Example:** \\\"One reason this cancer is so difficult to treat is that it suppresses the body's immune system, preventing it from fighting the cancer effectively.\\\"\\n   - **Problem:** Words like 'suppresses' and 'effectively' add unnecessary complexity.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \\\"This cancer is hard to treat because it weakens the body's immune system, which stops it from fighting the cancer well.\\\"\\n\\n2. **Clarify the first key message by defining the key term upfront.** The current structure introduces a complex term and only defines it in the following sentence, which can confuse readers.\\n   - **Example:** \\\"For people with glioma (the most common and aggressive type of brain tumour), immune checkpoint inhibitors probably do not help them live longer or stop their tumour from growing. These medicines are designed to help the body's immune system fight cancer.\\\"\\n   - **Problem:** The definition comes after the term is used, and the sentence is long and interrupted by a parenthetical phrase.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \\\"For people with glioma (the most common and aggressive type of brain tumour), medicines called 'immune checkpoint inhibitors' probably do not help them live longer or stop their tumour from growing. These medicines are designed to help the body's immune system recognise and attack cancer cells.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Use more active and direct language.** The draft contains several passive constructions and noun-heavy phrases that make the text less engaging and harder to follow.\\n   - **Example:** \\\"The studies looked at anti-PD-1 treatments (nivolumab or pembrolizumab), given either alone or combined with other therapies.\\\"\\n   - **Problem:** The passive phrase \\\"given either alone...\\\" is less direct than an active construction.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \\\"The studies looked at anti-PD-1 treatments (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Researchers gave these drugs either alone or combined with other therapies.\\\"\\n\\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a very high number of complex words (Dale-Chall complex words are beyond the 90th percentile) and a high use of passive voice.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows a mixed profile. While many readability scores and structural elements like sentence length fall within the best quartile for a PLS, there are significant deviations from typical patterns in vocabulary and sentence construction. Specifically, the draft has a very high number of complex words according to Dale-Chall criteria (BEYOND_P90) as well as high counts of general complex words, long words, and a high SMOG index (all P90). Additionally, the use of passive voice, nominalizations, and total nouns are all in the P90 range, indicating a style that is less direct and more academic than typical for a PLS."
