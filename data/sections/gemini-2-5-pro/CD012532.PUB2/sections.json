  "plain_title": "What impact do immune checkpoint inhibitors have on treating glioma?",
  "key_messages": [
    "For people with the most common and aggressive type of brain tumour (glioma), the current evidence suggests that treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (medicines that help the body's immune system fight cancer) generally does not help them live longer or stop their tumour from growing. The evidence on serious unwanted effects was unclear.",
    "There was some very limited evidence from a single small study that giving one of these medicines before surgery, as well as after, might help people whose brain tumour has returned.",
    "Due to the limited and uncertain evidence available, larger and better-designed studies are needed to understand if immune checkpoint inhibitors have a role in treating glioma."

      "subheading": "What is glioma?",
      "content": "Glioma is a type of brain cancer. The most common and aggressive form in adults is called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and people diagnosed with it have a very short life expectancy. One reason this cancer is so difficult to treat is that it creates an environment that suppresses the body's immune system, preventing it from fighting the cancer effectively. A type of treatment called 'immune checkpoint inhibitors' (ICIs) are drugs designed to help the immune system recognise and attack cancer cells. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies are two types of these drugs."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if using the immune checkpoint inhibitors anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 to treat adults with glioma is effective and safe. We were interested in whether these treatments helped people live longer, stopped the cancer from growing for longer, and if they caused any serious unwanted effects."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies called randomised controlled trials (where people are assigned to different treatment groups by chance) that compared immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs against other treatments or a placebo for adults with glioma. We then compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included seven studies with a total of 1953 adults with grade 4 glioma. Four studies involved people with recurrent glioblastoma, and three involved people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, including one study specifically in older adults. The number of participants in the studies ranged from 35 to 716. The studies evaluated anti-PD-1 treatments (nivolumab or pembrolizumab), either alone or combined with other therapies like bevacizumab, temozolomide, or radiotherapy. These interventions were compared against other treatments, placebo, or different timings of the same treatment."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: anti-PD-1 antibodies for glioblastoma",
      "content": "For people whose glioblastoma has returned: treatment with the drug nivolumab alone, compared to another drug called bevacizumab, probably makes little to no difference to how long people live or how long they live without the cancer growing. Giving another immune-based drug, pembrolizumab, both before and after surgery may improve survival, but we are very uncertain about this result. For other combinations of these immune-based treatments, it is unclear if they have an effect on survival or serious unwanted effects. For people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma: adding nivolumab to standard radiation therapy probably makes little to no difference to how long people live or how long they live without the cancer growing. When nivolumab is added to standard radiation and chemotherapy, it also probably makes little to no difference to survival, but it probably increases serious unwanted effects. It makes little to no difference to less serious unwanted effects. Overall, the evidence does not support using these specific immune-based treatments for glioblastoma. They probably offer no benefit for survival and may increase serious unwanted effects in some situations. For many outcomes, the evidence is very uncertain."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Additionally, the studies were done in different types of people, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2024."
