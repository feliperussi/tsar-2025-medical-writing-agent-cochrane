  "draft": "What impact do immune checkpoint inhibitors have on treating glioma?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For people with glioma (the most common and aggressive type of brain tumour), immune checkpoint inhibitors probably do not help them live longer or stop their tumour from growing. These medicines are designed to help the body's immune system fight cancer. The evidence on their serious unwanted effects was unclear.\n- We found very limited evidence from one small study that giving an immune checkpoint inhibitor before and after surgery might help people whose brain tumour has returned.\n- Because the evidence is limited and uncertain, we need larger and better-designed studies to understand if immune checkpoint inhibitors have a role in treating glioma.\n\nWhat is glioma?\n\nGlioma is a type of brain cancer. The most common and aggressive form in adults is called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and people diagnosed with it have a very short life expectancy. One reason this cancer is so difficult to treat is that it suppresses the body's immune system, preventing it from fighting the cancer effectively. A type of treatment called 'immune checkpoint inhibitors' (ICIs) are drugs designed to help the immune system recognise and attack cancer cells. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies are two types of these drugs.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if using the immune checkpoint inhibitors anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 to treat adults with glioma is effective and safe. We were interested in whether these treatments helped people live longer, stopped the cancer from growing for longer, and if they caused any serious unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials. In these studies, people are assigned to different treatment groups by chance. We looked for trials that compared immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs against other treatments or a placebo (a dummy treatment) for adults with glioma. We then compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 7 studies in our review, with a total of 1953 adults with grade 4 glioma. 4 studies involved people whose glioblastoma had returned, and 3 studies involved people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, including one study specifically in older adults. The number of people in the studies ranged from 35 to 716. The studies looked at anti-PD-1 treatments (nivolumab or pembrolizumab), given either alone or combined with other therapies. We compared these treatments against other treatments, a placebo, or different timings of the same treatment.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n\nFor people whose glioblastoma has returned, we found that treatment with the drug nivolumab alone probably makes little to no difference to how long they live or how long they live without the cancer growing, when compared to another drug called bevacizumab. Giving another immune-based drug, pembrolizumab, both before and after surgery may improve how long people live, but we are very uncertain about this result. For other combinations of these treatments, it is unclear if they affect survival or cause serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, adding nivolumab to standard radiation therapy probably makes little to no difference to how long they live or how long they live without the cancer growing. When nivolumab is added to standard radiation and chemotherapy, it also probably makes little to no difference to survival, but it probably increases serious unwanted effects. It makes little to no difference to less serious unwanted effects.\n\nOverall, our review of the evidence does not support using these specific immune-based treatments for glioblastoma. They probably offer no benefit for survival and may increase serious unwanted effects in some situations. For many outcomes, the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results. Also, the studies included different types of people, and we did not find enough studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured, with excellent sentence length and readability scores. To make it even clearer for patients and more aligned with Cochrane's plain language style, I recommend focusing on three key areas:\n\n1. **Simplify complex medical terms and define key concepts.**\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"The most common and aggressive form in adults is called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)...\" and later, \"...when compared to another drug called bevacizumab.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** \"Glioblastoma multiforme\" is a very technical term for a lay audience, even with an acronym. Separately, introducing a comparison drug like \"bevacizumab\" without any context can leave readers wondering what it is (e.g., standard care, another experimental drug).\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Simplify the introduction to cancer types: \"The most common and aggressive type of glioma is called glioblastoma.\" For the comparison drug, add a brief, helpful descriptor: \"...when compared to bevacizumab, another drug used to treat brain tumours.\"\n\n2. **Use more active voice to improve clarity.**\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"In these studies, people are assigned to different treatment groups by chance.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The passive voice (\"are assigned\") is less direct and can make the text feel more formal and distant. It is not immediately clear who is performing the action.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Use the active voice to make it clear who is acting. For example: \"In these studies, researchers assign people to different treatment groups by chance.\"\n\n3. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with direct verbs.**\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Overall, our review of the evidence does not support using these specific immune-based treatments for glioblastoma.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** Phrases like \"review of the evidence\" are noun-heavy (a nominalization) and can make sentences less direct and more wordy than using a simple verb.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Use verbs instead of nouns to make the sentence more active and concise. For example: \"Overall, the evidence we reviewed does not support using these...\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a very high number of unfamiliar words (Dale-Chall score is beyond the 90th percentile) and a high use of passive voice and nominalizations (both in the 90th percentile). Addressing these points will make the summary more accessible and easier to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns in many areas, particularly readability, with 61% of metrics falling in the best quartile (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is P25). However, there is significant deviation in vocabulary complexity and sentence structure. The number of unfamiliar words (complex_words_dc) is beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the vocabulary is much more complex than a typical PLS. Additionally, metrics for passive voice, nominalizations, nouns, and complex/long words are all in the 90th percentile, suggesting the writing style is more formal and less direct than recommended."
