  "draft": "What impact do immune checkpoint inhibitors have on treating glioma?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For people with glioma (the most common and aggressive type of brain tumour), medicines called 'immune checkpoint inhibitors' probably do not help them live longer or stop their tumour from growing. These medicines help the body's immune system fight cancer. We are uncertain about their serious unwanted effects.\n- We found one small study suggesting that giving an immune checkpoint inhibitor before and after surgery might help people whose brain tumour has returned.\n- Because the evidence is limited and uncertain, we need larger and better-designed studies to find out if immune checkpoint inhibitors can help treat glioma.\n\nWhat is glioma?\n\nGlioma is a type of brain cancer. The most common and aggressive type is called glioblastoma. People diagnosed with it have a very short life expectancy. This cancer is hard to treat because it weakens the body's immune system, which stops it from fighting the cancer well. A type of medicine called an 'immune checkpoint inhibitor' (ICI) is designed to help the immune system find and attack cancer cells. Two types of these medicines are anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out if using the immune checkpoint inhibitors anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 to treat adults with glioma is effective and safe. We were interested in whether these treatments helped people live longer, stopped the cancer from growing for longer, and if they caused any serious unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\n\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials. In these studies, researchers assign people to different treatment groups by chance. We looked for trials that compared immune checkpoint inhibitor medicines against other treatments or a placebo (a dummy treatment) for adults with glioma. We then compared and summarised the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 7 studies with a total of 1953 adults with glioblastoma. The number of people in each study ranged from 35 to 716. 4 studies included people whose glioblastoma had returned. 3 studies included people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, one of which focused on older adults. The studies looked at anti-PD-1 treatments (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Researchers gave these medicines either alone or with other treatments. We compared these treatments against other treatments, a placebo, or different timings of the same treatment.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n\nFor people whose glioblastoma has returned, the medicine nivolumab alone probably makes little to no difference to how long they live, or how long they live before the cancer grows. This was compared to bevacizumab, another medicine for brain tumours. Giving a different immune medicine, pembrolizumab, both before and after surgery may help people live longer, but we are very uncertain about this result. For other combinations of these treatments, it is unclear if they affect how long people live or if they cause serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, adding nivolumab to standard radiation therapy probably makes little to no difference to how long they live or how long they live before the cancer grows. When nivolumab is added to standard radiation and chemotherapy, it also probably makes little to no difference to how long people live. However, it probably increases serious unwanted effects. It makes little to no difference to less serious unwanted effects.\n\nOverall, the evidence we reviewed does not support using these specific immune-based treatments for glioblastoma. They probably do not help people live longer and may increase serious unwanted effects in some cases. For many results, the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results. Also, the studies included different types of people, and we did not find enough studies to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThis evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it is not approved because a few key improvements are needed to make the main findings easier for readers to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Break the 'Main results' section into shorter paragraphs.** The current single paragraph is long and combines findings for two different patient groups (those with recurrent vs. newly diagnosed cancer). This makes it difficult for readers to find the information that applies to them.\n   - **Problem:** A single, dense paragraph presents findings for recurrent and newly diagnosed glioblastoma together.\n   - **Suggestion:** Split this section into two paragraphs, one for each patient group, to improve readability.\n     - **Paragraph 1 (Recurrent):** \"For people whose glioblastoma has returned, the medicine nivolumab alone probably makes little to no difference to how long they live or how long they live before the cancer grows...\"\n     - **Paragraph 2 (Newly diagnosed):** \"For people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, adding nivolumab to standard radiation therapy probably makes little to no difference to how long they live...\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex and technical phrasing.** While the readability scores are good, the vocabulary is more complex than typical for a Plain Language Summary. Replacing jargon and simplifying phrases will make the text more accessible.\n   - **Problematic Phrase:** \"...medicines called 'immune checkpoint inhibitors' probably do not help them live longer or stop their tumour from growing. These medicines help the body's immune system fight cancer.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The explanation comes after the technical term is used. It's clearer to explain the concept first.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...medicines that help the body's immune system fight cancer (called 'immune checkpoint inhibitors') probably do not help people live longer or stop their tumour from growing.\"\n\n3. **Use consistent, simple language for key health outcomes.** The summary uses several different phrases to describe the same outcome (progression-free survival), which can be confusing.\n   - **Inconsistent Phrases:** \"stop their tumour from growing\", \"stopped the cancer from growing for longer\", and \"how long they live before the cancer grows\".\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Using different terms for the same concept can make readers wonder if they mean different things.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Choose one simple phrase, like \"slow the cancer's growth\", and use it consistently throughout the text.\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary much clearer and more helpful for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft is highly readable, with excellent scores for sentence length and structure (14 of 18 metrics are in the best quartile). However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. The counts for nouns (174), complex words (122), Dale-Chall unfamiliar words (266), and long words (181) are all in the 90th percentile range, supporting the need to simplify word choices."
