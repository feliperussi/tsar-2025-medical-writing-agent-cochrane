  "draft": "For women at average risk of breast cancer, what are the benefits and harms of adding a breast ultrasound to a mammogram for screening?\n\nKey messages\n- For women at average risk of breast cancer, adding a breast ultrasound to a mammogram helps to find more breast cancers. However, this combination also leads to more women being told they might have cancer when they do not (a false-positive result), and more women having unnecessary biopsies (where a small piece of tissue is removed for testing).\n- We do not know if finding more breast cancers by adding an ultrasound to a mammogram leads to fewer deaths from breast cancer. Studies that follow women for longer are needed to answer this important question.\n\nWhy add an ultrasound to a mammogram for breast cancer screening?\nScreening with a mammogram (an X-ray of the breast) can help to find breast cancer at an early stage. Some believe that adding a breast ultrasound scan to the screening process could help find cancers that mammograms might miss (a 'false-negative' result). However, others are concerned that adding an ultrasound could also increase the number of 'false-positive' results. A false-positive result is when a test suggests cancer might be present, but it turns out not to be cancer. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety and further procedures, such as a biopsy (where a small sample of tissue is taken to be examined).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and harms of using mammograms combined with breast ultrasound versus using mammograms alone for breast cancer screening in women who are at average risk of breast cancer.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared breast cancer screening using mammography combined with ultrasonography versus mammography alone. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 8 studies involving a total of 209,207 women aged between 40 and 75 at average risk for breast cancer. The studies followed women for 1 to 3 years. The percentage of women with dense breasts in the studies ranged from 48% to 100%. The studies compared screening with mammography alone to screening with mammography combined with breast ultrasonography. None of the included studies assessed whether the combined screening approach led to lower mortality from breast cancer or any other cause.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor women at average risk of breast cancer, adding ultrasonography to mammography for screening increases the number of breast cancers found. For every 1000 women screened, this combination finds about 2 more breast cancers over 2 years compared to mammography alone. Adding ultrasonography also reduces the number of cancers that appear between screening appointments and probably reduces the number of missed cancers. For women found to have invasive cancer, this combination probably reduces the detection of cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes.\n\nHowever, adding ultrasonography also has downsides. It increases the number of incorrect results that suggest cancer is present when it is not (false-positive results). For every 1000 women without cancer, about 37 more will receive a false-positive result. This also increases the number of women who need a biopsy; for every 1000 women screened, about 27 more will have a biopsy.\n\nWe do not know if adding ultrasonography to mammography screening affects the risk of dying from breast cancer because none of the studies looked at this.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about the types of studies included and the outcomes they measured. In most of the studies, researchers did not randomly assign people to the different screening groups, which means that differences found could be due to differences between the people rather than the screening methods. Importantly, the evidence does not cover all the outcomes we were interested in, as none of the studies looked at whether adding an ultrasound to mammograms saves lives.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to May 2021.",

However, a few revisions are needed to improve clarity and readability for a patient audience before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 improvements I recommend:\n\n1. **Simplify and combine the definition of 'biopsy'.**\n   - **Problem:** The definition of a biopsy is given twice, in slightly different ways, using passive voice. This is redundant and could be confusing.\n   - **Quote 1 (Key Messages):** \"...unnecessary biopsies (where a small piece of tissue is removed for testing).\"\n   - **Quote 2 (Introduction):** \"...a biopsy (where a small sample of tissue is taken to be examined).\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Define it clearly once in the 'Key messages' section and then just use the term 'biopsy' later. Try a more active phrasing like: \"...unnecessary biopsies (where a doctor removes a small piece of tissue for testing).\"\n\n2. **Rephrase a complex sentence about cancer spread.**\n   - **Problem:** This sentence is noun-heavy and uses indirect language (\"reduces the detection of\"), making it difficult to understand quickly.\n   - **Quote:** \"For women found to have invasive cancer, this combination probably reduces the detection of cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this using a more direct, active structure that focuses on the outcome for the patient. For example: \"For women with invasive cancer, this combination probably finds the cancer earlier, before it has spread to the lymph nodes.\"\n\n3. **Make the 'Limitations' section more direct.**\n   - **Problem:** The opening sentence is a bit vague and uses abstract language that may not be clear to all readers.\n   - **Quote:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about the types of studies included and the outcomes they measured.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Start with a more concrete explanation of the issues. For example: \"We have only moderate confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Most of the studies were not designed in a way that gives the most reliable results, and they did not measure all the important outcomes.\"\n\nThese changes will help address the high use of passive voice and the high number of nouns flagged in the linguistic analysis, making an already good summary even better.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72.2% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis also flags four areas for review. The number of nouns (BEYOND_P90) is significantly higher than typical, and the use of passive voice (P90), complex Dale-Chall words (P90), and long words (P90) also deviate from the norm. These metrics support the editorial recommendation to simplify sentence structures and reduce passive constructions to improve clarity."
