  "key_messages": [
    "For women at average risk of breast cancer, adding a breast ultrasound to a mammogram helps to find more breast cancers. However, this combination also leads to more women being told they might have cancer when they do not (a false-positive result), and more women having unnecessary biopsies (where a small piece of tissue is removed for testing).",
    "We do not know if finding more breast cancers by adding an ultrasound to a mammogram leads to fewer deaths from breast cancer. Studies with a longer observation period are needed to answer this important question."

      "subheading": "Why add an ultrasound to a mammogram for breast cancer screening?",
      "content": "Screening with a mammogram (an X-ray of the breast) can help to find breast cancer at an early stage. Some believe that adding a breast ultrasound scan to the screening process could help find cancers that mammograms might miss (a 'false-negative' result). However, others are concerned that adding an ultrasound could also increase the number of 'false-positive' results. A false-positive result is when a test suggests cancer might be present, but it turns out not to be cancer. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety and further procedures, such as a biopsy (where a small sample of tissue is taken to be examined)."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included eight studies involving a total of 209,207 women aged between 40 and 75 at average risk for breast cancer. The follow-up duration for these studies ranged from one to three years. Across the studies, the proportion of women with dense breasts varied from 48% to 100%. The studies compared screening with mammography alone to screening with mammography combined with breast ultrasonography. None of the included studies assessed whether the combined screening approach led to lower mortality from breast cancer or any other cause."

      "subheading": "Main results: Adding breast ultrasonography to mammography screening for women at average risk of breast cancer",
      "content": "For women at average risk of breast cancer, adding ultrasonography to mammography for screening increases the number of breast cancers found. For every 1000 women screened, this combination finds about two more breast cancers over two years compared to mammography alone. Adding ultrasonography also reduces the number of cancers that appear between screening appointments and probably reduces the number of missed cancers. For women found to have invasive cancer, this combination probably reduces the detection of cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes.\n\nHowever, adding ultrasonography also has downsides. It increases the number of incorrect results that suggest cancer is present when it is not (false-positive results). For every 1000 women without cancer, about 37 more will receive a false-positive result. This also increases the number of women who need a biopsy; for every 1000 women screened, about 27 more will have a biopsy.\n\nWe do not know if adding ultrasonography to mammography screening affects the risk of dying from breast cancer because none of the studies looked at this."

  "limitations": "Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about the types of studies included and the outcomes they measured. In most of the studies, people were not randomly placed into the different screening groups, which means that differences found could be due to differences between the people rather than the screening methods. Importantly, the evidence does not cover all the outcomes we were interested in, as none of the studies looked at whether adding an ultrasound to mammograms saves lives.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2021 of search."
