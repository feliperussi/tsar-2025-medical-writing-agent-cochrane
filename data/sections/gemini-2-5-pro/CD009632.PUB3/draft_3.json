  "draft": "For women at average risk of breast cancer, what are the benefits and harms of adding a breast ultrasound to a mammogram for screening?\n\nKey messages\n- For women at average risk of breast cancer, adding a breast ultrasound to a mammogram helps to find more breast cancers. However, this combination also leads to more women being told they might have cancer when they do not (a false-positive result), and more women having unnecessary biopsies (where a doctor removes a small piece of tissue for testing).\n- We do not know if finding more breast cancers by adding an ultrasound to a mammogram leads to fewer deaths from breast cancer. Studies that follow women for longer are needed to answer this important question.\n\nWhy add an ultrasound to a mammogram for breast cancer screening?\nScreening with a mammogram (an X-ray of the breast) can help to find breast cancer at an early stage. Some believe that adding a breast ultrasound scan to the screening process could help find cancers that mammograms might miss (a 'false-negative' result). However, others are concerned that adding an ultrasound could also increase the number of 'false-positive' results. A false-positive result is when a test suggests cancer might be present, but it turns out not to be cancer. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety and further procedures, such as a biopsy.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and harms of using mammograms combined with breast ultrasound versus using mammograms alone for breast cancer screening in women who are at average risk of breast cancer.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared breast cancer screening using mammography combined with ultrasonography versus mammography alone. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 8 studies involving a total of 209,207 women aged between 40 and 75 at average risk for breast cancer. The studies followed women for 1 to 3 years. The percentage of women with dense breasts in the studies ranged from 48% to 100%. The studies compared screening with mammography alone to screening with mammography combined with breast ultrasonography. None of the included studies assessed whether the combined screening approach led to lower mortality from breast cancer or any other cause.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor women at average risk of breast cancer, adding ultrasonography to mammography for screening increases the number of breast cancers found. For every 1000 women screened, this combination finds about 2 more breast cancers over 2 years compared to mammography alone. Adding ultrasonography also reduces the number of cancers that appear between screening appointments and probably reduces the number of missed cancers. For women with invasive cancer, this combination probably finds the cancer earlier, before it has spread to the lymph nodes.\n\nHowever, adding ultrasonography also has downsides. It increases the number of incorrect results that suggest cancer is present when it is not (false-positive results). For every 1000 women without cancer, about 37 more will receive a false-positive result. This also increases the number of women who need a biopsy; for every 1000 women screened, about 27 more will have a biopsy.\n\nWe do not know if adding ultrasonography to mammography screening affects the risk of dying from breast cancer because none of the studies looked at this.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have only moderate confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. First, most of the studies were not designed in the most reliable way. For example, researchers did not randomly assign women to the different screening groups, which means that differences found could be due to differences between the women rather than the screening methods. Second, the studies did not measure all the important outcomes. Importantly, none of the studies looked at whether adding an ultrasound to mammograms saves lives.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe searched for evidence up to May 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, factually accurate draft that meets all critical requirements. To make it even clearer for readers, I recommend focusing on simplifying the language in a few key areas. The evaluation metrics support this, noting that the draft uses more nouns, long words, and complex vocabulary than is typical for a PLS. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify the explanation of study limitations.** The current wording is a bit academic and could be more direct.\n*   **Current text:** 'First, most of the studies were not designed in the most reliable way. For example, researchers did not randomly assign women to the different screening groups, which means that differences found could be due to differences between the women rather than the screening methods.'\n*   **Suggestion:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is moderate because of how the studies were designed. In most studies, women were not assigned to the screening groups by chance. This means any differences found might be due to differences between the women themselves, not just the screening tests.'\n\n2. **Make the key finding about cancer spread easier to understand.** The sentence about lymph nodes is medically precise but may be unclear to a lay reader who doesn't know what lymph nodes are.\n*   **Current text:** 'For women with invasive cancer, this combination probably finds the cancer earlier, before it has spread to the lymph nodes.'\n*   **Suggestion:** 'For women who had cancer that could spread, the combination of tests was more likely to find it before it reached the lymph nodes (glands near the breast).'\n\n3. **Use more direct, active language for the most important outcome.** The summary correctly states that we don't know if the extra screening saves lives, but the phrasing is a bit passive.\n*   **Current text:** 'None of the included studies assessed whether the combined screening approach led to lower mortality from breast cancer or any other cause.'\n*   **Suggestion:** 'None of the studies looked at whether using both tests saves lives by reducing deaths from breast cancer.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable, with most metrics (78%) falling into the best quartile for typical PLS. However, the analysis flags three areas for improvement related to vocabulary complexity: the number of nouns, long words (7+ characters), and words unfamiliar to a general audience (Dale-Chall complex words) are all higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
