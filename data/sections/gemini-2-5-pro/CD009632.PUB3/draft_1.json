  "draft": "For women at average risk of breast cancer, what are the benefits and harms of adding a breast ultrasound to a mammogram for screening?\n\nKey messages\n- For women at average risk of breast cancer, adding a breast ultrasound to a mammogram helps to find more breast cancers. However, this combination also leads to more women being told they might have cancer when they do not (a false-positive result), and more women having unnecessary biopsies (where a small piece of tissue is removed for testing).\n- We do not know if finding more breast cancers by adding an ultrasound to a mammogram leads to fewer deaths from breast cancer. Studies with a longer observation period are needed to answer this important question.\n\nWhy add an ultrasound to a mammogram for breast cancer screening?\nScreening with a mammogram (an X-ray of the breast) can help to find breast cancer at an early stage. Some believe that adding a breast ultrasound scan to the screening process could help find cancers that mammograms might miss (a 'false-negative' result). However, others are concerned that adding an ultrasound could also increase the number of 'false-positive' results. A false-positive result is when a test suggests cancer might be present, but it turns out not to be cancer. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety and further procedures, such as a biopsy (where a small sample of tissue is taken to be examined).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and harms of using mammograms combined with breast ultrasound versus using mammograms alone for breast cancer screening in women who are at average risk of breast cancer.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared breast cancer screening using mammography combined with ultrasonography versus mammography alone. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included eight studies involving a total of 209,207 women aged between 40 and 75 at average risk for breast cancer. The follow-up duration for these studies ranged from one to three years. Across the studies, the proportion of women with dense breasts varied from 48% to 100%. The studies compared screening with mammography alone to screening with mammography combined with breast ultrasonography. None of the included studies assessed whether the combined screening approach led to lower mortality from breast cancer or any other cause.\n\nMain results: Adding breast ultrasonography to mammography screening for women at average risk of breast cancer\nFor women at average risk of breast cancer, adding ultrasonography to mammography for screening increases the number of breast cancers found. For every 1000 women screened, this combination finds about two more breast cancers over two years compared to mammography alone. Adding ultrasonography also reduces the number of cancers that appear between screening appointments and probably reduces the number of missed cancers. For women found to have invasive cancer, this combination probably reduces the detection of cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes.\n\nHowever, adding ultrasonography also has downsides. It increases the number of incorrect results that suggest cancer is present when it is not (false-positive results). For every 1000 women without cancer, about 37 more will receive a false-positive result. This also increases the number of women who need a biopsy; for every 1000 women screened, about 27 more will have a biopsy.\n\nWe do not know if adding ultrasonography to mammography screening affects the risk of dying from breast cancer because none of the studies looked at this.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about the types of studies included and the outcomes they measured. In most of the studies, people were not randomly placed into the different screening groups, which means that differences found could be due to differences between the people rather than the screening methods. Importantly, the evidence does not cover all the outcomes we were interested in, as none of the studies looked at whether adding an ultrasound to mammograms saves lives.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs some revisions to meet our style guidelines and improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issue is that several subheadings do not follow the required question format, which is a critical style guide rule.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Rephrase Subheadings as Questions**\nSome subheadings are statements, not questions. The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help readers find information easily.\n- **Problematic Subheadings:** \"Methods\", \"Main results: Adding breast ultrasonography to mammography screening for women at average risk of breast cancer\", \"Limitations of the evidence\"\n- **Suggested Rewrites:**\n  - For \"Methods\", use: \"How did we conduct the review?\"\n  - For the long \"Main results\" heading, use: \"What were the main results?\"\n  - For \"Limitations of the evidence\", use: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n\n**2. Simplify Complex and Formal Language**\nThe text contains several long, formal words and noun-heavy sentences that can be difficult for readers to process. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows a high number of complex words, long words, and nouns compared to typical summaries.\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"The follow-up duration for these studies ranged from one to three years. Across the studies, the proportion of women with dense breasts varied from 48% to 100%.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"follow-up duration\" and \"proportion\" are formal and less common in everyday language.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies followed women for one to three years. The percentage of women with dense breasts in the studies ranged from 48% to 100%.\"\n\n**3. Convert Passive Voice to Active Voice**\nThe summary uses passive voice in several places, which can make the text less direct and harder to understand. The style guide requires using the active voice (\"we found\" instead of \"it was found\").\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"In most of the studies, people were not randomly placed into the different screening groups...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is indirect. The active voice clarifies who performed the action (or in this case, who did not).\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In most of the studies, researchers did not randomly assign people to the different screening groups...\"\n\n**4. Rephrase the Currency Statement for Clarity**\nThe final sentence is slightly awkward and uses technical phrasing.\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"The evidence is up to date to May 2021 of search.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"of search\" is jargon.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We searched for evidence up to May 2021.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns overall, with 61% of features falling in the best quartile. However, there are significant deviations in key areas that impact readability. The text has a high number of nouns, complex words, long words, and passive voice constructions, all falling in the P90 range or beyond. These metrics support the editorial feedback to simplify vocabulary and convert sentences to the active voice to improve clarity for a lay audience."
