  "draft": "Does extra educational support help children and young people with long-term health conditions to stay involved with school and keep up with their schoolwork?\n\nKey messages\n- We are uncertain if extra educational support helps children with long-term health conditions with their schoolwork or their engagement with school.\n- The support may slightly improve their mental health (for example, their self-esteem).\n- We have very little confidence in these results because we found only 4 small studies, which focused on children with cancer or ADHD.\n\nHow do long-term health conditions affect children's schooling?\nChronic (long-term) health conditions are illnesses that last for a long time and are often not cured completely. When children and adolescents have a chronic health condition, it can affect their well-being and make it hard to attend school regularly. Missing school can cause students to fall behind in their schoolwork and feel disconnected from their learning, an issue known as 'school disengagement'. Education support services aim to help these students stay connected to school and keep up with their learning, especially during periods of absence due to their illness.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if education support services are effective for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. We wanted to know if these services help improve students' engagement with school and their academic achievement (schoolwork and grades).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that tested the effects of educational support services on school engagement and academic achievement for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. We summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 4 randomised controlled studies with a total of 359 children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years with chronic health conditions (cancer or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)). The studies assessed educational support services. We are uncertain whether education support improves school engagement, academic achievement, or a child's transition back to school. However, education support may slightly improve mental health. The review did not find any studies that measured quality of life or adverse effects.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have very little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. We found only 4 small studies, which is not enough to be certain about the results. Also, the evidence focused only on children with cancer or ADHD, so the results may not apply to children with other long-term health conditions. Finally, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. This could have affected the results, because people may act or report their feelings differently when they know they are receiving a new treatment.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to February 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, clear draft that meets all critical requirements for accuracy and completeness. The readability scores are excellent. However, I am recommending a few revisions to address a consistent pattern of using noun-heavy phrases, which makes the text less direct than it could be. Addressing this and two other minor points will make the summary even more accessible to readers.\n\nHere are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n1.  **Use more active verbs instead of noun-heavy phrases.**\n    The text frequently uses noun forms of verbs (a style called 'nominalization'), which can make sentences feel more abstract and less direct. The goal is to use the verb itself whenever possible.\n    - **Example from your draft:** \"We wanted to know if these services help improve students' **engagement** with school and their academic **achievement**...\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** The key actions are turned into concepts ('engagement', 'achievement'). Using verbs makes the sentence more direct.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to know if these services help students **engage** more with school and **achieve** better results...\"\n\n2.  **Use consistent terminology for your audience.**\n    The summary switches between two different terms for the same group of people, which can be slightly confusing.\n    - **Example from your draft:** The title refers to \"children and young people,\" while the main text uses \"children and adolescents.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** Consistency helps the reader follow along without having to wonder if there's a difference in meaning. \"Children and young people\" is generally preferred for plain language.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** Please choose one term—preferably \"children and young people\"—and use it throughout the entire summary.\n\n3.  **Clarify and condense the explanation of study limitations.**\n    The explanation of bias is good, but it could be more concise and impactful.\n    - **Example from your draft:** \"Finally, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. This could have affected the results, because people may act or report their feelings differently when they know they are receiving a new treatment.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** The second sentence repeats the idea of the first, making the explanation longer than necessary.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Finally, because people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, they might have reported their feelings differently, which could have affected the results.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft is very well-written and highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 14 of 18 metrics falling in the best quartile. Readability scores are excellent. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is unusually high (27 instances, placing it in the 90th percentile), which can make sentences less direct and active. Addressing this stylistic pattern is the primary recommendation."
