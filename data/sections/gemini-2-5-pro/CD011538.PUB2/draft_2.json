  "draft": "Does extra educational support help children and young people with long-term health conditions to stay involved with school and keep up with their schoolwork?\n\nKey messages\n- We are uncertain if extra educational support helps children with long-term health conditions with their schoolwork or their engagement with school.\n- The support may slightly improve their mental health (for example, their self-esteem).\n- We have very little confidence in these results because we found only 4 small studies, which focused on children with cancer or ADHD.\n\nHow do long-term health conditions affect children's schooling?\nChronic (long-term) health conditions are illnesses that last for a long time and are often not cured completely. When children and adolescents have a chronic health condition, it can affect their well-being and make it hard to attend school regularly. Missing school can cause students to fall behind in their schoolwork and feel disconnected from their learning, an issue known as 'school disengagement'. Education support services aim to help these students stay connected to school and keep up with their learning, especially during periods of absence due to their illness.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if education support services are effective for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. We wanted to know if these services help improve students' engagement with school and their academic achievement (schoolwork and grades).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at the effects of educational support services on school engagement and academic achievement for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. We summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 4 randomised controlled studies with a total of 359 children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years with chronic health conditions (cancer or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)). The studies assessed educational support services. We are uncertain whether education support improves school engagement, academic achievement, or a child's transition back to school. However, education support may slightly improve mental health. The review did not find any studies that measured quality of life or adverse effects.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. We found only 4 small studies, which is not enough to be certain about the results. Also, the evidence focused only on children with cancer or ADHD, so the results may not apply to children with other long-term health conditions. Finally, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. This could have affected the results because knowing you are receiving a new type of support can change your behaviour or how you report your feelings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to February 2021.",

I have three suggestions to make it even stronger and more direct for the reader.\n\n**1. Make the explanation of study limitations more direct.**\nThe sentence explaining why knowing the treatment could affect results is a bit long and abstract. Using a more direct, active structure would be easier to follow.\n- **Original sentence:** 'This could have affected the results because knowing you are receiving a new type of support can change your behaviour or how you report your feelings.'\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'This could have affected the results, because people may act or report their feelings differently when they know they are receiving a new treatment.'\n\n**2. Use more consistent wording for the certainty of evidence.**\nThe summary uses two different phrases to describe the confidence in the results, which could be confusing. Using the same term consistently reinforces the message.\n- **In Key Messages:** 'We have **very little confidence** in these results...'\n- **In 'How reliable is the evidence?':** 'We have **little confidence** in the evidence...'\n- **Suggested change:** Please change 'little confidence' to '**very little confidence**' in the 'How reliable is the evidence?' section to match the key message.\n\n**3. Use a stronger, more active verb in the methods section.**\nThe phrase 'looked at the effects' is a bit vague. A more precise verb would better describe the research process.\n- **Original sentence:** 'We searched for studies that looked at the effects of educational support services...'\n- **Suggested rewrite:** 'We searched for studies that tested the effects of educational support services...'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Analysis:**\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of 'nominalizations' (26 instances). This metric indicates that converting some noun phrases to active verbs, as suggested in point #1, would align the text more closely with typical plain language style.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile. Readability scores are excellent (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 9.5). The only significant deviation is a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which suggests some sentences could be more direct and use more active verbs."
