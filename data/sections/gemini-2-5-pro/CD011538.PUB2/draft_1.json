  "draft": "Does extra educational support help children and young people with long-term health conditions to stay involved with school and keep up with their schoolwork?\n\nHow do long-term health conditions affect children's schooling?\nChronic (long-term) health conditions are illnesses that last for a long time and are often not cured completely. When children and adolescents have a chronic health condition, it can affect their well-being and make it hard to attend school regularly. Missing school can cause students to fall behind in their schoolwork and feel disconnected from their learning, an issue known as 'school disengagement'. Education support services aim to help these students stay connected to school and keep up with their learning, especially during periods of absence due to their illness.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if education support services are effective for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. We wanted to know if these services help improve students' engagement with school and their academic achievement (schoolwork and grades).\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that looked at the effects of educational support services on school engagement and academic achievement for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. We summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included four randomised controlled studies with a total of 359 children and adolescents aged four to 18 years with chronic health conditions (cancer or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)). The studies assessed educational support services. We are uncertain whether education support improves school engagement, academic achievement, or a child's transition back to school. However, education support may slightly improve mental health. The review did not find any studies that measured quality of life or adverse effects.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies that do exist were very small. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Finally, the evidence focused on specific groups of children with certain health conditions, whereas the question we wanted to answer was broader.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2021 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-written, but it cannot be approved because it fails two critical checks from the style guide. First, the mandatory 'Key messages' section is missing. Second, three of the six subheadings are not phrased as questions as required. Addressing these structural issues is the top priority.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Add the missing 'Key messages' section.** This is a required component of all Plain Language Summaries and should appear after the main title to give readers a quick overview of the main findings.\n\n2.  **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. The following subheadings need to be revised:\n    *   **Quote:** \"Methods\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"What did we do?\"\n    *   **Quote:** \"Limitations of the evidence\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"How reliable is the evidence?\"\n    *   **Quote:** \"Currency of the evidence\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n3.  **Explain *why* limitations matter to the reader.** Simply stating a limitation isn't enough; you should briefly explain its impact on the results.\n    *   **Quote:** \"It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\"\n    *   **Explanation:** This describes a risk of bias but doesn't explain why it's a problem. A reader might wonder, \"So what?\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"People in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. This could have affected the results, because knowing you are receiving a new type of support can change your behaviour or how you report your feelings.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns. 9 of 18 metrics (50%) are in the best quartile, and another 8 (44%) are in the median range. Readability scores, sentence length, and use of active voice are all strong. The primary area for improvement identified by the metrics is a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which is in the 90th percentile. This supports the general feedback to use more direct, active language where possible."
