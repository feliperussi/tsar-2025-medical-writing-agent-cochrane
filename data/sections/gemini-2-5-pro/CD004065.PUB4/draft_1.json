  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medicines for eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition that causes swelling in the food pipe)?\n\nKey messages\n\nFor people with eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition of the food pipe), medicines called corticosteroids (which reduce swelling) and biologics (which target the immune system) seem to reduce the inflammation in the food pipe. Corticosteroids may also improve symptoms, but the evidence for biologics improving symptoms was less clear.\nThe review found that people taking corticosteroids may be less likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects than those taking a placebo (a dummy treatment), while there may be no difference for biologics.\nMore research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments and to directly compare the different types of medicines against each other to find out which works best.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esoph...?\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long-term (chronic) condition that affects the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It happens when a type of white blood cell, called an eosinophil, builds up in the lining of the esophagus. This is usually caused by an allergic-type reaction and leads to inflammation, which can cause symptoms like difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, and chest pain. Because there is no cure for EoE, people need ongoing treatment. Common treatments include special diets, procedures to stretch the esophagus, and medicines like corticosteroids and newer 'biologic' drugs that target the immune system.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe different medical treatments are for people with eosinophilic esophagitis. We were interested in whether these treatments improved people's symptoms, reduced the inflammation in the esophagus, and if they caused any unwanted effects.\n\nMethods\n\nWe searched for studies that compared medical treatments or food elimination diets for eosinophilic esophagitis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another intervention. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThis review included 41 randomized controlled trials with a total of 3253 participants. The studies involved both children and adults; eleven studies focused specifically on pediatric patients. Most studies recruited patients with active eosinophilic esophagitis, while four studies were in patients with inactive disease. The review looked at 19 different intervention comparisons, with the main ones being corticosteroids versus placebo and biologics versus placebo.\n\nMain results: Corticosteroids and biologics for active eosinophilic esophagitis\n\nFor people with active eosinophilic esophagitis, this review found the following when comparing treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment):\n\nCorticosteroids\nCorticosteroids cause a large increase in histological improvement (a reduction in the number of certain white blood cells in the esophagus). For every 3 people treated, one additional person had this improvement.\nCorticosteroids may slightly increase the improvement of symptoms. For every 4 people treated, one additional person had symptom improvement.\nThe effect on the appearance of the esophagus as seen through a camera is uncertain; corticosteroids may increase it or may make little to no difference.\nCorticosteroids may slightly reduce the number of people who stop treatment due to unwanted effects.\n\nBiologics\nBiologics probably cause a large increase in histological improvement. For every 2 people treated, one additional person had this improvement. However, when measured differently, it is unclear if biologics have an effect.\nThe effect of biologics on symptoms is uncertain. They probably increase symptom improvement when measured one way, but may make little to no difference when measured another way.\nBiologics may make little to no difference to the appearance of the esophagus as seen through a camera.\nBiologics may make little to no difference in the number of people who stop treatment due to unwanted effects.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes. In addition, the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the interventions, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it fails on a critical style guide rule and needs significant improvements in clarity and word choice before it can be approved. Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a requirement. More importantly, the text uses overly complex vocabulary and noun-heavy sentences that make it difficult for a lay audience to understand. The language used to describe conflicting evidence is also too abstract.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. Several current subheadings are statements.\n    *   **Problematic Subheadings:** \"Methods\", \"Main results: Corticosteroids and biologics for active eosinophilic esophagitis\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\".\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:**\n        *   \"How did we conduct the review?\"\n        *   \"What were the main results?\"\n        *   \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n        *   \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n2.  **Replace noun-heavy phrases with active verbs.** The summary frequently uses nouns where verbs would be clearer and more direct. This makes sentences dense and hard to read.\n    *   **Problematic Sentence:** \"Corticosteroids cause a large increase in histological improvement (a reduction in the number of certain white blood cells in the esophagus).\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is built around nouns ('increase', 'improvement', 'reduction'). Using verbs makes the action clearer.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Corticosteroids greatly improve the tissue in the esophagus by reducing the number of white blood cells. (Doctors see this when they look at tissue samples under a microscope).\"\n\n3.  **Simplify complex terms and explanations.** The summary struggles to explain technical concepts in everyday language, leading to awkward phrasing or unexplained jargon.\n    *   **Problematic Sentence:** \"The effect on the appearance of the esophagus as seen through a camera is uncertain...\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is a long and clunky way to describe an endoscopy. It's better to name the procedure and explain it simply.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve how the esophagus looks during an endoscopy (when a doctor uses a thin tube with a camera to look inside it).\"\n\n4.  **Clarify what conflicting evidence means for patients.** The summary uses abstract language to describe why the evidence for biologics is uncertain, which may confuse readers.\n    *   **Problematic Sentence:** \"They probably increase symptom improvement when measured one way, but may make little to no difference when measured another way.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** \"Measured one way\" is too vague. Readers need to understand the practical difference.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The effect of biologics on symptoms is uncertain. Some studies measured *if* symptoms got better and found little difference. Other studies measured *how much* symptoms improved and found that biologics may help.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows MODERATE CONFORMITY with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics are good (e.g., average sentence length is in the best quartile), there are significant deviations that hurt readability. Six key metrics fall outside the typical range, four of them significantly (BEYOND_P90). The core issues are with vocabulary and sentence construction. The SMOG index, complex word count, and long word count are all exceptionally high, indicating the vocabulary is too technical. Most critically, the nominalization score is far beyond the typical range, confirming that the text relies heavily on abstract nouns instead of direct verbs, making it dense and difficult for patients to read."
