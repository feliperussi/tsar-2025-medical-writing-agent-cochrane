  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medicines for eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition that causes swelling in the food pipe)?\n\nKey messages\n\nFor people with eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition of the food pipe), medicines called corticosteroids (which reduce swelling) and biologics (which target the immune system) seem to reduce the inflammation in the food pipe. Corticosteroids may also improve symptoms, but the evidence for biologics improving symptoms was less clear.\nThe review found that people taking corticosteroids may be less likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects than those taking a placebo (a dummy treatment), while there may be no difference for biologics.\nMore research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments and to directly compare the different types of medicines against each other to find out which works best.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long-term (chronic) condition that affects the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It happens when a type of white blood cell, called an eosinophil, builds up in the lining of the esophagus. This is usually caused by an allergic-type reaction and leads to inflammation, which can cause symptoms like difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, and chest pain. Because there is no cure for EoE, people need ongoing treatment. Common treatments include special diets, procedures to stretch the esophagus, and medicines like corticosteroids and newer 'biologic' drugs that target the immune system.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe different medical treatments are for people with eosinophilic esophagitis. We were interested in whether these treatments improved people's symptoms, reduced the inflammation in the esophagus, and if they caused any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another treatment. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review find?\n\nThis review included 41 studies with a total of 3253 people. The studies involved both children and adults; 11 studies focused specifically on children. Most studies included people with active eosinophilic esophagitis, while 4 studies were in people with inactive disease. The review looked at 19 different treatments, but the main ones were corticosteroids versus placebo and biologics versus placebo.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n\nFor people with active eosinophilic esophagitis, this review found the following when comparing treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment):\n\nCorticosteroids\n- Corticosteroids greatly reduce inflammation in the food pipe. (Doctors see this by looking at tissue samples under a microscope and counting the number of white blood cells). For every 3 people treated, the inflammation in 1 additional person was reduced.\n- Corticosteroids may also slightly improve symptoms. For every 4 people treated, the symptoms of 1 additional person improved.\n- We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve how the food pipe looks during an endoscopy (when a doctor uses a thin tube with a camera to look for swelling or other signs of inflammation). The evidence was not clear enough to say if the treatment reduced these signs.\n- People taking corticosteroids may be slightly less likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects.\n\nBiologics\n- Biologics probably also greatly reduce inflammation in the food pipe. For every 2 people treated, the inflammation in 1 additional person was reduced. However, when studies measured *how much* the inflammation was reduced, the effect was unclear.\n- The effect of biologics on symptoms is uncertain. Some studies measured the *amount* symptoms improved and suggested biologics may help. However, other studies that measured only *if* symptoms improved found little to no difference.\n- Biologics may make little to no difference to how the food pipe looks during an endoscopy (when a doctor uses a thin tube with a camera to look for swelling or other signs of inflammation).\n- People taking biologics are probably just as likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects as people taking a placebo.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes. Also, the studies included different types of people and used different treatment methods, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and length. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issue is that the text is dense and difficult to read due to a high number of complex words and noun-heavy sentence structures (nominalizations). This makes the key findings harder to understand than they need to be. Focusing on using simpler words and more direct, verb-based sentences will significantly improve readability.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace complex noun phrases with simpler verbs.** The heavy use of nouns instead of verbs makes sentences abstract and harder to follow. This is the most important change needed to improve clarity.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"This is usually caused by an allergic-type reaction and leads to inflammation, which can cause symptoms like difficulty swallowing...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"leads to inflammation\" is a nominalization. Using a direct verb is simpler and more active.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This allergic-type reaction causes inflammation, leading to symptoms like difficulty swallowing...\"\n\n2. **Simplify vocabulary and reduce wordiness.** Some sentences use more complex words than necessary or add extra phrases that don't improve understanding.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve how the food pipe looks during an endoscopy... The evidence was not clear enough to say if the treatment reduced these signs.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The second sentence repeats the first. Stating uncertainty once is sufficient and more concise.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve how the food pipe looks during an endoscopy..., as the evidence was not clear.\"\n\n3. **Avoid repeating lengthy explanations.** The explanation for 'endoscopy' is helpful, but it is repeated verbatim later in the text, which is unnecessary and makes the summary longer.\n   - **Problematic text:** The full parenthetical explanation \"(when a doctor uses a thin tube with a camera to look for swelling or other signs of inflammation)\" is used twice.\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Readers only need to see the explanation once. Repeating it interrupts the flow of the text.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Define endoscopy the first time it appears, and then simply use the word \"endoscopy\" in subsequent mentions.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show a mixed profile. The summary performs very well on structural metrics like sentence length (words_per_sentence: P25) and active voice use (active_voice: P75), resulting in good overall readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade: P25). However, there are significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and word choice. Five metrics are in the 'BEYOND_P90' range, indicating much higher complexity than is typical. The most critical deviations are in 'nominalization' (36 vs. median of <13) and 'nouns' (208 vs. median of <116), alongside high counts for 'complex_words', 'long_words', and 'complex_words_dc'. This suggests the summary relies too heavily on technical, noun-based language, which undermines its otherwise good structure."
