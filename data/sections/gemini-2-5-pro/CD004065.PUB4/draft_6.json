  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medicines for eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition that causes swelling in the food pipe)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For people with eosinophilic esophagitis, medicines called corticosteroids (which reduce swelling) and biologics (which target the immune system) seem to reduce swelling in the food pipe. Corticosteroids may also improve symptoms, but we are uncertain if biologics do.\n- People taking corticosteroids may be less likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects than those taking a placebo (a dummy treatment), while there may be no difference for people taking biologics.\n- More research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments and to compare them directly to find out which works best.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long-term condition that affects the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It happens when a type of white blood cell, called an eosinophil, builds up in the lining of the esophagus. This allergic reaction causes swelling (inflammation), which can lead to symptoms like difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, and chest pain. Because there is no cure for EoE, people need ongoing treatment. Common treatments include special diets, procedures to stretch the esophagus, and medicines like corticosteroids and newer 'biologic' drugs that target the immune system.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe different medicines are for people with EoE. We looked at whether these treatments improved symptoms, reduced swelling in the food pipe, and caused any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared medical treatments for EoE against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another treatment. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review find?\n\nThis review included 41 studies with a total of 3253 people. The studies involved both children and adults; 11 studies focused specifically on children. Most studies included people with active EoE, while 4 studies were in people with inactive disease. The review looked at 19 different treatments, but the main ones were corticosteroids versus placebo and biologics versus placebo.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n\nFor people with active EoE, this review found the following when comparing treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment):\n\nCorticosteroids\n- Corticosteroids greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe. This means there were fewer of the white blood cells that cause the swelling. For every 3 people treated, 1 extra person had their swelling reduced.\n- Corticosteroids may also slightly improve symptoms. For every 4 people treated, 1 extra person felt their symptoms improve.\n- We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve the appearance of the food pipe when viewed with a camera (endoscopy).\n- People who take corticosteroids may be slightly less likely to stop treatment because of unwanted effects.\n\nBiologics\n- Biologics probably also greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe. For every 2 people treated, 1 extra person had their swelling reduced. However, the evidence was less clear about *how much* the swelling was reduced.\n- We are uncertain if biologics improve symptoms. The evidence was mixed, with some studies showing a benefit and others showing little to no difference compared to a dummy treatment. More research is needed to be sure.\n- Biologics may make little to no difference to the appearance of the food pipe when viewed with a camera (endoscopy).\n- People who take biologics are probably just as likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects as people who take a placebo.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. There were not enough studies to be certain about all the results. Also, the studies included different types of people and used different ways to give the treatments. This makes it hard to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. All critical checks have passed. However, it is NOT_APPROVED because a few key areas could be made clearer for a patient audience. My feedback focuses on simplifying some dense paragraphs and clarifying the language around the main findings and their limitations. These changes will help address the vocabulary complexity identified in the linguistic analysis.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Explain key medical terms more clearly in the results.** The explanation for how corticosteroids work is a bit vague and disconnected from the introduction.\n    *   **Current text:** 'Corticosteroids greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe. This means there were fewer of the white blood cells that cause the swelling.'\n    *   **Problem:** This doesn't explicitly name the 'eosinophils' that were defined in the introduction, making the link less clear.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Corticosteroids greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe by lowering the number of eosinophils (the white blood cells that cause the inflammation).'\n\n2. **Simplify dense, noun-heavy paragraphs.** The paragraph describing the included studies is packed with numbers and technical terms, making it hard to digest. This is supported by the metric analysis, which shows high counts for nouns and long words.\n    *   **Current text:** 'This review included 41 studies with a total of 3253 people. The studies involved both children and adults; 11 studies focused specifically on children. Most studies included people with active EoE, while 4 studies were in people with inactive disease. The review looked at 19 different treatments, but the main ones were corticosteroids versus placebo and biologics versus placebo.'\n    *   **Problem:** This is a 'wall of text' that could be broken up to improve readability.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:**\n        'We found 41 studies that included 3253 people with EoE.\n        - The studies included both children and adults (11 studies focused only on children).\n        - Most people had 'active' EoE, meaning their symptoms were present. 4 studies looked at people with 'inactive' disease (symptoms were under control).\n        - We focused on the two main treatments compared against a placebo: corticosteroids and biologics.'\n\n3. **Make the limitations of the evidence more specific.** The current explanation is generic and could be more helpful by connecting it to the results the reader has just seen.\n    *   **Current text:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is low. There were not enough studies to be certain about all the results. Also, the studies included different types of people and used different ways to give the treatments. This makes it hard to draw firm conclusions.'\n    *   **Problem:** This is too general. The reader knows from the results that uncertainty was often caused by *how* things were measured.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is low to moderate. This is because some results were based on a small number of studies. Also, studies often measured outcomes in different ways (for example, by counting *if* people improved versus measuring *how much* they improved). This made it hard to combine their results and draw firm conclusions.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with over 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. Sentence length and structure are excellent. However, the analysis flags five metrics for potential improvement, all related to vocabulary complexity: nominalization (use of noun forms instead of verbs), total nouns, SMOG index, complex words (Dale-Chall), and long words. This suggests that while sentences are short, the word choice could be simpler and more direct to improve clarity for a lay audience."
