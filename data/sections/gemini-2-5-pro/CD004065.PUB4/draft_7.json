  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medicines for eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition that causes swelling in the food pipe)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For people with eosinophilic esophagitis, medicines called corticosteroids (which reduce swelling) and biologics (which target the immune system) seem to reduce swelling in the food pipe. Corticosteroids may also improve symptoms, but we are uncertain if biologics do.\n- People taking corticosteroids may be less likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects than those taking a placebo (a dummy treatment), while there may be no difference for people taking biologics.\n- More research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments and to compare them directly to find out which works best.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long-term condition that affects the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It happens when a type of white blood cell, called an eosinophil, builds up in the lining of the esophagus. This allergic reaction causes swelling (inflammation), which can lead to symptoms like difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, and chest pain. Because there is no cure for EoE, people need ongoing treatment. Common treatments include special diets, procedures to stretch the esophagus, and medicines like corticosteroids and newer 'biologic' drugs that target the immune system.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe different medicines are for people with EoE. We looked at whether these treatments improved symptoms, reduced swelling in the food pipe, and caused any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared medical treatments for EoE against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another treatment. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review find?\n\nWe found 41 studies that included 3253 people with EoE.\n- The studies included both children and adults (11 studies focused only on children).\n- Most people had 'active' EoE, meaning their symptoms were present. 4 studies looked at people with 'inactive' disease, where symptoms were under control.\n- The review looked at 19 different treatments, but we focused on the two main ones compared against a placebo: corticosteroids and biologics.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n\nFor people with active EoE, this review found the following when comparing treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment):\n\nCorticosteroids\n- Corticosteroids greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe by lowering the number of eosinophils (the white blood cells that cause the inflammation). For every 3 people treated, 1 extra person had their swelling reduced.\n- Corticosteroids may also slightly improve symptoms. For every 4 people treated, 1 extra person felt their symptoms improve.\n- We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve the appearance of the food pipe when viewed with a camera (endoscopy).\n- People who take corticosteroids may be slightly less likely to stop treatment because of unwanted effects.\n\nBiologics\n- Biologics probably also greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe. For every 2 people treated, 1 extra person had their swelling reduced. However, the evidence was less clear about *how much* the swelling was reduced.\n- We are uncertain if biologics improve symptoms. The evidence was mixed, with some studies showing a benefit and others showing little to no difference compared to a dummy treatment. More research is needed to be sure.\n- Biologics may make little to no difference to the appearance of the food pipe when viewed with a camera (endoscopy).\n- People who take biologics are probably just as likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects as people who take a placebo.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is low to moderate. This is because some results were based on a small number of studies. Also, studies often measured outcomes in different ways (for example, by counting *if* people improved versus measuring *how much* they improved). This made it hard to combine their results and draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. The readability scores are excellent. To make it even clearer for patients, I have three suggestions focusing on making the language more direct and active.\n\n1. **Use Verbs Instead of Nouns to Make Sentences More Direct**\nThe summary often uses noun forms of verbs (a style called 'nominalization'), which can make sentences feel dense and less active. Converting these back to verbs will make the text easier to follow. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows a very high number of nominalizations and nouns compared to typical summaries.\n\n*   **Example:** \"This allergic reaction causes swelling (inflammation), which can lead to symptoms like difficulty swallowing...\"\n*   **Problem:** \"reaction\" and \"swelling\" are nouns. Using verbs makes the cause-and-effect clearer.\n*   **Suggestion:** \"This allergic response inflames the food pipe, which can make it hard to swallow...\"\n\n2. **Clarify Why Evidence is 'Mixed' Within the Results Section**\nYou correctly state that the evidence for biologics improving symptoms is uncertain or mixed. You explain why in the 'Limitations' section, but readers would benefit from hearing the reason immediately.\n\n*   **Quote:** \"We are uncertain if biologics improve symptoms. The evidence was mixed, with some studies showing a benefit and others showing little to no difference compared to a dummy treatment.\"\n*   **Problem:** This leaves the reader wondering *why* the evidence is mixed.\n*   **Suggestion:** Add the reason right here. For example: \"We are uncertain if biologics improve symptoms because studies measured this in different ways, which gave mixed results. Some studies showed a benefit, while others showed little to no difference compared to a dummy treatment.\"\n\n3. **Simplify Wordy Phrases**\nSome phrases can be more concise, which helps improve readability. The analysis flagged a high number of long and complex words, and simplifying phrases can help address this.\n\n*   **Quote:** \"...greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe by lowering the number of eosinophils (the white blood cells that cause the inflammation).\"\n*   **Problem:** The explanation is a bit long and repeats information from the introduction.\n*   **Suggestion:** \"...greatly reduce swelling by lowering the number of the white blood cells (eosinophils) that cause it.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 72% of features falling in the best quartile for readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, words per sentence). However, there is significant deviation from typical patterns in metrics related to writing style. 'Nominalization' (using nouns instead of verbs) is beyond the 90th percentile, and related metrics like 'nouns', 'long_words', and 'complex_words_dc' are also in the P90 range. This indicates the text is dense and could be made more direct and active."
