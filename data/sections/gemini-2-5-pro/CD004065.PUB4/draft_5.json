  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medicines for eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition that causes swelling in the food pipe)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For people with eosinophilic esophagitis, medicines called corticosteroids (which reduce swelling) and biologics (which target the immune system) seem to reduce swelling in the food pipe. Corticosteroids may also improve symptoms, but we are uncertain if biologics do.\n- People taking corticosteroids may be less likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects than those taking a placebo (a dummy treatment), while there may be no difference for people taking biologics.\n- More research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments and to compare them directly to find out which works best.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long-term condition that affects the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It happens when a type of white blood cell, called an eosinophil, builds up in the lining of the esophagus. This allergic reaction causes swelling (inflammation), which can lead to symptoms like difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, and chest pain. Because there is no cure for EoE, people need ongoing treatment. Common treatments include special diets, procedures to stretch the esophagus, and medicines like corticosteroids and newer 'biologic' drugs that target the immune system.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe different medicines are for people with eosinophilic esophagitis. We looked at whether these treatments improved symptoms, reduced swelling in the food pipe, and caused any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another treatment. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review find?\n\nThis review included 41 studies with a total of 3253 people. The studies involved both children and adults; 11 studies focused specifically on children. Most studies included people with active eosinophilic esophagitis, while 4 studies were in people with inactive disease. The review looked at 19 different treatments, but the main ones were corticosteroids versus placebo and biologics versus placebo.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n\nFor people with active eosinophilic esophagitis, this review found the following when comparing treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment):\n\nCorticosteroids\n- Corticosteroids greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe. Doctors confirm this by looking at tissue samples under a microscope to count the white blood cells that cause the swelling. For every 3 people treated, 1 extra person had their swelling reduced.\n- Corticosteroids may also slightly improve symptoms. For every 4 people treated, 1 extra person felt their symptoms improve.\n- We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve the appearance of the food pipe. Doctors check this using an endoscopy (a thin tube with a camera) to look for swelling, but the evidence was not clear.\n- People who take corticosteroids may be slightly less likely to stop treatment because of unwanted effects.\n\nBiologics\n- Biologics probably also greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe. For every 2 people treated, 1 extra person had their swelling reduced. However, when studies measured *how much* the swelling was reduced, the results were unclear.\n- We are uncertain if biologics improve symptoms. Some studies looked at *whether* symptoms improved and found little to no difference compared to a dummy treatment. Other studies measured *how much* symptoms improved and suggested biologics may help. Because the studies show different results, we need more research to be sure.\n- Biologics may make little to no difference to the appearance of the food pipe when viewed with a camera (endoscopy).\n- People who take biologics are probably just as likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects as people who take a placebo.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. There were not enough studies to be certain about all the results. Also, the studies included different types of people and used different ways to give the treatments. This makes it hard to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that is well-structured and factually accurate. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience, as some of the language is too technical and the explanation of key results could be confusing. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify Complex Language and Use Abbreviations.**\n   - **Problem:** The full term \"eosinophilic esophagitis\" is used repeatedly throughout the text. This long, technical term makes sentences harder to read. Standard practice is to define an abbreviation once and then use it.\n   - **Suggestion:** In the first sentence of the \"What is eosinophilic esophagitis?\" section, introduce the abbreviation. Then, use \"EoE\" for all subsequent mentions.\n   - **Example Rewrite:** Change \"Eosinophilic ...\" and then use \"EoE\" throughout the rest of the summary.\n\n2. **Clarify Confusing Explanations of Results.**\n   - **Problem:** The summary tries to explain the difference between two ways of measuring outcomes (e.g., *if* something improved vs. *how much* it improved), but the wording is likely to confuse readers. It creates apparent contradictions.\n   - **Quote 1:** \"Biologics probably also greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe. ... However, when studies measured *how much* the swelling was reduced, the results were unclear.\"\n   - **Quote 2:** \"We are uncertain if biologics improve symptoms. Some studies looked at *whether* symptoms improved and found little to no difference... Other studies measured *how much* symptoms improved and suggested biologics may help.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase these sections to more clearly distinguish between the two types of measurement without sounding contradictory.\n   - **Example Rewrite for Quote 1:** \"Biologics also reduce swelling in the food pipe. When studies checked *if* swelling was reduced, they found a clear benefit. However, when they tried to measure *how much* the swelling was ...\"\n\n3. **Reduce Noun-Heavy Phrases and Procedural Detail.**\n   - **Problem:** Some sentences contain unnecessary procedural details that add complexity. The text relies heavily on nouns rather than direct verbs, making it less engaging and harder to read.\n   - **Quote:** \"Doctors confirm this by looking at tissue samples under a microscope to count the white blood cells that cause the swelling.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Focus on the outcome for the patient, not the detailed medical procedure. Replace noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs.\n   - **Example Rewrite:** Instead of explaining the microscopic process, you could simplify the point: \"This means there were fewer of the white blood cells that cause the swelling.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:** Your draft's readability scores are generally good, but the vocabulary analysis shows significant deviation from typical PLS patterns. The scores for complex words, long words, and nouns are all very high (in the 90th percentile or beyond), which supports the need to simplify technical terms and rephrase complex sentences.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While sentence-level metrics like length and active voice are strong (in the best quartile), vocabulary complexity is a significant issue. Six key metrics—`nominalization`, `nouns`, `smog_index`, `complex_words`, `complex_words_dc`, and `long_words`—deviate from the typical range for a PLS (rated P90 or BEYOND_P90). This indicates the text's vocabulary is more technical and noun-heavy than is typical for this format, which could impact reader understanding."
