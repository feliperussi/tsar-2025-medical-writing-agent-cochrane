  "key_messages": [
    "For people with eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition of the food pipe), medicines called corticosteroids (which reduce swelling) and biologics (which target the immune system) seem to reduce the inflammation in the food pipe. Corticosteroids may also improve symptoms, but the evidence for biologics improving symptoms was less clear.",
    "The review found that people taking corticosteroids may be less likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects than those taking a placebo (a dummy treatment), while there may be no difference for biologics.",
    "More research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments and to directly compare the different types of medicines against each other to find out which works best."

      "content": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long-term (chronic) condition that affects the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It happens when a type of white blood cell, called an eosinophil, builds up in the lining of the esophagus. This is usually caused by an allergic-type reaction and leads to inflammation, which can cause symptoms like difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, and chest pain. Because there is no cure for EoE, people need ongoing treatment. Common treatments include special diets, procedures to stretch the esophagus, and medicines like corticosteroids and newer 'biologic' drugs that target the immune system."

      "content": "We wanted to find out how effective and safe different medical treatments are for people with eosinophilic esophagitis. We were interested in whether these treatments improved people's symptoms, reduced the inflammation in the esophagus, and if they caused any unwanted effects."

      "content": "This review included 41 randomized controlled trials with a total of 3253 participants. The studies involved both children and adults; eleven studies focused specifically on pediatric patients. Most studies recruited patients with active eosinophilic esophagitis, while four studies were in patients with inactive disease. The review looked at 19 different intervention comparisons, with the main ones being corticosteroids versus placebo and biologics versus placebo."

      "content": "For people with active eosinophilic esophagitis, this review found the following when comparing treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment):\n\n**Corticosteroids**\n*   Corticosteroids cause a large increase in histological improvement (a reduction in the number of certain white blood cells in the esophagus). For every 3 people treated, one additional person had this improvement.\n*   Corticosteroids may slightly increase the improvement of symptoms. For every 4 people treated, one additional person had symptom improvement.\n*   The effect on the appearance of the esophagus as seen through a camera is uncertain; corticosteroids may increase it or may make little to no difference.\n*   Corticosteroids may slightly reduce the number of people who stop treatment due to unwanted effects.\n\n**Biologics**\n*   Biologics probably cause a large increase in histological improvement. For every 2 people treated, one additional person had this improvement. However, when measured differently, it is unclear if biologics have an effect.\n*   The effect of biologics on symptoms is uncertain. They probably increase symptom improvement when measured one way, but may make little to no difference when measured another way.\n*   Biologics may make little to no difference to the appearance of the esophagus as seen through a camera.\n*   Biologics may make little to no difference in the number of people who stop treatment due to unwanted effects."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes. In addition, the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the interventions, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2023."
