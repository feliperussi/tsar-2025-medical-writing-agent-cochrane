  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medicines for eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition that causes swelling in the food pipe)?\n\nKey messages\n\nFor people with eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition of the food pipe), medicines called corticosteroids (which reduce swelling) and biologics (which target the immune system) seem to reduce the inflammation in the food pipe. Corticosteroids may also improve symptoms, but the evidence for biologics improving symptoms was less clear.\nThe review found that people taking corticosteroids may be less likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects than those taking a placebo (a dummy treatment), while there may be no difference for biologics.\nMore research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments and to directly compare the different types of medicines against each other to find out which works best.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long-term (chronic) condition that affects the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It happens when a type of white blood cell, called an eosinophil, builds up in the lining of the esophagus. This is usually caused by an allergic-type reaction and leads to inflammation, which can cause symptoms like difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, and chest pain. Because there is no cure for EoE, people need ongoing treatment. Common treatments include special diets, procedures to stretch the esophagus, and medicines like corticosteroids and newer 'biologic' drugs that target the immune system.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe different medical treatments are for people with eosinophilic esophagitis. We were interested in whether these treatments improved people's symptoms, reduced the inflammation in the esophagus, and if they caused any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another treatment. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review find?\n\nThis review included 41 studies with a total of 3253 people. The studies involved both children and adults; 11 studies focused specifically on children. Most studies included people with active eosinophilic esophagitis, while 4 studies were in people with inactive disease. The review looked at 19 different treatments, but the main ones were corticosteroids versus placebo and biologics versus placebo.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n\nFor people with active eosinophilic esophagitis, this review found the following when comparing treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment):\n\nCorticosteroids\n- Corticosteroids greatly reduce inflammation in the food pipe. (Doctors see this by looking at tissue samples under a microscope and counting the number of white blood cells). For every 3 people treated, 1 additional person had this improvement.\n- Corticosteroids may also slightly improve symptoms. For every 4 people treated, 1 additional person had symptom improvement.\n- We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve how the food pipe looks during an endoscopy (when a doctor uses a thin tube with a camera to look inside it).\n- People taking corticosteroids may be slightly less likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects.\n\nBiologics\n- Biologics probably also greatly reduce inflammation in the food pipe. For every 2 people treated, 1 additional person had this improvement. However, when studies measured *how much* the inflammation was reduced, the effect was unclear.\n- The effect of biologics on symptoms is uncertain. Some studies measured *how much* symptoms improved and found that biologics may help. But other studies that measured *if* symptoms got better at all found little to no difference.\n- Biologics may make little to no difference to how the food pipe looks during an endoscopy.\n- People taking biologics are probably just as likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects as people taking a placebo.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes. Also, the studies included different types of people and used different treatment methods, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use active verbs instead of nouns to make sentences more direct.** The text frequently uses nouns like 'improvement' where a verb would be clearer.\n    *   **For example:** 'For every 4 people treated, 1 additional person had symptom improvement.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'For every 4 people treated, the symptoms of 1 additional person improved.'\n\n2. **Simplify the explanation of conflicting results for biologics.** The current explanation of why the evidence on symptoms is uncertain is long and complex.\n    *   **For example:** 'Some studies measured *how much* symptoms improved and found that biologics may help. But other studies that measured *if* symptoms got better at all found little to no difference.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We are uncertain about the effect of biologics on symptoms. Some studies measured the *amount* of improvement and suggested biologics may help. However, other studies that only measured *if* symptoms improved found little to no difference.'\n\n3. **Add context to what 'endoscopic improvement' means.** The summary explains what an endoscopy is, but not what doctors are looking for a sign of improvement.\n    *   **For example:** 'We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve how the food pipe looks during an endoscopy (when a doctor uses a thin tube with a camera to look inside it).'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve how the food pipe looks during an endoscopy (when a doctor uses a thin tube with a camera to look for swelling or other signs of inflammation). The evidence was not clear enough to say if the treatment reduced these signs.'\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the draft uses an unusually high number of nouns, nominalizations (noun-form verbs), and complex words compared to typical plain language summaries. Addressing these points will make the findings much easier for patients to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. The draft scores well on sentence-level readability, with 56% of metrics falling in the best quartile (e.g., good sentence length and use of active voice). However, there is significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary and word choice. Six key metrics, including nominalization, complex words, long words, and the SMOG index, are in the PLS90 range or beyond, indicating the text is more complex and noun-heavy than is typical for a PLS."
