  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medicines for eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition that causes swelling in the food pipe)?\n\nKey messages\n\n- For people with eosinophilic esophagitis, medicines called corticosteroids (which reduce swelling) and biologics (which target the immune system) seem to reduce swelling in the food pipe. Corticosteroids may also improve symptoms, but we are uncertain if biologics improve symptoms.\n- People taking corticosteroids may be less likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects than those taking a placebo (a dummy treatment), while there may be no difference for people taking biologics.\n- More research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments and to compare them directly to find out which works best.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long-term condition that affects the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It happens when your body has an allergic reaction that causes a type of white blood cell (called an eosinophil) to build up in your food pipe. This build-up causes swelling, which can make it hard to swallow, cause food to get stuck, and lead to chest pain. Because there is no cure for EoE, people need ongoing treatment. Common treatments include special diets, procedures to stretch the esophagus, and medicines like corticosteroids and newer 'biologic' drugs that target the immune system.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe different medicines are for people with EoE. We looked at whether these treatments improved symptoms, reduced swelling in the food pipe, and caused any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared medical treatments for EoE against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another treatment. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review find?\n\nWe found 41 studies that included 3253 people with EoE.\n- The studies included both children and adults (11 studies focused only on children).\n- Most people had 'active' EoE, meaning their symptoms were present. 4 studies looked at people with 'inactive' disease, where symptoms were under control.\n- The review looked at 19 different treatments, but we focused on the two main ones compared against a placebo: corticosteroids and biologics.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n\nFor people with active EoE, this review found the following when comparing treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment):\n\nCorticosteroids\n- Corticosteroids greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe. They work by lowering the number of the white blood cells (eosinophils) that cause the swelling. For every 3 people treated, 1 extra person had their swelling reduced.\n- Corticosteroids may also slightly improve symptoms. For every 4 people treated, 1 extra person felt their symptoms improve.\n- We are uncertain if corticosteroids make the food pipe look healthier during an endoscopy (a camera examination).\n- People who take corticosteroids may be slightly less likely to stop treatment because of unwanted effects.\n\nBiologics\n- Biologics probably also greatly reduce swelling in the food pipe. They work by lowering the number of the white blood cells (eosinophils) that cause the swelling. For every 2 people treated, 1 extra person had this improvement. However, when the swelling was measured in a different way, the effect of biologics was unclear.\n- We are uncertain if biologics improve symptoms. Because studies measured symptoms in different ways, some showed they helped while others found little or no difference compared to a placebo.\n- Biologics may make little to no difference to how healthy the food pipe looks during an endoscopy (a camera examination).\n- People who take biologics may be as likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects as people who take a placebo.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. This is mainly because some results came from a small number of studies, and they often measured outcomes in different ways, making it hard to combine their findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

I am marking it as 'Not Approved' to highlight these opportunities, but they should be quick to fix.\n\nHere are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of nouns.** Some sentences are less direct because they use noun forms of verbs. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing a high number of 'nominalizations'.\n    *   **For example:** 'We are uncertain if corticosteroids make the food pipe look healthier during an endoscopy (a camera examination).'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We are uncertain if corticosteroids make the food pipe look healthier when a doctor **examines** it with a camera (an endoscopy).'\n\n2. **Improve flow by removing repetitive information.** The results section repeats some information from the introduction, which can slow the reader down.\n    *   **For example:** Under both the Corticosteroids and Biologics results, you state: 'They work by lowering the number of the white blood cells (eosinophils) that cause the swelling.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** You can remove this sentence from both sections. You already explained the role of these cells perfectly in the introduction, so it's not needed here.\n\n3. **Break up sentences with multiple complex ideas.** While the average sentence length is good, some sentences combine several concepts, which can be challenging. The metrics show high vocabulary complexity, so simplifying sentence structure can help.\n    *   **For example:** 'It happens when your body has an allergic reaction that causes a type of white blood cell (called an eosinophil) to build up in your food pipe.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'It is caused by an allergic reaction. This reaction makes a type of white blood cell (called an eosinophil) build up in the food pipe.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS **evaluation** shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 67% of features in the best quartile for readability and sentence length. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity and sentence structure. Metrics for nominalization, nouns, long words, and complex words are all in the 90th percentile, indicating the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
