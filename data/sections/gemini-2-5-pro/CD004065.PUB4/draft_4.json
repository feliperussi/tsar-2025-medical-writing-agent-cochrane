  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of medicines for eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition that causes swelling in the food pipe)?\n\nKey messages\n\nFor people with eosinophilic esophagitis (a long-term allergic condition of the food pipe), medicines called corticosteroids (which reduce swelling) and biologics (which target the immune system) seem to reduce inflammation in the food pipe. Corticosteroids may also improve symptoms, but the evidence for biologics improving symptoms was less clear.\nPeople taking corticosteroids may be less likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects than those taking a placebo (a dummy treatment), while there may be no difference for biologics.\nMore research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments and to directly compare the different types of medicines against each other to find out which works best.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis?\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long-term (chronic) condition that affects the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. It happens when a type of white blood cell, called an eosinophil, builds up in the lining of the esophagus. This allergic-type reaction causes inflammation, which can lead to symptoms like difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, and chest pain. Because there is no cure for EoE, people need ongoing treatment. Common treatments include special diets, procedures to stretch the esophagus, and medicines like corticosteroids and newer 'biologic' drugs that target the immune system.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective and safe different medical treatments are for people with eosinophilic esophagitis. We were interested in whether these treatments improved people's symptoms, reduced inflammation in the esophagus, and if they caused any unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\n\nWe searched for studies that compared medical treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another treatment. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review find?\n\nThis review included 41 studies with a total of 3253 people. The studies involved both children and adults; 11 studies focused specifically on children. Most studies included people with active eosinophilic esophagitis, while 4 studies were in people with inactive disease. The review looked at 19 different treatments, but the main ones were corticosteroids versus placebo and biologics versus placebo.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n\nFor people with active eosinophilic esophagitis, this review found the following when comparing treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment):\n\nCorticosteroids\n- Corticosteroids greatly reduce inflammation in the food pipe. (Doctors see this by looking at tissue samples under a microscope and counting the number of white blood cells). For every 3 people treated, the inflammation in 1 additional person was reduced.\n- Corticosteroids may also slightly improve symptoms. For every 4 people treated, the symptoms of 1 additional person improved.\n- We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve how the food pipe looks during an endoscopy (when a doctor uses a thin tube with a camera to look for swelling or other signs of inflammation), as the evidence was not clear.\n- People taking corticosteroids may be slightly less likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects.\n\nBiologics\n- Biologics probably also greatly reduce inflammation in the food pipe. For every 2 people treated, the inflammation in 1 additional person was reduced. However, when studies measured *how much* the inflammation was reduced, the effect was unclear.\n- The effect of biologics on symptoms is uncertain. Some studies measured the *amount* symptoms improved and suggested biologics may help. However, other studies that measured only *if* symptoms improved found little to no difference.\n- Biologics may make little to no difference to how the food pipe looks during an endoscopy.\n- People taking biologics are probably just as likely to stop treatment due to unwanted effects as people taking a placebo.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes. Also, the studies included different types of people and used different treatment methods, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for completeness, accuracy, and length. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of complex vocabulary and sentence structures that make the key findings difficult to understand. The text relies heavily on noun-based phrases instead of direct verbs, and the explanation for why results sometimes seem to conflict is unclear. Addressing these points will make the summary much more accessible to patients and the public.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Sentences and Technical Explanations**\n\nSome sentences are too long and contain complex ideas that could be broken down. This makes key information hard to absorb.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve how the food pipe looks during an endoscopy (when a doctor uses a thin tube with a camera to look for swelling or other signs of inflammation), as the evidence was not clear.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This single 36-word sentence combines the finding, the definition of a procedure, and the reason for uncertainty. It's too much for one sentence.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are uncertain if corticosteroids improve the appearance of the food pipe. Doctors check this using an endoscopy (a thin tube with a camera) to look for swelling, but the evidence was not clear.\"\n\n**2. Replace Noun-Heavy Phrases with Active Verbs**\n\nThe text often uses nouns to describe actions, which is common in scientific writing but can make sentences feel static and abstract for a general reader.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"The effect of biologics on symptoms is uncertain.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is indirect. Using a direct verb makes the meaning clearer and the sentence more engaging.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are uncertain if biologics improve symptoms.\"\n\n**3. Clarify Apparent Contradictions in the Evidence**\n\nThe draft struggles to explain why some results suggest a treatment works, while others are unclear. This can confuse readers.\n\n- **Problematic text:** \"The effect of biologics on symptoms is uncertain. Some studies measured the *amount* symptoms improved and suggested biologics may help. However, other studies that measured only *if* symptoms improved found little to no difference.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** A reader may not understand why different ways of measuring lead to different conclusions, making the takeaway message confusing.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are uncertain if biologics improve symptoms. Some studies looked at *whether* symptoms improved and found little to no difference compared to a dummy treatment. Other studies measured *how much* symptoms improved and suggested biologics may help. Because the studies show different results, we need more research to be sure.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns, with 50% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability. However, there is significant deviation in vocabulary complexity and sentence structure. Six key metrics are in the P90 or 'Beyond P90' range, including the SMOG index (readability), counts for complex words, long words, and Dale-Chall unfamiliar words. The nominalization score is also exceptionally high. This pattern indicates the text is likely too technical and noun-heavy for a lay audience, despite having good average sentence length and use of active voice."
