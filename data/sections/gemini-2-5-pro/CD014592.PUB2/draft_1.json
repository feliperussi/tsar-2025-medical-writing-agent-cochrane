  "draft": "Can estrogen therapy help postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse (when organs in the pelvis, such as the womb or bladder, slip down)?\n\nKey messages\n- We do not know if oestrogen therapy (a hormone treatment) on its own helps to treat pelvic organ prolapse (when organs in the pelvis, such as the womb or bladder, slip down) because there was not enough evidence from the studies we found.\n- There is some limited evidence that using oestrogen cream or gel alongside other treatments might be helpful. It may reduce vaginal problems in women using a vaginal pessary (a device inserted to provide support) and may reduce urinary tract infections (infections of the bladder or kidneys) after surgery for prolapse.\n- Larger and better-quality studies are needed to find out about the benefits and potential harms of oestrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse, especially when looking at its effects over a longer period of time.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse and what did we want to find out?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a condition where organs in the pelvis, such as the womb (uterus), bladder, or rectum, slip down from their normal position and bulge into the vagina. It is a common condition, affecting many women after menopause, especially those who have given birth. Oestrogen is a hormone that decreases after menopause, and some believe that oestrogen therapy might help with the symptoms of POP, either on its own or with other treatments like surgery or the use of a vaginal pessary (a device inserted into the vagina to support the internal organs). We wanted to find out if oestrogen therapy helps to improve the symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse in women after menopause. We also wanted to know if this therapy has any unwanted or harmful effects. We were interested in oestrogen given in different ways, such as creams applied directly to the vagina (local) or pills taken by mouth (systemic).\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared the effects of oestrogen therapy (alone or with other treatments) against placebo, no treatment, or other interventions in postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse. We summarized the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 14 studies with a total of 1002 postmenopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse. The studies looked at oestrogen therapy combined with other treatments. Three studies compared oestrogen therapy plus a vaginal pessary with a vaginal pessary alone, and 11 studies compared oestrogen therapy plus surgery with surgery alone. The review did not find any studies that looked at oestrogen therapy on its own compared with no treatment, a placebo, pelvic floor muscle training, vaginal pessaries, or surgery. We do not know if oestrogen therapy improves symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse in women after menopause because there is not enough evidence from studies. When used with other treatments, topical oestrogen given with a vaginal pessary may lead to fewer vaginal problems, and when given with surgery, it may reduce urinary tract infections after the operation. However, we are very uncertain about these results.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies also used different ways of delivering the intervention, and they were very small.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs some revisions to meet our style guide and improve clarity for readers. A critical issue is that two subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is required by our style guide. Additionally, the summary contains several long, complex sentences and some unnecessarily technical phrasing that could be simplified. Addressing these points will make the summary much easier for a lay audience to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** Our style guide requires subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. Two subheadings currently do not follow this format.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"Methods\" and \"Limitations of the evidence\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What methods did we use?\" and \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n\n2.  **Break up long sentences to improve readability.** Some sentences combine too many ideas, making them difficult to follow. Aim for one main idea per sentence.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"Oestrogen is a hormone that decreases after menopause, and some believe that oestrogen therapy might help with the symptoms of POP, either on its own or with other treatments like surgery or the use of a vaginal pessary (a device inserted into the vagina to support the internal organs).\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Oestrogen is a hormone that decreases after menopause. Some believe that oestrogen therapy might help with POP symptoms. It could be used on its own or with other treatments, like surgery or a vaginal pessary (a device inserted into the vagina to provide support).\"\n\n3.  **Simplify technical or awkward phrasing.** Some wording is unnecessarily formal or jargony, which can be a barrier for readers.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"The evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This evidence is up to date to June 2022.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the text has a high number of complex and long words, contributing to a higher-than-ideal complexity score (SMOG Index). Focusing on these edits will significantly improve the summary's clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns, with 33.3% of features in the best quartile. However, the analysis highlights significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics fall into the P90 range (deviating from typical patterns): `nouns`, `smog_index`, `complex_words_dc`, `complex_words`, and `long_words`. This indicates the draft uses more nouns, polysyllabic words, and long words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, suggesting that simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure should be a priority."
