  "draft": "Can physical measures, like wearing face masks and washing hands, help stop or slow the spread of viruses that cause breathing illnesses?\n\nKey messages\n- It is uncertain whether physical measures, like wearing face masks or washing hands, stop or slow the spread of breathing viruses.\n- Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people who get an influenza-like illness (an illness with fever and cough or sore throat). Hand washing is likely to slightly reduce the number of people who catch a breathing illness.\n- The studies did not provide much information about the unwanted effects of these measures.\n- Our confidence in these results is limited because of the way the studies were designed and because not all people followed the measures as instructed. Better-quality studies are needed to understand the effects of these physical measures, especially during virus pandemics.\n\nWhy is it important to stop the spread of respiratory viruses?\nInfections of the nose, throat, and lungs, such as influenza (flu) and COVID-19, are caused by viruses that can spread easily between people. When these viruses spread quickly and widely, they can cause epidemics and pandemics, which pose a major threat to global health. Although vaccines and medicines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these illnesses.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well 'physical interventions' work to stop or reduce the spread of these viruses. Physical interventions are actions people can take, rather than using medicines. Examples include washing hands, wearing face masks, keeping a distance from others, screening people for illness before they enter a place, and isolation or quarantine. This is an update of a previous review and includes new evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. These studies assign people to one of two or more treatment groups by chance. We looked for trials that studied the effects of physical measures to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 78 studies with 610,872 people. 11 of these studies were new for this update. The studies took place in various settings, from suburban schools and hospitals in high-income countries to crowded inner-city areas in low-income countries. The newest studies were in Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway.\n\nWe looked at several physical measures. We compared:\n- wearing a medical or surgical mask versus wearing no mask\n- wearing an N95/P2 respirator versus wearing a medical or surgical mask\n- washing hands versus not washing hands.\n\nWe did not find any studies on the use of gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening people for illness at entry points.\n\nFor people in the community, wearing a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference to whether they catch an influenza-like or COVID-19-like illness. It also probably makes little to no difference to whether they get a lab-confirmed case of influenza or COVID-19.\n\nFor healthcare workers, wearing a more protective N95/P2 respirator probably makes little to no difference compared to a medical or surgical mask. It likely does not change their risk of getting a lab-confirmed flu infection.\n\nWashing hands or using hand sanitiser probably slightly reduces the number of people who get a breathing illness. For every 1000 people, this would mean about 327 people would get sick, compared to 380 people who did not wash their hands. However, hand washing may make little to no difference to the number of people who get an influenza-like illness or a lab-confirmed case of influenza.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. This is because people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting. Also, the studies included different types of people, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

It contains a critical factual error and needs several improvements for clarity before it can be published.\n\n**Critical Issue:**\n*   **Factual Error:** The summary misrepresents the number of participants in the review.\n    *   **You wrote:** 'This review included 78 studies with 610,872 people. 11 of these studies were new for this update.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This incorrectly states that all 78 studies included 610,872 people. The source material specifies that this number of participants comes from the 11 *new* studies only.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'This review included 78 studies. The 11 new studies added in this update involved 610,872 people.'\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Clarify the main key message:** The first bullet point is too broad and seems to contradict the later point about hand washing.\n    *   **You wrote:** 'It is uncertain whether physical measures, like wearing face masks or washing hands, stop or slow the spread of breathing viruses.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This statement is confusing because the review found that hand washing *is* likely beneficial. Lumping all 'physical measures' together hides this important nuance.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'There is uncertainty about the effects of wearing face masks to stop or slow the spread of breathing viruses, but washing hands is likely to be beneficial.'\n\n2.  **Simplify complex and technical language:** The text uses terms that may be unfamiliar to a lay audience, making it harder to read.\n    *   **Example 1:** 'The studies did not provide much information about the unwanted effects of these measures.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'The studies gave little information about the harms or downsides of these measures.'\n    *   **Example 2:** 'For healthcare workers, wearing a more protective N95  P2 respirator...'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'For healthcare workers, wearing a more protective type of mask (called an N95/P2 respirator)...'\n\n3.  **Make the limitations clearer and more direct:** The explanation of limitations uses indirect phrasing.\n    *   **You wrote:** 'This is because people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is slightly passive. Using more direct language helps the reader understand why this is a limitation.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'One reason is that people in the studies often knew which measure they were using (e.g., wearing a mask or not), which could have affected their behaviour and the results.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:**\nYour draft's vocabulary is more complex than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. The analysis shows high numbers of complex words, long words, and nouns (all in the top 10% of our corpus), which supports the need to simplify language for better readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in sentence structure and readability, with  is 72.2% of features falling in the best quartile. However, there is a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—nouns, SMOG index, Dale-Chall complex words, complex words (3+ syllables), and long words (7+ characters)—are in the P90 range, indicating the vocabulary is more technical and less plain than is typical for a PLS."
