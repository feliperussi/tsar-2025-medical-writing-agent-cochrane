  "draft": "Can physical measures, like wearing face masks and washing hands, help stop or slow the spread of viruses that cause breathing illnesses?\n\nKey messages\n- It is uncertain whether physical measures, like wearing face masks or washing hands, stop or slow the spread of breathing viruses. Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people who get an influenza-like illness (an illness with fever and cough or sore throat), and hand washing is likely to slightly reduce the number of people who catch a breathing illness. Unwanted effects of these measures were not well reported in the studies.\n- Our confidence in these results is limited because of issues with the way the studies were designed and because not all people in the studies followed the measures as instructed. Better-quality studies are needed to understand the effects of these physical measures, especially during virus pandemics.\n\nWhy is it important to stop the spread of respiratory viruses?\nInfections of the nose, throat, and lungs, such as influenza (flu) and COVID-19, are caused by viruses that can spread easily between people. When these viruses spread quickly and widely, they can cause epidemics and pandemics, which pose a major threat to global health. Although vaccines and medicines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these illnesses.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well 'physical interventions' work to stop or reduce the spread of these viruses. Physical interventions are actions people can take, rather than using medicines. Examples include washing hands, wearing face masks, keeping a distance from others, screening people for illness before they enter a place, and isolation or quarantine. This is an update of a previous review and includes new evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups by chance) that looked at the effects of physical interventions to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 78 randomised controlled trials; 11 of these studies were new for this update and involved 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various settings, including suburban schools, hospital wards in high-income countries, and crowded inner-city settings in low-income countries. The newest studies took place in Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway. The review examined several physical interventions, including comparisons of medical/surgical masks versus no masks, N95/P2 respirators versus medical/surgical masks, and hand hygiene versus no intervention. The authors did not find any randomised controlled trials on the use of gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports. For people in the community, wearing a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference to whether they catch an influenza-like or COVID-19-like illness. It also probably makes little to no difference to whether they get a laboratory-confirmed case of influenza or COVID-19. For healthcare workers, using a more protective N95/P2 respirator instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference to their risk of catching a laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Hand hygiene, such as handwashing or using hand sanitiser, probably slightly reduces the number of people who get an acute respiratory illness. For every 1000 people, this would mean a reduction from 380 people getting sick to about 327. However, hand hygiene may make little to no difference to the number of people who get an influenza-like illness or a laboratory-confirmed case of influenza.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns that it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Additionally, the studies were done in different types of people, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nDate of the evidence\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it does not meet the approval criteria due to a critical formatting issue and several opportunities to improve clarity for a lay audience.\n\n**Critical Issue:**\n- **Subheading Format:** Three subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a requirement of the style guide. They must be changed to guide the reader effectively.\n  - **\"Methods\"** should be a question like **\"How did we conduct this review?\"**\n  - **\"Limitations of the evidence\"** should be **\"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"**\n  - **\"Date of the evidence\"** should be **\"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"**\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed to make the summary clearer and more accessible:\n\n**1. Simplify Noun-Heavy and Technical Sentences**\nThe text often uses formal, noun-heavy phrases where simpler verbs would be clearer. This makes the text dense and harder to read.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"The review examined several physical interventions, including comparisons of medical/surgical masks versus no masks, N95/P2 respirators versus medical/surgical masks, and hand hygiene versus no intervention.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This sentence is long and uses formal words like \"interventions\" and \"comparisons\". The structure is repetitive and clunky.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We looked at several physical measures. We compared:\n- wearing a medical or surgical mask versus wearing no mask\n- wearing an N95/P2 respirator versus wearing a medical or surgical mask\n- washing hands versus not washing hands.\"\n\n**2. Break Down Long, Complex Sentences**\nSeveral sentences are over 30 words long, containing multiple ideas that are difficult for readers to process at once.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"For healthcare workers, using a more protective N95/P2 respirator instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference to their risk of catching a laboratory-confirmed influenza infection.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** At 33 words, this sentence packs too much information into a single thought. The core finding gets lost.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"For healthcare workers, wearing a more protective N95/P2 respirator probably makes little to no difference compared to a medical or surgical mask. It likely does not change their risk of getting a lab-confirmed flu infection.\"\n\n**3. Use More Direct, Active Language**\nSome sentences use a passive or indirect tone, which can feel less engaging and make it harder to understand who is performing the action.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Unwanted effects of these measures were not well reported in the studies.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This passive construction is less direct than stating who failed to report the information.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies did not provide much information about the unwanted effects of these measures.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows a moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 50% of features falling in the best quartile. However, there is significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics, including 'long_words' (BEYOND_P90), 'complex_words' (P90), 'nominalization' (P90), and 'nouns' (P90), are much higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This indicates the text relies too heavily on long, complex, and noun-based words, which supports the editorial feedback to simplify sentence structure and word choice to improve readability for a lay audience."
