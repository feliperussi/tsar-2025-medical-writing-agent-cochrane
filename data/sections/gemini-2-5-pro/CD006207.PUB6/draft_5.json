  "draft": "Can physical measures, like wearing face masks and washing hands, help stop or slow the spread of viruses that cause breathing illnesses?\n\nKey messages\n- We are uncertain about the effects of wearing face masks to stop or slow the spread of viruses that cause breathing illnesses. Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get an illness like the flu (an illness with fever and cough or sore throat).\n- Washing hands is likely helpful and probably slightly lowers the number of people who catch a breathing illness.\n- We have limited confidence in these results because of the way the studies were done and because many people did not use the measures as they were asked to. The studies also gave little information about any harms or downsides.\n\nWhy is it important to stop the spread of respiratory viruses?\nInfections of the nose, throat, and lungs, like the flu and COVID-19, are caused by viruses that spread easily from person to person. When these viruses spread quickly to many people, they can cause large outbreaks that threaten global health. Vaccines and medicines can help, but they may not be enough to stop these illnesses from spreading.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well 'physical measures' work to stop or slow the spread of these viruses. Physical measures are actions people can take, instead of using medicines. Examples include washing hands, wearing face masks, keeping a distance from others, screening people for illness before they enter a place, and staying away from others when sick (isolation or quarantine). This is an update of our last review and includes new studies from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into different groups by chance to compare different treatments or actions. We looked for trials that tested how well physical measures slow the spread of breathing viruses. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 78 studies. The 11 new studies in this update included 610,872 people. The studies took place in different places, from schools and hospitals in wealthier countries to crowded city areas in poorer countries. The newest studies were in Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway.\n\nWe looked at several physical measures. We compared:\n- wearing a medical or surgical mask versus wearing no mask\n- wearing a more protective mask (called an N95/P2 respirator) versus wearing a medical or surgical mask\n- washing hands versus not washing hands\n\nWe did not find any studies on using gowns and gloves, face shields, or checking people for illness at entry points.\n\nWearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little to no difference to whether people catch an illness like the flu or COVID-19. It also probably makes little to no difference to whether they get a case of flu or COVID-19 that is confirmed by a lab test.\n\nFor healthcare workers, wearing a more protective mask (an N95/P2 respirator) instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference. Their risk of getting a lab-confirmed flu infection was similar with both types of masks.\n\nWashing hands or using hand sanitiser probably slightly lowers the number of people who get a breathing illness. For example, out of 1000 people who did not wash their hands, 380 might get sick. With hand washing, this number would likely drop to about 327. However, hand washing may make little to no difference to the number of people who get an illness like the flu or a case of flu confirmed by a lab test.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence is limited because people in the studies knew whether or not they were wearing a mask. This knowledge might have caused them to change their behaviour in other ways, which could affect the results. Also, the studies were done with different groups of people, and there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, a few revisions are needed to improve clarity and make it easier for a lay audience to understand. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Make the first key message more direct.** The current wording seems to contradict itself by stating you are 'uncertain' and then immediately stating a probable finding. This can confuse readers about the relationship between the overall uncertainty and the specific result.\n   - **Current text:** \"We are uncertain about the effects of wearing face masks to stop or slow the spread of viruses that cause breathing illnesses. Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get an illness like the flu...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Clarify the relationship between the uncertainty and the finding. For example: \"The overall effects of wearing face masks to stop the spread of breathing illnesses are uncertain. However, the available evidence shows that wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a flu-like illness.\"\n\n2. **Simplify wordy and noun-heavy sentences.** Some sentences are more complex than necessary, which can slow down the reader. This observation is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the number of nouns, long words, and complex words were higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary.\n   - **Current text:** \"We have limited confidence in these results because of the way the studies were done and because many people did not use the measures as they were asked to.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Use simpler, more direct language. For example: \"Our confidence in these results is limited because of concerns about how the studies were designed and because many people did not follow the instructions.\"\n\n3. **Explain the limitations more clearly.** The explanation for why confidence is limited is a bit roundabout. Stating the reasons directly will help readers better understand the context of the findings.\n   - **Current text:** \"Our confidence is limited because people in the studies knew whether or not they were wearing a mask. This knowledge might have caused them to change their behaviour in other ways, which could affect the results.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Be more direct and break down the reasons. For example: \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. First, in the mask studies, people knew if they were wearing one, which might have changed their other behaviours. Second, the studies included different groups of people, and there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the findings.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable, with most metrics like sentence length and readability scores falling in the best quartile (P25). However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns by using a higher number of nouns, long words, and complex words (as defined by Dale-Chall), all of which are in the 90th percentile range. This suggests that while the sentence structure is simple, the vocabulary could be simplified further to improve clarity."
