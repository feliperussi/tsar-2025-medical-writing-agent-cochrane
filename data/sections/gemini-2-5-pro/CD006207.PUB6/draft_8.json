  "draft": "Can physical measures, like wearing face masks and washing hands, help stop or slow the spread of viruses that cause breathing illnesses?\n\nKey messages\n- It is uncertain if wearing face masks stops the spread of breathing illnesses. Wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. This was true whether the illness was diagnosed by symptoms or a lab test.\n- Washing hands with soap and water or using hand sanitiser probably slightly reduces the number of people who catch a breathing illness.\n- Our confidence in these results is limited because of how the studies were designed and because many people did not follow the instructions they were given.\n\nWhy is it important to stop the spread of respiratory viruses?\nInfections of the nose, throat, and lungs, like the flu and COVID-19, are caused by viruses that spread easily from person to person. When these viruses spread quickly to many people, they can cause large outbreaks that threaten global health. Vaccines and medicines can help, but they may not be enough to stop these illnesses from spreading.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well 'physical measures' work to stop or slow the spread of these viruses. Physical measures are actions people can take, instead of using medicines. Examples include washing hands, wearing face masks, keeping a distance from others, screening people for illness before they enter a place, and staying away from others when sick (isolation or quarantine). This is an update of our last review and includes new studies from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that put people into different groups by chance to compare different actions. These are called randomized controlled trials. We looked for trials that tested how well physical measures slow the spread of breathing viruses. We then combined the results and rated how certain we were in them.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 78 studies. The 11 new studies in this update included 610,872 people. The studies took place in different places, from schools and hospitals in wealthier countries to crowded city areas in poorer countries. The newest studies were in Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway.\n\nWe looked at several physical measures. We compared:\n– wearing a medical or surgical mask versus wearing no mask\n– wearing a more protective mask (called an N95/P2 respirator) versus wearing a medical or surgical mask\n– washing hands versus not washing hands\n\nWe did not find any studies on using gowns and gloves, face shields, or checking people for illness at entry points.\n\nWearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people who get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. This was true whether the illness was diagnosed by symptoms or a lab test.\n\nFor healthcare workers, wearing a more protective mask (an N95/P2 respirator) instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference in preventing a lab-confirmed flu infection.\n\nWashing hands or using hand sanitiser probably slightly reduces the number of people who get a general breathing illness (like a common cold). For example, out of 1000 people who did not wash their hands, 380 might get sick. With hand washing, this number would likely drop to about 327. However, hand washing may make little to no difference for more specific illnesses like the flu, or for cases of flu confirmed by a lab test.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. First, many people in the studies did not always follow the instructions they were given, such as wearing masks or washing hands. Second, in the mask studies, people knew they were in the mask group, which might have changed their other behaviours. Finally, the studies were done with different groups of people, and there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it can be made even clearer for a lay audience by addressing a few patterns that reduce readability. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify Noun-Heavy Sentences to Be More Direct:** Some sentences are dense and rely on nouns to carry the meaning, which can be hard for readers to process. Rewriting them to be more active and verb-focused will improve clarity.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** \"Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people who get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness.\"\n    - **Why it's an issue:** This sentence is grammatically correct but starts with a complex noun phrase (\"Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community\"), which is less direct than starting with the people involved.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"People who wear a medical or surgical mask in the community probably get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness at about the same rate as people who do not wear a mask.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the Link Between Uncertainty and Specific Findings:** The key messages state that the effect of masks is \"uncertain\" but also that they \"probably make little or no difference.\" To a lay reader, this can sound contradictory. Connecting these two ideas more explicitly will prevent confusion.\n    - **Problematic sentences:** \"It is uncertain if wearing face masks stops the spread of breathing illnesses. Wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness.\"\n    - **Why it's an issue:** The relationship between the overall uncertainty and the specific finding isn't clear. Readers might wonder, \"Is it uncertain, or is there no difference?\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are uncertain about the overall effects of wearing face masks to stop the spread of breathing illnesses. The available evidence suggests that wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness.\"\n\n3. **Make Explanations More Concise:** The methods section is a bit repetitive and could be streamlined to be more engaging for readers.\n    - **Problematic sentences:** \"We searched for studies that put people into different groups by chance to compare different actions. These are called randomized controlled trials. We looked for trials that tested how well physical measures slow the spread of breathing viruses.\"\n    - **Why it's an issue:** The phrasing \"We searched for studies... We looked for trials...\" is slightly redundant. Combining these ideas makes the text flow better.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for studies called 'randomized controlled trials', where people are put into different groups by chance. These studies tested how well physical measures (like wearing masks) slow the spread of breathing viruses.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of nouns (193), complex words (245), and long words (186) compared to typical Plain Language Summaries. Addressing these points will make the summary even clearer for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 77.8% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and structure. However, it deviates on vocabulary complexity and sentence density. The number of nouns (193.0), Dale-Chall complex words (245.0), and long words (186.0) are all in the 90th percentile, indicating the text may be denser and use more difficult vocabulary than a typical PLS. Focusing on simplifying sentence structure and word choice will improve overall clarity."
