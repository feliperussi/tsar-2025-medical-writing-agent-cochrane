  "draft": "Can physical measures, like wearing face masks and washing hands, help stop or slow the spread of viruses that cause breathing illnesses?\n\nKey messages\n- The overall effects of wearing face masks to stop the spread of breathing illnesses are uncertain. However, the available evidence shows that wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a flu-like illness (an illness with fever and cough or sore throat).\n- Washing hands with soap and water or using hand sanitiser probably slightly reduces the number of people who catch a breathing illness.\n- Our confidence in these results is limited because of how the studies were designed and because many people did not follow the instructions they were given.\n\nWhy is it important to stop the spread of respiratory viruses?\nInfections of the nose, throat, and lungs, like the flu and COVID-19, are caused by viruses that spread easily from person to person. When these viruses spread quickly to many people, they can cause large outbreaks that threaten global health. Vaccines and medicines can help, but they may not be enough to stop these illnesses from spreading.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well 'physical measures' work to stop or slow the spread of these viruses. Physical measures are actions people can take, instead of using medicines. Examples include washing hands, wearing face masks, keeping a distance from others, screening people for illness before they enter a place, and staying away from others when sick (isolation or quarantine). This is an update of our last review and includes new studies from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into different groups by chance to compare different treatments or actions. We looked for trials that tested how well physical measures slow the spread of breathing viruses. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 78 studies. The 11 new studies in this update included 610,872 people. The studies took place in different places, from schools and hospitals in wealthier countries to crowded city areas in poorer countries. The newest studies were in Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway.\n\nWe looked at several physical measures. We compared:\n– wearing a medical or surgical mask versus wearing no mask\n– wearing a more protective mask (called an N95/P2 respirator) versus wearing a medical or surgical mask\n– washing hands versus not washing hands\n\nWe did not find any studies on using gowns and gloves, face shields, or checking people for illness at entry points.\n\nWearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. This finding applies to both general symptoms and cases confirmed by a lab test.\n\nFor healthcare workers, wearing a more protective mask (an N95/P2 respirator) instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference. Their risk of getting a lab-confirmed flu infection was similar with both types of masks.\n\nWashing hands or using hand sanitiser probably slightly lowers the number of people who get a breathing illness. For example, out of 1000 people who did not wash their hands, 380 might get sick. With hand washing, this number would likely drop to about 327. However, hand washing may make little to no difference to the number of people who get an illness like the flu or a case of flu confirmed by a lab test.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. First, many people in the studies did not follow the instructions they were given, such as wearing masks or washing hands consistently. Second, in the mask studies, people knew they were in the mask group, which might have changed their other behaviours. Finally, the studies were done with different groups of people, and there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting. The readability scores are excellent. However, a few refinements are needed to make the text clearer and more direct for a lay audience before it can be approved.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n**1. Make the Key Message More Specific**\n\nThe first key message is less detailed than the findings presented later in the summary. This could lead readers to miss important nuances.\n- **Original Text:** \"...the available evidence shows that wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a flu-like illness...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This omits the findings related to COVID-19-like illness and lab-confirmed cases, which are important details included in the main results section.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...the available evidence shows that wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness, whether based on symptoms or a lab test.\"\n\n**2. Replace Noun-Heavy Phrases with More Direct Verbs**\n\nThe summary has a very high number of nouns, which can make sentences feel dense and less active. Using verbs instead of noun forms makes the writing easier to follow.\n- **Original Text:** \"The overall effects of wearing face masks to stop the spread of breathing illnesses are uncertain.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is indirect. Using a direct verb makes the point more clearly.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"It is uncertain if wearing face masks stops the spread of breathing illnesses.\"\n\n- **Original Text:** \"For healthcare workers, wearing a more protective mask (an N95/P2 respirator) instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference. Their risk of getting a lab-confirmed flu infection was similar with both types of masks.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The second sentence is passive and adds length. The key finding can be stated more concisely in a single, active sentence.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"For healthcare workers, wearing a more protective mask (an N95/P2 respirator) instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference in preventing a lab-confirmed flu infection.\"\n\n**3. Simplify Technical Phrasing**\n\nWhile technical terms are generally well-explained, the explanation could be introduced more simply.\n- **Original Text:** \"We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into different groups by chance to compare different treatments or actions.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This introduces the technical term before the simple explanation, which can be intimidating for some readers.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We searched for studies where people are put into different groups by chance to compare different treatments or actions. These are called randomized controlled trials.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make an already good summary even more accessible to your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 83.3% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and style. However, the analysis flags three metrics that deviate significantly from the norm: the number of nouns is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90), and the counts for long words (P90) and complex words from the Dale-Chall list (P90) are also elevated. This suggests that while sentence structure is good, the vocabulary is denser and more noun-focused than is typical for a PLS, supporting the recommendation to simplify phrasing and use more direct verbs."
