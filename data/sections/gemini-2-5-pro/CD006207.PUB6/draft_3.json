  "draft": "Can physical measures, like wearing face masks and washing hands, help stop or slow the spread of viruses that cause breathing illnesses?\n\nKey messages\n- There is uncertainty about the effects of wearing face masks to stop or slow the spread of breathing viruses. Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get an influenza-like illness (an illness with fever and cough or sore throat).\n- Washing hands is likely beneficial and probably slightly reduces the number of people who catch a breathing illness.\n- Our confidence in these results is limited because of how the studies were designed and because many people did not follow the measures as instructed. The studies also gave little information about the harms or downsides of these measures.\n\nWhy is it important to stop the spread of respiratory viruses?\nInfections of the nose, throat, and lungs, such as influenza (flu) and COVID-19, are caused by viruses that can spread easily between people. When these viruses spread quickly and widely, they can cause epidemics and pandemics, which are a major threat to global health. Although vaccines and medicines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these illnesses.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well 'physical interventions' work to stop or reduce the spread of these viruses. Physical interventions are actions people can take, rather than using medicines. Examples include washing hands, wearing face masks, keeping a distance from others, screening people for illness before they enter a place, and isolation or quarantine. This is an update of a previous review and includes new evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups by chance). We looked for trials that studied the effects of physical measures to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 78 studies. The 11 new studies added in this update involved 610,872 people. The studies took place in various settings, from suburban schools and hospitals in high-income countries to crowded inner-city areas in low-income countries. The newest studies were in Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway.\n\nWe looked at several physical measures. We compared:\n- wearing a medical or surgical mask versus wearing no mask\n- wearing a more protective type of mask (called an N95/P2 respirator) versus wearing a medical or surgical mask\n- washing hands versus not washing hands\n\nWe did not find any studies on the use of gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening people for illness at entry points.\n\nFor people in the community, wearing a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference to whether they catch an influenza-like or COVID-19-like illness. It also probably makes little to no difference to whether they get a lab-confirmed case of influenza or COVID-19.\n\nFor healthcare workers, wearing a more protective type of mask (called an N95/P2 respirator) probably makes little to no difference compared to a medical or surgical mask. It likely does not change their risk of getting a lab-confirmed flu infection.\n\nWashing hands or using hand sanitiser probably slightly reduces the number of people who get a breathing illness. For every 1000 people who did not wash their hands, 380 might get sick. With hand washing, this number would drop to about 327. However, hand washing may make little to no difference to the number of people who get an influenza-like illness or a lab-confirmed case of influenza.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. One reason is that people in the studies often knew which measure they were using (e.g., wearing a mask or not), which could have affected their behaviour and the results. Also, the studies included different types of people, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

However, it is not approved because there are several opportunities to improve clarity for a lay audience by simplifying complex vocabulary and sentence structures. The text uses more complex words, long words, and nouns than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which can make it harder for readers to process. The feedback below focuses on the top 3 areas for improvement with specific examples to make the summary more accessible.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, the analysis also flags significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics are in the P90 range (higher than 90% of typical PLS texts): `nouns` (199), `smog_index` (13.9), `complex_words_dc` (253), `complex_words` (117), and `long_words` (198). This indicates that while sentence length is good, the choice of words is often more complex and technical than necessary, which could create barriers for some readers."
