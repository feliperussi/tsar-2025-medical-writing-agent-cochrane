  "draft": "Can physical measures, like wearing face masks and washing hands, help stop or slow the spread of viruses that cause breathing illnesses?\n\nKey messages\n- It is uncertain if wearing face masks stops the spread of breathing illnesses. Wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness, based on either symptoms or a lab test.\n- Washing hands with soap and water or using hand sanitiser probably slightly reduces the number of people who catch a breathing illness.\n- Our confidence in these results is limited because of how the studies were designed and because many people did not follow the instructions they were given.\n\nWhy is it important to stop the spread of respiratory viruses?\nInfections of the nose, throat, and lungs, like the flu and COVID-19, are caused by viruses that spread easily from person to person. When these viruses spread quickly to many people, they can cause large outbreaks that threaten global health. Vaccines and medicines can help, but they may not be enough to stop these illnesses from spreading.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well 'physical measures' work to stop or slow the spread of these viruses. Physical measures are actions people can take, instead of using medicines. Examples include washing hands, wearing face masks, keeping a distance from others, screening people for illness before they enter a place, and staying away from others when sick (isolation or quarantine). This is an update of our last review and includes new studies from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies where people are put into different groups by chance to compare different treatments or actions. These are called randomized controlled trials. We looked for trials that tested how well physical measures slow the spread of breathing viruses. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 78 studies. The 11 new studies in this update included 610,872 people. The studies took place in different places, from schools and hospitals in wealthier countries to crowded city areas in poorer countries. The newest studies were in Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway.\n\nWe looked at several physical measures. We compared:\n– wearing a medical or surgical mask versus wearing no mask\n– wearing a more protective mask (called an N95/P2 respirator) versus wearing a medical or surgical mask\n– washing hands versus not washing hands\n\nWe did not find any studies on using gowns and gloves, face shields, or checking people for illness at entry points.\n\nWearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness, based on either symptoms or a lab test.\n\nFor healthcare workers, wearing a more protective mask (an N95/P2 respirator) instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference in preventing a lab-confirmed flu infection.\n\nWashing hands or using hand sanitiser probably slightly lowers the number of people who get a breathing illness. For example, out of 1000 people who did not wash their hands, 380 might get sick. With hand washing, this number would likely drop to about 327. However, hand washing may make little to no difference to the number of people who get an illness like the flu or a case of flu confirmed by a lab test.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. First, many people in the studies did not follow the instructions they were given, such as wearing masks or washing hands consistently. Second, in the mask studies, people knew they were in the mask group, which might have changed their other behaviours. Finally, the studies were done with different groups of people, and there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

To make the key findings even easier for readers to understand, I recommend focusing on these three improvements.\n\n1. **Break up the long sentence about masks.** The main finding on masks is packed into a single, 31-word sentence that is difficult to process.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness, based on either symptoms or a lab test.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people who get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness. This was true whether the illness was diagnosed based on symptoms or a lab test.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the handwashing results.** The summary presents two findings about handwashing back-to-back that might seem contradictory to a reader.\n   - **Original text:** \"Washing hands or using hand sanitiser probably slightly lowers the number of people who get a breathing illness... However, hand washing may make little to no difference to the number of people who get an illness like the flu or a case of flu confirmed by a lab test.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This could be confusing. The key is the difference between a *general* breathing illness and the *flu specifically*, which isn't immediately obvious.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Washing hands or using hand sanitiser probably slightly reduces the number of people who get a general breathing illness (like a common cold). However, it may make little to no difference for more specific illnesses like the flu.\"\n\n3. **Replace complex words with simpler alternatives.** The summary uses some words that are longer or more formal than necessary, which can make it harder to read.\n   - **Original phrase:** \"...many people in the studies did not follow the instructions they were given, such as wearing masks or washing hands consistently.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...many people in the studies did not always follow the instructions they were given, such as wearing masks or washing hands.\"\n   - **Original phrase:** \"We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We then combined the results and rated how certain we were in them.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and structure. However, the analysis also flags a high number of nouns (195), Dale-Chall complex words (240), and long words (181), all falling in the P90 range. This supports the editorial feedback to focus on simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure in key places to improve clarity for the reader."
