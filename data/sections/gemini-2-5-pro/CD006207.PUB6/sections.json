  "key_messages": [
    "It is uncertain whether physical measures, like wearing face masks or washing hands, stop or slow the spread of breathing viruses. Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the number of people who get an influenza-like illness (an illness with fever and cough or sore throat), and hand washing is likely to slightly reduce the number of people who catch a breathing illness. Unwanted effects of these measures were not well reported in the studies.",
    "Our confidence in these results is limited because of issues with the way the studies were designed and because not all people in the studies followed the measures as instructed. Better-quality studies are needed to understand the effects of these physical measures, especially during virus pandemics."

      "subheading": "Why is it important to stop the spread of respiratory viruses?",
      "content": "Infections of the nose, throat, and lungs, such as influenza (flu) and COVID-19, are caused by viruses that can spread easily between people. When these viruses spread quickly and widely, they can cause epidemics and pandemics, which pose a major threat to global health. Although vaccines and medicines are available, they may not be enough to prevent the spread of these illnesses."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out how well 'physical interventions' work to stop or reduce the spread of these viruses. Physical interventions are actions people can take, rather than using medicines. Examples include washing hands, wearing face masks, keeping a distance from others, screening people for illness before they enter a place, and isolation or quarantine. This is an update of a previous review and includes new evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic."

      "content": "We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups by chance) that looked at the effects of physical interventions to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review included 78 randomised controlled trials; 11 of these studies were new for this update and involved 610,872 people. The studies were conducted in various settings, including suburban schools, hospital wards in high-income countries, and crowded inner-city settings in low-income countries. The newest studies took place in Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway. The review examined several physical interventions, including comparisons of medical/surgical masks versus no masks, N95/P2 respirators versus medical/surgical masks, and hand hygiene versus no intervention. The authors did not find any randomised controlled trials on the use of gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports. For people in the community, wearing a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference to whether they catch an influenza-like or COVID-19-like illness. It also probably makes little to no difference to whether they get a laboratory-confirmed case of influenza or COVID-19. For healthcare workers, using a more protective N95/P2 respirator instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference to their risk of catching a laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Hand hygiene, such as handwashing or using hand sanitiser, probably slightly reduces the number of people who get an acute respiratory illness. For every 1000 people, this would mean a reduction from 380 people getting sick to about 327. However, hand hygiene may make little to no difference to the number of people who get an influenza-like illness or a laboratory-confirmed case of influenza."

  "limitations": "Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns that it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Additionally, the studies were done in different types of people, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search."
