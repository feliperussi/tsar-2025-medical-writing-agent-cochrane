  "draft": "Can physical measures, like wearing face masks and washing hands, help stop or slow the spread of viruses that cause breathing illnesses?\n\nKey messages\n- We are uncertain about the effects of wearing face masks to stop or slow the spread of viruses that cause breathing illnesses. Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get an illness like the flu (an illness with fever and cough or sore throat).\n- Washing hands is likely helpful and probably slightly lowers the number of people who catch a breathing illness.\n- We have limited confidence in these results because of the way the studies were done and because many people did not use the measures as they were asked to. The studies also gave little information about any harms or downsides.\n\nWhy is it important to stop the spread of respiratory viruses?\nInfections of the nose, throat, and lungs, like the flu and COVID-19, are caused by viruses that spread easily from person to person. When these viruses spread quickly to many people, they can cause large outbreaks that are a major threat to people's health around the world. Vaccines and medicines can help, but they may not be enough to stop these illnesses from spreading.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well 'physical measures' work to stop or slow the spread of these viruses. Physical measures are actions people can take, instead of using medicines. Examples include washing hands, wearing face masks, keeping a distance from others, screening people for illness before they enter a place, and staying away from others when sick (isolation or quarantine). This is an update of our last review and includes new studies from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into different groups by chance to compare different treatments or actions. We looked for trials that studied the effects of physical measures to slow the spread of breathing viruses. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 78 studies. The 11 new studies in this update included 610,872 people. The studies took place in different places, from schools and hospitals in wealthier countries to crowded city areas in poorer countries. The newest studies were in Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway.\n\nWe looked at several physical measures. We compared:\n- wearing a medical or surgical mask versus wearing no mask\n- wearing a more protective mask (called an N95/P2 respirator) versus wearing a medical or surgical mask\n- washing hands versus not washing hands\n\nWe did not find any studies on using gowns and gloves, face shields, or checking people for illness at entry points.\n\nFor people in the community, wearing a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference to whether they catch an illness like the flu or COVID-19. It also probably makes little to no difference to whether they get a case of flu or COVID-19 that is confirmed by a lab test.\n\nFor healthcare workers, wearing a more protective mask (an N95/P2 respirator) probably makes little to no difference compared to a medical or surgical mask in their risk of getting a flu infection confirmed by a lab test.\n\nWashing hands or using hand sanitiser probably slightly lowers the number of people who get a breathing illness. For example, out of 1000 people who did not wash their hands, 380 might get sick. With hand washing, this number would likely drop to about 327. However, hand washing may make little to no difference to the number of people who get an illness like the flu or a case of flu confirmed by a lab test.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in these results for a few reasons. People in the studies knew if they were wearing a mask or not. This knowledge might have changed how they acted, which could affect the results. Also, the studies were done with different groups of people, and there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and meets the word count. The key messages are clear. I am recommending 'NOT_APPROVED' not because of major errors, but to highlight a consistent pattern of wordiness that can be improved. By simplifying some key sentences, we can make this excellent summary even more accessible to readers.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify wordy, noun-heavy phrases.** Some sentences use complex noun phrases where a simple verb would be clearer and more direct.\n   - **Original:** \"We looked for trials that studied the effects of physical measures to slow the spread of breathing viruses.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"studied the effects of\" is indirect. \n   - **Suggestion:** \"We looked for trials that tested how well physical measures slow the spread of breathing viruses.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the explanation of study limitations.** The current explanation of bias is a bit vague and may not be clear to a lay reader.\n   - **Original:** \"People in the studies knew if they were wearing a mask or not. This knowledge might have changed how they acted, which could affect the results.\"\n   - **Problem:** This doesn't explain *why* knowing you're in a study group matters. It's better to be more explicit.\n   - **Suggestion:** \"Our confidence is limited because people in the studies knew whether or not they were wearing a mask. This knowledge might have caused them to change their behaviour in other ways, which could affect the results.\"\n\n3. **Break down long, dense sentences in the results.** One sentence in particular combines the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome, making it hard to follow in one go.\n   - **Original:** \"For healthcare workers, wearing a more protective mask (an N95/P2 respirator) probably makes little to no difference compared to a medical or surgical mask in their risk of getting a flu infection confirmed by a lab test.\"\n   - **Problem:** This single sentence contains too many distinct ideas.\n   - **Suggestion:** Break it into two shorter sentences: \"For healthcare workers, wearing a more protective mask (an N95/P2 respirator) instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little to no difference. Their risk of getting a lab-confirmed flu infection was similar with both types of masks.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 8.4). However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. The number of nouns, Dale-Chall complex words, and long words all fall in the 90th percentile range, indicating the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a PLS. The suggested edits focus on simplifying these word choices to improve clarity."
