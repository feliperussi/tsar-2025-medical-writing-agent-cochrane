  "draft": "Can physical measures, like wearing face masks and washing hands, help stop or slow the spread of viruses that cause breathing illnesses?\n\nKey messages\n- We are uncertain about the effects of wearing face masks to stop the spread of breathing illnesses. The available evidence suggests that wearing a mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to how many people get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness.\n- Washing hands with soap and water or using hand sanitiser probably slightly reduces the number of people who catch a breathing illness.\n- Our confidence in these results is limited because of how the studies were designed and because many people did not follow the instructions they were given.\n\nWhy is it important to stop the spread of respiratory viruses?\nInfections of the nose, throat, and lungs, like the flu and COVID-19, are caused by viruses that spread easily from person to person. When these viruses spread quickly to many people, they can cause large outbreaks that threaten global health. Vaccines and medicines can help, but they may not be enough to stop these illnesses from spreading.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well 'physical measures' work to stop or slow the spread of these viruses. Physical measures are actions people can take, instead of using medicines. Examples include washing hands, wearing face masks, keeping a distance from others, screening people for illness before they enter a place, and staying away from others when sick (isolation or quarantine). This is an update of our last review and includes new studies from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called 'randomized controlled trials', where people are put into different groups by chance. These studies tested how well physical measures, like wearing masks or washing hands, slow the spread of breathing viruses. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 78 studies. The 11 new studies in this update included 610,872 people. The studies took place in different places, from schools and hospitals in wealthier countries to crowded city areas in poorer countries. The newest studies were in Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway.\n\nWe looked at several physical measures. We compared:\n– wearing a medical or surgical mask versus wearing no mask\n– wearing a more protective mask (called an N95/P2 respirator) versus wearing a medical or surgical mask\n– washing hands versus not washing hands\n\nWe did not find any studies on using gowns and gloves, face shields, or checking people for illness at entry points.\n\nPeople in the community who wear a medical or surgical mask probably get a flu-like or COVID-19-like illness at about the same rate as people who do not wear a mask. This was true whether the illness was diagnosed by symptoms or a lab test.\n\nHealthcare workers who wear a more protective mask (an N95/P2 respirator) instead of a medical or surgical mask probably get a lab-confirmed flu infection at about the same rate.\n\nWashing hands or using hand sanitiser probably slightly reduces the number of people who get a general breathing illness (like a common cold). For example, out of 1000 people who did not wash their hands, 380 might get sick. With hand washing, this number would likely drop to about 327. However, people who wash their hands may get the flu, or have it confirmed by a lab test, at about the same rate as people who do not.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. First, many people in the studies did not always follow the instructions they were given, like wearing masks or washing hands consistently. Second, people in the mask studies knew which group they were in, which might have changed their other behaviours. Finally, the studies included different groups of people, and there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

The only deviations from typical patterns are slightly higher counts of nouns, long words, and complex words (Dale-Chall).
