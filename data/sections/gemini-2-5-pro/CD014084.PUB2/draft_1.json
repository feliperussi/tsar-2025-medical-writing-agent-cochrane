  "draft": "What are the effects of sinus surgery for people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps (growths in the nose)?\n\nKey messages\n\nDue to a lack of strong evidence, we are uncertain about the effects of sinus surgery for people with cystic fibrosis who have growths in the nose (nasal polyps). It is not clear if the surgery improves nose-related symptoms or lung function. One episode of bleeding during surgery was reported in the single small study found.\n\nLarger and longer-term studies are needed to find out if sinus surgery is helpful and safe for people of all ages with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps.\n\nWhat are sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis?\n\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body. In the nose and sinuses, this mucus can cause long-term swelling and lead to the growth of non-cancerous lumps called nasal polyps. This condition is known as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. These polyps can block the sinuses, making it difficult to breathe through the nose and leading to infections. One treatment option is endoscopic sinus surgery, a procedure to open the sinuses and remove the polyps, which may help other medical treatments work better.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to find out how effective sinus surgery is for people with cystic fibrosis who have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We compared people who had sinus surgery (with or without other medical treatments) to people who had medical treatments alone. We were interested in the effects on both nasal symptoms and lung function. We also wanted to know if surgery affected how often people were hospitalized, needed antibiotics, or had flare-ups of their lung condition (pulmonary exacerbations).\n\nMethods\n\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared sinus surgery with medical treatment for people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nThe review included one study with 28 participants aged 19 to 28 years with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. The study compared nasal irrigation combined with surgery (endoscopic polypectomy with extended sinusotomy, a procedure to remove polyps and open the sinuses) against nasal irrigation alone. For people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyps, the review found very uncertain evidence about the effects of adding sinus surgery to medical treatment (such as nasal rinses). Therefore, we do not know if adding surgery improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial infections in the sinuses, or lessens the need for antibiotics. We also do not know if it affects lung function or the number of lung flare-ups compared with medical treatment alone.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\n\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\n\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, factually accurate draft that is very close to being approved. The main reason for this decision is that several subheadings do not follow the question-based format required by the style guide. Addressing this, along with two other minor clarity improvements, will make the summary much easier for readers to navigate.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase subheadings as questions.** Several subheadings are statements, not questions. The style guide requires question-based headings to help readers scan the text and find information easily.\n    *   **Quote:** \"Methods\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\"\n    *   **Problem:** These are labels, not questions. They don't engage the reader or explain what information the section contains in a user-friendly way.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change them to questions, for example:\n        *   \"How did we conduct the review?\"\n        *   \"How reliable is the evidence?\"\n        *   \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n2.  **Simplify the complex sentence in the results.** The sentence describing the surgical procedure is long (33 words) and contains a lot of technical information, which can be difficult for readers to process all at once.\n    *   **Quote:** \"The study compared nasal irrigation combined with surgery (endoscopic polypectomy with extended sinusotomy, a procedure to remove polyps and open the sinuses) against nasal irrigation alone.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This sentence combines the comparison, the technical term for the surgery, and the plain language explanation into a single, dense sentence.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this into two shorter sentences for better readability:\n        *   \"The study compares a combination of nasal irrigation and surgery against nasal irrigation alone. The surgery was a procedure to remove polyps and open the sinuses (called endoscopic polypectomy with extended sinusotomy).\"\n\n3.  **Make the final sentence more natural.** The currency statement is slightly awkward and ungrammatical.\n    *   **Quote:** \"The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.\"\n    *   **Problem:** The phrase \"of search\" is clunky and unclear. A more direct and polished final sentence would leave a better impression on the reader.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please rephrase this to be more direct:\n        *   \"This review includes evidence published up to September 2022.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of its features falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. The readability scores are excellent (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 11.4). The one metric that deviates from typical patterns is 'nominalization' (P90), which suggests that some sentences could be more direct by using verbs instead of noun forms. The feedback provided addresses specific instances where this can be improved."
