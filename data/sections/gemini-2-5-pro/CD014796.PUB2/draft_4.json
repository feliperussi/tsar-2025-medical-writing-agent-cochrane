  "draft": "What are the views and experiences of the public, health professionals, and policymakers on general health check-ups?\n\nKey messages\n- General health check-ups are popular, even though research shows they do little to prevent illness or death. People find them reassuring and feel motivated to live healthier lives.\n- The main reasons people avoid check-ups are fear of the results, the cost of potential follow-up treatment, and lack of time.\n- Health professionals found it hard to provide check-ups because of a lack of time, staff, and resources. They also noted that while people often liked having a wide range of tests, it might be better to match check-ups to a person's own health risks.\n- The review found little evidence about why policymakers plan and fund health check-ups. More research is needed to understand this. It would also help to have a useful discussion about the future of these popular services, which could include offering other ways to support people's health.\n\nWhat are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are a set of tests offered to people who do not have any symptoms of illness. The aim is to check a person's overall health and find any problems early, to try to reduce future illness and prevent death. However, a previous major review found that general health checks do little to prevent death from any cause, including from cancer or heart disease. This raises questions about why these checks are still so common and popular.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand the views and experiences of the different groups of people involved in general health checks. We aimed to find out how the public, healthcare providers (such as doctors and nurses), and policymakers (people who plan and fund health services) view these checks. We wanted to look at what influences decisions to offer health checks, how they are provided, and why people decide to have them.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that explore people's views and experiences of general health checks. We combined the findings from these studies and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 146 studies and looked closely at 36 of them for our analysis. The studies explored the views and experiences of the public, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers. Most studies were from high-income European countries, but nearly a third took place in middle-income countries.\n\nWe found that people’s personal beliefs about disease, risk, and preventing illness were important in their decision to get a health check. It is also important that the people providing health checks are skilled and sensitive to different cultures.\n\nWe are moderately confident in several other findings. For people who get health checks, the experience motivates them to live more healthily and reassures them about their health. However, people are less likely to go if they fear bad results or prefer to wait for symptoms before seeing a doctor. Practical issues, like not having enough time or worrying about the cost of follow-up treatment, also affect whether people go.\n\nHealthcare providers play an important role in encouraging people to take part. However, providing health checks is made difficult by problems like lack of time, staff shortages, and limited resources. The review suggests that health checks could be improved by matching them to a person's own health risks and offering them in new and different places to help more people get them. For the public, a key part of the check is having the results explained and getting clear advice.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. The studies we included came from many different countries and involved various groups of people, which makes it hard to apply the findings to everyone. In some areas, there were also not enough studies for us to be certain about the results. More research would help confirm our conclusions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-structured and factually accurate, but it needs a few key revisions to improve clarity and correctly represent the certainty of the evidence. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Restore the language that signals the certainty of the evidence.** The draft states findings as facts, but the original review expressed different levels of confidence. Using words like 'probably' or 'may' is a standard way to convey this to readers.\n    *   **Problem:** 'For people who get health checks, the experience motivates them to live more healthily and reassures them about their health.'\n    *   **Reason:** This finding has moderate certainty. Stating it as a definite fact is misleading. The source text correctly uses 'probably' to reflect this.\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'For people who get health checks, the experience **probably** motivates them to live more healthily? Actually: 'For people who get health checks, the experience **probably** motivates them to live more healthily and reassures them about their health.' Apply this principle to other findings from the 'What did we find?' section.\n\n2. **Simplify abstract phrases and use more common words.** Some sentences are a bit vague and use complex vocabulary, which can make them hard to understand. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of uncommon words (Dale-Chall complex words are in the 90th percentile).\n    *   **Problem:** 'It would also help to have a useful discussion about the future of these popular services, which could include offering other ways to support people's health.'\n    *   **Reason:** This sentence is long and uses abstract concepts like 'useful discussion' and 'future of these popular services'.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this into two simpler sentences: '**More research could help plan for the future of these popular check-ups. This might include finding other ways to support people's health.**'\n\n3. **Use more active and direct language.** Some sentences use the passive voice or noun-heavy phrases, which can make the text less engaging. The analysis shows a high number of nouns (90th percentile), and converting some of these to verbs would help.\n    *   **Problem:** '...providing health checks is made difficult by problems like lack of time, staff shortages, and limited resources.'\n    *   **Reason:** This is a passive construction ('is made difficult by'). It's clearer to state who is finding it difficult.\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'However, **health providers found it difficult to offer check-ups** because of problems like lack of time, staff shortages, and limited resources.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 83% of metrics in the best quartile. Readability scores are excellent (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade 8.4) and sentence length is concise. However, two metrics deviate from typical patterns: the count of nouns (200) and Dale-Chall complex words (234) are high (P90), suggesting some sentences may be dense or use uncommon vocabulary."
