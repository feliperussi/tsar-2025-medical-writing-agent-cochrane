  "draft": "What are the views and experiences of the public, health professionals, and policymakers on general health check-ups?\n\nKey messages\n- General health check-ups are popular with the public, health professionals, and policymakers, even though other research has found they do little to prevent illness or death. People felt that check-ups reassured them and motivated them to live more healthily. However, fear of the results, cost, and time stopped people from going.\n- Health professionals found it hard to provide check-ups because of a lack of time, staff, and resources. They also noted that while people often liked having a wide range of tests, it might be better to match check-ups to a person's own health risks.\n- The review found little evidence about why policymakers plan and fund health check-ups. More research is needed to understand this. It would also help to have a useful discussion about the future of these popular services, which could include offering other ways to support people's health.\n\nWhat are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are a set of tests offered to people who do not have any symptoms of illness. The aim is to check a person's overall health and find any problems early, to try to reduce future illness and prevent death. However, a previous major review found that general health checks do little to prevent death from any cause, including from cancer or heart disease. This raises questions about why these checks are still so common and popular.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand the views and experiences of the different groups of people involved in general health checks. We aimed to find out how the public, healthcare providers (such as doctors and nurses), and policymakers (people who plan and fund health services) view these checks. We wanted to look at what influences decisions to offer health checks, how they are provided, and why people decide to have them.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that explore people's views and experiences of general health checks. We combined the findings from these studies and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 146 studies and looked closely at 36 of them for our analysis. The studies explored the views and experiences of the public, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers. Most studies were from high-income European countries, but nearly a third took place in middle-income countries.\n\nWe found that what people believe about disease, risk, and prevention affects their decision to get a health check. It is also important that the people providing health checks are skilled and sensitive to different cultures.\n\nWe are moderately confident in several other findings. For people who get health checks, the experience motivates them to live more healthily and reassures them about their health. However, people are less likely to go if they fear bad results or prefer to wait for symptoms before seeing a doctor. Practical issues, like not having enough time or worrying about the cost of follow-up treatment, also affect whether people go.\n\nHealthcare providers play an important role in encouraging people to take part. However, providing health checks is made difficult by problems like lack of time, staff shortages, and limited resources. The review suggests that health checks could be improved by matching them to a person's own health risks and offering them in new and different places to help more people get them. For the public, a key part of the check is having the results explained and getting clear advice.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. This is because the studies we included came from many different countries and involved various groups of people. This makes it difficult to be certain the findings apply to everyone, everywhere. More research would help confirm our conclusions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

Simplify the first key message for better impact.**\nThe first bullet point is quite long and combines three different ideas, which can be hard to absorb quickly.\n- **Original:** \"General health check-ups are popular with the public, health professionals, and policymakers, even though other research has found they do little to prevent illness or death. People felt that check-ups reassured them and motivated them to live more healthily.

People find them reassuring and feel motivated to live healthier lives.\"\n  - \"- The main reasons people avoid check-ups are fear of the results, the cost of potential follow-up treatment, and lack of time.\"\n\n**2. Rephrase an abstract sentence in the results section.**\nOne key finding is phrased in a way that is a bit academic. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which noted a high number of nouns and less-common words.\n- **Original:** \"We found that what people believe about disease, risk, and prevention affects their decision to get a health check.\"\n- **Suggestion:** Make this more direct and active.\n  - \"- We found that people’s personal beliefs about disease, risk, and preventing illness were important in their decision to get a health check.\"\n\n**3. Clarify the limitations of the evidence.**\nThe explanation for why your confidence is 'moderate' is incomplete, which might leave readers with questions.\n- **Original:** \"This is because the studies we included came from many different countries and involved various groups of people. This makes it difficult to be certain the findings apply to everyone, everywhere.\"\n- **Suggestion:** Add the missing context from the source material about the number of studies.\n  - \"- The studies we included came from many different countries and involved various groups of people, which makes it hard to apply the findings to everyone. In some areas, there were also not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is very well-written and highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis identified two metrics that deviate from the typical pattern: the number of nouns and the count of Dale-Chall complex words are higher than usual (both in the P90 range). This suggests some sentences may be noun-heavy or use less common vocabulary, which could be simplified for better clarity."
