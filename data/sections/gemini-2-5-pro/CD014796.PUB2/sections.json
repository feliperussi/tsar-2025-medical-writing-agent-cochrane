  "key_messages": [
    "General health check-ups are popular with the public, health professionals, and policymakers, even though other research has found they have little to no effect on preventing illness (morbidity) or death (mortality). The public felt that check-ups provided reassurance and motivated them to make healthier lifestyle choices. However, fear of the results, cost, and time were barriers to attending.",
    "Health professionals reported facing challenges in delivering check-ups, including lack of time, staff, and resources. They also noted that while the public often appreciated a wide range of tests, a better approach might be to tailor check-ups to an individual's specific health risks.",
    "The review found little evidence about the reasons why health check-ups are planned and funded by policymakers. Future research is needed to understand this, and to explore how to have a constructive debate about the future of these popular services, which might include offering alternative ways to support people's health."

      "subheading": "What are general health checks?",
      "content": "General health checks are a collection of screening tests offered to people who do not have any symptoms of illness. The aim is to assess a person's overall health and find potential problems early, with the goal of reducing future illness and preventing death. However, a previous major review found that general health checks have little to no effect on preventing death from any cause, including from cancer or heart disease. This raises questions about why these checks are still so common and popular in many healthcare systems."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to understand the views and experiences of the different groups of people involved in general health checks. We aimed to find out how clients (the public), healthcare providers (such as doctors and nurses), and policymakers (people who plan and fund health services) perceive these checks. Specifically, we wanted to explore the factors that influence decisions to offer health checks, how they are delivered, and why people decide to have them."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 146 studies, from which 36 were selected for analysis. The studies explored the views and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners. Most studies were conducted in high-income European countries, but nearly a third took place in middle-income countries in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The settings included primary and community healthcare, workplaces, and other community settings. The abstract did not provide information on the total number of participants or the funding sources for the included studies. The review found that people's personal beliefs about disease, risk, and prevention affect their decision to get a general health check. It is also important that providers of health checks are skilled and culturally sensitive. For people who get health checks, the experience probably motivates them to make lifestyle changes and provides reassurance about their health. However, people are probably less likely to attend if they fear bad results or prefer to wait for symptoms before seeing a doctor. Practical issues, like time and concerns about the cost of any follow-up treatment, also probably influence attendance. Healthcare providers probably play an important role in encouraging people to participate. However, delivering health checks is probably made difficult by challenges such as lack of time, staff shortages, and limited resources. Using new and different locations for checks probably could help more people get them. The review suggests that health checks may be improved by tailoring them to a person's individual health risks. For clients, it may be that a key part of the check is having the results explained and receiving clear recommendations."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.",
