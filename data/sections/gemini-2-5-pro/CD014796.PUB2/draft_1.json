  "draft": "What are the views and experiences of the public, health professionals, and policymakers on general health check-ups?\n\nKey messages\n- General health check-ups are popular with the public, health professionals, and policymakers, even though other research has found they have little to no effect on preventing illness (morbidity) or death (mortality). The public felt that check-ups provided reassurance and motivated them to make healthier lifestyle choices. However, fear of the results, cost, and time were barriers to attending.\n- Health professionals reported facing challenges in delivering check-ups, including lack of time, staff, and resources. They also noted that while the public often appreciated a wide range of tests, a better approach might be to tailor check-ups to an individual's specific health risks.\n- The review found little evidence about the reasons why health check-ups are planned and funded by policymakers. Future research is needed to understand this, and to explore how to have a constructive debate about the future of these popular services, which might include offering alternative ways to support people's health.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhat are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are a collection of screening tests offered to people who do not have any symptoms of illness. The aim is to assess a person's overall health and find potential problems early, with the goal of reducing future illness and preventing death. However, a previous major review found that general health checks have little to no effect on preventing death from any cause, including from cancer or heart disease. This raises questions about why these checks are still so common and popular in many healthcare systems.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand the views and experiences of the different groups of people involved in general health checks. We aimed to find out how clients (the public), healthcare providers (such as doctors and nurses), and policymakers (people who plan and fund health services) perceive these checks. Specifically, we wanted to explore the factors that influence decisions to offer health checks, how they are delivered, and why people decide to have them.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for 'qualitative' studies, which explore people's views and experiences of general health checks. We combined the findings from these studies and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 146 studies, from which 36 were selected for analysis. The studies explored the views and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers or commissioners. Most studies were conducted in high-income European countries, but nearly a third took place in middle-income countries in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The settings included primary and community healthcare, workplaces, and other community settings. The abstract did not provide information on the total number of participants or the funding sources for the included studies. The review found that people's personal beliefs about disease, risk, and prevention affect their decision to get a general health check. It is also important that providers of health checks are skilled and culturally sensitive. For people who get health checks, the experience probably motivates them to make lifestyle changes and provides reassurance about their health. However, people are probably less likely to attend if they fear bad results or prefer to wait for symptoms before seeing a doctor. Practical issues, like time and concerns about the cost of any follow-up treatment, also probably influence attendance. Healthcare providers probably play an important role in encouraging people to participate. However, delivering health checks is probably made difficult by challenges such as lack of time, staff shortages, and limited resources. Using new and different locations for checks probably could help more people get them. The review suggests that health checks may be improved by tailoring them to a person's individual health risks. For clients, it may be that a key part of the check is having the results explained and receiving clear recommendations.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start, but it cannot be approved because it has critical issues with its structure and some clarity problems that affect readability. \n\n**Critical Issue: Subheadings Must Be Questions**\nSeveral subheadings do not follow the style guide requirement to be phrased as questions. This is essential for reader navigation.\n- **Original:** \"Methods\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"How did we conduct the review?\"\n- **Original:** \"Limitations\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n- **Original:** \"Currency\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed to enhance clarity for your readers:\n\n**1. Simplify Noun-Heavy, Abstract Sentences**\nSome sentences are grammatically correct but hard for a lay reader to process quickly because they are built around abstract nouns instead of simple actions.\n- **Original:** \"The review found that people's personal beliefs about disease, risk, and prevention affect their decision to get a general health check.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is dense with abstract concepts ('beliefs', 'risk', 'prevention', 'decision'). Using more direct verbs would make it easier to understand.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We found that what people believe about disease, risk, and prevention affects whether they decide to get a health check.\"\n\n**2. Avoid Repetitive Phrasing**\nThe word \"probably\" is used five times in the main results paragraph. While this reflects the 'moderate' evidence certainty, the repetition can make the text sound hesitant and monotonous.\n- **Original:** \"...the experience probably motivates them... people are probably less likely to attend... also probably influence attendance. Healthcare providers probably play an important role... is probably made difficult by challenges...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The constant repetition can distract the reader and weaken the impact of the findings.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** Consider introducing the confidence level upfront and then stating the findings more directly. For example: \"We are moderately confident in several findings. For people who get health checks, the experience motivates them to make lifestyle changes and provides reassurance. However, they are less likely to attend if they fear bad results...\"\n\n**3. Replace Formal Language with Everyday Words**\nSome word choices are more formal than necessary for a plain language summary. Choosing simpler, more direct words improves readability.\n- **Original:** \"Practical issues, like time and concerns about the cost of any follow-up treatment, also probably influence attendance.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"influence attendance\" is formal and less direct than it could be.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Practical issues, like not having enough time or worrying about the cost of follow-up treatment, also probably affect whether people go to their check-ups.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour own editorial instincts about complex vocabulary are supported by the evaluation metrics. The draft has a higher number of nouns, complex words, and long words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which contributes to the clarity issues noted above.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, particularly in readability and active voice (50% of metrics are in the best quartile). However, there are significant deviations in vocabulary complexity. The number of nouns is beyond the 90th percentile, and metrics for complex words, long words, and the SMOG index are also in the 90th percentile range. This indicates that while sentence structure is generally good, the choice of words is often more complex than in a typical PLS, supporting the need to simplify vocabulary and reduce noun-heavy phrasing."
