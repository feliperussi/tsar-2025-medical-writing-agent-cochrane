  "draft": "What are the views and experiences of the public, health professionals, and policymakers on general health check-ups?\n\nKey messages\n- General health check-ups are popular with the public, health professionals, and policymakers, even though other research has found they have little to no effect on preventing illness (morbidity) or death (mortality). The public felt that check-ups provided reassurance and motivated them to make healthier lifestyle choices. However, fear of the results, cost, and time were barriers to attending.\n- Health professionals reported facing challenges in delivering check-ups, including lack of time, staff, and resources. They also noted that while the public often appreciated a wide range of tests, a better approach might be to tailor check-ups to an individual's specific health risks.\n- The review found little evidence about the reasons why health check-ups are planned and funded by policymakers. Future research is needed to understand this, and to explore how to have a constructive debate about the future of these popular services, which might include offering alternative ways to support people's health.\n\nWhat are general health checks?\nGeneral health checks are a collection of screening tests offered to people who do not have any symptoms of illness. The aim is to assess a person's overall health and find potential problems early, with the goal of reducing future illness and preventing death. However, a previous major review found that general health checks have little to no effect on preventing death from any cause, including from cancer or heart disease. This raises questions about why these checks are still so common and popular in many healthcare systems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to understand the views and experiences of the different groups of people involved in general health checks. We aimed to find out how clients (the public), healthcare providers (such as doctors and nurses), and policymakers (people who plan and fund health services) perceive these checks. Specifically, we wanted to explore the factors that influence decisions to offer health checks, how they are delivered, and why people decide to have them.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for 'qualitative' studies, which explore people's views and experiences of general health checks. We combined the findings from these studies and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 146 studies in the review and selected 36 for our analysis. The studies explored the views and experiences of clients, healthcare providers, and healthcare managers. Most studies were from high-income European countries, but nearly a third took place in middle-income countries.\n\nWe found that what people believe about disease, risk, and prevention affects whether they decide to get a health check. It is also important that providers of health checks are skilled and culturally sensitive.\n\nWe are moderately confident in several other findings. For people who get health checks, the experience motivates them to make lifestyle changes and provides reassurance about their health. However, people are less likely to attend if they fear bad results or prefer to wait for symptoms before seeing a doctor. Practical issues, like not having enough time or worrying about the cost of follow-up treatment, also affect whether people go.\n\nHealthcare providers play an important role in encouraging people to participate, but delivering health checks is made difficult by challenges such as lack of time, staff shortages, and limited resources. The review suggests that health checks may be improved by tailoring them to a person's individual health risks and using new and different locations to help more people get them. For clients, a key part of the check is having the results explained and receiving clear recommendations.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. This is because the studies included different types of people, and we need more research to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It's a clear and well-structured summary that passes all our critical checks for accuracy and completeness. To make it even more accessible to a lay audience, I have three main suggestions focusing on simplifying the language.\n\n1. **Replace technical terms in the Key Messages.** The first key message is crucial for setting the stage. Using simpler language will have the biggest impact here.\n*   **The sentence:** '...even though other research has found they have little to no effect on preventing illness (morbidity) or death (mortality).'\n*   **Why it's a problem:** 'Morbidity' and 'mortality' are medical jargon. While you've defined them, the sentence is more direct and easier to read without them.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** '...even though other research has found they do little to prevent illness or death.'\n\n2. **Make the 'Limitations' section more specific.** The current explanation is a bit vague and could leave readers wondering what the actual limitations are.\n*   **The sentence:** 'This is because the studies included different types of people, and we need more research to be certain about the findings.'\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This doesn't fully explain *why* including 'different types of people' is a limitation for the reader.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Our confidence is moderate because the studies we included came from many different countries and involved various groups of people. This makes it difficult to be certain the findings apply to everyone, everywhere. More research would help confirm our conclusions.'\n\n3. **Reduce complex words and noun-heavy phrases.** The summary sometimes uses longer, more formal words where simpler ones would work better. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which found the text has a higher number of nouns, long words, and complex words than is typical for a PLS.\n*   **Example 1:** 'Healthcare providers played a crucial role in motivating **participation**, but negative experiences with unqualified providers discouraged **attendance**.'\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Healthcare providers played a crucial role in encouraging people to take part, but bad experiences with unqualified staff discouraged people from going.'\n*   **Example 2:** 'The public felt that check-ups provided **reassurance** and **motivated** them to make healthier lifestyle choices.'\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'People felt that check-ups reassured them and motivated them to live more healthily.'\n\nBy making these adjustments, particularly to the vocabulary, the summary will be even more effective for a public audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS draft is well-structured and generally readable, with 72% of its linguistic features falling into the best quartile for PLS conformity. However, the analysis reveals a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary. Four metrics—noun count, SMOG index, Dale-Chall complex words, and long words—are in the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range. This indicates the text uses more nouns, more words with 3+ syllables, and more long words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which could affect reader comprehension."
