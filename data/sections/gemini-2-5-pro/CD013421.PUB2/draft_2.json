  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding where blood vessels are joined together (anastomosis) during surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having surgery on their blood vessels, using sealants (a type of surgical glue) to stop bleeding where vessels are joined (anastomosis) may help stop the bleeding faster and may reduce the chance that the initial attempt to stop the bleeding fails. However, it is not clear if using sealants makes a difference to the amount of blood lost, the length of the operation, or the need for another surgery to control bleeding. The studies did not report on important unwanted effects like death from bleeding.\n- The evidence is uncertain because of limitations in how the studies were conducted. Future research is needed to provide more reliable results and to better understand the potential unwanted effects and costs of using sealants.\n\nHow can bleeding be stopped during surgery on blood vessels?\nDuring surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery), surgeons often need to connect arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts. This connection is called an 'anastomosis'. These connection points can bleed from the small holes made by the surgical needles. The process of stopping bleeding is known as 'hemostasis'. When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants' directly to the bleeding area to help stop it. Although several types of sealants are available, it is not clear how effective they are for patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using sealants to help stop bleeding at the site of an anastomosis in people having vascular surgery.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with other methods to stop bleeding in people having vascular surgery. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2376 people undergoing vascular surgery. The studies compared using sealants to standard methods for stopping bleeding, such as applying pressure or using special sponges. People were followed for up to 30 days after their surgery. We did not find any studies that reported on death from bleeding or quality of life. The review did not state where the studies took place or how they were funded.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nWhen used to stop bleeding from the connection sites of blood vessels during surgery, sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop the bleeding. Sealants may reduce the number of times the first attempt to stop bleeding fails, but the evidence for this is very uncertain. Sealants may make little to no difference to the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total time the surgery takes, bleeding after the operation, or the need for another operation to manage bleeding. We did not find any studies that looked at death from bleeding or people's quality of life.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting. We also have concerns for a few reasons. The studies included different types of people, and there were not enough of them to be certain about the results. We also think the included studies may exaggerate the benefits of using sealants.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience by simplifying vocabulary and clarifying the study limitations. The following 3 improvements will make the summary much easier for patients to understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Remove Redundant Definitions and Jargon**\n\n*   **Quote:** The term 'anastomosis' is defined in both the 'Key messages' and the 'How can bleeding be stopped...' sections.\n*   **Why it's problematic:** Defining a technical term twice is unnecessary. It's best to introduce it once where it's most relevant and use simpler language elsewhere, especially in the key messages which should be as clear as possible.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:**\n    *   In 'Key messages', remove the term: \"...to stop bleeding where vessels are joined together may help...\"\n    *   Keep the full definition in the background section: \"This connection is called an 'anastomosis'.\"\n\n**2. Replace Technical Terms with Simpler Explanations**\n\n*   **Quote:** \"The process of stopping bleeding is known as 'hemostasis'.\" and \"We also think the included studies may exaggerate the benefits of using sealants.\"\n*   **Why it's problematic:** These phrases use unnecessary jargon ('hemostasis') and abstract language ('exaggerate the benefits') that can be simplified. The term 'hemostasis' is never used again, so defining it adds complexity without benefit.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:**\n    *   Instead of defining 'hemostasis', simply remove that sentence and merge the surrounding ideas: \"These connection points can bleed from the small holes made by the surgical needles. When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough to stop the bleeding, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants' directly to the area.\"\n    *   Explain *why* the benefits might be exaggerated: \"We also think that studies showing benefits for sealants were more likely to be published, which could make the treatment look better than it actually is.\"\n\n**3. Clarify Vague Wording in the Limitations**\n\n*   **Quote:** \"The studies included different types of people, and there were not enough of them to be certain about the results.\"\n*   **Why it's problematic:** This sentence combines two separate issues and uses vague language. 'Different types of people' and 'not enough of them' could be interpreted in multiple ways.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** Break this into two clearer points: \"The studies included people having different types of blood vessel surgery, which makes the results harder to combine. Also, some findings are based on a small number of participants, which makes them less certain.\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence\n\nYour draft is very readable overall, but the linguistic analysis supports the need for vocabulary simplification. The metrics for **nouns (P90)**, **complex words (P90)**, and **long words (P90)** are all higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which aligns with the feedback to reduce jargon and use more common language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS draft shows strong conformity with typical patterns in readability and sentence structure, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary, with high counts for nouns, long words (7+ characters), and complex words from the Dale-Chall list. This suggests the text may be noun-heavy and use less common vocabulary than is typical for a PLS, which could impact reader understanding."
