  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding where blood vessels are joined together (anastomosis) during surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having surgery on their blood vessels, using sealants (a type of surgical glue) where vessels are joined (anastomosis) may stop bleeding faster. However, it is unclear if using sealants reduces the number of times the first attempt to stop bleeding fails, or if they affect the amount of blood lost, the length of the operation, or the need for another surgery. The studies did not report on serious harms, such as death from bleeding.\n- The evidence is uncertain because of weaknesses in how the studies were done. Future research is needed to provide more reliable results and to better understand the possible harms and costs of using sealants.\n\nHow can bleeding be stopped during surgery on blood vessels?\nWhen people have surgery on their blood vessels (vascular surgery), surgeons often need to join blood vessels or attach special tubes (grafts) to redirect blood flow. The place where they are joined is called an anastomosis. These connection points can leak or bleed from the tiny holes made by the surgeon's needle. Usually, bleeding is stopped by applying pressure. When this is not enough, surgeons can use special products called 'sealants', which act like a surgical glue, directly on the bleeding area. There are several types of sealants, but it is not clear how well they work for people having blood vessel surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using sealants to help stop bleeding at the site of an anastomosis in people having vascular surgery.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with other ways to stop bleeding in people having vascular surgery. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2376 people undergoing vascular surgery. The studies compared using sealants to standard methods for stopping bleeding, such as applying pressure or using special sponges. Researchers followed people for up to 30 days after their surgery. We did not find any studies that reported on death from bleeding or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nSealants may help stop bleeding faster at the connection sites of blood vessels. However, it is unclear if using sealants reduces the number of times the first attempt to stop bleeding fails.\nSealants may make little to no difference to:\n– the amount of blood lost during surgery\n– the length of the surgery\n– bleeding after the operation\n– the need for another operation to manage bleeding.\nWe did not find any studies that looked at death from bleeding or people's quality of life.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. The main limitations were:\n– People in the studies and the researchers knew which treatment was being used, which could have influenced the results.\n– The studies included people having different types of surgery, which makes it hard to compare the results.\n– Some results were based on a small number of people, which makes them less certain.\n– It is possible that studies with positive results for sealants were more likely to be published. This could make the benefits of sealants seem larger than they are.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

The summary incorrectly states it is 'unclear' if sealants reduce the failure rate of stopping bleeding, whereas the source material indicates they 'may reduce' this rate, with very low certainty. This must be corrected in the Key Messages and Main Results sections. Additionally, a few sentences could be more concise to improve readability, particularly in the limitations section. Addressing these points will make the summary ready for approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. The readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 8.6) are excellent. However, the analysis identified two metrics deviating from typical patterns: the count of nouns (P90) and Dale-Chall complex words (P90). The high noun count supports the editorial feedback to rephrase some sentences to be more direct and verb-driven."
