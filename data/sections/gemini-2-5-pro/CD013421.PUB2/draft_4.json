  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding where blood vessels are joined together (anastomosis) during surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having surgery on their blood vessels, using sealants (a type of surgical glue) to stop bleeding where vessels are joined may help stop the bleeding faster and may make the first attempt to stop bleeding more likely to succeed. However, it is not clear if using sealants changes how much blood is lost, how long the operation takes, or if another surgery is needed to control bleeding. The studies did not report on important unwanted effects like death from bleeding.\n- The evidence is uncertain because of weaknesses in how the studies were conducted. Future research is needed to provide more reliable results and to better understand the potential unwanted effects and costs of using sealants.\n\nHow can bleeding be stopped during surgery on blood vessels?\nDuring surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery), surgeons often need to connect arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts. This connection is called an 'anastomosis'. These connection points can bleed from the small holes made by the surgical needles. The process of stopping bleeding is known as 'hemostasis'. When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough to achieve hemostasis, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants' directly to the area to help stop it. Although several types of sealants are available, it is not clear how effective they are for patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using sealants to help stop bleeding at the site of an anastomosis in people having vascular surgery.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with other ways to stop bleeding in people having vascular surgery. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2376 people undergoing vascular surgery. The studies compared using sealants to standard methods for stopping bleeding, such as applying pressure or using special sponges. People were followed for up to 30 days after their surgery. We did not find any studies that reported on death from bleeding or quality of life. The review did not state where the studies took place or how they were funded.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nSealants may help stop bleeding faster at the connection sites of blood vessels. They may also make the first attempt to stop bleeding more likely to succeed, but the evidence for this is very uncertain.\nSealants may make little to no difference to:\n– how much blood is lost during surgery\n– how long the surgery takes\n– bleeding after the operation\n– the need for another operation to manage bleeding.\nWe did not find any studies that looked at death from bleeding or people's quality of life.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. People in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results. The results are also harder to combine because the studies included people having different types of surgery. Some findings are based on a small number of people, which makes them less certain. Finally, we think that studies showing a benefit were more likely to be published. This could make sealants seem more effective than they really are.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

This must be corrected for accuracy.\n    *   **Quote:** 'They may also make the first attempt to stop bleeding more likely to succeed, but the evidence for this is very uncertain.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This misrepresents the source finding, which states the effect is 'unclear'. Suggesting a potential benefit, even with a caveat, is misleading to patients.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'It is unclear if using sealants makes the first attempt to stop bleeding more likely to succeed.'\n\n2.  **Replace complex and redundant phrases:** The text sometimes uses technical phrasing where simpler, more direct language would be clearer.\n    *   **Quote:** 'When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough to achieve hemostasis, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants' directly to the area to help stop it.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The term 'hemostasis' was defined in the previous sentence as 'stopping bleeding'. Repeating 'achieve hemostasis' is redundant and overly technical.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough to stop the bleeding, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants' directly to the area.'\n\n3.  **Use more active voice:** Several sentences use passive voice, which can make the text less direct and harder to read.\n    *   **Quote:** 'People in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This construction is indirect. Active voice makes it clearer who is doing what and is generally easier for readers to follow.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We have less confidence in the evidence because the people and researchers in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\nYour draft is strong on most readability metrics. However, the analysis shows a high number of passive voice constructions (19), complex words (224), and long words (179) compared to typical summaries. Addressing the points above will help align the text with best practices for plain language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, three metrics deviate significantly from the typical range: passive_voice (19 instances), complex_words_dc (224 words), and long_words (179 words) are all in the P90 range, indicating that the text could be improved by using more active voice and simpler, shorter vocabulary."
