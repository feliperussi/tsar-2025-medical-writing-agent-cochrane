  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding where blood vessels are joined together (anastomosis) during surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having surgery on their blood vessels, using sealants (a type of surgical glue) to stop bleeding where vessels are joined may help stop the bleeding faster and may reduce the chance that the first attempt to stop the bleeding fails. However, it is not clear if using sealants changes how much blood is lost, how long the operation takes, or if another surgery is needed to control bleeding. The studies did not report on important unwanted effects like death from bleeding.\n- The evidence is uncertain because of weaknesses in how the studies were done. Future research is needed to provide more reliable results and to better understand the potential unwanted effects and costs of using sealants.\n\nHow can bleeding be stopped during surgery on blood vessels?\nDuring surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery), surgeons often need to connect arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts. This connection is called an 'anastomosis'. These connection points can bleed from the small holes made by the surgical needles. Stopping bleeding is called 'hemostasis'. When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough to stop the bleeding, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants' directly to the area. Although several types of sealants are available, it is not clear how effective they are for patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using sealants to help stop bleeding at the site of an anastomosis in people having vascular surgery.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with other ways to stop bleeding in people having vascular surgery. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2376 people undergoing vascular surgery. The studies compared using sealants to standard methods for stopping bleeding, such as applying pressure or using special sponges. Researchers followed people for up to 30 days after their surgery. We did not find any studies that reported on death from bleeding or quality of life. The studies did not report where they took place or how they were funded.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nSealants may help stop bleeding faster at the connection sites of blood vessels. Sealants may also reduce the chance that the first attempt to stop the bleeding fails, but the evidence for this is very uncertain.\nSealants may make little to no difference to:\n– the amount of blood lost during surgery\n– the length of the surgery\n– bleeding after the operation\n– the need for another operation to manage bleeding.\nWe did not find any studies that looked at death from bleeding or people's quality of life.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. First, people in the studies and the researchers knew which treatment was being used. This knowledge could have influenced the results. Second, the studies included people having different types of surgery, which makes it hard to compare the results. Third, some results are based on a small number of people, which makes them less certain. Finally, we think that studies showing a benefit were more likely to be published, which could make sealants seem more effective than they really are.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

To make the summary even more accessible for patients, I recommend focusing on three areas: simplifying key sentences, using more direct language, and clarifying the study limitations.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the opening key message for easier reading.** The first key message is long and contains multiple ideas. Breaking it into shorter sentences will improve clarity.\n    *   **Current text:** 'For people having surgery on their blood vessels, using sealants (a type of surgical glue) to stop bleeding where vessels are joined may help stop the bleeding faster and may reduce the chance that the first attempt to stop the bleeding fails.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'For people having blood vessel surgery, using sealants (a type of surgical glue) where vessels are joined may stop bleeding faster. It may also mean the first try to stop the bleeding is more likely to work.'\n\n2. **Use more direct and active language.** Some phrases are a bit wordy or rely on nouns instead of verbs, which can make them less engaging.\n    *   **Current text:** 'The studies did not report on important unwanted effects like death from bleeding.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'The studies did not report if sealants caused any serious problems, such as death from bleeding.'\n\n3. **Clarify the explanation of study limitations.** The explanation for publication bias is good but uses slightly academic phrasing. A simpler version would be easier for all readers to understand.\n    *   **Current text:** 'Finally, we think that studies showing a benefit were more likely to be published, which could make sealants seem more effective than they really are.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Finally, it's possible that studies with positive results for sealants were more likely to be published. This could make the benefits of sealants seem larger than they actually are.'\n\nThese changes will help address the high number of long words, complex words, and nouns identified in the linguistic analysis, making an already good summary even better.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable in many ways, with 72% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns in four key areas: a high number of passive voice constructions (P90), a high density of nouns (P90), and a high count of long words (P90) and complex words from the Dale-Chall list (P90). These metrics suggest the text could be improved by using more active verbs and simpler, more common vocabulary."
