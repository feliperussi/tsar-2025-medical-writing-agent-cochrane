  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding where blood vessels are joined together (anastomosis) during surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having blood vessel surgery, using sealants (a type of surgical glue) where vessels are joined may stop bleeding faster. It may also mean the first try to stop the bleeding is more likely to work.\n- However, it is not clear if using sealants changes how much blood is lost, how long the operation takes, or if another surgery is needed to control bleeding. The studies did not report if sealants caused any serious problems, such as death from bleeding.\n- The evidence is uncertain because of weaknesses in how the studies were done. Future research is needed to provide more reliable results and to better understand the potential unwanted effects and costs of using sealants.\n\nHow can bleeding be stopped during surgery on blood vessels?\nDuring surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery), surgeons often need to connect arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts. This connection is called an 'anastomosis'. These connection points can bleed from the small holes made by the surgical needles. Stopping bleeding is called 'hemostasis'. When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough to stop the bleeding, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants' directly to the area. Although several types of sealants are available, it is not clear how effective they are for patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using sealants to help stop bleeding at the site of an anastomosis in people having vascular surgery.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with other ways to stop bleeding in people having vascular surgery. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2376 people undergoing vascular surgery. The studies compared using sealants to standard methods for stopping bleeding, such as applying pressure or using special sponges. Researchers followed people for up to 30 days after their surgery. We did not find any studies that reported on death from bleeding or quality of life. The studies did not report where they took place or how they were funded.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nSealants may help stop bleeding faster at the connection sites of blood vessels. Sealants may also reduce the chance that the first attempt to stop the bleeding fails, but the evidence for this is very uncertain.\nSealants may make little to no difference to:\n– the amount of blood lost during surgery\n– the length of the surgery\n– bleeding after the operation\n– the need for another operation to manage bleeding.\nWe did not find any studies that looked at death from bleeding or people's quality of life.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. First, people in the studies and the researchers knew which treatment was being used. This knowledge could have influenced the results. Second, the studies included people having different types of surgery, which makes it hard to compare the results. Third, some results came from a small number of people, which makes them less certain. Finally, it's possible that studies with positive results for sealants were more likely to be published. This could make the benefits of sealants seem larger than they actually are.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft with excellent readability scores and a clear structure. However, a few key revisions are needed to ensure the messages are completely clear and accurate for patients before approval.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add Missing Uncertainty to a Key Message:** The key messages must accurately reflect the certainty of the evidence. One of your key findings is missing this crucial context.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"It may also mean the first try to stop the bleeding is more likely to work.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This statement omits the fact that the evidence is 'very uncertain', which is a critical piece of information for the reader. This is stated correctly later in the results, but it must also be in the key messages.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"It may also mean the first try to stop the bleeding is more likely to work, **but this evidence is very uncertain.** \"\n\n2. **Simplify Technical Phrasing:** Some phrases, while technically correct, can be replaced with simpler, more common words that are easier for readers to understand.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"...to better understand the potential unwanted effects and costs of using sealants.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Potential unwanted effects\" is a technical term. Using simpler language like \"harms\" or \"side effects\" is more direct and accessible for a lay audience.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...to better understand the **possible harms** and costs of using sealants.\"\n\n3. **Improve the Flow of the Results Section:** One sentence in the 'What did we find?' section interrupts the flow of the main findings about the treatments.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The studies did not report where they took place or how they were funded.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is about the quality of study reporting, not a health outcome for patients. It fits better in the limitations section ('How reliable is this evidence?'), as it helps explain *why* the evidence may be less reliable.\n   - **Suggested action:** Move this sentence from the \"What did we find?\" section to the \"How reliable is this evidence?\" section.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. The sentence structure is excellent (e.g., words_per_sentence is 15.97). However, the analysis also supports the need for vocabulary simplification, as three metrics deviate significantly from typical patterns: 'nouns' (159), 'complex_words_dc' (223), and 'long_words' (176) are all in the P90 range, indicating a higher density of complex vocabulary than is typical for a PLS."
