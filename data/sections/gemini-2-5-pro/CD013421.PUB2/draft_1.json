  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding where blood vessels are joined together (anastomosis) during surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having surgery on their blood vessels, using sealants (a type of surgical glue) to stop bleeding where vessels are joined (anastomosis) may help stop the bleeding faster and may reduce the chance that the initial attempt to stop the bleeding fails. However, it is not clear if using sealants makes a difference to the amount of blood lost, the length of the operation, or the need for another surgery to control bleeding. The studies did not report on important unwanted effects like death from bleeding.\n- The evidence is uncertain because of limitations in how the studies were conducted. Future research is needed to provide more reliable results and to better understand the potential unwanted effects and costs of using sealants.\n\nHow can bleeding be stopped during surgery on blood vessels?\nDuring surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery), surgeons often need to connect arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts. This connection is called an 'anastomosis'. These connection points can bleed from the small holes made by the surgical needles. The process of stopping bleeding is known as 'hemostasis'. When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants' directly to the bleeding area to help stop it. Although several types of sealants are available, it is not clear how effective they are for patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using sealants to help stop bleeding at the site of an anastomosis in people having vascular surgery.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with other methods (like manual compression) to stop bleeding in people having vascular surgery. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2376 people undergoing vascular surgery. The studies compared using fibrin or synthetic sealants to standard care (such as manual compression, oxidized cellulose, and gelatin sponges). People were followed for up to 30 days after their surgery. We did not find any studies that reported on death from bleeding or quality of life. The review did not state where the studies took place or how they were funded.\n\nMain results: sealants for stopping bleeding during vascular surgery\nWhen used to stop bleeding from the connection sites of blood vessels during surgery, sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop the bleeding. It is unclear if using sealants reduces the number of times the first attempt to stop bleeding fails. Sealants may make little to no difference to the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total time the surgery takes, bleeding after the operation, or the need for another operation to manage bleeding. We did not find any studies that looked at death from bleeding or people's quality of life.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. We also have concerns because the studies were done in different types of people, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies that provide results for our review are likely to exaggerate the benefits of the intervention.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft is factually inconsistent and does not follow key style guide rules for structure. Specifically, the 'Main results' section contradicts the 'Key messages' regarding whether sealants reduce the failure rate of stopping bleeding. Additionally, several subheadings ('Methods', 'Main results', 'Limitations of the evidence', 'Currency of the evidence') are not phrased as questions, which is required by the style guide. Finally, some sentences are overly complex and contain technical terms that could be simplified for a lay audience.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Resolve Factual Contradiction:** The summary gives conflicting information about the effect of sealants on the failure to stop bleeding. This must be consistent.\n    *   **Quote 1 (Key Messages):** \"...may reduce the chance that the initial attempt to stop the bleeding fails.\"\n    *   **Quote 2 (Main Results):** \"It is unclear if using sealants reduces the number of times the first attempt to stop bleeding fails.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Revise the sentence in the 'Main results' to align with the 'Key messages' and the source abstract. A better phrasing would be: \"Sealants may reduce the number of times the first attempt to stop bleeding fails, but the evidence for this is very uncertain.\"\n\n2.  **Rephrase All Subheadings as Questions:** Several subheadings do not follow the mandatory question format, which makes the document harder for readers to navigate.\n    *   **Quotes:** \"Methods\", \"Main results: sealants for stopping bleeding during vascular surgery\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\".\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase these to be questions:\n        *   \"Methods\" → \"How did we conduct this review?\"\n        *   \"Main results...\" → \"What were the main results?\"\n        *   \"Limitations of the evidence\" → \"How reliable is this evidence?\"\n        *   \"Currency of the evidence\" → \"How up to date is this evidence?\"\n\n3.  **Simplify Complex Language and Sentences:** The text contains technical terms and long sentences that can be simplified to improve readability.\n    *   **Quote 1:** \"The studies compared using fibrin or synthetic sealants to standard care (such as manual compression, oxidized cellulose, and gelatin sponges).\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Replace the technical examples with a simpler description: \"The studies compared using sealants to standard methods for stopping bleeding, such as applying pressure or using special sponges.\"\n    *   **Quote 2:** \"We also have concerns because the studies were done in different types of people, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies that provide results for our review are likely to exaggerate the benefits of the intervention.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this long sentence into shorter ones: \"We also have concerns for a few reasons. The studies included different types of people, and there were not enough of them to be certain about the results. We also think the included studies may exaggerate the benefits of using sealants.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 67% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis also flags significant deviations in vocabulary complexity. The number of nouns (164), Dale-Chall complex words (223), and long words (184) are all in the P90 range, indicating the vocabulary is more complex and dense than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This supports the editorial recommendation to simplify technical terms and rephrase noun-heavy sentences to improve clarity for a lay audience."
