  "plain_title": "What are the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding where blood vessels are joined together (anastomosis) during surgery?",
  "key_messages": [
    "For people having surgery on their blood vessels, using sealants (a type of surgical glue) to stop bleeding where vessels are joined (anastomosis) may help stop the bleeding faster and may reduce the chance that the initial attempt to stop the bleeding fails. However, it is not clear if using sealants makes a difference to the amount of blood lost, the length of the operation, or the need for another surgery to control bleeding. The studies did not report on important unwanted effects like death from bleeding.",
    "The evidence is uncertain because of limitations in how the studies were conducted. Future research is needed to provide more reliable results and to better understand the potential unwanted effects and costs of using sealants."

      "subheading": "How can bleeding be stopped during surgery on blood vessels?",
      "content": "During surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery), surgeons often need to connect arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts. This connection is called an 'anastomosis'. These connection points can bleed from the small holes made by the surgical needles. The process of stopping bleeding is known as 'hemostasis'. When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants' directly to the bleeding area to help stop it. Although several types of sealants are available, it is not clear how effective they are for patients undergoing vascular surgery."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 24 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2376 people undergoing vascular surgery. The studies compared using fibrin or synthetic sealants to standard care (such as manual compression, oxidized cellulose, and gelatin sponges). People were followed for up to 30 days after their surgery. We did not find any studies that reported on death from bleeding or quality of life. The review did not state where the studies took place or how they were funded."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: sealants for stopping bleeding during vascular surgery",
      "content": "When used to stop bleeding from the connection sites of blood vessels during surgery, sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop the bleeding. It is unclear if using sealants reduces the number of times the first attempt to stop bleeding fails. Sealants may make little to no difference to the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total time the surgery takes, bleeding after the operation, or the need for another operation to manage bleeding. We did not find any studies that looked at death from bleeding or people's quality of life."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. We also have concerns because the studies were done in different types of people, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies that provide results for our review are likely to exaggerate the benefits of the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2023."
