  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding where blood vessels are joined together (anastomosis) during surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having surgery on their blood vessels, using sealants (a type of surgical glue) to stop bleeding where vessels are joined may help stop the bleeding faster. However, it is not clear if using sealants makes the first attempt to stop bleeding more likely to succeed, changes how much blood is lost, how long the operation takes, or if another surgery is needed to control bleeding. The studies did not report on important unwanted effects like death from bleeding.\n- The evidence is uncertain because of weaknesses in how the studies were conducted. Future research is needed to provide more reliable results and to better understand the potential unwanted effects and costs of using sealants.\n\nHow can bleeding be stopped during surgery on blood vessels?\nDuring surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery), surgeons often need to connect arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts. This connection is called an 'anastomosis'. These connection points can bleed from the small holes made by the surgical needles. The process of stopping bleeding is known as 'hemostasis'. When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough to stop the bleeding, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants' directly to the area. Although several types of sealants are available, it is not clear how effective they are for patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using sealants to help stop bleeding at the site of an anastomosis in people having vascular surgery.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with other ways to stop bleeding in people having vascular surgery. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2376 people undergoing vascular surgery. The studies compared using sealants to standard methods for stopping bleeding, such as applying pressure or using special sponges. Researchers followed people for up to 30 days after their surgery. We did not find any studies that reported on death from bleeding or quality of life. The studies did not report where they took place or how they were funded.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nSealants may help stop bleeding faster at the connection sites of blood vessels. However, it is unclear if using sealants makes the first attempt to stop bleeding more likely to succeed.\nSealants may make little to no difference to:\n– how much blood is lost during surgery\n– how long the surgery takes\n– bleeding after the operation\n– the need for another operation to manage bleeding.\nWe did not find any studies that looked at death from bleeding or people's quality of life.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. First, people and researchers in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Second, the studies included people having different types of surgery, which makes the results harder to combine. Third, some findings are based on a small number of people, which makes them less certain. Finally, we think that studies showing a benefit were more likely to be published. This could make sealants seem more effective than they really are.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is not approved due to a critical factual error in the 'Key messages' section that misrepresents a main finding. Additionally, several sections can be made clearer for a lay audience by reducing passive voice and simplifying complex language, issues which are supported by the linguistic analysis.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the Factual Error in Key Messages:** The summary of a key finding is inaccurate.\n   - **Current text:** '...it is not clear if using sealants makes the first attempt to stop bleeding more likely to succeed...'\n   - **Problem:** This incorrectly suggests no effect was found. The source material states there *may be* a benefit, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n   - **Suggested rewrite (to match source):** '...may reduce the chance that the initial attempt to stop the bleeding fails.'\n\n2. **Simplify Language in the Limitations Section:** The explanation of study weaknesses is wordy and uses passive voice.\n   - **Current text:** 'First, people and researchers in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.'\n   - **Problem:** This is indirect. Using a more active voice makes it clearer and easier for readers to understand.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'First, people in the studies and the researchers knew which treatment was being used. This knowledge could have influenced the results.'\n\n3. **Replace Complex and Long Words:** The text uses some unnecessarily formal words, making it harder to read.\n   - **Current text:** 'The evidence is uncertain because of weaknesses in how the studies were conducted.'\n   - **Problem:** 'Conducted' is a formal word that can be simplified. This aligns with the evaluation finding that the draft has a high number of long and complex words.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'The evidence is uncertain because of weaknesses in how the studies were done.'\n\nThe linguistic analysis supports these recommendations, showing a high number of passive voice constructions (19 instances), Dale-Chall complex words (227), and long words (181), all of which deviate from typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 77.8% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis identified three areas for improvement where the text deviates significantly from the norm: passive voice (19 instances, P90), complex words according to the Dale-Chall list (227 words, P90), and long words of 7+ characters (181 words, P90). Addressing these would further improve clarity and align the text with best practices."
