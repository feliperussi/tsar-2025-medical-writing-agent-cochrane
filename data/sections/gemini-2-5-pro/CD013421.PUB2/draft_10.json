  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding where blood vessels are joined together (anastomosis) during surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having surgery on their blood vessels, using sealants (a type of surgical glue) where vessels are joined (anastomosis) may stop bleeding faster and may reduce the number of times the first attempt to stop bleeding fails, though this evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear if using sealants affects the amount of blood lost, the length of the operation, or the need for another surgery. The studies did not report on serious harms, such as death from bleeding.\n- Our confidence in the evidence is low because of how the studies were done. Future research is needed to provide more reliable results and to better understand the possible harms and costs of using sealants.\n\nHow can bleeding be stopped during surgery on blood vessels?\nWhen people have surgery on their blood vessels (vascular surgery), surgeons often need to join blood vessels or attach special tubes (grafts) to redirect blood flow. The place where they are joined is called an anastomosis. These connection points can leak or bleed from the tiny holes made by the surgeon's needle. Usually, bleeding is stopped by applying pressure. When this is not enough, surgeons can use special products called 'sealants', which act like a surgical glue, directly on the bleeding area. There are several types of sealants, but it is not clear how well they work for people having blood vessel surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using sealants to help stop bleeding at the site of an anastomosis in people having vascular surgery.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with other ways to stop bleeding in people having vascular surgery. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2376 people undergoing vascular surgery. The studies compared using sealants to standard methods for stopping bleeding, such as applying pressure or using special sponges. Researchers followed people for up to 30 days after their surgery. We did not find any studies that reported on death from bleeding or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nSealants may help stop bleeding faster at the connection sites of blood vessels. Sealants may also reduce the number of times the first attempt to stop bleeding fails, but the evidence is very uncertain.\nSealants may make little to no difference to:\n– the amount of blood lost during surgery\n– the length of the surgery\n– bleeding after the operation\n– the need for another operation to manage bleeding.\nWe did not find any studies that looked at death from bleeding or people's quality of life.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for several reasons:\n– Participants and researchers in the studies knew which treatment was used, which could have biased the results.\n– The studies included various types of surgery, making the results difficult to compare.\n– Some results were based on only a small number of people, making them less certain.\n– Studies with positive results may have been more likely to be published, potentially exaggerating the benefits of sealants.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and factually accurate. The readability scores are excellent. To make it even better for patients, I have three main suggestions focused on simplifying the language around research concepts and making the text more direct.\n\n1. **Simplify the explanation of study limitations.** The language used to describe bias is still a bit technical for a lay audience.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"Participants and researchers in the studies knew which treatment was used, which could have biased the results.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"biased the results\" is jargon. It's better to explain *how* the results might have been affected.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In these studies, everyone knew who got the sealants and who didn't. This knowledge could have influenced the results, for example, by affecting how researchers measured bleeding.\"\n\n2. **Use more direct, active phrasing.** Some sentences are a bit wordy and rely on noun-heavy constructions.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"Sealants may also reduce the number of times the first attempt to stop bleeding fails, but the evidence is very uncertain.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is indirect and clunky. Using a more direct verb makes the meaning clearer and the sentence easier to read.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Sealants may also be more successful at stopping bleeding on the first try, but the evidence is very uncertain.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the meaning of 'various types of surgery'.** This phrase in the limitations section is vague and doesn't explain why it's a problem.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The studies included various types of surgery, making the results difficult to compare.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Patients may not understand why including different surgeries is a limitation. Adding context makes the point much clearer.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies looked at different kinds of blood vessel surgery. This makes it hard to combine the results confidently, as the sealants might work better for some operations than for others.\"\n\nThese changes will help address the high use of passive voice, nouns, and unfamiliar words identified in the linguistic analysis, making an already good summary even more accessible.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72.2% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and style. However, three metrics deviate significantly from the typical range, suggesting areas for refinement: passive voice count (P90), total noun count (P90), and the number of complex words from the Dale-Chall list (P90). The feedback focuses on addressing these specific areas to further improve clarity for a lay audience."
