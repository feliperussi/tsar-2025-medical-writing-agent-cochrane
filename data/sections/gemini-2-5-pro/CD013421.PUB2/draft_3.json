  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of using sealants to stop bleeding where blood vessels are joined together (anastomosis) during surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having surgery on their blood vessels, using sealants (a type of surgical glue) to stop bleeding where vessels are joined may help stop the bleeding faster and may reduce the chance that the initial attempt to stop the bleeding fails. However, it is not clear if using sealants makes a difference to the amount of blood lost, the length of the operation, or the need for another surgery to control bleeding. The studies did not report on important unwanted effects like death from bleeding.\n- The evidence is uncertain because of limitations in how the studies were conducted. Future research is needed to provide more reliable results and to better understand the potential unwanted effects and costs of using sealants.\n\nHow can bleeding be stopped during surgery on blood vessels?\nDuring surgery on blood vessels (vascular surgery), surgeons often need to connect arteries, veins, or synthetic grafts. This connection is called an 'anastomosis'. These connection points can bleed from the small holes made by the surgical needles. When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough to stop the bleeding, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants' directly to the area to help stop it. Although several types of sealants are available, it is not clear how effective they are for patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of using sealants to help stop bleeding at the site of an anastomosis in people having vascular surgery.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared using sealants with other methods to stop bleeding in people having vascular surgery. We combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 24 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2376 people undergoing vascular surgery. The studies compared using sealants to standard methods for stopping bleeding, such as applying pressure or using special sponges. People were followed for up to 30 days after their surgery. We did not find any studies that reported on death from bleeding or quality of life. The review did not state where the studies took place or how they were funded.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nWhen used to stop bleeding from the connection sites of blood vessels during surgery, sealants may reduce the time it takes to stop the bleeding. Sealants may reduce the number of times the first attempt to stop bleeding fails, but the evidence for this is very uncertain. Sealants may make little to no difference to the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total time the surgery takes, bleeding after the operation, or the need for another operation to manage bleeding. We did not find any studies that looked at death from bleeding or people's quality of life.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. This is because people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting. We also have concerns for a few reasons. The studies included people having different types of blood vessel surgery, which makes the results harder to combine. Also, some findings are based on a small number of participants, which makes them less certain. We also think that studies showing a benefit were more likely to be published. This could make the sealants look better than they actually are.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting. However, it is not approved because several clarity issues need to be addressed to make it more accessible for a lay audience. The main areas for improvement are simplifying complex vocabulary, defining all key technical terms, and rephrasing noun-heavy sentences to be more direct and active. Addressing these points will significantly improve reader understanding.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Simplify Vocabulary and Reduce Noun Density:** The summary uses more complex words and noun-heavy phrases than is typical for a PLS. This can make sentences feel dense and harder to process, even when they are short.\n\n*   **Quote:** \"Sealants may make little to no difference to the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total time the surgery takes, bleeding after the operation, or the need for another operation to manage bleeding.\"\n*   **Problem:** This sentence is packed with noun phrases (\"amount of blood lost,\" \"need for another operation\") that slow the reader down.\n*   **Suggestion:** Rephrase using more direct verbs and consider a list for clarity. For example: \"Sealants may make little to no difference to:\n    - how much blood is lost during surgery\n    - how long the surgery takes\n    - bleeding after the operation\n    - the need for another operation to manage bleeding.\"\n\n**2. Define All Key Technical Terms:** The summary does a good job defining 'anastomosis' but misses another important term that would help readers.\n\n*   **Quote:** \"When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough to stop the bleeding, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants' directly to the area to help stop it.\"\n*   **Problem:** This section explains the concept of stopping bleeding but doesn't introduce the technical term 'hemostasis', which is used in the original review and other medical contexts. Defining it improves reader comprehension.\n*   **Suggestion:** Add the definition, as suggested in the source material: \"The process of stopping bleeding is known as 'hemostasis'. When standard methods like applying pressure are not enough to achieve hemostasis, surgeons can apply products called 'sealants'...\"\n\n**3. Make Key Messages More Direct:** The wording in the key messages could be more active and straightforward.\n\n*   **Quote:** \"...may reduce the chance that the initial attempt to stop the bleeding fails.\"\n*   **Problem:** This phrasing is slightly wordy and uses a negative construction (\"fails\"), which can be harder to understand quickly.\n*   **Suggestion:** Rephrase this in a more active and positive way. For example: \"...may make the first attempt to stop bleeding more likely to succeed.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows a mixed profile. While the draft has excellent readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 8.8) due to its short sentences (17 words on average), it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in its vocabulary. The text falls in the 90th percentile for its high number of nouns (162), Dale-Chall complex words (222), and long words (176). This indicates that while the sentence structure is simple, the word choice is more complex and dense than is ideal for a lay audience, supporting the need for vocabulary simplification."
