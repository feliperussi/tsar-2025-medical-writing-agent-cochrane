  "draft": "Can programs designed to help adults manage their vision loss improve their quality of life?\n\nKey messages\n- Based on the available evidence, which is not very strong, programs designed to help adults manage their vision loss may have little to no effect on their quality of life (a person's overall well-being). These programs also appear to have little to no effect on the risk of unwanted effects.\n- Future research is needed to find better ways to measure quality of life and to see if these programs could help a wider range of people, such as those at different stages of vision loss or people who also have hearing loss.\n\nWhat is visual impairment and how can self-management help?\nVisual impairment is a common health problem that affects more than 2 billion people worldwide, particularly older adults. Losing vision can make daily tasks more difficult and can lead to a decline in a person's physical and mental well-being. Self-management programs are designed to help people with visual impairment by teaching them skills to manage their condition, stay independent in their daily activities, and improve their overall quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if self-management programs improve the quality of life for adults with visual impairment. We compared these programs to either usual care or no specific program (such as being on a waiting list).\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nTo conduct this review, we performed a comprehensive search for studies that compared self-management programs with usual care or no program for adults with visual impairment. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 20 studies with a total of 3151 participants. The studies were conducted across Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America in settings such as hospitals, low-vision clinics, and rehabilitation centers. Participants were older adults, with mean ages ranging from 60 to 84 years, and age-related macular degeneration (an eye disease that can blur central vision) was the main cause of low vision in most studies. The self-management programs we looked at were diverse, but generally aimed to teach people skills to manage their condition and stay independent. We compared them to groups of people who received either usual care, optical aids, other low-vision support, or were on a waiting list. For adults with visual impairment, self-management programs may make little to no difference to their quality of life, both in general and specifically related to their vision. These programs may also make little to no difference to the risk of unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for two main reasons. First, there were not enough studies to be certain about the findings. Second, the programs included in the studies were very different from one another, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about what type of support works best.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. However, it can be made even more direct and easier to read by addressing one consistent style issue: the use of nominalizations (turning verbs into nouns). This makes sentences longer and less active than they could be. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing a 'nominalization' score in the 90th percentile, which is higher than typical for a Plain Language Summary.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make the methods section more direct.** The current phrasing is slightly wordy and uses a passive-sounding structure.\n   - **Current text:** 'To conduct this review, we performed a comprehensive search for studies...'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'We searched for studies...'\n\n2. **Use stronger, more active verbs in the results section.** This makes the description more engaging.\n   - **Current text:** 'The self-management programs we looked at were diverse, but generally aimed to teach people skills to manage their condition and stay independent.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'The self-management programs taught people skills to manage their condition and stay independent.'\n\n3. **Clarify the second limitation for the reader.** The explanation can be simplified to be more impactful.\n   - **Current text:** 'Second, the programs included in the studies were very different from one another, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about what type of support works best.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'Second, the support programs in the studies were very different from each other. This makes it hard to know which parts of the programs might be most helpful.'\n\nBy converting these noun-heavy phrases back to direct verbs, the summary will become even more concise and accessible for readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows excellent overall conformity with typical PLS patterns. An impressive 72% of metrics (13 out of 18) fall within the best quartile for readability and plain language, indicating the text is very easy to understand. However, the 'nominalization' metric is in the 90th percentile (26 instances). This suggests a pattern of using noun forms instead of direct verbs (e.g., 'performed a search' instead of 'we searched'), which can make sentences less direct and slightly more complex than necessary."
