  "key_messages": [
    "Based on the available evidence, which is not very strong, programs designed to help adults manage their vision loss may have little to no effect on their quality of life (a person's overall well-being). These programs also appear to have little to no effect on the risk of unwanted effects.",
    "Future research is needed to find better ways to measure quality of life and to see if these programs could help a wider range of people, such as those at different stages of vision loss or people who also have hearing loss."

      "subheading": "What is visual impairment and how can self-management help?",
      "content": "Visual impairment is a common health problem that affects more than 2 billion people worldwide, particularly older adults. Losing vision can make daily tasks more difficult and can lead to a decline in a person's physical and mental well-being. Self-management programs are designed to help people with visual impairment by teaching them skills to manage their condition, stay independent in their daily activities, and improve their overall quality of life."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if self-management programs improve the quality of life for adults with visual impairment. We compared these programs to either usual care or no specific program (such as being on a waiting list)."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared self-management programs with usual care or no program for adults with visual impairment. We then combined and summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 20 studies with a total of 3151 participants. The studies were conducted across Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America in settings such as hospitals, low-vision clinics, and rehabilitation centers. Participants were older adults, with mean ages ranging from 60 to 84 years, and age-related macular degeneration was the main cause of low vision in most studies. The review examined multifaceted self-management interventions, which were compared against wait lists, usual care, optical aids, or low-vision rehabilitation. For adults with visual impairment, self-management programs may make little to no difference to their quality of life, both in general and specifically related to their vision. These programs may also make little to no difference to the risk of unwanted or harmful effects."
    }

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2024."
