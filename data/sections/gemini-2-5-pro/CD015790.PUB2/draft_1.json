  "draft": "Can programs designed to help adults manage their vision loss improve their quality of life?\n\nKey messages\n- Based on the available evidence, which is not very strong, programs designed to help adults manage their vision loss may have little to no effect on their quality of life (a person's overall well-being). These programs also appear to have little to no effect on the risk of unwanted effects.\n- Future research is needed to find better ways to measure quality of life and to see if these programs could help a wider range of people, such as those at different stages of vision loss or people who also have hearing loss.\n\nWhat is visual impairment and how can self-management help?\nVisual impairment is a common health problem that affects more than 2 billion people worldwide, particularly older adults. Losing vision can make daily tasks more difficult and can lead to a decline in a person's physical and mental well-being. Self-management programs are designed to help people with visual impairment by teaching them skills to manage their condition, stay independent in their daily activities, and improve their overall quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if self-management programs improve the quality of life for adults with visual impairment. We compared these programs to either usual care or no specific program (such as being on a waiting list).\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared self-management programs with usual care or no program for adults with visual impairment. We then combined and summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 20 studies with a total of 3151 participants. The studies were conducted across Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America in settings such as hospitals, low-vision clinics, and rehabilitation centers. Participants were older adults, with mean ages ranging from 60 to 84 years, and age-related macular degeneration was the main cause of low vision in most studies. The review examined multifaceted self-management interventions, which were compared against wait lists, usual care, optical aids, or low-vision rehabilitation. For adults with visual impairment, self-management programs may make little to no difference to their quality of life, both in general and specifically related to their vision. These programs may also make little to no difference to the risk of unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-written. However, it requires a few revisions to fully meet the Cochrane style guide and maximize readability for a lay audience. The main issue is that three subheadings ('Methods', 'Limitations of the evidence', 'Currency of the evidence') must be rephrased as questions. Additionally, a couple of sentences in the results and limitations sections are a bit long and contain clinical phrasing that could be simplified. Addressing these points will make an already good summary even better.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase subheadings as questions:** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to better guide the reader. This is the most important change needed.\n    *   **Problem:** The subheadings \"Methods\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", and \"Currency of the evidence\" are statements, not questions.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please change them to:\n        *   \"How did we conduct the review?\"\n        *   \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n        *   \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n2.  **Simplify the description of the programs:** One sentence in the results section is long and uses clinical terms that may be unfamiliar to readers.\n    *   **Problem:** \"The review examined multifaceted self-management interventions, which were compared against wait lists, usual care, optical aids, or low-vision rehabilitation.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Consider breaking this down and simplifying the language, for example: \"The programs we looked at included multiple types of support. We compared them to groups of people who received either usual care, optical aids, other low-vision support, or were on a waiting list.\"\n\n3.  **Make the limitations section more direct:** The sentence explaining the limitations is a bit abstract and could be clearer.\n    *   **Problem:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Try splitting this into two shorter, more direct sentences: \"We have little confidence in the evidence for two main reasons. First, there were not enough studies to be certain about the findings. Second, the support programs in the studies were all very different from each other.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 72.2% of features fall within the best quartile for readability and style. The readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 11.5) are excellent. The one area for improvement highlighted by the metrics is 'nominalization' (the use of noun forms of verbs), which is in the P90 range. This supports the editorial feedback to rephrase some sentences to be more direct and action-oriented, particularly in the limitations section."
