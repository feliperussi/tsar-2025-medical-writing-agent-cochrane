  "draft": "Can education help people with long-term kidney disease and diabetes manage their health?\n\n- For people with long-term kidney disease and diabetes, education programmes probably help to lower long-term blood sugar levels (measured by a blood test called HbA1c) and may help to lower cholesterol. The effects on other important outcomes, such as death or kidney failure, are uncertain due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- These programmes may also improve people's knowledge about diabetes and their confidence and ability to manage their own health in the short term. However, it is not clear if these improvements are long-lasting.\n- Because the review found only a small number of studies, more research is needed to better understand the long-term effects of education programmes on important health outcomes for people with both kidney disease and diabetes.\n\nWhy are education programmes important for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes?\nPeople who have both chronic kidney disease (a long-term condition where the kidneys don't work as well as they should) and diabetes often have complicated treatment plans to follow. Sticking to these plans, which can include changes to diet, lifestyle, and taking multiple medicines, can be very difficult. Education programmes aim to help by giving people information, advice, and support from healthcare providers to manage their health conditions better.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what the benefits and harms of these education programmes are for adults with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared the effects of education programs with routine care for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included eight studies with a total of 840 adults who have both chronic kidney disease and diabetes. The studies compared educational programmes to routine care. For people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, education programmes probably reduce blood sugar levels and may also reduce cholesterol levels. They may also improve a person's knowledge about their diabetes and their confidence in managing their condition. However, these programmes may make little to no difference to long-term behaviour changes. When education is combined with co-ordinated care from a team of different healthcare professionals, it may also make little or no difference to blood sugar levels, kidney failure, blood pressure, or cholesterol. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of education programmes on the risk of death, serious low blood sugar, or kidney failure.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nThe evidence may be limited by small sample sizes, potential selection bias, lack of longitudinal data, reliance on self-reported measures, and possible confounding variables that were not controlled for in the study design.\n\nDate of the search\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is a good start with clear key messages, but it is NOT_APPROVED because it needs a few important revisions to meet Cochrane Plain Language Summary standards. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Rewrite the 'Limitations' section in plain language.** The current version uses technical jargon that is not suitable for a lay audience.\n    *   **Problematic text:** 'The evidence may be limited by small sample sizes, potential selection bias, lack of longitudinal data, reliance on self-reported measures, and possible confounding variables that were not controlled for in the study design.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Terms like 'selection bias', 'longitudinal data', and 'confounding variables' are unclear to most readers and don't explain the practical impact of these limitations.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. We found only a small number of studies, and they included a small number of people. Also, the way studies selected people to participate could have affected the results, and some findings were based on what people told researchers, which may not always be accurate.'\n\n2. **Format all subheadings as questions.** Several subheadings do not follow the required question format, which helps guide the reader through the text.\n    *   **Problematic subheadings:** 'Methods', 'Limitations of the evidence', 'Date of the search'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help orient the reader.\n    *   **Suggested rewrites:**\n        *   'Methods' -> 'How did we conduct this review?'\n        *   'Limitations of the evidence' -> 'What are the limitations of the evidence?'\n        *   'Date of the search' -> 'How up-to-date is this evidence?'\n\n3. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs.** The text often uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which can make sentences less direct and harder to read.\n    *   **Problematic text:** 'However, these programmes may make little to no difference to long-term behaviour changes.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** 'behaviour changes' is a noun phrase. Using a verb is more direct and active.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'However, these programmes may not change how people behave in the long term.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:** Your linguistic analysis supports the need for these changes. The draft has a high number of 'nominalizations' (27) and 'nouns' (177), both in the 90th percentile for PLS texts. Addressing point #3 will help bring these metrics closer to the typical range and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft conforms well to many PLS patterns, with excellent scores for readability, sentence length, and use of active voice. However, it deviates significantly in two areas: the number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) and the total noun count are much higher than typical, falling in the 90th percentile. This suggests the text could be made more direct and easier to read by using more active verbs."
