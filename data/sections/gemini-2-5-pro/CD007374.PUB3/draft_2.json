  "draft": "Can education help people with long-term kidney disease and diabetes manage their health?\n\n- For people with long-term kidney disease and diabetes, education programmes probably help to lower long-term blood sugar levels (measured by a blood test called HbA1c) and may help to lower cholesterol. The effects on other important outcomes, such as death or kidney failure, are uncertain due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- These programmes may also improve people's knowledge about diabetes and their confidence and ability to manage their own health in the short term. However, we are not sure if these benefits last.\n- Because the review found only a small number of studies, more research is needed to better understand the long-term effects of education programmes on important health outcomes for people with both kidney disease and diabetes.\n\nWhy are education programmes important for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes?\nPeople who have both chronic kidney disease (a long-term condition where the kidneys don't work as well as they should) and diabetes often have complicated treatment plans to follow. It can be very difficult to stick to these plans, which can include changing their diet, lifestyle, and taking multiple medicines. Education programmes aim to help by giving people information, advice, and support from healthcare providers to manage their health conditions better.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out what the benefits and harms of these education programmes are for adults with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared the effects of education programs with routine care for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 8 studies with a total of 840 adults who have both chronic kidney disease and diabetes. The studies compared educational programmes to routine care. For people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, education programmes probably reduce blood sugar levels and may also reduce cholesterol levels. They may also improve a person's knowledge about their diabetes and their confidence in managing their condition. However, these programmes may not change how people behave in the long term. When education is combined with co-ordinated care from a team of different healthcare professionals, it may also make little or no difference to blood sugar levels, kidney failure, blood pressure, or cholesterol. We are very uncertain how education programmes affect the risk of death, serious low blood sugar, or kidney failure.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. We found only a small number of studies, and they included a small number of people. Also, the way studies selected people to participate could have affected the results, and some findings were based on what people told researchers, which may not always be accurate.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

I have three suggestions to make it even more direct and concise for your readers.\n\n**1. Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.**\nSome sentences use noun forms of verbs, which can make them feel a bit formal and less direct. This is a common challenge in scientific writing.\n- **For example:** \"When the education is combined with co-ordinated care... it may also make little or no difference to blood sugar levels...\"\n- **Suggestion:** \"Combining education with co-ordinated care... may not change blood sugar levels...\"\n\n**2. Simplify the description of the evidence limitations.**\nThe explanation of limitations is a bit long and could be broken up to be easier to follow.\n- **For example:** \"Also, the way studies selected people to participate could have affected the results, and some findings were based on what people told researchers, which may not always be accurate.\"\n- **Suggestion:** \"Also, the way studies chose participants could have affected the results. Some findings were also based on what people reported themselves, which is not always accurate.\"\n\n**3. Remove redundant words to improve conciseness.**\nIn some places, we can make sentences shorter without losing meaning, which helps readers get to the point faster.\n- **For example:** \"The review included 8 studies with a total of 840 adults who have both chronic kidney disease and diabetes.\"\n- **Suggestion:** \"The review included 8 studies with 840 adults.\" (The context of the paragraph  makes it clear who the participants are).\n\nThese small changes will help make an already excellent summary even clearer for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 89% of metrics (16/18) falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. The draft has excellent readability scores, short sentences, and good use of active voice. The only significant deviations from typical patterns are in the 'nominalization' (P90) and 'nouns' (P90) metrics, indicating a higher-than-usual number of noun-heavy phrases. This suggests the text could be made more direct by converting some nouns back into their verb forms."
