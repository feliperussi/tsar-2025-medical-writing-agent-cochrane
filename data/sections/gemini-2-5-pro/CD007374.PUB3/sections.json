  "key_messages": [
    "For people with long-term kidney disease and diabetes, education programmes probably help to lower long-term blood sugar levels (measured by a blood test called HbA1c) and may help to lower cholesterol. The effects on other important outcomes, such as death or kidney failure, are uncertain due to a lack of robust evidence.",
    "These programmes may also improve people's knowledge about diabetes and their confidence and ability to manage their own health in the short term. However, it is not clear if these improvements are long-lasting.",
    "Because the review found only a small number of studies, more research is needed to better understand the long-term effects of education programmes on important health outcomes for people with both kidney disease and diabetes."

      "subheading": "Why are education programmes important for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes?",
      "content": "People who have both chronic kidney disease (a long-term condition where the kidneys don't work as well as they should) and diabetes often have complicated treatment plans to follow. Sticking to these plans, which can include changes to diet, lifestyle, and taking multiple medicines, can be very difficult. Education programmes aim to help by giving people information, advice, and support from healthcare providers to manage their health conditions better."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included eight studies with a total of 840 adults who have both chronic kidney disease and diabetes. The studies compared educational programmes to routine care. For people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, education programmes probably reduce blood sugar levels and may also reduce cholesterol levels. They may also improve a person's knowledge about their diabetes and their confidence in managing their condition. However, these programmes may make little to no difference to long-term behaviour changes. When education is combined with co-ordinated care from a team of different healthcare professionals, it may also make little or no difference to blood sugar levels, kidney failure, blood pressure, or cholesterol. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of education programmes on the risk of death, serious low blood sugar, or kidney failure."

  "limitations": "The evidence may be limited by small sample sizes, potential selection bias, lack of longitudinal data, reliance on self-reported measures, and possible confounding variables that were not controlled for in the study design.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to July 2024."
