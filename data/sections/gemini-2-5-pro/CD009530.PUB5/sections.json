    "For children with cystic fibrosis, the available evidence suggests that using a lung scope (bronchoscopy) to guide antibiotic treatment for lung infections likely makes little to no difference to lung function or quality of life compared to standard methods (like throat swabs). This approach may lead to more hospital stays and can cause temporary side effects, such as a worsening cough.",
    "The evidence in this review comes from studies in children, so it is unclear if these findings apply to adults with cystic fibrosis."

      "content": "This review included two studies with a total of 187 infants and children with cystic fibrosis (CF). One study followed infants from under six months until they were five years old, while the other included children aged five to 18 years. The studies compared antimicrobial therapy guided by bronchoscopy (specifically bronchoalveolar lavage or BAL) with standard care, where treatment was based on samples from the throat (oropharyngeal cultures) and clinical symptoms. The review found no studies in adults. For preschool children with cystic fibrosis, using an invasive test called bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment probably makes little to no difference to chest scan scores or to the overall cost of care when compared to standard treatment based on symptoms and throat swabs. This approach may also make little to no difference to lung function, nutritional measures, or how often certain harmful bacteria are found in the airways. However, it may lead to more hospital stays each year. Overall, there is no evidence to support the routine use of bronchoscopy to diagnose and manage lung infections in preschool children with cystic fibrosis."
