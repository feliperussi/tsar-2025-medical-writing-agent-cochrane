  "draft": "For people with cystic fibrosis, is it better to guide antibiotic treatment for lung infections using samples taken with a lung scope (bronchoscopy) compared to standard tests like a throat swab?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For children with cystic fibrosis, the available evidence suggests that using a lung scope (bronchoscopy) to guide antibiotic treatment for lung infections likely makes little to no difference to lung function or quality of life compared to standard methods (like throat swabs). This approach may lead to more hospital stays and can cause temporary side effects, such as a worsening cough.\n- The evidence in this review comes from studies in children, so it is unclear if these findings apply to adults with cystic fibrosis.\n\nINTRODUCTION/AIMS\nHow are lung infections managed in people with cystic fibrosis?\nPeople with cystic fibrosis (CF) are prone to lung infections, and early diagnosis and treatment are essential for managing their lung disease. For people who ... (the rest of the content as provided).\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to evaluate whether using bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment is better for managing lung infections in adults and children with CF compared to standard care (where treatment is guided by throat swabs and clinical symptoms).\n\nMETHODS\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched for studies that compared using antibiotics guided by samples taken during a bronchoscopy (a procedure to look inside the lungs) with antibiotics guided by other methods, like throat swabs.\nData Synthesis\nWe then compared and summarized the results.\nEvidence Assessment\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included two studies with a total of 187 infants and children with cystic fibrosis (CF). One study followed infants from under six months until they were five years old, while the other included children aged five to 18 years. The studies compared antimicrobial therapy guided by bronchoscopy (specifically bronchoalveolar lavage or BAL) with standard care, where treatment was based on samples from the throat (oropharyngeal cultures) and clinical symptoms. The review found no studies in adults. For preschool children with cystic fibrosis, using an invasive test called bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment probably makes little to no difference to chest scan scores or to the overall cost of care when compared to standard treatment based on symptoms and throat swabs. This approach may also make little to no difference to lung function, nutritional measures, or how often certain harmful bacteria are found in the airways. However, it may lead to more hospital stays each year. Overall, there is no evidence to support the routine use of bronchoscopy to diagnose and manage lung infections in preschool children with cystic fibrosis.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies used different ways of delivering the intervention. Additionally, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nCURRENCY\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft, but it needs a few revisions to meet our style guide and improve readability for a lay audience. The main issues are that some subheadings are not phrased as questions, the results section is a single long paragraph that is difficult to read, and the text relies too heavily on noun-heavy phrases instead of direct verbs.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase subheadings as questions:** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. The subheadings in the 'METHODS' section are currently labels.\n    *   **Current text:** \"Search Strategy\", \"Data Synthesis\", \"Evidence Assessment\"\n    *   **Problem:** These are not questions and don't align with the user-friendly format used in the rest of the summary.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"How did we find the studies?\", \"How did we combine the results?\", \"How did we rate the evidence?\"\n\n2.  **Break up the long results paragraph:** The 'What did we find?' section presents all the results in a single, dense paragraph. This \"wall of text\" can be overwhelming for readers.\n    *   **Current text:** \"This review included two studies with a total of 187 infants and children... [to] ...diagnose and manage lung infections in preschool children with cystic fibrosis.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This single paragraph covers the study population, methods, and multiple outcomes (chest scans, cost, lung function, hospital stays), making it difficult to digest the key findings.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Break this into at least two smaller paragraphs. For example:\n        *   **Paragraph 1 (Study details):** \"This review included two studies with a total of 187 infants and children with cystic fibrosis (CF). One study followed infants from under six months until they were five years old, while the other included children aged 5 to 18 years. The studies compared treatment guided by bronchoscopy... with standard care... The review found no studies in adults.\"\n        *   **Paragraph 2 (Key findings):** \"For preschool children with CF, using bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic treatment probably makes little to no difference to chest scan scores, the cost of care, lung function, or nutritional measures. However, it may lead to more hospital stays each year. Overall, we found no evidence to support the routine use of bronchoscopy to manage lung infections in preschool children with CF.\"\n\n3.  **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases (nominalizations):** The text often uses complex noun phrases where a simple verb would be clearer and more direct. This makes sentences feel more abstract and academic.\n    *   **Current text:** \"The studies compared **antimicrobial therapy guided by bronchoscopy**...\"\n    *   **Problem:** This is a noun-heavy, passive construction. Using a verb makes the sentence more active and easier to understand.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies compared **guiding antibiotic treatment with bronchoscopy**...\"\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary much clearer and more accessible for your readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft HIGHLY CONFORMS TO TYPICAL PLS PATTERNS, with most metrics (61.1%) falling within the best quartile for readability and style. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: 'nominalization' (the use of noun-form verbs) is in the P90 range. The draft has 25 instances, which is much higher than the typical median of under 13. This metric supports the editorial feedback to replace abstract noun phrases with more direct verbs to improve clarity."
