  "key_messages": [
    "For people with a long-lasting middle ear infection with discharge (chronic suppurative otitis media), antibiotic ear drops seem to be better at stopping the discharge within two weeks compared to one type of antiseptic ear drop (boric acid). We are uncertain about how antibiotics compare with other types of antiseptic ear drops because of a lack of good evidence.",
    "The studies did not provide clear information about the unwanted or harmful effects of the different treatments.",
    "More high-quality research is needed to better understand the benefits and potential harms of using antibiotic versus antiseptic ear drops for this condition, especially over the long term."

      "subheading": "What is a long-term ear infection with discharge?",
      "content": "Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long-term infection and inflammation of the middle ear. It occurs when a hole in the eardrum (perforated tympanic membrane) allows bacteria to enter. The main symptoms are persistent discharge (pus) from the ear and hearing loss. Treatments for CSOM include antibiotics and antiseptics, which are used to kill the micro-organisms causing the infection. These can be applied directly into the ear as drops or powders (topical treatment). Antibiotics can also be taken by mouth or by injection (systemic treatment)."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review included 15 studies with a total of 2371 adults and children who had chronic suppurative otitis media. The studies had a minimum follow-up period of one week. The studies compared various topical or systemic antibiotics (such as quinolones and aminoglycosides) against topical antiseptics (including acetic acid, boric acid, povidone-iodine, and aluminium acetate). The abstract did not mention the countries where the studies were conducted or their funding sources. No included studies reported on health-related quality of life."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: topical antibiotics versus topical antiseptics for chronic ear discharge",
      "content": "When treating chronic ear discharge, topical antibiotics (quinolones) probably stop the discharge within two weeks more effectively than boric acid ear drops. For every four people treated with these topical antibiotics instead of boric acid, one additional person will have their ear discharge resolved. Topical quinolones may also cause less ear pain, discomfort, or irritation compared with boric acid, and may make little to no difference to hearing.\n\nWhen comparing a different topical antiseptic (acetic acid) to another type of topical antibiotic (aminoglycosides), the antiseptic may be better at stopping ear discharge.\n\nFor other comparisons of antibiotics and antiseptics, we do not know if they affect ear discharge or side effects like ear pain because the results were very uncertain. None of the studies provided information on quality of life or serious complications from the treatments."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the evidence does not cover all of the people or treatments we were interested in, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search."
