  "draft": "Are antibiotics better than antiseptic ear drops for treating a long-lasting middle ear infection with discharge (chronic suppurative otitis media)?\n\nKey messages\nFor people with a long-lasting middle ear infection with discharge (chronic suppurative otitis media), antibiotic ear drops are probably better at stopping the discharge within 2 weeks compared to one type of antiseptic ear drop (boric acid). We are uncertain about how antibiotics compare with other types of antiseptic ear drops because of a lack of good evidence.\nThe studies did not provide clear information about the unwanted or harmful effects of the different treatments.\nMore high-quality research is needed to better understand the benefits and potential harms of using antibiotic versus antiseptic ear drops for this condition, especially over the long term.\n\nWhat is a long-term ear infection with discharge?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is when the middle ear is infected and inflamed for a long time. It occurs when a hole in the eardrum allows bacteria to enter. The main symptoms are pus that keeps draining from the ear and a loss of hearing. Treatments for CSOM include antibiotics and antiseptics, which are used to kill the germs that cause the infection. These can be put directly into the ear as drops or powders. Antibiotics can also be taken by mouth or by injection.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and harms of using antibiotics versus antiseptics to treat people with CSOM.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared antibiotics against antiseptics for people with long-term ear discharge. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 15 studies with a total of 2371 adults and children who had chronic suppurative otitis media. The studies had a minimum follow-up period of 1 week. The studies compared different types of antibiotics against several kinds of antiseptics. We do not have information about where the studies were conducted or how they were funded. No included studies reported on health-related quality of life.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nAntibiotic ear drops (quinolones) probably stop the discharge within 2 weeks more effectively than boric acid ear drops. For every 4 people treated with these antibiotic ear drops instead of boric acid, 1 additional person will have their ear discharge resolved. These antibiotic ear drops may also cause less ear pain, discomfort, or irritation compared with boric acid, and may make little to no difference to hearing.\nWhen comparing a different antiseptic ear drop (acetic acid) to another type of antibiotic ear drop (aminoglycosides), the antiseptic may be better at stopping ear discharge.\nFor other comparisons of antibiotics and antiseptics, we do not know if they affect ear discharge or side effects like ear pain because the results were very uncertain. None of the studies provided information on quality of life or serious complications from the treatments.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. Not all studies provided data on the outcomes we were interested in. The evidence also does not cover all the different types of people or treatments. Finally, there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2022.",

The text is highly readable, with excellent scores for sentence length and readability indices like Flesch-Kincaid (Grade 9.36). Two metrics, 'nouns' and 'complex_words', are in the P90 range, suggesting the vocabulary is slightly denser and more complex than is typical. However, this does not significantly impact overall clarity in this case."
