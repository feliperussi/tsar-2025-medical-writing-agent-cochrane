  "draft": "Are antibiotics better than antiseptic ear drops for treating a long-lasting middle ear infection with discharge (chronic suppurative otitis media)?\n\nKey messages\nFor people with a long-lasting middle ear infection with discharge (chronic suppurative otitis media), antibiotic ear drops seem to be better at stopping the discharge within two weeks compared to one type of antiseptic ear drop (boric acid). We are uncertain about how antibiotics compare with other types of antiseptic ear drops because of a lack of good evidence.\nThe studies did not provide clear information about the unwanted or harmful effects of the different treatments.\nMore high-quality research is needed to better understand the benefits and potential harms of using antibiotic versus antiseptic ear drops for this condition, especially over the long term.\n\nWhat is a long-term ear infection with discharge?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long-term infection and inflammation of the middle ear. It occurs when a hole in the eardrum (perforated tympanic membrane) allows bacteria to enter. The main symptoms are persistent discharge (pus) from the ear and hearing loss. Treatments for CSOM include antibiotics and antiseptics, which are used to kill the micro-organisms causing the infection. These can be applied directly into the ear as drops or powders (topical treatment). Antibiotics can also be taken by mouth or by injection (systemic treatment).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and harms of using antibiotics versus antiseptics to treat people with CSOM.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared antibiotics against antiseptics for people with long-term ear discharge. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 15 studies with a total of 2371 adults and children who had chronic suppurative otitis media. The studies had a minimum follow-up period of one week. The studies compared various topical or systemic antibiotics (such as quinolones and aminoglycosides) against topical antiseptics (including acetic acid, boric acid, povidone-iodine, and aluminium acetate). The abstract did not mention the countries where the studies were conducted or their funding sources. No included studies reported on health-related quality of life.\n\nMain results: topical antibiotics versus topical antiseptics for chronic ear discharge\nWhen treating chronic ear discharge, topical antibiotics (quinolones) probably stop the discharge within two weeks more effectively than boric acid ear drops. For every four people treated with these topical antibiotics instead of boric acid, one additional person will have their ear discharge resolved. Topical quinolones may also cause less ear pain, discomfort, or irritation compared with boric acid, and may make little to no difference to hearing.\nWhen comparing a different topical antiseptic (acetic acid) to another type of topical antibiotic (aminoglycosides), the antiseptic may be better at stopping ear discharge.\nFor other comparisons of antibiotics and antiseptics, we do not know if they affect ear discharge or side effects like ear pain because the results were very uncertain. None of the studies provided information on quality of life or serious complications from the treatments.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the evidence does not cover all of the people or treatments we were interested in, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. Two subheadings do not follow the required question format, and the text uses complex vocabulary and sentence structures that make it difficult to understand. The following 3 improvements will have the biggest impact.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Rephrase Subheadings as Questions**\n\nTwo subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is required by the style guide to help readers scan the text for answers.\n\n- **Quote 1:** \"Methods\"\n- **Suggestion:** Change this to a question, such as \"What did we do in this review?\"\n\n- **Quote 2:** \"Main results: topical antibiotics versus topical antiseptics for chronic ear discharge\"\n- **Suggestion:** Simplify this to a question, such as \"What were the main results?\"\n\n**2. Simplify Complex Medical Terms and Reduce Jargon**\n\nThe summary contains many technical terms and long words that will be unfamiliar to most readers. This makes the text dense and hard to follow.\n\n- **Quote:** \"It occurs when a hole in the eardrum (perforated tympanic membrane) allows bacteria to enter.\"\n- **Problem:** The plain language term is clear on its own. Adding the technical term in parentheses adds unnecessary complexity.\n- **Suggestion:** Remove the technical term: \"It occurs when a hole in the eardrum allows bacteria to enter.\"\n\n- **Quote:** \"The studies compared various topical or systemic antibiotics (such as quinolones and aminoglycosides) against topical antiseptics (including acetic acid, boric acid, povidone-iodine, and aluminium acetate).\"\n- **Problem:** This long list of specific drug and chemical names is overwhelming and not necessary for understanding the main point of the methods.\n- **Suggestion:** Generalize the description and introduce specific names only when discussing the results. For example: \"The studies compared different types of antibiotics against several kinds of antiseptics.\"\n\n**3. Use More Verbs and Fewer Nouns (Reduce Nominalization)**\n\nMany sentences are built around noun forms of verbs (e.g., 'infection' instead of 'infects'), which makes the writing less direct and more abstract.\n\n- **Quote:** \"Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long-term infection and inflammation of the middle ear.\"\n- **Problem:** The nouns 'infection' and 'inflammation' make the sentence feel static and academic.\n- **Suggestion:** Rewrite using verbs to be more active: \"Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is when the middle ear is infected and inflamed for a long time.\"\n\n- **Quote:** \"The main symptoms are persistent discharge (pus) from the ear and hearing loss.\"\n- **Problem:** 'Discharge' and 'loss' are nouns that hide the action.\n- **Suggestion:** Rephrase with more active language: \"The main symptoms are pus that keeps draining from the ear and a loss of hearing.\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis\n\nYour own editorial instincts about the text's complexity are confirmed by the linguistic analysis. The draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary, with high scores for:\n- **Nominalization** (24 instances vs. a median of 13)\n- **Complex Words** (140 vs. a median of 84)\n- **Long Words** (198 vs. a median of 122)\n\nAddressing the suggestions above will help bring these metrics closer to the typical range for a Plain Language Summary and, more importantly, make the text much easier for patients to read and understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While sentence-level metrics like 'words_per_sentence' (18.61) and 'active_voice' (52) are strong, falling into the best quartile, there is a significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics, including 'nominalization' (P90), 'complex_words' (P90), 'long_words' (P90), and 'smog_index' (P90), are in the highest 10% of the corpus, indicating the language is more technical and dense than is typical for a PLS. The feedback focuses on simplifying this vocabulary to improve overall readability."
