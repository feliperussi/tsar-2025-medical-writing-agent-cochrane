  "draft": "After a kidney transplant, is it better to remove the urinary catheter (tube to drain urine) early or to leave it in longer?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether removing a urinary catheter (a tube to drain urine) early (before 5 days) or late (at 5 days or after) following a kidney transplant makes any difference to the risk of developing bacteria in the urine. Information on other unwanted effects, such as urinary tract infections or major problems with the urinary system, was lacking.\n- Because the available studies were small and of poor quality, a larger, well-designed study is needed to provide clear guidance on the best time to remove a urinary catheter after a kidney transplant.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhy is the timing of urinary catheter removal important after a kidney transplant?\nFor people with severe kidney disease, a kidney transplant is the best treatment. During the transplant operation, a tube called a catheter is placed into the bladder to drain urine. This helps the join between the new kidney and the bladder to heal. However, having a catheter can also allow bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary tract infection (UTI). The longer the catheter stays in, the greater the risk of infection. Doctors are not sure about the best time to remove the catheter to balance the risk of infection against the risk of other problems.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if it is better to remove the catheter early (in under 5 days) or late (at 5 days or later) after a kidney transplant. We compared these two approaches to see which led to fewer urinary tract infections (both with and without symptoms) and other serious urinary system problems that required treatment.\n\nMethods\nSearch Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, and trial registries for studies that compared early urinary catheter removal (before 5 days) with late removal (5 days or more) in kidney transplant recipients. No language or date restrictions were applied.\nEligibility Criteria\nRandomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies enrolling adult kidney transplant recipients and reporting outcomes related to catheter removal timing were eligible. Studies that did not separate early (<5 days) from late (≥5 days) removal or that involved in other organ transplants were excluded.\nData Extraction and Synthesis\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, participant demographics, catheter removal timing, and clinical outcomes (e.g., urinary tract infection, graft function). Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. A random‑effects meta‑analysis was used to pool risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes.\nRisk of Bias Assessment\nRisk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for randomized trials and the ROBINS‑I tool for non‑randomized studies. Domains evaluated included randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of outcomes, and selective reporting.\nConfidence in the Evidence\nThe certainty of the pooled estimates was graded with the GRADE approach, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Overall confidence was rated as low to moderate due to limited trial numbers and heterogeneity.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included two studies with a total of 197 patients who had received a kidney transplant. The studies compared removing the urinary catheter early (before five days) with removing it later (at or after five days). The follow-up period in these studies was short, with no patients being followed for more than one month. Based on the available evidence, it is unclear if removing a urinary catheter early compared to later after a kidney transplant has any effect on the risk of developing bacteria in the urine without symptoms. The review found no information on the effects of catheter removal timing on urinary tract infections with symptoms or on major complications.\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. There are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. There are two critical issues that must be addressed. First, the entire 'Methods' section is written for a technical audience and is not suitable for a Plain Language Summary; it must be completely rewritten in simple, accessible language. Second, the subheadings in the 'Methods' section, and the missing subheadings for 'Limitations' and 'Currency', do not follow the mandatory question-based format outlined in the style guide. These issues make a significant portion of the summary incomprehensible to the target audience. I have provided specific suggestions for rewriting the methods section and reformatting the subheadings.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rewrite the entire 'Methods' section in plain language.** The current version is filled with technical jargon that is meaningless to patients.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"A random‑effects meta‑analysis was used to pool risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. ... Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for randomized trials and the ROBINS‑I tool for non‑randomized studies.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This language is for researchers. Patients do not understand terms like 'meta-analysis', 'risk ratios', 'dichotomous outcomes', or 'ROBINS-I tool'. The purpose of a PLS is to translate these concepts into understandable language.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Replace the entire 'Methods' section with something like this:\n        \"**How did we find and assess the evidence?**\n        We searched medical databases for clinical trials that compared removing urinary catheters early (before 5 days) with removing them late (at or after 5 days) in people who had received a kidney transplant. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size.\"\n\n2.  **Reformat all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires subheadings to be questions to guide the reader. The 'Methods' section subheadings are not questions, and the 'Limitations' and 'Currency' sections are missing subheadings entirely.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"Search Strategy\", \"Eligibility Criteria\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This violates a key structural rule of the style guide and makes the document harder for readers to scan and understand.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:**\n        *   Replace the five 'Methods' subheadings with a single, question-based subheading as shown in the point above.\n        *   Add a subheading to the 'Limitations' section: \"**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\"\n        *   Add a subheading to the 'Currency' section: \"**How up-to-date is this evidence?**\"\n\n3.  **Simplify complex vocabulary and sentence structure.** The text has a high number of complex, long, and noun-form words, which makes it difficult to read. This is confirmed by the linguistic analysis.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"The certainty of the pooled estimates was graded with the GRADE approach, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is a long list of abstract nouns and technical terms. It is dense and difficult for a lay reader to process.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** This would be covered by the full rewrite of the 'Methods' section. A simpler way to express this idea is: \"We assessed how confident we could be in the results.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, but there are significant deviations in key areas of complexity. Five metrics fall 'Beyond P90', indicating the text is much more complex than a typical PLS. Specifically, the scores for SMOG Index (15.33), complex words (148), Dale-Chall complex words (296), and long words (222) are exceptionally high. This confirms that the vocabulary is too technical for a lay audience. Additionally, the high number of nouns (210) and nominalizations (26) supports the editorial finding that sentences are dense and lack a clear, active style."
