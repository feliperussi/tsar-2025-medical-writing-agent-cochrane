  "plain_title": "After a kidney transplant, is it better to remove the urinary catheter (tube to drain urine) early or to leave it in longer?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, it is uncertain whether removing a urinary catheter (a tube to drain urine) early (before 5 days) or late (at 5 days or after) following a kidney transplant makes any difference to the risk of developing bacteria in the urine. Information on other unwanted effects, such as urinary tract infections or major problems with the urinary system, was lacking.",
    "Because the available studies were small and of poor quality, a larger, well-designed study is needed to provide clear guidance on the best time to remove a urinary catheter after a kidney transplant."

      "subheading": "Why is the timing of urinary catheter removal important after a kidney transplant?",
      "content": "For people with severe kidney disease, a kidney transplant is the best treatment. During the transplant operation, a tube called a catheter is placed into the bladder to drain urine. This helps the join between the new kidney and the bladder to heal. However, having a catheter can also allow bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary tract infection (UTI). The longer the catheter stays in, the greater the risk of infection. Doctors are not sure about the best time to remove the catheter to balance the risk of infection against the risk of other problems."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if it is better to remove the catheter early (in under 5 days) or late (at 5 days or later) after a kidney transplant. We compared these two approaches to see which led to fewer urinary tract infections (both with and without symptoms) and other serious urinary system problems that required treatment."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, and trial registries for studies that compared early urinary catheter removal (before 5 days) with late removal (5 days or more) in kidney transplant recipients. No language or date restrictions were applied."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Eligibility Criteria",
      "content": "Randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies enrolling adult kidney transplant recipients and reporting outcomes related to catheter removal timing were eligible. Studies that did not separate early (<5 days) from late (≥5 days) removal or that involved in other organ transplants were excluded."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, participant demographics, catheter removal timing, and clinical outcomes (e.g., urinary tract infection, graft function). Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. A random‑effects meta‑analysis was used to pool risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Risk of Bias Assessment",
      "content": "Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for randomized trials and the ROBINS‑I tool for non‑randomized studies. Domains evaluated included randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of outcomes, and selective reporting."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Confidence in the Evidence",
      "content": "The certainty of the pooled estimates was graded with the GRADE approach, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Overall confidence was rated as low to moderate due to limited trial numbers and heterogeneity."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included two studies with a total of 197 patients who had received a kidney transplant. The studies compared removing the urinary catheter early (before five days) with removing it later (at or after five days). The follow-up period in these studies was short, with no patients being followed for more than one month. Based on the available evidence, it is unclear if removing a urinary catheter early compared to later after a kidney transplant has any effect on the risk of developing bacteria in the urine without symptoms. The review found no information on the effects of catheter removal timing on urinary tract infections with symptoms or on major complications."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. There are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search."
