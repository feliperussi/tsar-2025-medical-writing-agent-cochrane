  "draft": "After a kidney transplant, is it better to remove the urinary catheter (tube to drain urine) early or to leave it in longer?\n\nKey messages\n- We are uncertain if removing a urinary catheter early (before 5 days) or late (at 5 days or after) affects the risk of bacteria in the urine after a kidney transplant. This is because of a lack of good-quality evidence. Information on other unwanted effects, such as urinary tract infections or major problems with the urinary system, was lacking.\n- Because the available studies were small and of poor quality, a larger, well-designed study is needed to provide clear guidance on the best time to remove a urinary catheter after a kidney transplant.\n\nWhy is the timing of urinary catheter removal important after a kidney transplant?\nFor people with severe kidney disease, a kidney transplant is the best treatment. During the transplant operation, surgeons place a tube called a catheter into the bladder to drain urine. This helps the join between the new kidney and the bladder to heal. However, having a catheter can also allow bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary tract infection (UTI). The longer the catheter stays in, the greater the risk of infection. Doctors are not sure about the best time to remove the catheter to balance the risk of infection against the risk of other problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if it is better to remove the catheter early (in under 5 days) or late (at 5 days or later) after a kidney transplant. We compared these two approaches to see which led to fewer urinary tract infections (both with and without symptoms) and other serious urinary system problems that required treatment.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?\nWe searched medical databases for clinical trials that compared removing urinary catheters early (before 5 days) with removing them late (at or after 5 days) in people who had received a kidney transplant. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 2 studies with a total of 197 patients who had received a kidney transplant. The studies compared removing the urinary catheter early (before 5 days) with removing it later (at or after 5 days). The follow-up period in these studies was short, with no patients being followed for more than 1 month. The evidence does not show whether removing a catheter early versus late has any effect on the risk of developing bacteria in the urine (without symptoms). The review found no information on the effects of catheter removal timing on urinary tract infections with symptoms or on major complications.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. There are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",

There are no metrics showing significant deviation from typical patterns."
