  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of non-immune-suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease), medicines that lower blood pressure appear to be the most helpful treatment that does not suppress the immune system. They can reduce the amount of protein in the urine. The review found little information on unwanted effects or long-term effects like preventing kidney failure.\n- In studies of Japanese people, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may help reduce protein and blood in the urine. It is not clear if this finding applies to people of other ethnicities.\n- The studies in this review were generally small and did not last long enough to properly assess the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments on important outcomes like kidney failure.\n\nWhat is this review about?\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common kidney disease. Over many years, it can cause the kidneys to stop working properly, which leads to kidney failure in some people. A key sign of kidney damage in IgAN is when protein leaks from the blood into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Treatments that do not suppress the body's immune system are often used to help manage the disease. These treatments aim to control blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine, without the risks of long-term immune-suppressing medicines.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of different non-immunosuppressive treatments for adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We looked at a wide range of treatments, including medicines to lower blood pressure, blood thinners, fish oil, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy), and herbal medicines.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at the effects of non-immunosuppressive treatments in adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 80 studies with a total of 4856 adults and children whose IgA nephropathy was confirmed by a biopsy. The studies compared different non-immunosuppressive treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or standard care.\n\nFor people with IgA nephropathy, medicines that lower blood pressure (specifically RAS inhibitors) probably reduce the amount of protein in the urine. They also probably improve measures of kidney function when compared to a dummy treatment or treating only the symptoms. However, these medicines may make little to no difference to the risk of kidney failure. There may be little to no difference in the risk of unwanted effects when taking these medicines.\n\nFor people of Japanese ethnicity, having a tonsillectomy along with standard care may help. It may increase the chances that protein and blood disappear from the urine. It may also reduce the chances that they come back. It is not clear if these findings apply to people of other ethnicities.\n\nAntimalarial therapy may greatly reduce protein in the urine, but it is unclear if this treatment causes unwanted effects. Other treatments like blood thinners, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines may offer small benefits for kidney function compared to a dummy treatment. However, these benefits may disappear when compared to standard care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. First, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results. Second, many studies were very small and did not provide data on all the outcomes we were interested in. Finally, some evidence was only for specific groups of people, but we wanted to answer a broader question.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023.",

However, it is not approved because there are several opportunities to improve clarity for a patient audience by simplifying sentence structure and vocabulary. The main issues are the frequent use of noun-heavy phrases instead of direct verbs (a high nominalization count), a high density of complex and long words, and a 'Limitations' section that could be clearer. Addressing these points will make the summary more direct and easier to understand. The specific suggestions below will help you revise the text to better meet plain language standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, four metrics deviate significantly from the typical range (P90), indicating areas for improvement: nominalization (22.0), total nouns (191.0), Dale-Chall complex words (240.0), and long words (176.0). This pattern suggests the text relies heavily on complex nouns and technical terms, which can reduce clarity even when sentence length is well-controlled."
