  "draft": "Benefits and risks of non-immune-suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy\n\nKey messages\n- For people with IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease), medicines that lower blood pressure appear to be the most helpful treatment that does not suppress the immune system. They can reduce the amount of protein in the urine. The review found little information on unwanted effects or long-term effects, like preventing kidney failure.\n- In studies of Japanese people, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may help reduce protein and blood in the urine. It is not clear if this finding applies to people of other ethnicities.\n- The studies in this review were generally small and too short to show the long-term effects of these treatments on serious problems like kidney failure.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common kidney disease. Over many years, it can cause the kidneys to stop working properly, which leads to kidney failure in some people. A key sign of kidney damage in IgAN is when protein leaks from the blood into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Treatments that do not suppress the body's immune system are often used to help manage the disease. These treatments aim to control blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine, without the risks that come with long-term immune-suppressing medicines.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of different non-immunosuppressive treatments for adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We looked at a wide range of treatments, including medicines to lower blood pressure, blood thinners, fish oil, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy), and herbal medicines.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at the effects of non-immunosuppressive treatments in adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 80 studies with a total of 4856 adults and children who had a biopsy to confirm they had IgA nephropathy. The studies compared different treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or standard care.\n\nMedicines that lower blood pressure (specifically RAS inhibitors) probably reduce the amount of protein in the urine for people with IgA nephropathy. They also probably help the kidneys work better when compared to a dummy treatment or treating only the symptoms. However, these medicines may make little to no difference to the risk of kidney failure. There may be little to no difference in the risk of unwanted effects when taking these medicines.\n\nFor people of Japanese ethnicity, having a tonsillectomy in addition to standard care may help. It may increase the chances that protein and blood disappear from the urine and reduce the chances that they come back. It is not clear if these findings apply to people of other ethnicities.\n\nAntimalarial therapy may greatly reduce protein in the urine, but it is unclear if this treatment causes unwanted effects. Other treatments like blood thinners, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines may slightly help the kidneys work better compared to a dummy treatment. However, these benefits may not be seen when compared to standard care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons:\n- In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\n- Many studies were very small, and there were not enough studies overall for us to be certain about the results.\n- The studies did not always report on important long-term effects, such as kidney failure.\n- Some findings were only from specific groups of people, so the results may not apply to everyone with IgA nephropathy.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023.",

However, it is not approved because it fails one critical check: the main title is not phrased as a question, which is a requirement of the style guide. Additionally, there are opportunities to improve clarity for patients by simplifying some complex vocabulary and rephrasing noun-heavy sentences, as supported by the linguistic analysis.\n\n**Critical Issue to Fix:**\n\n*   **Title Format:** The main title must be a question to match the style of the subheadings.\n    *   **Current Title:** \"Benefits and risks of non-immune-suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What are the benefits and risks of treatments that do not suppress the immune system for IgA nephropathy?\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Simplify Complex and Technical Words:** The summary uses some terms that may be unfamiliar to readers.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis identified three features that deviate from typical patterns (P90 range), indicating areas for improvement. The number of nouns (192), Dale-Chall complex words (236), and long words (177) are all higher than is typical for a PLS. This data supports the editorial feedback to simplify vocabulary and rephrase noun-heavy sentences to enhance clarity for the reader."
