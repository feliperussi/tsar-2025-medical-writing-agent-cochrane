  "draft": "Benefits and risks of non-immune-suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy\n\nKey messages\n- For people with IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease), a group of blood pressure medicines called RAS inhibitors appear to be the most helpful treatment that does not suppress the immune system. They can reduce the amount of protein in the urine. The review found little information on unwanted effects or long-term effects, like preventing kidney failure.\n- In studies conducted only in Japanese people, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may help reduce protein and blood in the urine. It is not clear if this finding applies to people of other ethnicities.\n- The studies in this review were generally small and did not last long enough to show the long-term effects of these treatments on serious problems like kidney failure.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common kidney disease. Over many years, it can cause the kidneys to stop working properly, which leads to kidney failure in some people. A key sign of kidney damage in IgAN is when protein leaks from the blood into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Doctors often use treatments that do not suppress the body's immune system to help manage the disease. These treatments aim to control blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine, without the risks that come with long-term immune-suppressing medicines.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of different non-immunosuppressive treatments for adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We looked at a wide range of treatments, including medicines to lower blood pressure, blood thinners, fish oil, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy), and herbal medicines.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at the effects of non-immunosuppressive treatments in adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 80 studies that included 4856 adults and children. A biopsy was used to confirm that all participants had IgA nephropathy. The studies compared different treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or standard care.\n\nA group of blood pressure medicines called RAS inhibitors probably reduces the amount of protein in the urine for people with IgA nephropathy. They also probably help the kidneys work better when compared to a dummy treatment or treating only the symptoms. However, these medicines may make little to no difference to the risk of kidney failure. There may be little to no difference in the risk of unwanted effects when taking these medicines.\n\nFor Japanese people, having a tonsillectomy in addition to standard care may help. It may increase the chances that protein and blood disappear from the urine and reduce the chances that they come back. It is not clear if these findings apply to people of other ethnicities.\n\nAntimalarial therapy may greatly reduce protein in the urine, but it is unclear if this treatment causes unwanted effects. Other treatments like blood thinners, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines may slightly help the kidneys work better compared to a dummy treatment. However, these benefits may not be seen when compared to standard care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons:\n- In some studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving. This knowledge could have influenced the results.\n- Many studies were very small, and there were not enough studies overall for us to be certain about the results.\n- The studies did not always report on important long-term effects, such as kidney failure.\n- Some findings were only from specific groups of people, so the results may not apply to everyone with IgA nephropathy.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and factually accurate. All critical checks for completeness, accuracy, and word count have passed. To make it even more accessible for readers, I'm recommending a few revisions focusing on vocabulary and consistency.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n**1. Replace Noun-Heavy Phrases with More Direct Verbs**\n\nSome sentences rely on nouns where verbs would be simpler and more direct. This can make the text feel a bit ...\n\n*   **Original Text:** 'A biopsy was used to confirm that all participants had IgA nephropathy.'\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This is a passive, noun-focused construction ('A biopsy was used...'). Using a direct verb makes the sentence more active and easier to read.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Doctors used a biopsy to confirm that all participants had IgA nephropathy.'\n\n**2. Use Consistent Terminology for Side Effects**\n\nThe summary uses several different terms for side effects, including 'risks' (in the title), 'harms' (in the aims), and 'unwanted effects' (in the results).\n\n*   **Original Text:** 'Benefits and risks of...', '...find out the benefits and harms...', '...risk of unwanted effects...'\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Using different words for the same concept can be confusing for readers. It's best to choose one clear, plain-language term and use it consistently.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** Standardize on 'unwanted effects' throughout the text. For example: 'Benefits and unwanted effects of non-immune-suppressing treatments...', '...find out the benefits and unwanted effects...', '...risk of unwanted effects...'.\n\n**3. Make Vague Descriptions More Concrete**\n\nOne of the key findings uses a subjective term that could be made more specific for the reader.\n\n*   **Original Text:** 'Antimalarial therapy may greatly reduce protein in the urine...'\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The word 'greatly' is vague and open to interpretation. The original study provides a more concrete measure (>50% reduction) that can be translated into plain language.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Antimalarial therapy may reduce protein in the urine by more than half...'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Analysis:**\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of nouns, long words, and words uncommon in everyday language (Dale-Chall complex words) compared to typical Plain Language Summaries. Addressing these points will improve clarity and align the text more closely with best practices.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 77.8% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, the analysis and evaluation identified significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. The counts for nouns (195.0), Dale-Chall complex words (242.0), and long words (183.0) are all in the P90 range, indicating the vocabulary is more complex and noun-heavy than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
