  "draft": "Benefits and risks of non‑immune‑suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy\n\nKey messages\n- For people with IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease), medicines that lower blood pressure appear to be the most helpful non-immunosuppressive treatment, as they can reduce the amount of protein in the urine. The review found little information on unwanted effects or on long-term effects like preventing kidney failure.\n- In studies conducted only in Japanese people, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may help reduce protein and blood in the urine. It is not clear if this finding applies to people of other ethnicities.\n- The studies included in the review were generally small and did not last long enough to properly assess the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments on important outcomes like kidney failure.\n\nWhat is this review about?\nWhat is IgA nephropathy?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common kidney disease. Over many years, it can cause the kidneys to stop working properly, leading to kidney failure in some people. A key sign of kidney damage in IgAN is when protein leaks from the blood into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Treatments that do not suppress the body's immune system are often used to help manage the disease. These treatments aim to control blood pressure and reduce the amount of protein in the urine, without the risks that come with long-term immune-suppressing medicines.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different non-immunosuppressive treatments for adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We looked at a wide range of treatments, including medicines to lower blood pressure, blood thinners, fish oil, surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy), and herbal medicines.\n\nWhat we did\nWe searched for studies that looked at the effects of non-immunosuppressive treatments in adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat we found\nThe review included 80 studies involving a total of 4856 adults and children with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy. The studies examined various non-immunosuppressive interventions compared against placebo, no treatment, or standard care.\nFor people with IgA nephropathy, medicines that lower blood pressure (specifically RAS inhibitors) probably reduce the amount of protein in the urine and probably improve measures of kidney function compared to either a dummy treatment or treating only the symptoms. However, these medicines may make little to no difference to the risk of kidney failure. There may be little to no difference in the risk of unwanted effects when taking these medicines.\nFor people of Japanese ethnicity, having a tonsillectomy in addition to standard care may increase the chances of protein and blood disappearing from the urine and may reduce the chances of them reappearing. It is not clear if these findings apply to people of other ethnicities.\nAntimalarial therapy may increase the chances of a large reduction of protein in the urine, but it is unclear if this treatment has an effect on unwanted effects. Other treatments like blood thinners, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines may offer small benefits for kidney function compared to a dummy treatment, but these benefits may not be seen when compared to standard care.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. Furthermore, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies that were included were very small. Finally, some evidence focused on specific populations, whereas the question we wanted to answer was broader.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs some revisions to meet our style guide and improve clarity for readers. The main issue is a critical one: several headings are not phrased as questions. Additionally, the text is often dense and uses complex phrasing, which is supported by the linguistic analysis.\n\n**Critical Issue: Headings Must Be Questions**\n\n- **Problem:** The main title and several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a requirement of the Master Style Guide (5.3). This makes the summary harder for readers to scan and understand its structure.\n- **Examples:**\n    - Title: \"Benefits and risks of non‑immune‑suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy\"\n    - Subheading: \"What we did\"\n    - Subheading: \"What we found\"\n    - Subheading: \"Limitations of the evidence\"\n- **Suggested Fix:** Please rephrase all titles and subheadings as questions.\n    - Title: \"What are the benefits and risks of non-immune-suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy?\"\n    - Subheading: \"What did we do?\"\n    - Subheading: \"What did we find?\"\n    - Subheading: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed for Clarity**\n\n1.  **Replace noun-heavy phrases with direct verbs.** The sentences often use noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which makes them less direct and harder to read.\n    - **Quote:** \"Antimalarial therapy may increase the chances of a large reduction of protein in the urine...\"\n    - **Problem:** The phrase \"a large reduction of\" is indirect. Using a verb makes the sentence stronger and clearer.\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Antimalarial therapy may greatly reduce protein in the urine...\"\n\n2.  **Break up long, complex sentences.** Some sentences combine too many ideas, which can be overwhelming for readers.\n    - **Quote:** \"For people of Japanese ethnicity, having a tonsillectomy in addition to standard care may increase the chances of protein and blood disappearing from the urine and may reduce the chances of them reappearing.\"\n    - **Problem:** This 34-word sentence is difficult to process in one go. Splitting it makes the key points easier to absorb.\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"For people of Japanese ethnicity, having a tonsillectomy along with standard care may help. It may increase the chances that protein and blood disappear from the urine. It may also reduce the chances that they come back.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify wordy phrases and technical terms.** Some phrasing is more complex than it needs to be for a plain language summary.\n    - **Quote:** \"The studies examined various non-immunosuppressive interventions compared against placebo, no treatment, or standard care.\"\n    - **Problem:** \"Interventions\" is a technical term, and the overall phrasing is dense.\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies compared different non-immunosuppressive treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or standard care.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These editorial suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft deviates from typical PLS patterns with high counts of nominalizations, nouns, complex words, and long words. Addressing the points above will help bring these metrics closer to the typical range for a Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows good conformity in some areas, with 77.8% of metrics falling within the median or best quartile ranges. However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure. The counts for nominalization (23.0), nouns (194.0), complex words (238.0), and long words (190.0) are all in the P90 range, indicating the text is denser and uses more complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. These metrics support the need for simplification and more direct, verb-based phrasing."
