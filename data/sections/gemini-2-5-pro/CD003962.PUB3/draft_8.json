  "draft": "What are the benefits and unwanted effects of treatments that do not suppress the immune system for IgA nephropathy?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease), medicines that lower blood pressure appear to be the most helpful treatment that does not suppress the immune system, as they can reduce the amount of protein in the urine. The review found little information on unwanted effects or long-term effects, like preventing kidney failure.\n- In studies conducted only in Japanese people, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may help reduce protein and blood in the urine. It is not clear if this finding applies to people of other ethnicities.\n- The studies in this review were generally small and did not last long enough to show the long-term effects of these treatments on important outcomes like kidney failure.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common kidney disease. Over many years, it can cause the kidneys to stop working properly, which leads to kidney failure in some people. A key sign of kidney damage in IgAN is when protein leaks from the blood into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Doctors often use treatments that do not suppress the body's immune system to help manage the disease. These treatments aim to control blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine, without the risks that come with long-term medicines that suppress the immune system.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and unwanted effects of different treatments that do not suppress the immune system for adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We looked at a wide range of treatments, including medicines to lower blood pressure, blood thinners, fish oil, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy), and herbal medicines.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at the effects of treatments that do not suppress the immune system in adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 80 studies that included 4856 adults and children. Doctors used a biopsy to confirm that all participants had IgA nephropathy. The studies compared different treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or standard care.\n\nMedicines that lower blood pressure (specifically a type called RAS inhibitors) probably reduce protein in the urine for people with IgA nephropathy. They also probably help the kidneys work better when compared to a dummy treatment or treating only the symptoms. However, these medicines may make little to no difference to the risk of kidney failure. There may be little to no difference in the risk of unwanted effects when taking these medicines.\n\nFor Japanese people, having a tonsillectomy in addition to standard care may help. It may increase the chances that protein and blood disappear from the urine and reduce the chances that they come back. It is not clear if these findings apply to people of other ethnicities.\n\nAntimalarial therapy may reduce protein in the urine by more than half, but it is unclear if this treatment causes unwanted effects. Other treatments like blood thinners, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines may slightly help the kidneys work better compared to a dummy treatment. However, these benefits may not be seen when compared to standard care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons:\n- In some studies, the people taking part knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.\n- Many studies were very small, and there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n- The studies did not always report on important long-term effects, such as kidney failure.\n- Some findings may not apply to everyone. For example, the studies on tonsil removal were only conducted with Japanese people, so we do not know if these results apply to people of other ethnicities.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. It meets all the critical requirements. The following suggestions are minor revisions aimed at making the text even more direct and accessible for readers.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1.  **Simplify Wordy and Repetitive Phrases.** Some sentences use more words than necessary to explain concepts, which can slow the reader down. Simplifying them will improve readability.\n    *   **Example 1:** \"Doctors often use treatments that do not suppress the body's immune system to help manage the disease. These treatments aim to control blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine, without the risks that come with long-term medicines that suppress the immune system.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"suppress the... immune system\" is used twice in two sentences. This could be more concise.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"To manage the disease, doctors often use treatments that don't suppress the immune system. These aim to control blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine, avoiding the risks of long-term immunosuppressive medicines.\"\n\n2.  **Make Phrasing More Direct and Active.** Some sentences, particularly in the limitations section, are written in an indirect way. Using a more direct, active structure makes the information easier to process.\n    *   **Example:** \"In some studies, the people taking part knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly roundabout. A more direct statement is clearer and has more impact.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"People in some studies knew which treatment they received, which could have biased the results.\"\n\n3.  **Break Up Complex Sentences in the Results.** The results section contains sentences that pack a lot of information into one place. Breaking them into shorter, more focused sentences can help readers absorb the key findings.\n    *   **Example:** \"Medicines that lower blood pressure (specifically a type called RAS inhibitors) probably reduce protein in the urine for people with IgA nephropathy.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The parenthetical information, while useful, interrupts the main point of the sentence.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"A type of blood pressure medicine called RAS inhibitors probably reduces protein in the urine for people with IgA nephropathy.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your draft is already very strong, with 83% of its features falling into the best quartile for PLS texts. The suggestions above are supported by metrics showing a higher-than-typical number of nouns, long words, and complex words (Dale-Chall). Addressing these minor issues will help refine an already excellent summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling within the best quartile. The text is well within the word count limit and has excellent readability scores. However, three metrics deviate from typical patterns, falling in the P90 range: 'nouns' (201.0), 'complex_words_dc' (255.0), and 'long_words' (187.0). This suggests the text could be improved by reducing noun-heavy constructions and simplifying some vocabulary choices to enhance clarity further."
