  "draft": "What are the benefits and unwanted effects of treatments that do not suppress the immune system for IgA nephropathy?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease), medicines that lower blood pressure appear to be the most helpful treatment that does not suppress the immune system. These medicines can reduce the amount of protein in the urine, but the review found little information on their unwanted effects or long-term effects, like preventing kidney failure.\n- In studies conducted only in Japanese people, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may help reduce protein and blood in the urine. It is not clear if this finding applies to people of other ethnicities.\n- The studies in this review were generally small and did not last long enough to show the long-term effects of these treatments on important outcomes like kidney failure.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common kidney disease. Over many years, it can cause the kidneys to stop working properly, which leads to kidney failure in some people. A key sign of kidney damage in IgAN is when protein leaks from the blood into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). To manage the disease, doctors often use treatments that do not suppress the immune system. These aim to control blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine, avoiding the risks of long-term immune-suppressing medicines.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and unwanted effects of different treatments that do not suppress the immune system for adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We looked at a wide range of treatments, including medicines to lower blood pressure, blood thinners, fish oil, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy), and herbal medicines.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at the effects of treatments that do not suppress the immune system in adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 80 studies that included 4856 adults and children. Doctors used a biopsy (taking a small tissue sample) to confirm that all participants had IgA nephropathy. The studies compared different treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or standard care.\n\nA type of blood pressure medicine called RAS inhibitors probably reduces protein in the urine for people with IgA nephropathy. These medicines also probably help the kidneys work better compared to a dummy treatment or treating only symptoms. However, they may make little to no difference to the risk of kidney failure. There may also be little to no difference in the risk of unwanted effects.\n\nFor Japanese people, having a tonsillectomy in addition to standard care may help. It may increase the chances that protein and blood disappear from the urine and reduce the chances that they come back. It is not clear if these findings apply to people of other ethnicities.\n\nAntimalarial therapy may reduce protein in the urine by more than half, but it is unclear if this treatment causes unwanted effects. Other treatments like blood thinners, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines may slightly help the kidneys work better compared to a dummy treatment. However, these benefits may not be seen when compared to standard care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons:\n- People in some studies knew which treatment they received, which could have biased the results.\n- Many studies were small, and there were not enough of them for us to be certain about the results.\n- The studies did not always report on important long-term effects, such as kidney failure.\n- The findings on tonsil removal were only from studies with Japanese people, so we do not know if these results apply to people of other ethnicities.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, well-structured draft that is factually accurate and meets all critical requirements. However, it can be made more accessible for a lay audience by simplifying some word choices and making sentences more direct. The suggested edits below will help align the text more closely with plain language principles.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Replace clinical terms with simpler, everyday words.** Some terms, while technically correct, are more formal than needed for a patient audience.\n   - **Quote:** \"Doctors used a biopsy (taking a small tissue sample) to confirm that all **participants** had IgA nephropathy.\"\n   - **Problem:** \"Participants\" is clinical research jargon.\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace it with a more familiar term. For example: \"Doctors used a biopsy (taking a small tissue sample) to confirm that all **people in the studies** had IgA nephropathy.\"\n\n2. **Make noun-heavy sentences more direct by using verbs.** Some sentences rely heavily on nouns, which can make them dense and harder to process.\n   - **Quote:** \"A key sign of kidney damage in IgAN is when protein leaks from the blood into the urine (a condition called proteinuria).\"\n   - **Problem:** This sentence is packed with nouns (\"sign\", \"damage\", \"protein\", \"blood\", \"urine\", \"condition\"), making it less direct.\n   - **Suggestion:** Break the idea into two shorter, verb-focused sentences. For example: \"In people with IgAN, a key sign of kidney damage is having too much protein in their urine. This is called proteinuria.\"\n\n3. **Simplify wordy phrases.** Some phrases can be shortened to improve readability and flow.\n   - **Quote:** \"The review found little information on their unwanted effects or long-term effects, like preventing kidney failure.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"found little information on\" is slightly indirect.\n   - **Suggestion:** Use a more direct and active construction. For example: \"The review did not find much information about the side effects of these medicines or their long-term effects, like preventing kidney failure.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is very well-written and highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis also supports the need for minor revisions, identifying a higher than usual number of nouns, long words, and complex words (Dale-Chall). These deviations suggest that simplifying vocabulary and sentence structure in a few key places would further improve clarity for readers."
