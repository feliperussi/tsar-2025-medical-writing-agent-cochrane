  "draft": "What are the benefits and unwanted effects of non-immune-suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease), a type of blood pressure medicine called a RAS inhibitor appears to be the most helpful treatment that does not suppress the immune system. They can reduce the amount of protein in the urine. The review found little information on unwanted effects or long-term effects, like preventing kidney failure.\n- In studies conducted only in Japanese people, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may help reduce protein and blood in the urine. It is not clear if this finding applies to people of other ethnicities.\n- The studies in this review were generally small and did not last long enough to show the long-term effects of these treatments on important outcomes like kidney failure.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common kidney disease. Over many years, it can cause the kidneys to stop working properly, which leads to kidney failure in some people. A key sign of kidney damage in IgAN is when protein leaks from the blood into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Doctors often use treatments that do not suppress the body's immune system to help manage the disease. These treatments aim to control blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine, without the risks that come with long-term immune-suppressing medicines.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and unwanted effects of different non-immunosuppressive treatments for adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We looked at a wide range of treatments, including medicines to lower blood pressure, blood thinners, fish oil, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy), and herbal medicines.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at the effects of non-immunosuppressive treatments in adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 80 studies that included 4856 adults and children. Doctors used a biopsy to confirm that all participants had IgA nephropathy. The studies compared different treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or standard care.\n\nA type of blood pressure medicine called a RAS inhibitor probably reduces protein in the urine for people with IgA nephropathy. They also probably help the kidneys work better when compared to a dummy treatment or treating only the symptoms. However, these medicines may make little to no difference to the risk of kidney failure. There may be little to no difference in the risk of unwanted effects when taking these medicines.\n\nFor Japanese people, having a tonsillectomy in addition to standard care may help. It may increase the chances that protein and blood disappear from the urine and reduce the chances that they come back. It is not clear if these findings apply to people of other ethnicities.\n\nAntimalarial therapy may reduce protein in the urine by more than half, but it is unclear if this treatment causes unwanted effects. Other treatments like blood thinners, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines may slightly help the kidneys work better compared to a dummy treatment. However, these benefits may not be seen when compared to standard care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons:\n- In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. This can bias the results, because people’s expectations can influence how they feel or what they report.\n- Many studies were very small, and there were not enough studies overall for us to be certain about the results.\n- The studies did not always report on important long-term effects, such as kidney failure.\n- Some findings were only from specific groups of people, so the results may not apply to everyone with IgA nephropathy.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that is close to approval. It passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and length. However, it is 'NOT_APPROVED' because of three key clarity issues that should be addressed to ensure the best possible reader experience.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Unify the terminology for the main treatment type.** The summary uses at least four different phrases (e.g., 'non-immune-suppressing', 'does not suppress the immune system', 'non-immunosuppressive') to describe the same concept. This could confuse readers into thinking these are different treatments.\n   - **Quote:** 'non-immune-suppressing treatments' (title) vs. 'treatment that does not suppress the immune system' (key messages) vs. 'non-immunosuppressive treatments' (aims).\n   - **Suggestion:** Please choose one clear, plain-language phrase, such as 'treatments that do not suppress the immune system', and use it consistently throughout the summary.\n\n2. **Make the 'Limitations' section more specific and concrete.** The current explanations are too general and may not give readers a clear picture of the evidence's weaknesses.\n   - **Quote:** 'In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting... Some findings were only from specific groups of people, so the results may not apply to everyone with IgA nephropathy.'\n   - **Suggestion:** Please make this more concrete. For example: 'In some studies, the people taking part knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Also, some findings may not apply to everyone. For example, the studies on tonsil removal were only conducted with Japanese people, so we do not know if these results apply to people of other ethnicities.'\n\n3. **Simplify the first key message to avoid early jargon.** The first key message immediately introduces a specific drug class ('RAS inhibitor'), which may be unfamiliar to readers. It's better to start with the broader category.\n   - **Quote:** '...a type of blood pressure medicine called a RAS inhibitor appears to be the most helpful treatment...'\n   - **Suggestion:** Please simplify this to align with the source text, which is more accessible. For example: '...medicines that lower blood pressure appear to be the most helpful treatment that does not suppress the immune system, as they can reduce the amount of protein in the urine.' You can then introduce 'RAS inhibitors' in the main results section.\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The linguistic analysis shows the draft is noun-heavy and uses more long and complex words than is typical for a PLS (nouns, long_words, and complex_words_dc are all in the 90th percentile). Addressing the points above, particularly simplifying terminology, will help improve these metrics and overall readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of its linguistic features falling within the best quartile for readability and style. However, the analysis also highlights a few key areas for improvement. The draft deviates from typical patterns on three metrics related to vocabulary complexity: 'nouns' (P90), 'complex_words_dc' (P90), and 'long_words' (P90). These scores suggest the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex and long words than is common in PLS, supporting the editorial recommendation to simplify terminology and phrasing."
