  "key_messages": [
    "For people with IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease), medicines that lower blood pressure appear to be the most helpful non-immunosuppressive treatment, as they can reduce the amount of protein in the urine. The review found little information on unwanted effects or on long-term effects like preventing kidney failure.",
    "In studies conducted only in Japanese people, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may help reduce protein and blood in the urine. It is not clear if this finding applies to people of other ethnicities.",
    "The studies included in the review were generally small and did not last long enough to properly assess the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments on important outcomes like kidney failure."

      "content": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common kidney disease. Over many years, it can cause the kidneys to stop working properly, leading to kidney failure in some people. A key sign of kidney damage in IgAN is when protein leaks from the blood into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Treatments that do not suppress the body's immune system are often used to help manage the disease. These treatments aim to control blood pressure and reduce the amount of protein in the urine, without the risks that come with long-term immune-suppressing medicines."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different non-immunosuppressive treatments for adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We looked at a wide range of treatments, including medicines to lower blood pressure, blood thinners, fish oil, surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy), and herbal medicines."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 80 studies involving a total of 4856 adults and children with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy. The studies examined various non-immunosuppressive interventions compared against placebo, no treatment, or standard care.\n\nFor people with IgA nephropathy, medicines that lower blood pressure (specifically RAS inhibitors) probably reduce the amount of protein in the urine and probably improve measures of kidney function compared to either a dummy treatment or treating only the symptoms. However, these medicines may make little to no difference to the risk of kidney failure. There may be little to no difference in the risk of unwanted effects when taking these medicines.\n\nFor people of Japanese ethnicity, having a tonsillectomy in addition to standard care may increase the chances of protein and blood disappearing from the urine and may reduce the chances of them reappearing. It is not clear if these findings apply to people of other ethnicities.\n\nAntimalarial therapy may increase the chances of a large reduction of protein in the urine, but it is unclear if this treatment has an effect on unwanted effects. Other treatments like blood thinners, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines may offer small benefits for kidney function compared to a dummy treatment, but these benefits may not be seen when compared to standard care."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. Furthermore, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies that were included were very small. Finally, some evidence focused on specific populations, whereas the question we wanted to answer was broader.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023 of search."
