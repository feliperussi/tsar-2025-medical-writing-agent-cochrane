  "draft": "Benefits and risks of non-immune-suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy\n\nKey messages\n- For people with IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease), medicines that lower blood pressure appear to be the most helpful treatment that does not suppress the immune system. These medicines can reduce the amount of protein in the urine, but the review did not find much information about the side effects of these medicines or their long-term effects, like preventing kidney failure.\n- In studies conducted only in Japanese people, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may help reduce protein and blood in the urine. It is not clear if this finding applies to people of other ethnicities.\n- The studies in this review were generally small and did not last long enough to assess the long-term benefits and harms of these treatments on important outcomes like kidney failure.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common kidney disease. Over many years, it can cause the kidneys to stop working properly, which leads to kidney failure in some people. A key sign of kidney damage is having too much protein in the urine. This condition is called proteinuria. To manage the disease, doctors often use treatments that do not suppress the immune system. These aim to control blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine, avoiding the risks of long-term immune-suppressing medicines.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of different treatments that do not suppress the immune system for adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We looked at a wide range of treatments, including medicines to lower blood pressure, blood thinners, fish oil, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy), and herbal medicines.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at the effects of treatments that do not suppress the immune system in adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 80 studies that included 4856 adults and children. Doctors used a biopsy (taking a small tissue sample) to confirm that all people in the studies had IgA nephropathy. The studies compared different treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or standard care.\n\nA type of blood pressure medicine called RAS inhibitors probably reduces protein in the urine for people with IgA nephropathy. These medicines also probably help the kidneys work better compared to a dummy treatment or treating only symptoms. However, they may make little to no difference to the risk of kidney failure. There may also be little to no difference in the risk of side effects.\n\nFor Japanese people, having a tonsillectomy in addition to standard care may help. It may increase the chances that protein and blood disappear from the urine and reduce the chances that they come back. It is not clear if these findings apply to people of other ethnicities.\n\nAntimalarial therapy may reduce protein in the urine by more than half, but it is unclear if this treatment causes side effects. Other treatments like blood thinners, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines may slightly help the kidneys work better compared to a dummy treatment. However, these benefits may not be seen when compared to standard care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons:\n- People in some studies knew which treatment they received, which could have biased the results.\n- Many studies were small, and there were not enough of them for us to be certain about the results.\n- The studies did not always report on important long-term effects, such as kidney failure.\n- The findings on tonsil removal were only from studies with Japanese people, so we do not know if these results apply to people of other ethnicities.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, accuracy, and length have passed. However, a few revisions to simplify complex phrasing and align with style guidelines will make it even more accessible for readers. \n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase the title as a question to better engage readers.** The style guide recommends using questions for headings where possible. This helps draw the reader in.\n   - **Current Title:** \"Benefits and risks of non-immune-suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What are the benefits and risks of non-immune-suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy?\"\n\n2. **Simplify technical descriptions and reduce wordiness.** Some sentences are noun-heavy and use repetitive phrasing, which can make them harder to process.\n   - **Example 1:** \"A key sign of kidney damage is having too much protein in the urine. This condition is called proteinuria.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is a bit clunky. Combining the idea and the term can make it flow better.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"A key sign of kidney damage is when protein from the blood leaks into the urine. This is called proteinuria.\"\n\n   - **Example 2:** \"To manage the disease, doctors often use treatments that do not suppress the immune system. These aim to control blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine, avoiding the risks of long-term immune-suppressing medicines.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"immune system\" is used twice in close succession. Since the topic is already established, this can be streamlined.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"To manage the disease, doctors often use treatments that control blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine. These treatments avoid the risks that come with long-term medicines that suppress the immune system and long-term medicines that suppress the immune system.\"\n\n3. **Make the limitations more concrete for a lay audience.** The explanation of bias could be clearer about *how* the results might be affected.\n   - **Current Sentence:** \"People in some studies knew which treatment they received, which could have biased the results.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The term \"biased the results\" is abstract. Explaining the potential impact is more helpful.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced their reported symptoms or outcomes, potentially affecting the results.\"\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows higher-than-typical counts for nouns and complex words. Addressing these points will improve clarity and make the summary easier for patients and their families to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 77.8% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and structure. Sentence length and use of active voice are excellent. However, the analysis identified significant deviation from typical patterns in three areas related to vocabulary complexity: the number of nouns (P90), complex words based on the Dale-Chall list (P90), and long words (P90). This suggests that while the sentence structure is simple, the word choice could be simplified further to enhance reader understanding."
