  "draft": "Benefits and unwanted effects of non-immune-suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy\n\nKey messages\n- For people with IgA nephropathy (a kidney disease), a group of blood pressure medicines called RAS inhibitors appear to be the most helpful treatment that does not suppress the immune system. They can reduce the amount of protein in the urine. The review found little information on unwanted effects or long-term effects, like preventing kidney failure.\n- In studies conducted only in Japanese people, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may help reduce protein and blood in the urine. It is not clear if this finding applies to people of other ethnicities.\n- The studies in this review were generally small and did not last long enough to show the long-term effects of these treatments on important outcomes like kidney failure.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common kidney disease. Over many years, it can cause the kidneys to stop working properly, which leads to kidney failure in some people. A key sign of kidney damage in IgAN is when protein leaks from the blood into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Doctors often use treatments that do not suppress the body's immune system to help manage the disease. These treatments aim to control blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine, without the unwanted effects that come with long-term immune-suppressing medicines.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and unwanted effects of different non-immunosuppressive treatments for adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We looked at a wide range of treatments, including medicines to lower blood pressure, blood thinners, fish oil, surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy), and herbal medicines.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that looked at the effects of non-immunosuppressive treatments in adults and children with IgA nephropathy. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 80 studies that included 4856 adults and children. Doctors used a biopsy to confirm that all participants had IgA nephropathy. The studies compared different treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or standard care.\n\nA group of blood pressure medicines called RAS inhibitors probably reduces the amount of protein in the urine for people with IgA nephropathy. They also probably help the kidneys work better when compared to a dummy treatment or treating only the symptoms. However, these medicines may make little to no difference to the risk of kidney failure. There may be little to no difference in the risk of unwanted effects when taking these medicines.\n\nFor Japanese people, having a tonsillectomy in addition to standard care may help. It may increase the chances that protein and blood disappear from the urine and reduce the chances that they come back. It is not clear if these findings apply to people of other ethnicities.\n\nAntimalarial therapy may reduce protein in the urine by more than half, but it is unclear if this treatment causes unwanted effects. Other treatments like blood thinners, fish oil, and traditional Chinese medicines may slightly help the kidneys work better compared to a dummy treatment. However, these benefits may not be seen when compared to standard care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons:\n- In some studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving. This knowledge could have influenced the results.\n- Many studies were very small, and there were not enough studies overall for us to be certain about the results.\n- The studies did not always report on important long-term effects, such as kidney failure.\n- Some findings were only from specific groups of people, so the results may not apply to everyone with IgA nephropathy.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023.",

The following suggestions are intended to refine an already excellent summary to make it even more accessible for readers.\n\n### Critical Issues\n\n- **Title Format:** The main title does not follow the style guide's preference for being phrased as a question.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Rephrase the main title as a question to better engage readers.**\n- **Quote:** \"Benefits and unwanted effects of non-immune-suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy\"\n- **Why it's problematic:** The Cochrane style guide recommends phrasing titles and subheadings as questions. This helps readers immediately understand what question the review answers and makes the content feel more approachable.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"What are the benefits and unwanted effects of non-immune-suppressing treatments for IgA nephropathy?\"\n\n**2. Simplify some sentences to reduce wordiness and complex vocabulary.**\n- **Why it's problematic:** While the readability scores are good, some sentences are denser than they need to be. Using simpler, more common words makes the text easier to process, especially for readers with lower health literacy. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which noted a higher-than-typical number of nouns, long words, and complex words.\n- **Quote:** \"A group of blood pressure medicines called RAS inhibitors probably reduces the amount of protein in the urine for people with IgA nephropathy.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"A type of blood pressure medicine called a RAS inhibitor probably reduces protein in the urine for people with IgA nephropathy.\"\n\n**3. Make the explanation of study limitations more concrete for the reader.**\n- **Quote:** \"In some studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving. This knowledge could have influenced the results.\"\n- **Why it's problematic:** This correctly identifies the limitation (lack of blinding) but doesn't explain *why* it matters in simple terms. A lay reader may not understand how this knowledge could influence the results.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. This can bias the results, because people’s expectations can influence how they feel or what they report.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is very well-written and highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, the analysis also identified a higher-than-typical density of nouns (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), and long words (P90). This suggests that while the sentence structure is excellent, the vocabulary could be simplified in places to further improve accessibility."
