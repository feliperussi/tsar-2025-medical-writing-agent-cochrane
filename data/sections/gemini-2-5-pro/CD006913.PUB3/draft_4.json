  "draft": "Can psychological therapies, such as talking therapy, help people with inflammatory bowel disease (a long-term condition where the gut becomes inflamed)?\n\nKey messages\n- For adults with inflammatory bowel disease, psychological therapies (such as talking therapy, education, and relaxation) are likely to slightly improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety. For children and adolescents, a specific type of talking therapy (called psychotherapy) probably also improves quality of life. These therapies may have little to no effect on the inflammation of the gut (disease activity). The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The studies included in the review were very different from each other, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. More research is needed to find out which types of psychological therapies are most helpful and to understand their effects over a longer period of time.\n\nWhat is the link between inflammatory bowel disease and mental health?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a long-term condition where the gut becomes inflamed, causing symptoms like pain and diarrhoea. Living with IBD can be challenging and stressful, and people with the condition have a higher risk of developing mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. The relationship may go both ways: the stress of the disease can affect a person's mood, and their emotional state might also affect their physical symptoms. Because of this link, psychological therapies such as talking therapies, educational programs, and relaxation techniques have been used to support people with IBD. However, previous studies have shown inconsistent results about how well they work.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if psychological therapies are effective for children and adults with IBD. Specifically, we looked at whether these therapies improved people's quality of life, their emotional state (such as anxiety and depression), and the severity of their IBD symptoms (known as 'disease activity').\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychological therapies with no treatment or other types of care for people with inflammatory bowel disease. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with inflammatory bowel disease (6111 adults and 294 children and adolescents). These studies compared psychological therapies to usual care or no therapy.\n\nFor adults, psychological therapies (like talking therapy, education, and relaxation) probably increase quality of life slightly and probably reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety slightly. For children and adolescents, a specific type of talking therapy (called psychotherapy) probably increases their quality of life. The evidence suggests that psychological therapies may make little to no difference to disease activity.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have moderate confidence in the evidence for several reasons. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies used different ways of providing the therapies, and some of the studies were very small.\n\nThis review includes evidence found up to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is well-structured and factually accurate. However, it has not been approved because the vocabulary is more complex than necessary for a lay audience, which could make it difficult for some readers to understand. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing that the number of complex and long words is higher than in typical Plain Language Summaries.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements to increase clarity:\n\n1. **Explain *why* a study limitation is a problem.** Readers may not understand the concept of bias. Adding a brief explanation makes the limitation meaningful.\n    *   **Current text:** 'It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting...'\n    *   **Problem:** This states a fact but doesn't explain why it's a concern for the evidence.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, **which could have influenced their answers about their symptoms.**'\n\n2. **Replace research jargon with simpler, more direct language.** This helps make the text more accessible.\n    *   **Current text:** 'However, previous studies have shown **inconsistent results** about how well they work.'\n    *   **Problem:** 'Inconsistent results' is a term used by researchers. A more straightforward phrasing would be better for a general audience.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'However, **previous studies have not agreed on** how well they work.'\n\n3. **Use simpler, everyday words instead of abstract nouns.** This makes the writing feel more direct and less academic.\n    *   **Current text:** '...and their **emotional state** might also affect their physical symptoms.'\n    *   **Problem:** 'Emotional state' is slightly formal and abstract.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** '...and their **feelings** might also affect their physical symptoms.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, particularly in sentence structure and use of active voice, with 50% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, the analysis identifies a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Four key metrics—smog_index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words—are in the P90 range, indicating the text uses more complex and long words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which could impact readability for a lay audience."
