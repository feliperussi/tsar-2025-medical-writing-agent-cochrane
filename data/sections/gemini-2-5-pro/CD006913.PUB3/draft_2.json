  "draft": "Can psychological therapies, such as talking therapy, help people with inflammatory bowel disease (a long-term condition where the gut becomes inflamed)?\n\nKey messages\n- For adults with inflammatory bowel disease, psychological therapies (such as talking therapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques) are likely to slightly improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety. For children and adolescents, talking therapy probably also improves quality of life. These therapies may have little to no effect on the inflammation of the gut (disease activity). The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The studies included in the review were very different from each other, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. More research is needed to find out which types of psychological therapies are most helpful and to understand their effects over a longer period of time.\n\nWhat is the link between inflammatory bowel disease and mental health?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a long-term condition where the gut becomes inflamed, causing symptoms like pain and diarrhoea. Living with IBD can be challenging and stressful, and people with the condition have a higher risk of developing mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. The relationship may go both ways: the stress of the disease can affect a person's mood, and their emotional state might also influence their physical symptoms. Because of this link, psychological treatments like talking therapies, educational programs, and relaxation techniques have been used to support people with IBD. However, previous studies have shown inconsistent results about how well they work.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if psychological treatments are effective for children and adults with IBD. Specifically, we looked at whether these interventions improved people's quality of life, their emotional state (such as anxiety and depression), and the severity of their IBD symptoms (known as 'disease activity').\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychological treatments with no treatment or other types of care for people with inflammatory bowel disease. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with inflammatory bowel disease (6111 adults and 294 children and adolescents). The studies looked at psychological treatments (like talking therapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques) and compared them to usual care or no therapy. For adults with inflammatory bowel disease, psychological interventions probably increase quality of life slightly and probably reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety slightly. For children and adolescents, psychotherapy probably increases their quality of life. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may make little to no difference to disease activity.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about several factors. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies used different ways of delivering the interventions, and some of the studies were very small.\n\nThis review includes evidence found up to May 2023.",

However, a few minor revisions will make it even easier for readers to understand. I'm recommending 'NOT_APPROVED' so you can incorporate these suggestions for a final polish.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1.  **Use consistent terminology for treatments.** The summary uses 'psychological therapies', 'psychological treatments', and 'psychological interventions' to describe the same thing. This could confuse a reader into thinking these are different concepts.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** The draft switches between 'therapies' (in the title), 'treatments' (in the 'What did we find?' section), and 'interventions' (also in the 'What did we find?' section).\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** I recommend sticking with 'psychological therapies' throughout, as it's used in the title and is the most patient-friendly term. For example, in the 'What did we find?' section, you could change: \"...psychological interventions probably increase quality of life...\" to \"...psychological therapies probably increase quality of life...\"\n\n2.  **Remove redundant information.** The list of example therapies is repeated, which makes the text longer than necessary.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** In the 'What did we find?' section, you write: \"The studies looked at psychological treatments (like talking therapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques)...\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** This list of examples is already clearly stated in the 'Key messages'. You can make the results section more concise by removing it. Consider combining the first two sentences like this: \"We found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with inflammatory bowel disease. These studies compared psychological therapies to usual care or no therapy.\"\n\n3.  **Make the currency statement more direct.** The final sentence is grammatically correct but could be phrased more actively.\n    *   **Problematic Text:** \"This review includes evidence found up to May 2023.\"\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** A more standard and active phrasing would be: \"The evidence in this review is up to date to May 2023.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour summary's structure is excellent, with short sentences and good use of active voice. The linguistic analysis did flag a high number of long and complex words (`long_words` and `complex_words_dc` are in the P90 range). The suggestions above, especially standardizing your terminology and removing repetition, will help simplify the language and improve overall readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 11 of 18 metrics (61.1%) in the best quartile for readability. Strengths include excellent sentence length (18.1 words/sentence) and strong use of active voice. However, the draft deviates from typical patterns on vocabulary complexity, with both `complex_words_dc` (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words) and `long_words` falling in the P90 range. This suggests an opportunity to simplify word choices to better align with typical PLS standards."
