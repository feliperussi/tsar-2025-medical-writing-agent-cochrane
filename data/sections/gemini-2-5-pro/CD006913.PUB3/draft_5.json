  "draft": "Can psychological therapies, such as talking therapy, help people with inflammatory bowel disease (a long-term condition where the gut becomes inflamed)?\n\nKey messages\n- For adults with inflammatory bowel disease, psychological therapies (such as talking therapy, education, and relaxation) are likely to slightly improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety. For children and adolescents, a specific type of talking therapy (called psychotherapy) probably also improves quality of life. These therapies may have little to no effect on the inflammation of the gut (disease activity). The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The studies included in the review were very different from each other, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. More research is needed to find out which types of psychological therapies are most helpful and to understand their effects over a longer period of time.\n\nWhat is the link between inflammatory bowel disease and mental health?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a long-term condition where the gut becomes inflamed, causing symptoms like pain and diarrhoea. Living with IBD can be challenging and stressful, and people with the condition have a higher risk of developing mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. The relationship may go both ways: the stress of the disease can affect a person's mood, and their feelings might also affect their physical symptoms. Because of this link, psychological therapies such as talking therapies, educational programs, and relaxation techniques have been used to support people with IBD. However, previous studies have not agreed on how well they work.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if psychological therapies are effective for children and adults with IBD. Specifically, we looked at whether these therapies improved people's quality of life, their feelings (such as anxiety and depression), and how serious their IBD symptoms were (known as 'disease activity').\n\nHow did we carry out this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychological therapies with no treatment or other types of care for people with inflammatory bowel disease. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with inflammatory bowel disease (6111 adults and 294 children and adolescents). These studies compared psychological therapies to usual care or no therapy.\n\nFor adults, psychological therapies (like talking therapy, education, and relaxation) probably increase quality of life slightly and probably reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety slightly. For children and adolescents, a specific type of talking therapy (called psychotherapy) probably increases their quality of life. The evidence suggests that psychological therapies may make little to no difference to disease activity.\n\nHow certain is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate. This is because in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced their answers about their symptoms. Also, the studies used different ways of providing the therapies, and some were very small.\n\nThis review includes evidence found up to May 2023.",

I am recommending a few minor revisions to enhance readability and make the language even more accessible for a lay audience. My suggestions focus on simplifying some of the vocabulary, as flagged by the linguistic analysis.\n\nHere are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Replace formal phrases with simpler, everyday words.** This makes the text feel more direct and less academic.\n    - **Quote:** \"How did we carry out this review?\"\n    - **Problem:** The phrase \"carry out\" is slightly formal and wordy.\n    - **Suggestion:** Replace it with a simpler verb, such as: \"How did we do this review?\"\n\n2. **Use more common, patient-friendly terminology.** When possible, choose words that patients themselves would use.\n    - **Quote:** \"The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\"\n    - **Problem:** While technically correct, this phrase is clinical. The term \"side effects\" is much more familiar to a general audience.\n    - **Suggestion:** Consider rewriting this as: \"The studies did not report any side effects from the therapies.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the impact of study limitations.** Explain *how* a limitation affects the results in simple terms.\n    - **Quote:** \"...people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced their answers about their symptoms.\"\n    - **Problem:** The phrase \"influenced their answers\" is a bit vague. It's clearer to state directly that this could lead to bias.\n    - **Suggestion:** A more direct explanation would be: \"...This knowledge might have biased how they reported their symptoms.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with excellent sentence length and use of active voice. However, two vocabulary metrics, 'complex_words_dc' (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words) and 'long_words', are in the P90 range. This indicates the text uses more long or less common words than 75-90% of typical summaries, supporting the editorial recommendation to simplify some of the vocabulary."
