  "draft": "Can psychological therapies, such as talking therapy, help people with inflammatory bowel disease (a long-term condition where the gut becomes inflamed)?\n\nKey messages\n- For adults with inflammatory bowel disease, psychological therapies (such as talking therapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques) are likely to slightly improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety. For children and adolescents, talking therapy probably also improves quality of life. These therapies may have little to no effect on the inflammation of the gut (disease activity). The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The studies included in the review were very different from each other, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. More research is needed to find out which types of psychological therapies are most helpful and to understand their effects over a longer period of time.\n\nWhat is the link between inflammatory bowel disease and mental health?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a long-term condition where the gut becomes inflamed, causing symptoms like pain and diarrhoea. Living with IBD can be challenging and stressful, and people with the condition have a higher risk of developing mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. The relationship may go both ways: the stress of the disease can affect a person's mood, and their emotional state might also influence their physical symptoms. Because of this link, psychological therapies such as talking therapies, educational programs, and relaxation techniques have been used to support people with IBD. However, previous studies have shown inconsistent results about how well they work.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if psychological therapies are effective for children and adults with IBD. Specifically, we looked at whether these therapies improved people's quality of life, their emotional state (such as anxiety and depression), and the severity of their IBD symptoms (known as 'disease activity').\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychological therapies with no treatment or other types of care for people with inflammatory bowel disease. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with inflammatory bowel disease (6111 adults and 294 children and adolescents). These studies compared psychological therapies to usual care or no therapy. For adults with inflammatory bowel disease, psychological therapies probably increase quality of life slightly and probably reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety slightly. For children and adolescents, talking therapy probably increases their quality of life. The evidence suggests that psychological therapies may make little to no difference to disease activity.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about several factors. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies used different ways of delivering the therapies, and some of the studies were very small.\n\nThe evidence in this review is up to date to May 2023.",

However, it is not approved because it contains a pattern of unnecessarily complex and long words that make it harder to read than necessary. Addressing the 3 improvements below will make the summary much clearer for a lay audience.\n\n1. **Replace complex words with simpler alternatives.** The summary uses more long and complex words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This can make sentences feel dense and harder to understand.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about several factors.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"concerns about several factors\" is abstract and wordy.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We have moderate confidence in the evidence for several reasons.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the relationship between different therapies.** the results section switches from the broad term \"psychological therapies\" for adults to the specific \"talking therapy\" for children without explanation. This could confuse readers about what was studied.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"For adults with inflammatory bowel disease, psychological therapies probably increase quality of life slightly... For children and adolescents, talking therapy probably increases their quality of life.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** It's unclear if \"talking therapy\" is a type of \"psychological therapy\" or something different. The original abstract specifies \"multimodular psychotherapy\" for children, which the writer has simplified.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"For adults, psychological therapies (like talking therapy, education, and relaxation) probably increase quality of life slightly... For children and adolescents, a specific type of talking therapy (called psychotherapy) probably also increases their quality of life.\"\n\n3. **Improve the phrasing of the currency statement.** The final sentence is grammatically awkward.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence in this review is up to date to May 2023.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"up to date to\" is not standard English and sounds unnatural.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This review includes evidence found up to May 2023.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 12 of 18 metrics (66.7%) falling within the best quartile. The sentence structure is excellent, with low sentence length and passive voice. However, the analysis identified a pattern of deviation in vocabulary complexity. Two metrics, `complex_words_dc` (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words) and `long_words`, are in the P90 range, indicating the text uses more complex and long words than is typical for a PLS. This supports the editorial feedback to simplify vocabulary for better readability."
