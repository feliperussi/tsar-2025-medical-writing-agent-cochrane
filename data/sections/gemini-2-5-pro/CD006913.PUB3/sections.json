  "key_messages": [
    "For adults with inflammatory bowel disease, psychological therapies (such as talking therapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques) are likely to slightly improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety. For children and adolescents, talking therapy probably also improves quality of life. These therapies may have little to no effect on the inflammation of the gut (disease activity). The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.",
    "The studies included in the review were very different from each other, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. More research is needed to find out which types of psychological therapies are most helpful and to understand their effects over a longer period of time."

      "subheading": "What is the link between inflammatory bowel disease and mental health?",
      "content": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a long-term condition where the gut becomes inflamed, causing symptoms like pain and diarrhoea. Living with IBD can be challenging and stressful, and people with the condition have a higher risk of developing mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. The relationship may go both ways: the stress of the disease can affect a person's mood, and their emotional state might also influence their physical symptoms. Because of this link, psychological treatments like talking therapies, educational programs, and relaxation techniques have been used to support people with IBD. However, previous studies have shown inconsistent results about how well they work."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if psychological treatments are effective for children and adults with IBD. Specifically, we looked at whether these interventions improved people's quality of life, their emotional state (such as anxiety and depression), and the severity of their IBD symptoms (known as 'disease activity')."

      "content": "We searched for studies that compared psychological treatments with no treatment or other types of care for people with inflammatory bowel disease. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with inflammatory bowel disease (6111 adults and 294 children and adolescents). The studies evaluated psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques, compared against no therapy or usual care. For adults with inflammatory bowel disease, psychological interventions probably increase quality of life slightly and probably reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety slightly. For children and adolescents, psychotherapy probably increases their quality of life. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may make little to no difference to disease activity."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about several factors. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies used different ways of delivering the interventions, and some of the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search."
