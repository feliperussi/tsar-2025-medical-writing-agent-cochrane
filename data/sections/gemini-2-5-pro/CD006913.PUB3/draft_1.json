  "draft": "Can psychological therapies, such as talking therapy, help people with inflammatory bowel disease (a long-term condition where the gut becomes inflamed)?\n\nKey messages\n- For adults with inflammatory bowel disease, psychological therapies (such as talking therapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques) are likely to slightly improve quality of life, depression, and anxiety. For children and adolescents, talking therapy probably also improves quality of life. These therapies may have little to no effect on the inflammation of the gut (disease activity). The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The studies included in the review were very different from each other, which makes it difficult to be certain about the results. More research is needed to find out which types of psychological therapies are most helpful and to understand their effects over a longer period of time.\n\nWhat is this review about?\nWhat is the link between inflammatory bowel disease and mental health?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a long-term condition where the gut becomes inflamed, causing symptoms like pain and diarrhoea. Living with IBD can be challenging and stressful, and people with the condition have a higher risk of developing mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. The relationship may go both ways: the stress of the disease can affect a person's mood, and their emotional state might also influence their physical symptoms. Because of this link, psychological treatments like talking therapies, educational programs, and relaxation techniques have been used to support people with IBD. However, previous studies have shown inconsistent results about how well they work.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if psychological treatments are effective for children and adults with IBD. Specifically, we looked at whether these interventions improved people's quality of life, their emotional state (such as anxiety and depression), and the severity of their IBD symptoms (known as 'disease activity').\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared psychological treatments with no treatment or other types of care for people with inflammatory bowel disease. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 6405 people with inflammatory bowel disease (6111 adults and 294 children and adolescents). The studies evaluated psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques, compared against no therapy or usual care. For adults with inflammatory bowel disease, psychological interventions probably increase quality of life slightly and probably reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety slightly. For children and adolescents, psychotherapy probably increases their quality of life. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may make little to no difference to disease activity.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about several factors. It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies used different ways of delivering the interventions, and some of the studies were very small.\n\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search.",

However, it is not approved because it does not fully meet our style guide requirements and contains some language that could be clearer for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** Our style guide requires subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. Two of your subheadings are not currently in question format.\n   - **Problem:** \"Methods\" and \"Limitations of the evidence\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Change \"Methods\" to \"How did we conduct this review?\" and change \"Limitations of the evidence\" to \"How reliable is this evidence?\"\n\n2. **Simplify some technical and formal language.** While generally clear, some word choices are more complex than necessary for a plain language summary. Replacing them with everyday words will improve readability.\n   - **Problem:** \"The studies evaluated psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques, compared against no therapy or usual care.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"The studies looked at psychological treatments (like talking therapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques) and compared them to usual care or no therapy.\"\n\n3. **Improve the phrasing**\n   - **Problem:** \"The evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"This review includes evidence found up to May 2023.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 67% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and structure. However, two vocabulary metrics show significant deviation: 'complex_words_dc' (unfamiliar words) and 'long_words' are in the P90 range. This indicates the text uses more complex and long words than is typical for a PLS, supporting the editorial recommendation to simplify some vocabulary."
