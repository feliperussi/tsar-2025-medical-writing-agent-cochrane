  "draft": "Can bowel prep and antibiotics before planned bowel surgery reduce complications?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having planned bowel surgery, using laxatives with oral antibiotics probably reduces complications like wound infections and bowel leakage, compared to using laxatives alone.\n- We are uncertain if this combined approach is better than taking antibiotics alone or no preparation at all, because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\n- We need more studies to compare different bowel preparation methods and to better understand their potential side effects.\n\nWhat is bowel preparation for colorectal surgery?\nColorectal surgery is an operation on the large bowel (the colon and rectum). Because the large bowel naturally contains many bacteria, this surgery is more likely to cause problems than other abdominal operations. The most serious problems are infections in the surgical wound (called surgical site infections) and leaks from where the surgeon reconnects the bowel. To prevent these problems, surgeons may clean out the bowel before they operate. This is called 'bowel preparation'.\n\nSurgeons prepare the bowel in two main ways. They can use laxatives to empty the bowel; this is called a 'mechanical bowel preparation' or 'bowel cleanse'. They can also give antibiotics by mouth to reduce bacteria (oral antibiotics). Sometimes, surgeons use both methods together.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if combining laxatives with oral antibiotics helps prevent problems after planned colorectal surgery. We compared this combined method to three other approaches: laxatives alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies in adults having planned bowel surgery. The studies compared using laxatives with oral antibiotics against other methods or no preparation. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nWe found 21 studies that included 5264 adults having planned bowel surgery for both cancerous and non-cancerous reasons. The studies compared the combined preparation (laxatives plus oral antibiotics) against three other approaches: laxatives alone (17 studies), oral antibiotics alone (3 studies), or no bowel preparation (1 study). We found very little information on side effects. Only 4 studies reported on them. None of these recorded specific problems like dehydration or imbalances in the body's essential minerals (called electrolyte imbalances).\n\nCompared to using only laxatives, using both laxatives and oral antibiotics probably makes wound infections and leakage from the reconnected bowel less likely. This combined approach probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who die after surgery or how long they stay in the hospital. It may also make little to no difference in how quickly the bowel starts working again after surgery.\n\nWe are uncertain if the combined approach is different from using oral antibiotics alone or from using no bowel preparation at all. This is because the evidence for these comparisons is of low or very low certainty.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. We had some concerns about how the studies were conducted. For example, in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. Also, not all studies provided data on all the outcomes we were interested in. The studies also used different ways of giving the treatments. For some questions, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex sentences by breaking them into shorter ones.** Long sentences with multiple ideas can be hard to follow.\n   - **Original:** 'None of these recorded specific problems like dehydration or imbalances in the body's essential minerals (called electrolyte imbalances).'\n   - **Problem:** This sentence combines several distinct concepts, making it dense and difficult to process.\n   - **Suggestion:** 'The studies gave little information on side effects. For example, they did not report on problems like dehydration or imbalances in the body's essential minerals (electrolytes).'\n\n2. **Replace formal or complex words with simpler alternatives.** The text uses more long and uncommon words than is typical for a plain language summary, making it harder to read.\n   - **Original:** 'The most serious problems are infections in the surgical wound (called surgical site infections) and leaks from where the surgeon reconnects the bowel.'\n   - **Problem:** The phrasing is clinical and wordy.\n   - **Suggestion:** 'The most serious problems are wound infections (called 'surgical site infections') and leaks from where the surgeon rejoined the bowel.'\n\n3. **Use more active and direct language.** The summary has a high number of passive sentences, which can make the text feel indirect and harder to understand.\n   - **Original:** 'We had some concerns about how the studies were conducted.'\n   - **Problem:** The passive voice ('were conducted') obscures who performed the action. The style guide requires active voice.\n   - **Suggestion:** 'We had some concerns about how researchers conducted the studies.'\n\nAddressing these points will help align the text with plain language best practices. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing higher-than-usual rates of passive voice, nominalizations, and complex words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and some readability scores are good (in the best quartile), the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence structure. Seven metrics fall into the P90 range, indicating higher-than-usual complexity. Key areas for review are the high number of passive voice constructions (19), nominalizations (25), complex words (130), and long words (192), which contribute to a high SMOG index (14.3)."
