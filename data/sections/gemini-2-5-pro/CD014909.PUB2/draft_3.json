  "draft": "Can bowel prep and antibiotics before planned bowel surgery reduce complications?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having planned bowel surgery, using a bowel cleanse (laxatives) with oral antibiotics probably reduces the risk of complications like wound infections and bowel leakage, compared to using a bowel cleanse alone.\n- We are uncertain if this combined approach is better than taking antibiotics alone or no preparation at all, because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\n- We need more studies to compare different bowel preparation methods and to better understand their potential side effects.\n\nWhat is bowel preparation for colorectal surgery?\nColorectal surgery is an operation on the large bowel (the colon and rectum). The large bowel naturally contains many bacteria, so this surgery has a higher risk of problems than other abdominal operations. The most serious problems are infections where you had surgery (surgical site infections) and leaks from where the surgeon re-joined your bowel (anastomotic leakage). To prevent these problems, surgeons may clean out the bowel before they operate. This is called 'bowel preparation'.\n\nSurgeons prepare the bowel in two main ways. They can use laxatives to physically empty the bowel; this is called a 'bowel cleanse' (mechanical bowel preparation). They can also give antibiotics by mouth to reduce bacteria (oral antibiotics). Sometimes, surgeons use both methods together.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if combining a bowel cleanse with oral antibiotics helps prevent problems after planned colorectal surgery. We compared this combined method to three other approaches: a bowel cleanse alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies in adults having planned bowel surgery. The studies compared using a bowel cleanse with oral antibiotics against other methods or no preparation. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that included a total of 5264 adults. These adults were having planned colorectal surgery for both cancerous and non-cancerous reasons. The studies compared the combined bowel preparation (a bowel cleanse plus oral antibiotics) against three other approaches. These were: a bowel cleanse alone (17 studies), oral antibiotics alone (3 studies), or no bowel preparation (1 study). We found very little information on side effects. Only 4 studies reported on them. None of these recorded specific problems like dehydration or imbalances in body salts (electrolyte imbalances).\n\nWhat did the review find?\nCompared to using only a bowel cleanse, using both a bowel cleanse and oral antibiotics probably reduces wound infections and leakage from the re-joined bowel.\nThis combined approach probably makes little to no difference in the number of people who die after surgery or how long they stay in the hospital. It may also make little to no difference in the bowel taking time to start working again after surgery.\nWe are uncertain if the combined approach is different from using oral antibiotics alone or from using no bowel preparation at all. This is because the evidence for these comparisons is of low or very low certainty.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. This is because we had concerns about how some studies were conducted. For example, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, not all studies provided data on all the outcomes we were interested in. The studies also used different ways of giving the treatments. For some questions, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is accurate and well-structured. However, it can be made even clearer for readers by focusing on three areas. Here are my top suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify technical terms and explanations.** Some explanations are a bit dense and use complex words. Making these simpler will help readers grasp the key concepts more easily.\n    *   **Example:** 'The most serious problems are infections where you had surgery (surgical site infections) and leaks from where the surgeon re-joined your bowel (anastomotic leakage).'\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** This sentence introduces the complex term 'anastomotic leakage' without fully simplifying it. The high number of complex and long words in the draft (flagged by the SMOG index and complex word counts) can make sentences like this a barrier.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'The most serious problems are infections in the surgical wound (called surgical site infections) and leaks from where the surgeon joined the ends of the bowel back together (called anastomotic leakage).'\n\n2. **Use more direct verbs instead of nouns.** The draft often uses noun forms of verbs, which can make sentences less direct and harder to read. This is reflected in the high `nominalization` score.\n    *   **Example:** 'For people having planned bowel surgery, using a bowel cleanse (laxatives) with oral antibiotics probably reduces the risk of complications like wound infections and bowel leakage...'\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** Phrases like 'reduces the risk of complications' are slightly wordy. Using a more direct verb makes the message punchier.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'For people having planned bowel surgery, using a bowel cleanse (laxatives) with oral antibiotics probably makes complications like wound infections and bowel leakage less likely...'\n\n3. **Streamline the structure of the results section.** The results are currently split under two very similar subheadings, which could confuse readers.\n    *   **Example:** The draft has two back-to-back subheadings: 'What did we find?' and 'What did the review find?'.\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** This breaks the flow. The first section describes the studies found, and the second describes the results. A single, clear heading for the main findings would be better.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Combine these two sections under a single, more descriptive subheading like 'What are the main results of the review?'.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable in many respects, with 61% of features falling into the best quartile for PLS conformity (e.g., sentence length, readability scores). However, the analysis also highlights significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure. Six metrics are in the P90 range, indicating higher-than-usual complexity. These include `nominalization` (use of noun forms instead of verbs), `nouns`, `smog_index`, `complex_words`, and `long_words`, all of which suggest the text could be simplified by using more common words and direct verbs."
