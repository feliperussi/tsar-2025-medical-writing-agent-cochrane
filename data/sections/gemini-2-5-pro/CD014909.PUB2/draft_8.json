  "draft": "Can bowel prep and antibiotics before planned bowel surgery reduce complications?\n\nKey messages\n– For people having planned bowel surgery, combining laxatives with oral antibiotics probably reduces the risk of wound infections and bowel leakage compared to using laxatives alone. The review found little information on the side effects of this preparation.\n– We are uncertain if this combined approach is better than taking antibiotics alone or no preparation at all. This is because there was not enough good-quality evidence to be sure.\n– We need more studies to compare different bowel preparation methods and to better understand their potential side effects.\n\nWhat is bowel preparation for colorectal surgery?\nColorectal surgery is an operation on the large bowel (the colon and rectum). The large bowel naturally contains many bacteria. This means bowel surgery has a higher risk of problems than other operations on the belly. The most serious problems that can happen are infections in the surgical wound (which doctors call 'surgical site infections') and leaks from where the surgeon rejoined the bowel. To prevent these problems, surgeons may clean out the bowel before they operate. Surgeons call this 'bowel preparation'.\n\nSurgeons prepare the bowel in 2 main ways. One way is to use laxatives to empty the bowel. Surgeons call this 'mechanical bowel preparation' or a 'bowel cleanse'. Another way is to give antibiotics by mouth to reduce bacteria (oral antibiotics). Sometimes, surgeons use both methods together.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if combining laxatives with oral antibiotics helps prevent problems after planned colorectal surgery. We compared this combined method to 3 other approaches: laxatives alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies in adults having planned bowel surgery. The studies compared using laxatives with oral antibiotics against other methods or no preparation. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nWe found 21 studies that included 5264 adults having planned bowel surgery for both cancerous and non-cancerous reasons. The studies compared the combined preparation (laxatives plus oral antibiotics) against 3 other approaches:\n– laxatives alone (17 studies)\n– oral antibiotics alone (3 studies)\n– no bowel preparation (1 study)\n\nThe studies gave little information on side effects. For example, only 4 studies reported on them. They did not report on specific problems like dehydration or if the body's salts and minerals (electrolytes) were out of balance.\n\nCompared to using only laxatives, combining them with oral antibiotics probably makes wound infections and leakage from the rejoined bowel less likely. This combined approach probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who die after surgery or how long they stay in the hospital. It may also make little to no difference in how quickly the bowel starts working again after surgery.\n\nWe are uncertain if the combined approach is different from using oral antibiotics alone or from using no bowel preparation at all. This is because the evidence for these comparisons is of low or very low certainty.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. We had some concerns about how researchers conducted the studies. For example, in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. Also, not all studies provided data on all the outcomes we were interested in. The studies used different ways of giving the treatments, and for some questions, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify and Standardize Terminology:** The summary introduces multiple terms for the same concept (e.g., 'laxatives', 'mechanical bowel preparation', 'bowel cleanse'), which can be confusing. It's better to define the technical term once and then stick to the simplest version.\n   - **INSTEAD OF:** \"Surgeons call this 'mechanical bowel preparation' or a 'bowel cleanse'.\"\n   - **SUGGESTION:** \"One way is to use laxatives to empty the bowel (which doctors call 'mechanical bowel preparation'). Then, use the simpler term \"laxatives\" consistently throughout the rest of the text.\"\n\n2. **Use More Direct Verbs Instead of Nouns:** The text often uses noun forms of verbs ('nominalizations'), which makes sentences less direct and harder to read. Rewriting these sentences with active verbs will make them clearer.\n   - **INSTEAD OF:** \"This combined approach probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who die after surgery...\"\n   - **SUGGESTION:** \"This combined approach probably does not change how many people die after surgery...\"\n   - **INSTEAD OF:** \"The most serious problems that can happen are infections in the surgical wound... and leaks from where the surgeon rejoined the bowel.\"\n   - **SUGGESTION:** \"The most serious problems are wounds getting infected... and the re-joined bowel leaking.\"\n\n3. **Replace Complex and Formal Language:** Some phrases are unnecessarily complex or formal for a plain language summary. Choosing simpler, more common words will make the text more accessible.\n   - **INSTEAD OF:** \"...if the body's salts and minerals (electrolytes) were out of balance.\"\n   - **SUGGESTION:** \"...an imbalance of the body's salts and minerals (electrolytes).\"\n   - **INSTEAD OF:** \"We had some concerns about how researchers conducted the studies.\"\n   - **SUGGESTION:** \"We had some concerns about how the studies were done.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your own evaluation results support these suggestions. The text has a very high number of 'nominalizations' (noun-form verbs), and the scores for complex words, long words, and the SMOG index are all higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Addressing the points above will help bring these metrics into a more typical range and significantly improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. It performs well on structural metrics like sentence length (P25) and active voice (P75). However, it deviates significantly on vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics are in the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range, including `nominalization` (use of noun-form verbs), `nouns`, `smog_index` (readability based on complex words), `complex_words`, and `long_words`. This pattern indicates that while the sentence structure is simple, the word choice is more complex and less direct than is typical for this format, which could create a barrier for readers."
