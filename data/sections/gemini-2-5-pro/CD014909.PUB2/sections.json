  "key_messages": [
    "For people having planned bowel surgery, cleansing the bowel with laxatives combined with taking antibiotics by mouth probably reduces the risk of some complications (such as wound infections and leakage from the reconnected bowel) compared to only cleansing the bowel with laxatives. The review found little information on unwanted side effects of the bowel preparation itself.",
    "It remains unclear whether combining laxatives with antibiotics is better than taking antibiotics alone, or better than no bowel preparation at all, as there was not enough good-quality evidence to be certain.",
    "Future studies are needed to compare the different ways of preparing the bowel before surgery and to better understand the potential side effects of the preparations."

      "subheading": "What is bowel preparation for colorectal surgery?",
      "content": "Colorectal surgery is an operation on the large bowel (the colon and rectum). Because the large bowel naturally contains a lot of bacteria, this type of surgery has a higher risk of complications compared to other abdominal operations. The most serious complications are infections where the surgery was performed (called surgical site infections) and leaks from where the bowel was surgically re-joined (called anastomotic leakage). To try and prevent these problems, surgeons may clean out the bowel before an operation. This is called 'bowel preparation'. It can be done in two ways: using a substance to physically empty the bowel (mechanical bowel preparation) and giving antibiotics by mouth to reduce the number of bacteria (oral antibiotics). Sometimes these two methods are used together."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics is effective at preventing complications after planned colorectal surgery. We compared this combined approach with mechanical preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 21 studies with a total of 5264 adults undergoing planned colorectal surgery for both cancerous and non-cancerous reasons. The studies compared combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation against three different approaches: mechanical bowel preparation alone (17 studies), oral antibiotics alone (3 studies), or no bowel preparation (1 study). We found very little information on the side effects of the bowel preparations; only four studies reported on them and none recorded specific adverse effects like dehydration or electrolyte imbalances."

      "subheading": "Main results: combining a bowel washout with oral antibiotics compared to a bowel washout alone for people having planned bowel surgery",
      "content": "For people having planned bowel surgery, giving both a bowel washout (mechanical preparation) and oral antibiotics beforehand, compared to only a bowel washout, probably causes a large reduction in wound infections and in leakage from the newly joined section of the bowel. This combination probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who die after surgery or how long they stay in the hospital, and it may make little to no difference to the temporary paralysis of the bowel that can occur after surgery. It is unclear if using the combination of a bowel washout and oral antibiotics is any different from using oral antibiotics alone, or from using no bowel preparation at all, because the evidence is of low or very low certainty."

  ],
  "limitations": "Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about how the studies were conducted; it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies also used different ways of delivering the intervention, and for some questions, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to December 2021."
