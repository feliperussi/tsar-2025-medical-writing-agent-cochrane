  "draft": "Can bowel prep and antibiotics before planned bowel surgery reduce complications?\n\nKey messages\n– For people having planned bowel surgery, combining laxatives with oral antibiotics probably reduces the risk of wound infections and leakage from the re-joined bowel compared to using laxatives alone. The review found little information on the side effects of this preparation.\n– We are uncertain if this combined approach is better than taking antibiotics alone or no preparation at all, because there was not enough good-quality evidence to be sure.\n– We need more studies to compare different ways of preparing the bowel and to better understand their potential side effects.\n\nWhat is bowel preparation for colorectal surgery?\nColorectal surgery is an operation on the large bowel (the colon and rectum). The large bowel naturally contains many bacteria, so this type of surgery has a higher risk of problems than other belly operations. The most serious problems are the surgical wound getting infected (which doctors call a 'surgical site infection') and the re-joined bowel leaking. To prevent these problems, surgeons may clean out the bowel before they operate. This is called 'bowel preparation'.\n\nSurgeons prepare the bowel in 2 main ways. One way is to use laxatives to empty the bowel (which doctors call 'mechanical bowel preparation'). Another way is to give antibiotics by mouth (oral antibiotics) to reduce bacteria. Sometimes, surgeons use both methods together.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if combining laxatives with oral antibiotics helps prevent problems after planned colorectal surgery. We compared this combined method to 3 other approaches: laxatives alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies in adults having planned bowel surgery. The studies compared using laxatives with oral antibiotics against other methods or no preparation. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nWe found 21 studies that included 5264 adults having planned bowel surgery for both cancerous and non-cancerous reasons. The studies compared the combined preparation (laxatives plus oral antibiotics) against 3 other approaches:\n– laxatives alone (17 studies)\n– oral antibiotics alone (3 studies)\n– no bowel preparation (1 study)\n\nThe studies gave little information on side effects. For example, only 4 studies reported on them. They did not report on specific problems like dehydration or an imbalance of the body's salts and minerals (electrolytes).\n\nCompared to using only laxatives, combining them with oral antibiotics probably makes wound infections and leakage from the re-joined bowel less likely. This combined approach probably does not change how many people die after surgery or how long they stay in the hospital. It may also not change how quickly the bowel starts working again after surgery.\n\nWe are uncertain if the combined approach is different from using oral antibiotics alone or from using no bowel preparation at all. This is because the evidence for these comparisons is of low or very low certainty.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. We had some concerns about how the studies were done. For example, in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. Also, not all studies provided data on all the outcomes we were interested in. The studies used different ways of giving the treatments, and for some questions, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issue is that the vocabulary and sentence structures are often too complex and formal, which is reflected in the linguistic analysis showing high scores for complex words, long words, and nominalizations.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex phrasing.** Some sentences are grammatically correct but difficult to read quickly because they use roundabout phrasing or unnecessary jargon.\n   - **Example:** 'The most serious problems are the surgical wound getting infected (which doctors call a 'surgical site infection') and the re-joined bowel leaking.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is clunky. The explanation of the medical term can be integrated more smoothly.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'The most serious problems are infections in the surgical wound (called 'surgical site infections') and leaks from the re-joined bowel.'\n\n2. **Use verbs instead of noun forms (nominalizations).** The text often uses nouns to describe actions, which makes it feel more passive and academic. Using verbs makes the writing more direct.\n   - **Example:** 'We are uncertain if this combined approach is better than taking antibiotics alone or no preparation at all...'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The noun 'preparation' is less direct than the verb 'to prepare'.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'We are uncertain if this combined method is better than taking antibiotics alone or not preparing the bowel at all.'\n\n3. **Replace long, formal words with shorter, everyday alternatives.** The analysis shows a high number of long and complex words, which can make the text harder to understand.\n   - **Example:** 'Compared to using only laxatives, combining them with oral antibiotics probably makes wound infections and leakage from the re-joined bowel less likely.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase 'makes... less likely' is less direct than a simple verb like 'reduces'.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'Compared to using only laxatives, the combined method probably reduces wound infections and leaks from the re-joined bowel.'\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary significantly easier for patients and the public to read and understand. The linguistic analysis confirms these issues, with 7 out of 18 metrics, including `complex_words`, `long_words`, and `nominalization`, deviating significantly from typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows a mixed profile. The draft has excellent sentence-level readability, with short average sentence length (16 words) and high scores for readability indices like Flesch Reading Ease. However, it shows significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and word choice. Seven key metrics, including `complex_words` (P90), `long_words` (P90), `nominalization` (P90), and `smog_index` (P90), are in the highest 10th percentile, indicating the vocabulary is more complex and formal than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This suggests the main opportunity for improvement is to simplify word choices and use more direct, verb-oriented language."
