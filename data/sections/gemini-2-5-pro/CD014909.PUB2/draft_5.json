  "draft": "Can bowel prep and antibiotics before planned bowel surgery reduce complications?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having planned bowel surgery, using a bowel cleanse (laxatives) with oral antibiotics probably reduces complications like wound infections and bowel leakage, compared to using a bowel cleanse alone.\n- We are uncertain if this combined approach is better than taking antibiotics alone or no preparation at all, because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\n- We need more studies to compare different bowel preparation methods and to better understand their potential side effects.\n\nWhat is bowel preparation for colorectal surgery?\nColorectal surgery is an operation on the large bowel (the colon and rectum). Because the large bowel naturally contains many bacteria, this surgery is more likely to cause problems than other abdominal operations. The most serious problems are infections in the surgical wound (called surgical site infections) and leaks from where the surgeon re-joins the bowel. To prevent these problems, surgeons may clean out the bowel before they operate. This is called 'bowel preparation'.\n\nSurgeons prepare the bowel in two main ways. They can use laxatives to empty the bowel; this is called a 'bowel cleanse' (mechanical bowel preparation). They can also give antibiotics by mouth to reduce bacteria (oral antibiotics). Sometimes, surgeons use both methods together.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if combining a bowel cleanse with oral antibiotics helps prevent problems after planned colorectal surgery. We compared this combined method to three other approaches: a bowel cleanse alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies in adults having planned bowel surgery. The studies compared using a bowel cleanse with oral antibiotics against other methods or no preparation. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nWe found 21 studies that included 5264 adults having planned bowel surgery for both cancerous and non-cancerous reasons. The studies compared the combined bowel preparation (a bowel cleanse plus oral antibiotics) against three other approaches: a bowel cleanse alone (17 studies), oral antibiotics alone (3 studies), or no bowel preparation (1 study). We found very little information on side effects. Only 4 studies reported on them. None of these recorded specific problems like dehydration or imbalances in body salts (electrolyte imbalances).\n\nCompared to using only a bowel cleanse, using both a bowel cleanse and oral antibiotics probably makes wound infections and leakage from the re-joined bowel less likely. This combined approach probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who die after surgery or how long they stay in the hospital. It may also make little to no difference to the bowel starting to work again after surgery.\n\nWe are uncertain if the combined approach is different from using oral antibiotics alone or from using no bowel preparation at all. This is because the evidence for these comparisons is of low or very low certainty.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. We had some concerns about how the studies were conducted. For example, in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. Also, not all studies provided data on all the outcomes we were interested in. The studies also used different ways of giving the treatments. For some questions, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it is not approved because several clarity issues could confuse a lay reader. Addressing the following 3 points will make the summary much easier to understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Simplify complex vocabulary and explanations.**\nSome words and phrases are still too technical for a general audience. Simplifying them will improve readability.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"None of these recorded specific problems like dehydration or imbalances in body salts (electrolyte imbalances).\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The term \"body salts\" is an unusual and potentially confusing simplification of \"electrolytes.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"None of these recorded specific problems like dehydration or imbalances in the body's essential minerals (called electrolyte imbalances).\"\n\n**2. Use consistent and simple terminology for key concepts.**\nThe summary uses multiple terms for the same procedure (bowel cleanse, laxatives, mechanical bowel preparation), which can be confusing. It's better to define the term once and then stick to the simplest version.\n\n- **Problematic phrases:** In the Key Messages, you use \"bowel cleanse (laxatives)\". In the introduction, you use \"'bowel cleanse' (mechanical bowel preparation)\".\n- **Why it's a problem:** Switching between terms forces the reader to remember that they all mean the same thing.\n- **Suggested rewrite:**\n    - In the introduction, define it clearly: \"They can use **laxatives** to empty the bowel; this is called a 'mechanical bowel preparation' or 'bowel cleanse'.\"\n    - Then, use only the simplest term, **\"laxatives,\"** throughout the rest of the summary. For example: \"...using **laxatives** with oral antibiotics probably reduces complications... compared to using **laxatives** alone.\"\n\n**3. Rephrase wordy and noun-heavy sentences to be more direct.**\nSome sentences are built around nouns instead of action verbs, which makes them less direct and harder to follow.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"It may also make little to no difference to the bowel starting to work again after surgery.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrasing is indirect and clunky.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"It may also make little to no difference in how quickly the bowel starts working again after surgery.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of complex words, long words, and noun-based phrases (nominalizations) compared to typical Plain Language Summaries.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While many readability scores are good (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade is in the best 25% of PLS texts), several key metrics deviate significantly. Seven features, including `complex_words` (119), `long_words` (188), `nominalization` (25), and `passive_voice` (19), are in the P90 range. This indicates the vocabulary is more complex and the sentence structures are less direct than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, supporting the need for simplification."
