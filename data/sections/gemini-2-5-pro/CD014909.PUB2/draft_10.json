  "draft": "Can bowel prep and antibiotics before planned bowel surgery reduce complications?\n\nKey messages\n– For people having planned bowel surgery, using laxatives with oral antibiotics probably reduces wound infections and leaks from the re-joined bowel compared to using laxatives alone. The review found little information on the side effects of this method.\n– We are uncertain if this combined method is better than taking antibiotics alone or not preparing the bowel at all, because there was not enough good-quality evidence to be sure.\n– We need more studies to compare different ways of preparing the bowel and to better understand their potential side effects.\n\nWhat is bowel preparation for colorectal surgery?\nColorectal surgery is an operation on the large bowel (the colon and rectum). The large bowel naturally contains many bacteria, so this type of surgery has a higher risk of problems than other operations on the belly. The most serious problems are infections in the surgical wound (called a 'surgical site infection') and leaks from the re-joined bowel. To prevent these problems, surgeons may clean the bowel before an operation. This is called 'bowel preparation'.\n\nSurgeons prepare the bowel in 2 main ways. One way is to use laxatives to empty the bowel (called 'mechanical bowel preparation'). Another way is to give antibiotics by mouth (oral antibiotics) to reduce the number of bacteria. Sometimes, surgeons use both methods together.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using laxatives with oral antibiotics helps prevent problems after planned colorectal surgery. We compared this combined method to 3 other approaches: using laxatives alone, using oral antibiotics alone, or not preparing the bowel at all.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies in adults having planned bowel surgery. The studies compared using laxatives with oral antibiotics against other methods or no preparation at all. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nWe found 21 studies that included 5264 adults having planned bowel surgery for both cancerous and non-cancerous reasons. The studies compared the combined method (laxatives plus oral antibiotics) against 3 other approaches:\n– laxatives alone (17 studies)\n– oral antibiotics alone (3 studies)\n– no bowel preparation (1 study)\n\nThe studies gave little information on side effects. For example, only 4 studies reported on them. They did not report on specific problems like dehydration or an imbalance of the body's salts and minerals (electrolytes).\n\nCompared to using only laxatives, the combined method probably reduces wound infections and leaks from the re-joined bowel. This combined method probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who die after surgery or how long they stay in the hospital. It may also make little to no difference to how quickly the bowel starts working again after surgery.\n\nWe are uncertain if the combined method is different from using oral antibiotics alone or from not preparing the bowel at all. This is because the evidence for these comparisons is of low or very low certainty.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. We had some concerns about how the studies were done. For example, in some studies, the people involved may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. Also, not all studies provided data on all the outcomes we were interested in. The studies used different ways of preparing the bowel, and for some questions, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it can be made much easier for patients to read by addressing three key areas. The high number of complex words and passive sentences identified in the linguistic analysis makes the text denser than it needs to be. Here are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\n\n1. **Simplify complex descriptions and technical terms.** Some explanations, while accurate, are too wordy for a lay audience. Simplifying them will improve clarity.\n   - **Quote:** \"The most serious problems are infections in the surgical wound (called a 'surgical site infection') and leaks from the re-joined bowel.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is long and introduces a formal technical term ('surgical site infection') that isn't necessary for understanding.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The main risks are infections in the wound and leaks where the bowel was re-joined.\"\n\n2. **Use more direct, active language.** The draft has a high number of passive constructions, which can make sentences feel indirect and harder to follow. Changing these to active voice makes the text more engaging.\n   - **Quote:** \"We had some concerns about how the studies were done. For example, in some studies, the people involved may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrasing \"how the studies were done\" is passive, and the second sentence is wordy. This makes the limitations harder to grasp quickly.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We have moderate confidence in the evidence because of some concerns with how the studies were run. For example, in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\"\n\n3. **Make key messages more concise.** The key messages are the most important part of the summary. They should be as clear and direct as possible.\n   - **Quote:** \"For people having planned bowel surgery, using laxatives with oral antibiotics probably reduces wound infections and leaks from the re-joined bowel compared to using laxatives alone.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is 26 words long and the comparison at the end makes it a bit clunky to read.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Using laxatives with oral antibiotics before planned bowel surgery probably reduces wound infections and bowel leaks better than using laxatives alone.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your draft has good sentence length, but the linguistic analysis shows it deviates from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and structure. It has a high number of complex words (125), passive voice constructions (22), and nominalizations (24), which supports the need for the edits above.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and overall readability scores are good (most in the best quartile), the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence structure. Seven key metrics, including passive voice (22 instances), nominalization (24 instances), complex words (125), and the SMOG index (13.91), are in the P90 range, indicating the text is more complex and uses more passive constructions than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
