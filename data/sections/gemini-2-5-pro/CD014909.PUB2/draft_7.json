  "draft": "Can bowel prep and antibiotics before planned bowel surgery reduce complications?\n\nKey messages\n– For people having planned bowel surgery, using laxatives with oral antibiotics probably reduces complications like wound infections and bowel leakage, compared to using laxatives alone. The review found little information on the side effects of the bowel preparation itself.\n– We are uncertain if this combined approach is better than taking antibiotics alone or no preparation at all. This is because there was not enough good-quality evidence to be sure.\n– We need more studies to compare different bowel preparation methods and to better understand their potential side effects.\n\nWhat is bowel preparation for colorectal surgery?\nColorectal surgery is an operation on the large bowel (the colon and rectum). The large bowel naturally contains many bacteria. This means bowel surgery has a higher risk of problems than other operations on the belly. The most serious problems are wound infections (called 'surgical site infections') and leaks from where the surgeon rejoined the bowel. To prevent these problems, surgeons may clean out the bowel before they operate. This is called 'bowel preparation'.\n\nSurgeons prepare the bowel in two main ways. One way is to use laxatives to empty the bowel. This is called 'mechanical bowel preparation' or a 'bowel cleanse'. Another way is to give antibiotics by mouth to reduce bacteria (oral antibiotics). Sometimes, surgeons use both methods together.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if combining laxatives with oral antibiotics helps prevent problems after planned colorectal surgery. We compared this combined method to three other approaches: laxatives alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies in adults having planned bowel surgery. The studies compared using laxatives with oral antibiotics against other methods or no preparation. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nWe found 21 studies that included 5264 adults having planned bowel surgery for both cancerous and non-cancerous reasons. The studies compared the combined preparation (laxatives plus oral antibiotics) against three other approaches:\n– laxatives alone (17 studies)\n– oral antibiotics alone (3 studies)\n– no bowel preparation (1 study)\n\nThe studies gave little information on side effects. For example, only 4 studies reported on them. They did not report on specific problems like dehydration or imbalances in the body's essential minerals (electrolytes).\n\nCompared to using only laxatives, using both laxatives and oral antibiotics probably makes wound infections and leakage from the rejoined bowel less likely. This combined approach probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who die after surgery or how long they stay in the hospital. It may also make little to no difference in how quickly the bowel starts working again after surgery.\n\nWe are uncertain if the combined approach is different from using oral antibiotics alone or from using no bowel preparation at all. This is because the evidence for these comparisons is of low or very low certainty.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. We had some concerns about how researchers conducted the studies. For example, in some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. Also, not all studies provided data on all the outcomes we were interested in. The studies used different ways of giving the treatments, and for some questions, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for completeness, accuracy, and length. However, it can be made significantly clearer for a lay audience by focusing on three key areas before approval.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Simplify Complex and Technical Language:** Some phrases are still too technical for a general audience, which can make the text difficult to understand.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"They did not report on specific problems like dehydration or imbalances in the body's essential minerals (electrolytes).\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"imbalances in the body's essential minerals\" is abstract and clinical. A more concrete description would be easier for readers to grasp.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"They did not report on specific problems like dehydration or if the body's salts and minerals (electrolytes) were out of balance.\"\n\n2.  **Replace Abstract Nouns with Active Verbs:** The text often uses nouns to describe actions (this is called nominalization), which can make sentences feel dense and less direct. Converting these back into verbs will make the summary easier to read.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"The most serious problems are wound infections (called 'surgical site infections') and leaks from where the surgeon rejoined the bowel.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** This sentence is built around abstract nouns ('problems', 'infections', 'leaks'). Phrasing it more actively makes it more direct and easier to follow.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The most serious problems that can happen are infections in the surgical wound (which doctors call 'surgical site infections') and leaks from where the surgeon rejoined the bowel.\"\n\n3.  **Use Active Voice Consistently:** The draft sometimes uses the passive voice, which can make it unclear who is performing an action. Switching to active voice makes the writing more direct and engaging, as recommended by the style guide.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"This is called 'bowel preparation'.\"\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** This passive construction is less direct than the active voice.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Surgeons call this 'bowel preparation'.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of complex words, long words, and nominalizations compared to typical Plain Language Summaries. Addressing these points will significantly improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While readability scores like sentence length and Flesch-Kincaid grade are good (in the best quartile), the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics, including `complex_words`, `long_words`, `nominalization`, and `smog_index`, are in the P90 range, indicating the text is more complex and noun-heavy than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
