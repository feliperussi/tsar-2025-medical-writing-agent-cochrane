  "draft": "Can bowel prep and antibiotics before planned bowel surgery reduce complications?\n\nKey messages\n- Combining a bowel cleanse with oral antibiotics before planned bowel surgery probably reduces the risk of complications like wound infections and bowel leakage, compared to only cleansing the bowel.\n- We are uncertain if this combined approach is better than taking antibiotics alone or no preparation at all, because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\n- We need more studies to compare different bowel preparation methods and to better understand their potential side effects.\n\nWhat is bowel preparation for colorectal surgery?\nColorectal surgery is an operation on the large bowel (the colon and rectum). The large bowel naturally contains many bacteria, so this surgery has a higher risk of complications than other abdominal operations. The most serious complications are infections at the surgical site (surgical site infections) and leaks from where the surgeon re-joined the bowel (anastomotic leakage). To prevent these problems, surgeons may clean out the bowel before an operation. This is called 'bowel preparation'. Surgeons prepare the bowel in two ways. They can use a substance to physically empty the bowel (mechanical bowel preparation). They can also give antibiotics by mouth to reduce bacteria (oral antibiotics). Sometimes, surgeons use both methods together.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics helps prevent complications after planned colorectal surgery. We compared this combined method to three other approaches: mechanical preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies in adults having planned bowel surgery. The studies compared combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation with other methods or no preparation. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies that included a total of 5264 adults. These adults were having planned colorectal surgery for both cancerous and non-cancerous reasons. The studies compared the combined bowel preparation against three other approaches. These were: mechanical bowel preparation alone (17 studies), oral antibiotics alone (3 studies), or no bowel preparation (1 study). We found very little information on side effects. Only 4 studies reported on them. None of these recorded specific problems like dehydration or imbalances in body salts (electrolyte imbalances).\n\nWhat are the main results?\nCompared to only a bowel washout (mechanical preparation), using both a bowel washout and oral antibiotics probably reduces wound infections and leakage from the re-joined bowel. This combined approach probably makes little to no difference in the number of people who die after surgery or how long they stay in the hospital. It may also make little to no difference to the temporary paralysis of the bowel that can happen after surgery.\n\nWe are uncertain if the combined approach is different from using oral antibiotics alone or from using no bowel preparation at all. This is because the evidence for these comparisons is of low or very low certainty.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. This is because we had concerns about how some studies were conducted. For example, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, not all studies provided data on all the outcomes we were interested in. The studies also used different ways of giving the treatments. For some questions, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it is not approved because the language is often too technical and noun-heavy for a lay audience. The feedback below focuses on simplifying word choices and sentence structures to make the key messages more accessible.\n\n### Critical Issues\n\n*   **Subheading Format:** One subheading does not follow the style guide requirement to be a question.\n    *   **Quote:** \"What are the main results?\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Please rephrase this as a question, for example: \"What are the main results of the review?\"\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Simplify Noun-Heavy Sentences to Be More Direct**\n\nYour sentences rely heavily on nouns instead of active verbs, which can make them dense and difficult to read. This is often caused by 'nominalization' (turning a verb into a noun, e.g., \"operation\" instead of \"operate\").\n\n*   **Quote:** \"The most serious complications are infections at the surgical site (surgical site infections) and leaks from where the surgeon re-joined the bowel (anastomotic leakage). To prevent these problems, surgeons may clean out the bowel before an operation. This is called 'bowel preparation'.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This passage uses many abstract nouns like \"complications,\" \"infections,\" and \"preparation.\" Rewriting with more direct verbs makes the text more engaging and easier to follow.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The most serious problems are infections where you had surgery and leaks from where the surgeon re-joined your bowel. To prevent this, surgeons may clean out your bowel before they operate. This is called 'bowel preparation'.\"\n\n**2. Replace Technical Terms with Simpler, Everyday Language**\n\nSome of the vocabulary, while technically correct, may be unfamiliar or alarming to patients.\n\n*   **Quote:** \"It may also make little to no difference to the temporary paralysis of the bowel that can happen after surgery.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The word \"paralysis\" can sound frightening and may not accurately convey the temporary nature of the condition (postoperative ileus) to a lay reader.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"It may also make little to no difference in the bowel taking time to start working again after surgery.\"\n\n**3. Use Consistent, Simple Terminology**\n\nThe summary uses several different terms for the same concept, which can cause confusion.\n\n*   **Quote:** The text uses \"bowel cleanse,\" \"bowel washout,\" \"mechanical bowel preparation,\" and \"mechanical preparation\" to refer to the same procedure.\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Readers may wonder if these are different procedures. Using one consistent, simple term after the initial definition improves clarity.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** After defining 'mechanical bowel preparation', choose one simple term like \"bowel cleanse\" and use it consistently. For example: \"Compared to only a **bowel cleanse**, using both a **bowel cleanse** and oral antibiotics probably reduces wound infections...\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The summary shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence-level metrics like length and readability are good (most in the best 25th percentile), the vocabulary is significantly more complex than is typical for a PLS. Metrics for nominalization (BEYOND_P90), complex words (P90), long words (P90), and the SMOG index (P90) all indicate that the word choice is too technical and noun-heavy, which can make the text difficult for a lay audience to understand."
