  "draft": "Can bowel prep and antibiotics before planned bowel surgery reduce complications?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having planned bowel surgery, cleansing the bowel with laxatives combined with taking antibiotics by mouth probably reduces the risk of some complications (such as wound infections and leakage from the reconnected bowel) compared to only cleansing the bowel with laxatives. The review found little information on unwanted side effects of the bowel preparation itself.\n- It remains unclear whether combining laxatives with antibiotics is better than taking antibiotics alone, or better than no bowel preparation at all, as there was not enough good-quality evidence to be certain.\n- Future studies are needed to compare the different ways of preparing the bowel before surgery and to better understand the potential side effects of the preparations.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is bowel preparation for colorectal surgery?\nColorectal surgery is an operation on the large bowel (the colon and rectum). Because the large bowel naturally contains a lot of bacteria, this type of surgery has a higher risk of complications compared to other abdominal operations. The most serious complications are infections where the surgery was performed (called surgical site infections) and leaks from where the bowel was surgically re-joined (called anastomotic leakage). To try and prevent these problems, surgeons may clean out the bowel before an operation. This is called 'bowel preparation'. It can be done in two ways: using a substance to physically empty the bowel (mechanical bowel preparation) and giving antibiotics by mouth to reduce the number of bacteria (oral antibiotics). Sometimes these two methods are used together.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if combining mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics is effective at preventing complications after planned colorectal surgery. We compared this combined approach with mechanical preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation with other preparation methods or no preparation in adults having planned bowel surgery. We then combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 21 studies with a total of 5264 adults undergoing planned colorectal surgery for both cancerous and non-cancerous reasons. The studies compared combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation against three different approaches: mechanical bowel preparation alone (17 studies), oral antibiotics alone (3 studies), or no bowel preparation (1 study). We found very little information on the side effects of the bowel preparations; only four studies reported on them and none recorded specific adverse effects like dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.\nMain results: combining a bowel washout with oral antibiotics compared to a bowel washout alone for people having planned bowel surgery\nFor people having planned bowel surgery, giving both a bowel washout (mechanical preparation) and oral antibiotics beforehand, compared to only a bowel washout, probably causes a large reduction in wound infections and in leakage from the newly joined section of the bowel. This combination probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who die after surgery or how long they stay in the hospital, and it may make little to no difference to the temporary paralysis of the bowel that can occur after surgery. It is unclear if using the combination of a bowel washout and oral antibiotics is any different from using oral antibiotics alone, or from using no bowel preparation at all, because the evidence is of low or very low certainty.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about how the studies were conducted; it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies also used different ways of delivering the intervention, and for some questions, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

Additionally, the text is difficult for a lay audience to read due to long sentences, extensive use of passive voice, and complex vocabulary, as confirmed by the linguistic analysis.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. Several are currently statements.\n   - **Problematic Headings:** \"Methods\", \"Main results...\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\".\n   - **Suggested Rewrites:**\n     - \"Methods\" → \"How did we conduct this review?\"\n     - \"Limitations of the evidence\" → \"How reliable is this evidence?\"\n     - \"Currency of the evidence\" → \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n2. **Break up long, complex sentences.** Many sentences are over 30 words long, making them difficult to follow. This is reflected in the high average words-per-sentence metric (24.9).\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about how the studies were conducted; it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is moderate. This is because we had concerns about how some studies were conducted. For example, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, not all studies reported on the outcomes we were interested in.\"\n\n3. **Use active voice instead of passive voice.** The summary relies heavily on passive constructions, which can make the text feel abstract and unclear. The analysis found 31 instances of passive voice, which is unusually high.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"The most serious complications are infections where the surgery was performed (called surgical site infections) and leaks from where the bowel was surgically re-joined (called anastomotic leakage).\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The most serious complications are infections at the surgical site (surgical site infections) and leaks from where the surgeon re-joined the bowel (anastomotic leakage).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns. Readability is poor, with a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 15.3 (P90) and a low Flesch Reading Ease score of 29.7 (P10). This is driven by several structural issues that fall outside the 90th percentile: very high use of passive voice (31 instances), nominalizations (40 instances), complex/long words, and long sentences (average 24.9 words)."
