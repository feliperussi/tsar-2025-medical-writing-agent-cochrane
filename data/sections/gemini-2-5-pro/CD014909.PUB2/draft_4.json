  "draft": "Can bowel prep and antibiotics before planned bowel surgery reduce complications?\n\nKey messages\n- For people having planned bowel surgery, using a bowel cleanse (laxatives) with oral antibiotics probably makes complications like wound infections and bowel leakage less likely, compared to using a bowel cleanse alone.\n- We are uncertain if this combined approach is better than taking antibiotics alone or no preparation at all, because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\n- We need more studies to compare different bowel preparation methods and to better understand their potential side effects.\n\nWhat is bowel preparation for colorectal surgery?\nColorectal surgery is an operation on the large bowel (the colon and rectum). The large bowel naturally contains many bacteria, so this surgery has a higher risk of problems than other abdominal operations. The most serious problems are infections in the surgical wound (called surgical site infections) and leaks from where the surgeon joined the ends of the bowel back together (called anastomotic leakage). To prevent these problems, surgeons may clean out the bowel before they operate. This is called 'bowel preparation'.\n\nSurgeons prepare the bowel in two main ways. They can use laxatives to empty the bowel; this is called a 'bowel cleanse' (mechanical bowel preparation). They can also give antibiotics by mouth to reduce bacteria (oral antibiotics). Sometimes, surgeons use both methods together.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if combining a bowel cleanse with oral antibiotics helps prevent problems after planned colorectal surgery. We compared this combined method to three other approaches: a bowel cleanse alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies in adults having planned bowel surgery. The studies compared using a bowel cleanse with oral antibiotics against other methods or no preparation. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nWe found 21 studies that included 5264 adults having planned bowel surgery for both cancerous and non-cancerous reasons. The studies compared the combined bowel preparation (a bowel cleanse plus oral antibiotics) against three other approaches: a bowel cleanse alone (17 studies), oral antibiotics alone (3 studies), or no bowel preparation (1 study). We found very little information on side effects. Only 4 studies reported on them. None of these recorded specific problems like dehydration or imbalances in body salts (electrolyte imbalances).\n\nCompared to using only a bowel cleanse, using both a bowel cleanse and oral antibiotics probably makes wound infections and leakage from the re-joined bowel less likely. This combined approach probably makes little to no difference to the number of people who die after surgery or how long they stay in the hospital. It may also make little to no difference to the bowel starting to work again after surgery.\n\nWe are uncertain if the combined approach is different from using oral antibiotics alone or from using no bowel preparation at all. This is because the evidence for these comparisons is of low or very low certainty.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate. This is because we had concerns about how some studies were conducted. For example, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Also, not all studies provided data on all the outcomes we were interested in. The studies also used different ways of giving the treatments. For some questions, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis evidence is up to date to December 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and factual accuracy have passed. However, the text could be made even easier for a lay audience to understand by focusing on three key areas. The goal of these suggestions is to refine the vocabulary and sentence structure to better align with plain language principles.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Words and Phrases**\n\nSome sentences contain technical terms or phrasing that could be simpler, even when a definition is provided. Simplifying the language will help readers grasp the concepts more quickly.\n\n- **Original Text:** \"The most serious problems are infections in the surgical wound (called surgical site infections) and leaks from where the surgeon joined the ends of the bowel back together (called anastomotic leakage).\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The core sentence is long and contains the technical term \"anastomotic leakage.\" While you define it, the sentence itself could be more direct.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The most serious problems are infections in the surgical wound and leaks from where the surgeon re-joins the bowel.\"\n\n**2. Use More Direct Verbs (Reduce Nominalizations)**\n\nThe text sometimes uses noun phrases where a strong verb would be more direct. Changing these \"noun-heavy\" sentences to be more action-oriented makes them easier to read.\n\n- **Original Text:** \"The large bowel naturally contains many bacteria, so this surgery has a higher risk of problems than other abdominal operations.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"has a higher risk of problems\" is less direct and engaging than a simple verb.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Because the large bowel naturally contains many bacteria, this surgery is more likely to cause problems than other abdominal operations.\"\n\n**3. Clarify the Impact of Study Limitations**\n\nThe section on evidence reliability is good, but could be more explicit about *why* certain study methods are a concern for the reader.\n\n- **Original Text:** \"This is because we had concerns about how some studies were conducted. For example, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is a bit vague. Explaining that knowing the treatment can influence the results helps the reader understand the impact of this limitation.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We had some concerns about the methods used in the studies. For example, in some studies people may have known which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results.\"\n\nBy addressing these points, you can make an already good summary even more accessible to patients and the public.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While many readability and structural metrics fall within the best quartile (55.6% of features), a significant number (38.9%) deviate from typical patterns. Specifically, 7 metrics are in the P90 range, indicating higher-than-usual complexity. These include high counts of passive voice, nominalizations, nouns, complex words, and long words. This suggests that while the summary is generally readable, its vocabulary and sentence structures are more complex than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, supporting the editorial recommendation to simplify word choices and use more direct verbs."
