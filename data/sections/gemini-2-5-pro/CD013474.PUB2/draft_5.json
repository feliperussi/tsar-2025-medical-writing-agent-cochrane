  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, maintenance therapy may delay the cancer from getting worse. However, this treatment does not seem to help people live longer overall and may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n- The evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the overall benefits and harms of maintenance therapy. Future studies are needed, particularly to study newer treatments that were not covered in this review.\n\nWhat is maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Initial treatments can put the cancer into remission (a period where cancer signs and symptoms have lessened or disappeared), but CLL is currently incurable and often returns. After each course of treatment, the time before the cancer gets worse can become shorter. After a successful first therapy, some people have 'maintenance therapy'. This ongoing treatment aims to keep the cancer in remission and prevent it from returning. Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people with regular check-ups but not give them treatment. However, we do not fully know the benefits and harms of using maintenance therapies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies for people with CLL. We compared these treatments to observation or a placebo (a dummy treatment) to see if they helped people live longer, delayed the cancer from getting worse, and what unwanted side effects they caused.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance). These studies compared maintenance therapies with observation or a placebo. We then combined the results from the studies and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that included 2393 people with CLL. The people in the studies were 54 to 72 years old on average, and most were men. Some had early-stage cancer, while others had more advanced cancer. The studies followed people for an average of 1 to 6 years. The studies looked at several maintenance drugs, including rituximab, ofatumumab, lenalidomide, and alemtuzumab. We did not find any studies that looked at newer targeted drug treatments.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people with CLL, we found that while some maintenance therapies may delay the disease from getting worse, they do not seem to help people live longer and may cause more unwanted effects.\n\nMaintenance therapy with drugs like rituximab, ofatumumab, and lenalidomide probably delays the disease from getting worse. However, these therapies probably make little to no difference to how long people live and may increase serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor another drug, alemtuzumab, it is unclear if it delays the disease from getting worse. The studies did not provide information on how long people lived, their quality of life, or unwanted effects with this treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons. The studies included different types of people, and some studies were very small. There were not enough studies for us to be certain about all the results. It is also possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. Finally, not all studies reported on the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

The key messages are easy to understand, and all critical checks for completeness, accuracy, and formatting have passed. The feedback below is intended to refine an already strong draft by making the language even more direct and active for the reader.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n**1. Replace Noun-Heavy Phrases with Stronger Verbs**\nSome sentences rely on abstract nouns where a direct verb would be more concise and easier for readers to process. This makes the text less active.\n- **Original:** \"The studies did not provide information on how long people lived, their quality of life, or unwanted effects with this treatment.\"\n- **Suggestion:** \"The studies did not report on how long people lived, their quality of life, or unwanted effects with this treatment.\"\n\n**2. Simplify Definitions and Complex Terms**\nThe definition: \"...remission (a period where cancer signs and symptoms have lessened or disappeared)...\" can be simplified.\n- **Original:** \"...remission (a period where cancer signs and symptoms have lessened or disappeared)...\"\n- **Suggestion:** \"...remission (a time when signs of cancer are reduced or gone)...\"\n\n**3. Use More Precise Language for Certainty of Evidence**\nThe summary uses general phrases like \"it is unclear,\" which could be more specific.\n- **Original:** \"For another drug, alemtuzumab, it is unclear if it delays the disease from getting worse.\"\n- **Suggestion:** \"For another drug, alemtuzumab, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it delays the disease from getting worse.\"\n\nMaking these small adjustments will address a pattern of noun-heavy language and wordiness, making an already good summary even clearer for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns in most areas, with 13 of 18 metrics (72%) falling in the best quartile. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (8.62) are excellent. However, the analysis identified significant deviations from typical patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure. Specifically, the metric for 'nominalization' (using nouns instead of verbs) is beyond the 90th percentile, and metrics for 'nouns', 'long_words', and 'complex_words_dc' are also in the 90th percentile range. This data supports the editorial feedback to focus on using more direct verbs and simplifying complex phrasing."
