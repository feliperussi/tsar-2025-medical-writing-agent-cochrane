  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, maintenance therapy may delay the cancer from getting worse. However, this treatment does not seem to help people live longer overall and may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n- The evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the overall benefits and harms of maintenance therapy. Future studies are needed, particularly to evaluate newer treatments that were not covered in this review.\n\nWhat is maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Initial treatments can put the cancer into remission (a time when signs of cancer are reduced or gone), but CLL is currently incurable and often returns. After each course of treatment, the time before the cancer gets worse can become shorter. After a successful first therapy, some people have 'maintenance therapy'. This ongoing treatment aims to keep the cancer in remission and prevent it from returning. Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people with regular check-ups but not give them treatment. However, we do not fully know the benefits and harms of using maintenance therapies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies for people with CLL. We compared these treatments to observation or a placebo (a dummy treatment) to see if they helped people live longer, delayed the cancer from getting worse, and what unwanted side effects they caused.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance). These studies compared maintenance therapies with observation or a placebo. We then combined the results from the studies and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that included 2393 people with CLL. The people in the studies were 54 to 72 years old on average, and most were men. Some had early-stage cancer, while others had more advanced cancer. The studies followed people for an average of 1 to 6 years. The studies looked at several maintenance drugs, including rituximab, ofatumumab, lenalidomide, and alemtuzumab. We did not find any studies that looked at newer targeted drug treatments.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people with CLL, we found that while some maintenance therapies may delay the disease from getting worse, they do not seem to help people live longer and may cause more unwanted effects.\n\nMaintenance therapy with drugs like rituximab, ofatumumab, and lenalidomide probably delays the disease from getting worse. However, these therapies probably make little to no difference to how long people live and may increase serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor another drug, alemtuzumab, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it delays the disease from getting worse. The studies did not report on how long people lived, their quality of life, or unwanted effects with this treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons. The studies included different types of people, and some studies were very small. There were not enough studies for us to be certain about all the results. It is also possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. Finally, not all studies reported on the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it is not yet approved because several key areas need improvement to make the text clearer and more direct for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\n\n1. **Replace 'noun-heavy' phrases with direct verbs.**\nThe text often uses noun forms of verbs, which makes sentences longer and less direct. Using simple, active verbs will make it easier for readers to understand.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people with regular check-ups but not give them treatment.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"give them treatment\" is indirect. A direct verb is stronger and more concise.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people with regular check-ups but not treat them.\"\n\n2. **Clarify and specify the main results.**\nThe main results section currently groups different drug types together, which may be confusing for readers trying to understand the effects of specific treatments.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Maintenance therapy with drugs like rituximab, ofatumumab, and lenalidomide probably delays the disease from getting worse.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This sentence combines two different classes of drugs (anti-CD20 antibodies and an immunomodulatory drug). It is clearer to present the results for each drug type separately, as was done in the original abstract.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Therapy with anti-CD20 drugs (rituximab or ofatumumab) probably delays the disease from getting worse. Similarly, therapy with the drug lenalidomide probably delays the disease from getting worse. However, neither therapy seems to help people live longer and both may increase serious unwanted effects.\"\n\n3. **Use consistent terminology for side effects.**\nThe draft uses several different terms for adverse events, which could confuse readers.\n- **Problematic terms:** The draft uses \"unwanted effects,\" \"unwanted side effects,\" and \"serious unwanted effects.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** Using different terms for the same concept can make readers wonder if they mean different things. It's best to choose one standard term for general adverse events and another for serious ones and use them consistently.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We recommend using 'unwanted effects' for all general side effects and 'serious unwanted effects' for grade 3/4 events throughout the summary. For example, change 'what unwanted side effects they caused' to 'what unwanted effects they caused.'\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, particularly in readability and sentence structure, with 72% of features in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary, with a 'BEYOND_P90' rating for nominalization (32 instances) and 'P90' ratings for total nouns, Dale-Chall complex words, and long words. These metrics support the editorial feedback, indicating that the language could be more direct and use simpler, more active phrasing to better align with plain language principles."
