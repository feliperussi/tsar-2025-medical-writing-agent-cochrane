  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, maintenance therapy may delay the cancer from getting worse. However, this treatment does not seem to help people live longer overall and may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n- The evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the overall benefits and harms of maintenance therapy. Future studies are needed, particularly to evaluate newer types of treatments that were not covered in this review.\n\nWhat is maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Initial treatments can put the cancer into remission (a period where the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or have disappeared), but CLL is currently incurable and often returns. After each course of treatment, the time before the cancer gets worse can become shorter. After a successful first therapy, some people have 'maintenance therapy'. This ongoing treatment aims to keep the cancer in remission and prevent it from returning. Instead of maintenance therapy, people can have regular medical check-ups without active treatment, which is known as 'observation'. However, we do not fully know the benefits and harms of using maintenance therapies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the effects and safety of different types of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. We compared these treatments against observation or a placebo (a dummy treatment) to see if they helped people live longer, extended the time before the cancer got worse, and to understand any unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance). These studies compared maintenance therapies with observation or a placebo. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies with 2393 people with CLL. On average, people in the studies were 54 to 72 years old, and most were men. Some had early-stage cancer, while others had more advanced cancer. The studies followed people for 1 to 6 years on average. The studies looked at several maintenance drugs, including rituximab, ofatumumab, lenalidomide, and alemtuzumab. We did not find any studies that looked at newer types of targeted drug treatments.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people with CLL, we found that while some maintenance therapies may delay the disease from getting worse, they do not seem to help people live longer and may cause more unwanted effects.\n\nMaintenance therapy with the drugs rituximab and ofatumumab probably delays the disease from getting worse. The drug lenalidomide probably has the same effect. However, both of these types of therapy probably make little to no difference to how long people live and may increase serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor a third drug, alemtuzumab, it is unclear if it affects how long it takes for the disease to get worse. We found no information from the studies on how long people lived, their quality of life, or unwanted effects with this treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and some of the studies were very small. There are not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

The feedback below is intended to refine an already strong draft to make it even more direct and easier for readers to understand.\n\nThe main opportunity for improvement is to make the language more active by replacing abstract nouns with direct verbs. This will address a pattern of 'nominalization' that makes some sentences less engaging.\n\nHere are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.**\n   - **Quote:** \"Instead of maintenance therapy, people can have regular medical check-ups without active treatment, which is known as 'observation'.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"is known as 'observation'\" is passive and uses a noun to describe an action. Using a direct verb makes the sentence simpler and more active.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can observe people with regular check-ups but without active treatment.\"\n\n2. **Make definitions more concise.**\n   - **Quote:** \"...remission (a period where the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or have disappeared)\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This definition is a bit wordy. It can be shortened without losing its meaning, which helps maintain reader focus.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...remission (a period where cancer signs and symptoms have lessened or disappeared)\"\n\n3. **Improve the flow when presenting results for different treatments.**\n   - **Quote:** \"Maintenance therapy with the drugs rituximab and ofatumumab probably delays the disease from getting worse. The drug lenalidomide probably has the same effect.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Presenting these similar results in two separate sentences is slightly repetitive and breaks the flow. Combining them makes the key finding easier to grasp.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Maintenance therapy with drugs like rituximab, ofatumumab, and lenalidomide probably delays the disease from getting worse.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, four metrics deviate from the typical range, most notably 'nominalization' (the use of noun-form verbs), which is rated 'BEYOND_P90'. This suggests a consistent pattern of using abstract nouns instead of direct verbs, which can make the text less engaging. The counts for 'nouns', 'long_words', and Dale-Chall 'complex_words' are also higher than typical (P90), indicating that simplifying some vocabulary and sentence structures would further improve readability."
