  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, maintenance therapy may delay the cancer from getting worse. However, this treatment does not seem to help people live longer overall and may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n- The evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the overall benefits and harms of maintenance therapy. Future studies are needed, particularly to evaluate newer treatments that were not covered in this review.\n\nWhat is maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Initial treatments can put the cancer into remission (a time when signs of cancer are reduced or gone), but CLL is currently incurable and often returns. After each course of treatment, the time before the cancer gets worse can become shorter. After a successful first therapy, some people have 'maintenance therapy'. This ongoing treatment aims to keep the cancer in remission and prevent it from returning. Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people with regular check-ups but not treat them. However, we do not fully know the benefits and harms of using maintenance therapies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies for people with CLL. We compared these treatments to observation or a placebo (a dummy treatment) to see if they helped people live longer, delayed the cancer from getting worse, and what unwanted effects they caused.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance). These studies compared maintenance therapies with observation or a placebo. We then combined the results from the studies and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that included 2393 people with CLL. The people in the studies were 54 to 72 years old on average, and most were men. Some had early-stage cancer, while others had more advanced cancer. The studies followed people for an average of 1 to 6 years. The studies looked at several maintenance drugs, including rituximab, ofatumumab, lenalidomide, and alemtuzumab. We did not find any studies that looked at newer targeted drug treatments.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people with CLL, we found that while some maintenance therapies may delay the disease from getting worse, they do not seem to help people live longer and may cause more unwanted effects.\n\nTherapy with anti-CD20 drugs (rituximab or ofatumumab) probably delays the disease from getting worse. Similarly, therapy with the drug lenalidomide probably delays the disease from getting worse. However, neither therapy seems to help people live longer and both may increase serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor another drug, alemtuzumab, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it delays the disease from getting worse. The studies did not report on how long people lived, their quality of life, or unwanted effects with this treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons. The studies included different types of people, and some studies were very small. There were not enough studies for us to be certain about all the results. It is also possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. Finally, not all studies reported on the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-structured and clear, but it is NOT_APPROVED due to a factual error and several opportunities to improve clarity for readers. Here are the 4 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct the Factual Error Regarding Age:** The draft misrepresents a key demographic detail.\n    - **Problem:** You wrote, 'The people in the studies were 54 to 72 years old on average...'\n    - **Why it's an issue:** The original review specifies a *median* age range, which is different from an average. Using the wrong term is factually incorrect.\n    - **Suggestion:** Please rewrite this to be accurate and clear for a lay audience. For example: 'The people in the studies were typically between 54 and 72 years old...'\n\n2. **Make Sentences More Active and Less Noun-Heavy:** The summary relies heavily on nouns instead of verbs, which can make it less direct. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a very high number of 'nominalizations' (verbs turned into nouns).\n    - **Problem:** 'After each course of treatment, the time before the cancer gets worse can become shorter.'\n    - **Why it's an issue:** This phrasing is passive and a bit wordy. Using a direct verb makes the point more clearly.\n    - **Suggestion:** Try a more active construction, like: 'After each treatment, the cancer may return more quickly.'\n\n3. **Vary Repetitive Phrasing in the Results:** The key finding is repeated using the exact same words, which can be monotonous for the reader.\n    - **Problem:** The phrase 'delays the disease from getting worse' is used three times in quick succession in the 'Main results' section.\n    - **Why it's an issue:** Varying the language makes the text more engaging and can also add subtle clarity.\n    - **Suggestion:** Consider using alternatives like 'slows the cancer's progress' or 'extends the time before the cancer returns' to make the section flow better.\n\n4. **Improve the Structure of the 'Limitations' Section:** The limitations are presented as a block of text, which is harder to read than a list.\n    - **Problem:** 'We have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons. The studies included different types of people, and some studies were very small...'\n    - **Why it's an issue:** This format forces the reader to process each limitation as part of a dense paragraph. A list is much easier to scan and understand.\n    - **Suggestion:** Please format this section as a bulleted list using dashes, as per the style guide. For example: 'We have limited confidence in the evidence because: - the studies were often small and included different types of people; - it's possible people knew which treatment they were getting...'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 72% of metrics in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates significantly in its use of nominalization (noun-form verbs), which is beyond the 90th percentile. It also shows higher-than-typical counts for total nouns, long words, and complex words (Dale-Chall). These metrics support the editorial feedback that the language could be more direct, active, and use simpler vocabulary to enhance clarity."
