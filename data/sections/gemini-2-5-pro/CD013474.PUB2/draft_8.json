  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, maintenance therapy may delay the cancer from getting worse. However, this treatment does not seem to help people live longer overall and may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n- The evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the overall benefits and harms of maintenance therapy. Future studies are needed, particularly to evaluate newer treatments that were not covered in this review.\n\nWhat is maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Initial treatments can put the cancer into remission (a time when signs of cancer are reduced or gone), but CLL is currently incurable and often returns. After each treatment, the cancer may return more quickly. Some people have 'maintenance therapy' after a successful first therapy. This ongoing treatment aims to keep the cancer in remission and prevent it from returning. Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people with regular check-ups but not treat them. However, we do not fully know the benefits and harms of using maintenance therapies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies for people with CLL. We compared these treatments to observation or a placebo (a dummy treatment) to see if they helped people live longer, delayed the cancer from getting worse, and what unwanted effects they caused.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance). These studies compared maintenance therapies with observation or a placebo. We then combined the results from the studies and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that included 2393 people with CLL. The people in the studies were typically between 54 and 72 years old, and most were men. Some had early-stage cancer, while others had more advanced cancer. The studies followed people for an average of 1 to 6 years. The studies looked at several maintenance drugs, including rituximab, ofatumumab, lenalidomide, and alemtuzumab. We did not find any studies that looked at newer targeted drug treatments.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people with CLL, we found that while some maintenance therapies may slow the cancer's progress, they do not seem to help people live longer and may cause more unwanted effects.\n\nTherapy with anti-CD20 drugs (rituximab or ofatumumab) probably extends the time before the cancer returns. Similarly, therapy with the drug lenalidomide probably delays the cancer from getting worse. However, neither therapy seems to help people live longer and both may increase serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor another drug, alemtuzumab, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it slows the cancer's progress. The studies did not report on how long people lived, their quality of life, or unwanted effects with this treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons:\n- The studies included different types of people and some were very small.\n- There were not enough studies for us to be certain about all the results.\n- It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting.\n- Not all studies reported on the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

The readability scores are excellent. I have three suggestions to make it even more direct and easier for readers to digest, focusing on simplifying sentence structure and using more active verbs.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n**1. Simplify the presentation of drug names in the results.**\n\n*   **The issue:** The current paragraph introduces several complex drug names in long sentences, which can be dense for readers.\n*   **Original text:** \"Therapy with anti-CD20 drugs (rituximab or ofatumumab) probably extends the time before the cancer returns. Similarly, therapy with the drug lenalidomide probably delays the cancer from getting worse.\"\n*   **Suggestion:** Use a bulleted list to break up this information, making it easier to scan and understand.\n    *   **Rewrite:** \"We found that two types of therapy probably delay the cancer from getting worse:\n        - Anti-CD20 drugs (rituximab or ofatumumab)\n        - The immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide\"\n\n**2. Use more direct and active language in the limitations section.**\n\n*   **The issue:** The explanation for potential bias is a bit indirect and formal.\n*   **Original text:** \"It is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting.\"\n*   **Suggestion:** Rephrase this more directly to help the reader understand why this is a limitation.\n    *   **Rewrite:** \"In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting. This could have influenced the results, as knowing you are on an active treatment can affect how you report your well-being.\"\n\n**3. Replace noun-heavy phrases with verbs to make sentences more active.**\n\n*   **The issue:** The draft has a high number of 'nominalizations' (verbs turned into nouns), which can make sentences feel passive and wordy.\n*   **Original text:** \"Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people with regular check-ups but not treat them.\"\n*   **Suggestion:** Using a verb is more direct and active.\n    *   **Rewrite:** \"Instead of giving maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people by checking them regularly.\"\n\nThese changes will help address the patterns identified in the linguistic analysis, which showed the text was denser with nouns and complex words than a typical PLS. Addressing these points will make an already good summary even better.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS draft shows strong overall readability, with 72% of metrics falling within the best quartile for PLS texts. However, it deviates from typical patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure. Specifically, the rates of nominalization (29.0), total nouns (167.0), complex words (238.0), and long words (178.0) are higher than usual (in the P90 range or beyond). This suggests the text, while having a good grade-level score, may feel dense and overly formal to a lay reader."
