  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow), maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) may delay the cancer from getting worse. However, this treatment does not seem to help people live longer overall and may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n- The evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the overall benefits and harms of maintenance therapy. Future studies are needed, particularly to evaluate newer types of treatments that were not covered in this review.\n\nWhat is maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Although initial treatments can put the cancer into remission (a period where signs and symptoms of the cancer are reduced or have disappeared), CLL is currently incurable and often returns. After each course of treatment, the time before the cancer progresses can become shorter. 'Maintenance therapy' is an ongoing treatment used after an initial, successful therapy. Its goal is to keep the cancer in remission for longer and delay its return. The alternative to maintenance therapy is regular medical check-ups without active treatment, known as 'observation'. However, the benefits and harms of using maintenance therapies are not fully known.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the effects and safety of different types of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. We compared these treatments against observation or a placebo (a dummy treatment) to see if they helped people live longer, extended the time before the cancer got worse, and to understand any unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared maintenance therapies with observation or a placebo. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that included 2393 people with CLL. On average, people in the studies were between 54 and 72 years old, and most were men. Some had early-stage cancer, while others had more advanced cancer. The studies followed people for an average of 1 to 6 years. The studies looked at different types of maintenance therapies. These included drugs called anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab or ofatumumab), immunomodulatory drugs (lenalidomide), and anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies (alemtuzumab). We did not find any studies that looked at certain newer types of targeted drug treatments.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people with CLL, we found that while some maintenance therapies can delay the disease from getting worse, they do not seem to help people live longer and may cause more unwanted effects.\n\nTwo types of maintenance therapy probably delay the disease from getting worse. These are a group of drugs called anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (such as rituximab) and an immunomodulatory drug (lenalidomide). However, both therapies probably make little to no difference to how long people live and may increase serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor a third type of therapy, an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody (alemtuzumab), it is unclear if it affects how long it takes for the disease to get worse. We found no information from the studies on how long people lived, their quality of life, or unwanted effects with this treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and some of the studies were very small. There are not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it needs revision to be clearer for a lay audience. The main issues are an over-reliance on complex nouns instead of simple verbs, and some unnecessarily technical language that makes the text dense and harder to read. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing that while sentences are a good length, the vocabulary is more complex than in a typical PLS.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace complex nouns with simple verbs to make sentences more direct.** The text frequently uses 'nominalizations' (verbs turned into nouns like 'treatment' or 'return' instead of 'treat' or 'returns'), which can make sentences feel abstract and less active. The analysis confirms this is the biggest deviation from a typical PLS style.\n\n   - **Problem:** \"'Maintenance therapy' is an ongoing treatment used after an initial, successful therapy. Its goal is to keep the cancer in remission for longer and delay its return.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase using more active verbs. For example: \"After a successful first therapy, some people have 'maintenance therapy'. This ongoing treatment aims to keep the cancer in remission and prevent it from returning.\"\n\n2. **Simplify technical drug categories.** The long, technical names for drug classes are difficult for readers to understand and remember. Focusing on the specific drug names is more helpful for a lay audience.\n\n   - **Problem:** \"These included drugs called anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab or ofatumumab), immunomodulatory drugs (lenalidomide), and anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies (alemtuzumab).\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Remove the complex categories from the main sentence. For example: \"The studies looked at several maintenance drugs, including rituximab, ofatumumab, lenalidomide, and alemtuzumab.\"\n\n3. **Avoid repeating definitions in the Key Messages.** The Key Messages should be as clear and concise as possible. Repeating long definitions from the title makes them harder to scan and absorb quickly.\n\n   - **Problem:** \"For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow), maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) may delay the cancer from getting worse.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Remove the parenthetical definitions, as the reader just saw them in the title. You can define the terms in the main body of the text. For example: \"For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, maintenance therapy may delay the cancer from getting worse.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word count limit and has good sentence-level readability scores, with most indices falling in the best quartile for clarity. However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary and sentence structure. The use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90), and the counts for nouns, complex words, and long words are also in the highest 10% of the corpus (P90 range). This suggests that while sentences are short, the word choice is overly complex and the style is not direct enough for a lay audience."
