  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, maintenance therapy may delay the cancer from getting worse. However, this treatment does not seem to help people live longer overall and may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n- The evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the overall benefits and harms of maintenance therapy. Future studies are needed, particularly to evaluate newer treatments that were not covered in this review.\n\nWhat is maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Initial treatments can put the cancer into remission (a time when signs of cancer are reduced or gone), but CLL is currently incurable and often returns. After each treatment, the cancer may return more quickly. Some people have 'maintenance therapy' after a successful first therapy. This ongoing treatment aims to keep the cancer in remission and prevent it from returning. Instead of giving maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people by checking them regularly. However, we do not fully know the benefits and harms of using maintenance therapies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies for people with CLL. We compared these treatments to observation or a placebo (a dummy treatment) to see if they helped people live longer, delayed the cancer from getting worse, and what unwanted effects they caused.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance). These studies compared maintenance therapies with observation or a placebo. We then combined the results from the studies and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that included 2393 people with CLL. The people in the studies were typically between 54 and 72 years old, and most were men. Some had early-stage cancer, while others had more advanced cancer. The studies followed people for an average of 1 to 6 years. The studies looked at several maintenance drugs, including rituximab, ofatumumab, lenalidomide, and alemtuzumab. We did not find any studies that looked at newer targeted drug treatments.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nWe found that two types of therapy probably delay the cancer from getting worse:\n- anti-CD20 drugs (rituximab or ofatumumab)\n- the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide\n\nHowever, neither therapy seems to help people live longer, and both may increase serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor another drug, alemtuzumab, the evidence is very uncertain about whether it slows the cancer's progress. The studies did not report on how long people lived, their quality of life, or unwanted effects with this treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons:\n- The studies included different types of people and some were very small.\n- There were not enough studies for us to be certain about all the results.\n- In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting. This could have influenced the results, as knowing you are on an active treatment can affect how you report your well-being.\n- Not all studies reported on the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

To make it even clearer for readers, I recommend focusing on 3 key improvements:\n\n1. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of noun phrases.** The analysis shows a high number of 'nominalizations' (BEYOND_P90), which can make sentences feel dense and less active.\n    *   **Instead of:** \"Instead of giving maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people by checking them regularly.\"\n    *   **Consider:** \"Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people with regular check-ups.\"\n    *   **Instead of:** \"This could have influenced the results, as knowing you are on an active treatment can affect how you report your well-being.\"\n    *   **Consider:** \"This could have influenced the results, because people who know they are receiving an active treatment might report their well-being differently.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the different drug types earlier.** The list of technical drug names can be confusing. Grouping them by type when they are first mentioned will help readers follow the results section more easily.\n    *   **Instead of:** \"The studies looked at several maintenance drugs, including rituximab, ofatumumab, lenalidomide, and alemtuzumab.\"\n    *   **Consider:** \"The studies looked at three main types of maintenance drugs:\n- anti-CD20 drugs (rituximab and ofatumumab)\n- an immunomodulatory drug (lenalidomide)\n- another antibody drug (alemtuzumab)\"\n\n3. **Use bullet points to make the main results easier to compare.** The main results section discusses findings for three different treatments in a single paragraph. Using a list would help readers see the different outcomes for each drug type more clearly.\n    *   **Instead of the current paragraph:** \"We found that two types of therapy probably delay the cancer from getting worse... The studies did not report on how long people lived, their quality of life, or unwanted effects with this treatment.\"\n    *   **Consider this structure:**\n\"We found that two types of therapy probably delay the cancer from getting worse, but do not seem to help people live longer:\n- **Anti-CD20 drugs (rituximab or ofatumumab):** These drugs likely delay the cancer's return but may also increase serious unwanted effects.\n- **The immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide:** This drug also likely delays the cancer's return but may increase serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor another drug, **alemtuzumab**, the evidence is very uncertain. We don't know if it slows the cancer's progress, and the studies did not report on how long people lived or on unwanted effects.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade 8.9, 15.6 words per sentence). However, the analysis identified significant deviations in four areas: nominalization (use of noun-form verbs), total nouns, complex words (Dale-Chall), and long words. The high nominalization count (29.0, well beyond the typical median of <13.0) is the primary driver of the other deviations and is the key area for editorial focus."
