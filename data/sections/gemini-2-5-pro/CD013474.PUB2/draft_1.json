  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow), maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) may delay the cancer from getting worse. However, this treatment does not seem to help people live longer overall and may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n- The evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the overall benefits and harms of maintenance therapy. Future studies are needed, particularly to evaluate newer types of treatments that were not covered in this review.\n\nWhat is maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Although initial treatments can put the cancer into remission (a period where signs and symptoms of the cancer are reduced or have disappeared), CLL is currently incurable and often returns. After each course of treatment, the time before the cancer progresses can become shorter. 'Maintenance therapy' is an ongoing treatment used after an initial, successful therapy. Its goal is to keep the cancer in remission for longer and delay its return. The alternative to maintenance therapy is regular medical check-ups without active treatment, known as 'observation'. However, the benefits and harms of using maintenance therapies are not fully known.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the effects and safety of different types of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. We compared these treatments against observation or a placebo (a dummy treatment) to see if they helped people live longer, extended the time before the cancer got worse, and to understand any unwanted side effects.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance) that compared maintenance therapies with observation or a placebo (a dummy treatment). We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 11 studies with a total of 2393 people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The median age of participants ranged from 54.1 to 71.7 years, and about 60% were men. The severity of the disease varied, with some studies including people with early-stage disease and others including people with advanced-stage disease. The studies followed participants for a median duration of 12.4 to 73 months. The studies compared different types of maintenance therapies against observation or a placebo. These included anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab or ofatumumab), immunomodulatory drugs (lenalidomide), and anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies (alemtuzumab). The review did not find any studies that looked at novel small molecular inhibitors, such as B-cell receptor inhibitors or B-cell leukaemia-2/lymphoma-2 inhibitors.\n\nMain results: Maintenance therapies may delay the disease getting worse but do not seem to help people live longer\nFor people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the review found that while some maintenance therapies can delay the disease from getting worse, they do not seem to help people live longer and may cause more unwanted effects. Maintenance therapy with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab or ofatumumab) or the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide probably increases the length of time before the disease gets worse. However, both therapies probably make little to no difference to how long people live and may increase serious unwanted effects. For maintenance therapy with anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies (alemtuzumab), it is unclear if it has an effect on the length of time before the disease gets worse. The review found no information from the studies on how long people lived, their quality of life, or unwanted effects with this treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and some of the studies were very small. There are not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022 of search.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows a significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Six metrics are in the 'BEYOND_P90' category, including the SMOG index (15.0), complex words (147), and nominalizations (39). This indicates the text uses a high number of multi-syllable words and abstract nouns, making it difficult for a lay audience to understand, despite having a good average sentence length. While 61% of metrics fall into the best quartile, the severity of the vocabulary issues requires attention."
