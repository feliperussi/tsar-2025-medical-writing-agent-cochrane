  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, maintenance therapy may delay the cancer from getting worse. However, this treatment does not seem to help people live longer overall and may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n- The evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the overall benefits and harms of maintenance therapy. Future studies are needed, particularly to evaluate newer types of treatments that were not covered in this review.\n\nWhat is maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Initial treatments can put the cancer into remission (a period where cancer signs and symptoms have lessened or disappeared), but CLL is currently incurable and often returns. After each course of treatment, the time before the cancer gets worse can become shorter. After a successful first therapy, some people have 'maintenance therapy'. This ongoing treatment aims to keep the cancer in remission and prevent it from returning. Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can observe people with regular check-ups but without active treatment. However, we do not fully know the benefits and harms of using maintenance therapies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the effects and safety of different types of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. We compared these treatments against observation or a placebo (a dummy treatment) to see if they helped people live longer, extended the time before the cancer got worse, and to understand any unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance). These studies compared maintenance therapies with observation or a placebo. We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies with 2393 people with CLL. On average, people in the studies were 54 to 72 years old, and most were men. Some had early-stage cancer, while others had more advanced cancer. The studies followed people for 1 to 6 years on average. The studies looked at several maintenance drugs, including rituximab, ofatumumab, lenalidomide, and alemtuzumab. We did not find any studies that looked at newer types of targeted drug treatments.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nFor people with CLL, we found that while some maintenance therapies may delay the disease from getting worse, they do not seem to help people live longer and may cause more unwanted effects.\n\nMaintenance therapy with drugs like rituximab, ofatumumab, and lenalidomide probably delays the disease from getting worse. However, these therapies probably make little to no difference to how long people live and may increase serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor a third drug, alemtuzumab, it is unclear if it affects how long it takes for the disease to get worse. We found no information from the studies on how long people lived, their quality of life, or unwanted effects with this treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and some of the studies were very small. There are not enough studies to be certain about the results for all outcomes. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

However, it's not approved yet because a few key improvements can make it even clearer for patients. The main issue is that the writing is sometimes dense and formal due to specific word choices. Our analysis supports this, showing an unusually high number of noun-based phrases ('nominalizations'), nouns, and long words compared to typical summaries.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** This makes the writing more active and easier to understand.\n   - **Problem:** 'We then combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n   - **Suggestion:** 'We then combined the results from the studies and judged how confident we were in the evidence.'\n\n2. **Replace wordy phrases with simpler, more concise language.**\n   - **Problem:** '...not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.'\n   - **Suggestion:** '...not all studies reported on the outcomes we were interested in.'\n\n3. **Simplify phrasing to be more direct.**\n   - **Problem:** 'Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can observe people with regular check-ups but without active treatment.'\n   - **Suggestion:** 'Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people with regular check-ups but not give them treatment.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, four metrics deviate significantly, indicating areas for improvement. The number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is 'BEYOND_P90', and the counts for total nouns, Dale-Chall, complex words, and long words are all in the P90 range. This suggests that while sentence structure is good, the vocabulary and phrasing are denser and more complex than is typical for a PLS."
