  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow)?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, maintenance therapy may delay the cancer from getting worse. However, this treatment does not seem to help people live longer overall and may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects.\n- The evidence is not strong enough to be certain about the overall benefits and harms of maintenance therapy. Future studies are needed, particularly to evaluate newer treatments that were not covered in this review.\n\nWhat is maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Initial treatments can put the cancer into remission (a time when signs of cancer are reduced or gone), but CLL is currently incurable and often returns. After each treatment, the cancer may return more quickly. Some people have 'maintenance therapy' after a successful first therapy. This ongoing treatment aims to keep the cancer in remission and prevent it from returning. Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people with regular check-ups. However, we do not fully know the benefits and harms of using maintenance therapies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies for people with CLL. We compared these treatments to observation or a placebo (a dummy treatment) to see if they helped people live longer, delayed the cancer from getting worse, and what unwanted effects they caused.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance). These studies compared maintenance therapies with observation or a placebo. We then combined the results from the studies and judged how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that included 2393 people with CLL. The people in the studies were typically between 54 and 72 years old, and most were men. Some had early-stage cancer, while others had more advanced cancer. The studies followed people for an average of 1 to 6 years. The studies looked at three main types of maintenance drugs:\n- anti-CD20 drugs (rituximab and ofatumumab)\n- an immunomodulatory drug (lenalidomide)\n- another antibody drug (alemtuzumab)\nWe did not find any studies that looked at newer targeted drug treatments.\n\nWhat were the main results?\nWe found that two types of therapy probably delay the cancer from getting worse, but do not seem to help people live longer:\n- Anti-CD20 drugs (rituximab or ofatumumab): these drugs likely delay the cancer's return but may also increase serious unwanted effects.\n- The immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide: this drug also likely delays the cancer's return but may increase serious unwanted effects.\n\nFor another drug, alemtuzumab, the evidence is very uncertain. We do not know if it slows the cancer's progress, and the studies did not report on how long people lived or on unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons:\n- The studies included different types of people and some were very small.\n- There were not enough studies for us to be certain about all the results.\n- In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting. This could have influenced the results, because people who know they are receiving an active treatment might report their well-being differently.\n- Not all studies reported on the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, factually accurate draft that is well within the word count and has excellent readability scores. I have three suggestions to make it even clearer and more direct for readers by focusing on sentence structure and word choice.\n\n**1. Replace Abstract Nouns (Nominalizations) with Active Verbs:**\nThe text sometimes uses noun forms where verbs would be more direct. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a very high number of 'nominalizations' (28 instances, where under 13 is typical for a PLS).\n*   **Original Text:** \"Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people with regular check-ups.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"regular check-ups\" is a noun. Using the verb form makes the sentence more active and easier to read.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Instead of maintenance therapy, doctors can monitor people by checking on them regularly.\"\n\n**2. Simplify the Explanation of Study Bias:**\nThe sentence explaining bias is long and combines several complex ideas that could be broken down for easier understanding.\n*   **Original Text:** \"In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting. This could have influenced the results, because people who know they are receiving an active treatment might report their well-being differently.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This 29-word sentence is hard to follow. Phrases like \"influenced the results\" and \"receiving an active treatment\" can be simplified.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"In some studies, people knew which treatment. This could affect the results. For example, people who know they are getting a real medicine might report feeling better than they otherwise would.\"\n\n**3. Use Active Voice to Clarify Who is Doing What:**\nThe style guide recommends active voice. One sentence in the methods section could be clearer by changing it from passive to active.\n*   **Original Text:** \"We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are put into treatment groups by chance).\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The passive phrase \"are put into\" is less clear than stating who is performing the action (the researchers).\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where researchers put people into treatment groups by chance).\"\n\nAddressing these points will make an already good summary even more accessible to patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 72% of metrics in the best quartile for readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 9.06). However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence structure, with high scores for nominalization (BEYOND_P90), nouns (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), and long words (P90). This suggests that while readable, the text relies on abstract nouns and complex vocabulary more than is typical, which can be improved for clarity."
