  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with oral submucous fibrosis (a condition that causes stiffening and reduced opening of the mouth), taking medicines called antioxidants (substances that may protect cells from damage) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce the burning sensation in the mouth. Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, the benefits and risks of other treatments are uncertain.\n- Although antioxidants may improve mouth opening, the improvement found in the studies was small and may not be meaningful to people living with the condition.\n- Better-quality studies are needed to find out which treatments work best for oral submucous fibrosis and to better understand their potential unwanted effects. Future studies should also measure results that are important to patients, such as being able to eat and speak normally.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting disease that causes the inside of the mouth and cheeks to become tighter and stiffer over time. This can lead to severe pain and make it difficult to open the mouth, which affects a person's ability to eat, swallow, and speak, impacting their quality of life. People with OSF also have an increased risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause of OSF is chewing areca nut (also known as betel nut), so a key part of treatment is helping people to stop this habit.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments used to manage oral submucous fibrosis.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nTo find out, we searched for studies that compared different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or each other. We then combined and summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 adults with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies looked at different treatments, such as oral drugs (antioxidants and pentoxifylline), injections into the affected area (such as steroids), and physiotherapy. These treatments were compared with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or another active treatment. The studies followed people for different lengths of time, from less than 3 months to more than 6 months. The review does not say where the studies were conducted or who funded them.\n\nWhat are the effects of the treatments?\nFor people with oral submucous fibrosis, antioxidants taken by mouth probably increase mouth opening slightly (measured between 3 and 6 months) and probably reduce the burning sensation in the mouth (for up to and beyond 6 months). We are uncertain if other treatments—such as the drug pentoxifylline, steroid injections, or physiotherapy—have an effect because the evidence is very uncertain. We did not find enough information to be certain about the unwanted side effects of any treatment. No studies looked at whether people were able to resume normal eating, chewing, and speech.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for two main reasons. First, people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results. Second, there were not enough studies to be certain about the effects of most treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and factually accurate. All critical checks passed. However, a few minor refinements would make it even easier for readers to understand. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** The analysis shows a high number of 'nominalizations' (verbs turned into nouns), which can make sentences less direct and more abstract for readers.\n    - **Example:** \"...antioxidants taken by mouth probably increase mouth opening slightly...\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase 'increase mouth opening' describes a concept rather than an action. A more direct verb makes the benefit clearer to the reader.\n    - **Suggestion:** \"...antioxidants taken by mouth probably help people open their mouths slightly wider...\"\n\n2. **Replace less common words with simpler alternatives.** The draft uses some words that might be unfamiliar to readers, as indicated by the high Dale-Chall complex word count.\n    - **Example:** \"No studies looked at whether people were able to resume normal eating, chewing, and speech.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** 'Resume' is a less common word. Simpler language ensures the message is understood by the widest possible audience.\n    - **Suggestion:** \"No studies looked at whether people were able to go back to eating, chewing, and speaking normally.\"\n\n3. **Remove unnecessary introductory phrases.** Some sentences start with phrases that repeat the idea from the subheading, which can be trimmed for conciseness.\n    - **Example:** \"How did we conduct this review? To find out, we searched for studies...\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase 'To find out,' is redundant because the subheading already tells the reader the purpose of the paragraph.\n    - **Suggestion:** \"How did we conduct this review? We searched for studies...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. The sentence length is short (19 words/sentence) and readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9.97) are excellent. However, two metrics deviate from the typical range, suggesting areas for refinement: 'nominalization' (P90) and 'complex_words_dc' (P90). This indicates that replacing some noun phrases with active verbs and substituting less common words with simpler alternatives would further improve clarity."
