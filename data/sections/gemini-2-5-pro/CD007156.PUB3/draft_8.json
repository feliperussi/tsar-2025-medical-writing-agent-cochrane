  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for oral submous fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with oral submous fibrosis, taking medicines called antioxidants (substances that may protect cells from damage) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce the burning sensation in the mouth. Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, the benefits and risks of other treatments are uncertain.\n- Although antioxidants may improve mouth opening, the improvement found in the studies was small and may not be meaningful to people living with the condition.\n- Better-quality studies are needed to find out which treatments work best for oral submous fibrosis and to better understand their potential unwanted effects. Future studies should also measure results that are important to patients, such as being able to eat and speak normally.\n\nWhat is oral submous fibrosis?\nOral submous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting disease that causes the inside of the mouth and cheeks to become tighter and stiffer over time. This can lead to severe pain and make it difficult to open the mouth, which affects how well a person can eat, swallow, and speak, and impacts their quality of life. People with OSF also have an increased risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause of OSF is chewing areca nut (also known as betel nut), so a key part of treatment is helping people to stop this habit.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments used to manage oral submous fibrosis.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for oral submous fibrosis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or each other. We combined and summarized the results. We then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 adults with oral submous fibrosis. The studies looked at different treatments, such as oral drugs (antioxidants and pentoxifylline), injections into the affected area (such as steroids), and physiotherapy. These treatments were compared with a placebo, no treatment, or another active treatment. The studies followed people for different lengths of time, from less than 3 months to more than 6 months. The review did not say where the studies were conducted or who funded them.\n\nWhat are the effects of the treatments?\nFor people with this condition, taking antioxidants by mouth probably helps in two ways. Between 3 and 6 months of treatment, it may help them open their mouths slightly wider. It also probably lessens the burning feeling in the mouth for 6 months or more. We are not sure if other treatments—such as the drug pentoxifylline, steroid injections, or physiotherapy—have an effect because there is not enough reliable evidence. We did not find enough information to be sure about the unwanted side effects of any treatment. No studies looked at whether people were able to go back to eating, chewing, and speaking normally.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. We are moderately confident about the effects of antioxidants. However, we have little confidence in the evidence for other treatments. This is for two main reasons. First, people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their symptoms, which makes the results less reliable. Second, there were not enough studies to be sure about the effects of most treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

This must be corrected to 'submucous'.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Simplify the explanation of study limitations.** The current wording is a bit abstract and could be hard for readers to grasp.\n    *   **Current sentence:** \"First, people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their symptoms, which makes the results less reliable.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase 'This knowledge could have influenced' is indirect. The connection between knowing the treatment and unreliable results could be stated more clearly.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"First, the results are less reliable because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were receiving. This could have affected how they reported their symptoms.\"\n\n2.  **Use more direct, everyday vocabulary.** Some word choices, while correct, are more complex than necessary for a plain language summary.\n    *   **Current sentence:** \"The review did not say where the studies were conducted or who funded them.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The word 'conducted' is less common than simpler alternatives.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The review did not say where the studies took place or who funded them.\"\n\n3.  **Clarify the main finding about mouth opening.** The key messages correctly state the improvement may not be meaningful, but this point could be reinforced in the main results section for greater impact.\n    *   **Current sentence:** \"Between 3 and 6 months of treatment, it may help them open their mouths slightly wider.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is clear, but it misses an opportunity to connect the clinical result to the patient's experience.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"After 3 to 6 months of treatment, antioxidants may help people open their mouths slightly wider. However, the studies found this improvement was small and may not be large enough to make a real difference in daily life.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis also flags three metrics in the P90 range, indicating deviation from the norm: 'nominalization' (using nouns instead of verbs), 'complex_words_dc' (use of words outside a common vocabulary list), and 'long_words'. These metrics support the editorial feedback to simplify vocabulary and rephrase sentences to be more direct and verb-focused."
