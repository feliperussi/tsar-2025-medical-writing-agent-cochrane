  "key_messages": [
    "For people with oral submucous fibrosis (a condition that causes stiffening and reduced opening of the mouth), taking medicines called antioxidants may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce the burning sensation in the mouth. Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, the benefits and risks of other treatments are uncertain.",
    "Although antioxidants may improve mouth opening, the improvement found in the studies was small and may not be meaningful to people living with the condition.",
    "Better-quality studies are needed to find out which treatments work best for oral submucous fibrosis and to better understand their potential unwanted effects. Future studies should also measure results that are important to patients, such as being able to eat and speak normally."

      "subheading": "What is oral submucous fibrosis?",
      "content": "Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting disease that causes the inside of the mouth and cheeks to become progressively tighter and stiffer. This can lead to severe pain and make it difficult to open the mouth, which affects a person's ability to eat, swallow, and speak, impacting their quality of life. People with OSF also have an increased risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause of OSF is chewing areca nut (also known as betel nut), so a key part of treatment is helping people to stop this habit."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 30 studies that involved 2176 adults with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies looked at different treatments, such as oral drugs (antioxidants and pentoxifylline), injections into the affected area (such as steroids), and physiotherapy. These treatments were compared with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or another active treatment. The studies followed people for different lengths of time, from less than three months to more than six months. The review did not provide information on where the studies were conducted or how they were funded."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Antioxidants for oral submucous fibrosis",
      "content": "For people with oral submucous fibrosis, antioxidants taken by mouth probably increase mouth opening slightly (measured between three and six months) and probably reduce the burning sensation in the mouth (for up to and beyond six months). For other treatments reviewed, such as another drug called pentoxifylline, steroid injections, or physiotherapy, it is unclear if they have an effect because the evidence is very uncertain. There was not enough information to be certain about unwanted side effects from any of the treatments. No studies looked at whether people were able to resume normal eating, chewing, and speech."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for most treatments.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022."
