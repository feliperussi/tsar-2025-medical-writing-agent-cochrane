  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis?\n\n**Key messages**\n- For people with oral submucous fibrosis (a condition that causes stiffening and reduced opening of the mouth), taking medicines called antioxidants may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce the burning sensation in the mouth. Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, the benefits and risks of other treatments are uncertain.\n- Although antioxidants may improve mouth opening, the improvement found in the studies was small and may not be meaningful to people living with the condition.\n- Better-quality studies are needed to find out which treatments work best for oral submucous fibrosis and to better understand their potential unwanted effects. Future studies should also measure results that are important to patients, such as being able to eat and speak normally.\n\n**Introduction and Aims**\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting disease that causes the inside of the mouth and cheeks to become progressively tighter and stiffer. This can lead to severe pain and make it difficult to open the mouth, which affects a person's ability to eat, swallow, and speak, impacting their quality of life. People with OSF also have an increased risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause of OSF is chewing areca nut (also known as betel nut), so a key part of treatment is helping people to stop this habit.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments used to manage oral submucous fibrosis.\n\n**Methods**\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or each other.\n\nData Synthesis\nWe then combined and summarized the results.\n\nConfidence Rating\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 adults with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies looked at different treatments, such as oral drugs (antioxidants and pentoxifylline), injections into the affected area (such as steroids), and physiotherapy. These treatments were compared with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or another active treatment. The studies followed people for different lengths of time, from less than three months to more than six months. The review did not provide information on where the studies were conducted or how they were funded.\n\nMain results: Antioxidants for oral submucous fibrosis\nFor people with oral submucous fibrosis, antioxidants taken by mouth probably increase mouth opening slightly (measured between three and six months) and probably reduce the burning sensation in the mouth (for up to and beyond six months). For other treatments reviewed, such as another drug called pentoxifylline, steroid injections, or physiotherapy, it is unclear if they have an effect because the evidence is very uncertain. There was not enough information to be certain about unwanted side effects from any of the treatments. No studies looked at whether people were able to resume normal eating, chewing, and speech.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for most treatments.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

This is a violation of the style guide.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Restructure the 'Methods' section for better flow.** The current format with three subheadings for three short sentences is choppy and hard to read.\n    -   **Problem:** \n        > **Search Strategy**\n        > We searched for studies...\n        > **Data Synthesis**\n        > We then combined and summarized...\n        > **Confidence Rating**\n        > We rated our confidence...\n    -   **Suggestion:** Combine these into a single paragraph under one question-based subheading.\n        > **How did we conduct this review?**\n        > To find out, we searched for studies that compare different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or each other.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence length. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity and sentence construction, with high scores for nominalization (22), Dale-Chall complex words (222), and long words (172), all falling in the P90 range. These metrics support the editorial feedback to simplify word choices and rephrase noun-heavy sentences to improve clarity."
