  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with oral submucous fibrosis, taking medicines called antioxidants (substances that may protect cells from damage) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce the burning sensation in the mouth. Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, the benefits and risks of other treatments are uncertain.\n- Although antioxidants may improve mouth opening, the improvement found in the studies was small and may not be meaningful to people living with the condition.\n- Better-quality studies are needed to find out which treatments work best for oral submucous fibrosis and to better understand their potential unwanted effects. Future studies should also measure results that are important to patients, such as being able to eat and speak normally.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting disease that causes the inside of the mouth and cheeks to become tighter and stiffer over time. This can lead to severe pain and make it difficult to open the mouth, which affects how well a person can eat, swallow, and speak, and impacts their quality of life. People with OSF also have an increased risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause of OSF is chewing areca nut (also known as betel nut), so a key part of treatment is helping people to stop this habit.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments used to manage oral submucous fibrosis.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or each other. We combined and summarized the results. We then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 adults with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies looked at different treatments, such as oral drugs (antioxidants and pentoxifylline), injections into the affected area (such as steroids), and physiotherapy. These treatments were compared with a placebo, no treatment, or another active treatment. The studies followed people for different lengths of time, from less than 3 months to more than 6 months. The review authors did not report where the studies were conducted or who funded them.\n\nWhat are the effects of the treatments?\nFor people with oral submucous fibrosis, antioxidants taken by mouth probably help people open their mouths slightly wider (measured between 3 and 6 months) and probably lessen the burning feeling in the mouth (for up to and beyond 6 months). We are not sure if other treatments—such as the drug pentoxifylline, steroid injections, or physiotherapy—have an effect because there is not enough reliable evidence. We did not find enough information to be sure about the unwanted side effects of any treatment. No studies looked at whether people were able to go back to eating, chewing, and speaking normally.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. We are moderately confident about the effects of antioxidants. However, we have little confidence in the evidence for other treatments. This is for two main reasons. First, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Knowing which treatment they received could change how people reported their symptoms, making the results less reliable. Second, there were not enough studies to be sure about the effects of most treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, well-structured draft that is factually accurate and meets all critical requirements. I'm recommending a few minor revisions to enhance clarity and readability for patients before final approval. My suggestions focus on simplifying sentence structure and word choice, which is supported by the linguistic analysis showing a higher-than-usual number of long words and nominalizations (verbs turned into nouns).\n\nHere are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n**1. Break up long, complex sentences in the results section.**\n*   **Problematic sentence:** 'For people with oral submucous fibrosis, antioxidants taken by mouth probably help people open their mouths slightly wider (measured between 3 and 6 months) and probably lessen the burning feeling in the mouth (for up to and beyond 6 months).'\n*   **Why it's an issue:** This 39-word sentence combines multiple findings and timeframes, making it difficult to follow.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'For people with this condition, taking antioxidants by mouth probably helps in two ways. Between 3 and 6 months of treatment, it may help them open their mouths slightly wider. It also probably lessens the burning feeling in the mouth for six months or more.'\n\n**2. Use simpler, more direct language.**\n*   **Problematic sentence:** 'The review authors did not report where the studies were conducted or who funded them.'\n*   **Why it's an issue:** This phrasing is a bit formal and wordy.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'The review did not say where the studies were conducted or who funded them.'\n\n**3. Clarify the explanation of study limitations.**\n*   **Problematic sentence:** 'First, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Knowing which treatment they received could change how people reported their symptoms, making the results less reliable.'\n*   **Why it's an issue:** The second sentence is repetitive. A more direct explanation of *why* this is a problem would be clearer.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** 'First, people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting. This knowledge could have influenced how they reported their symptoms, which makes the results less reliable.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with over 77% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, the analysis flags three areas for potential improvement related to vocabulary and sentence structure: the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), complex words from the Dale-Chall list, and long words (7+ characters) are all higher than is typical for a PLS."
