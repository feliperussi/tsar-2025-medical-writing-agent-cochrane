  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n- Medicines called antioxidants (substances that may protect cells from damage) probably help people with oral submucous fibrosis (a condition that causes stiffening and reduced opening of the mouth) open their mouths slightly wider and probably lessen the burning feeling in the mouth. Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, the benefits and risks of other treatments are not clear.\n- Although antioxidants may help people open their mouths wider, the change found in the studies was small and may not be important to people living with the condition.\n- Better-quality studies are needed to find out which treatments work best for oral submucous fibrosis and to better understand their possible unwanted effects. Future studies should also measure results that are important to patients, such as being able to eat and speak normally.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting disease that causes the inside of the mouth and cheeks to become tighter and stiffer over time. This can lead to severe pain and make it difficult to open the mouth, which affects how well a person can eat, swallow, and speak, and impacts their quality of life. People with OSF also have an increased risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause of OSF is chewing areca nut (also known as betel nut), so a key part of treatment is helping people to stop this habit.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments used to manage oral submucous fibrosis.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or each other. We combined and summarized the results. We then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 adults with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies looked at different treatments, such as oral drugs (antioxidants and pentoxifylline), injections into the affected area (such as steroids), and physiotherapy. These treatments were compared with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or another active treatment. The studies followed people for different lengths of time, from less than 3 months to more than 6 months. The studies included in the review did not report where they were conducted or who funded them.\n\nWhat are the effects of the treatments?\nFor people with oral submucous fibrosis, antioxidants taken by mouth probably help people open their mouths slightly wider (measured between 3 and 6 months) and probably lessen the burning feeling in the mouth (for up to and beyond 6 months). We are not sure if other treatments—such as the drug pentoxifylline, steroid injections, or physiotherapy—have an effect because there is not enough reliable evidence. We did not find enough information to be sure about the unwanted side effects of any treatment. No studies looked at whether people were able to go back to eating, chewing, and speaking normally.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. We are moderately confident about the effects of antioxidants. However, we have little confidence in the evidence for other treatments. This is for two main reasons. First, people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results. Second, there were not enough studies to be sure about the effects of most treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and meets the word count. However, it is NOT_APPROVED because a few key areas need improvement to maximize clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are an overly complex key message, the use of noun-heavy phrases instead of direct verbs (known as nominalization), and a lack of context in the limitations section. Addressing these 3-4 points will significantly improve readability.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Simplify the First Key Message:** The first bullet point is long and contains two definitions, which makes it difficult to understand the main finding quickly.\n- **Problematic Text:** \"- Medicines called antioxidants (substances that may protect cells from damage) probably help people with oral submucous fibrosis (a condition that causes stiffening and reduced opening of the mouth) open their mouths slightly wider and probably lessen the burning feeling in the mouth.\"\n- **Reasoning:** This sentence is 46 words long and asks the reader to process the main finding while also learning the definitions of 'antioxidants' and 'oral submucous fibrosis'. The definition of the condition is provided in the very next section, making it redundant here.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"- Medicines called antioxidants (substances that may protect cells from damage) probably help people with oral submucous fibrosis to open their mouths slightly wider and lessen the burning feeling in their mouth.\"\n\n**2. Use More Direct Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases:** The text often uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which can make sentences less direct and harder to read.\n- **Problematic Text:** \"...a condition that causes stiffening and reduced opening of the mouth...\"\n- **Reasoning:** The words 'stiffening' and 'opening' are used as nouns. Converting them back to verbs makes the sentence more active and easier to understand.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...a condition that stiffens the mouth and reduces how wide it can open...\"\n\n**3. Add Context to the Limitations:** The explanation of study limitations may not be clear to readers' without a research background.\n- **Problematic Text:** \"First, people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results.\"\n- **Reasoning:** A lay reader may not understand *why* knowing your treatment is a problem. Briefly explaining the concept of bias adds important context.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"First, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. This awareness can influence how they report their symptoms, which could affect the accuracy of the results.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour draft is very well‑written and scores highly on most readability metrics. The feedback above is supported by two metrics that fall outside the typical range for a Plain Language Summary: 'nominalization' (21.0 vs. a target of <13.0) and 'Dale‑Chall complex words' (228.0 vs. a target of <160.0). The suggested changes will help address both of these issues, making an already good summary even clearer.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft HIGHLY CONFORMS to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. However, two metrics deviate from the typical pattern: 'nominalization' (P90) and 'complex_words_dc' (P90). This indicates that while the text is generally easy to read, it could be improved by using more direct verbs instead of noun phrases and simplifying some word choices to reduce reliance on vocabulary not on the Dale‑Chall familiar word list."
