  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with oral submucous fibrosis, taking medicines called antioxidants (substances that may protect cells from damage) may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce the burning sensation in the mouth. Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, the benefits and risks of other treatments are uncertain.\n- Although antioxidants may improve mouth opening, the improvement found in the studies was small and may not be meaningful to people living with the condition.\n- Better-quality studies are needed to find out which treatments work best for oral submucous fibrosis and to better understand their potential unwanted effects. Future studies should also measure results that are important to patients, such as being able to eat and speak normally.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting disease that causes the inside of the mouth and cheeks to become tighter and stiffer over time. This can lead to severe pain and make it difficult to open the mouth, which affects how well a person can eat, swallow, and speak, and impacts their quality of life. People with OSF also have an increased risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause of OSF is chewing areca nut (also known as betel nut), so a key part of treatment is helping people to stop this habit.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments used to manage oral submucous fibrosis.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or each other. We combined and summarized the results. We then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 adults with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies looked at different treatments, such as oral drugs (antioxidants and pentoxifylline), injections into the affected area (such as steroids), and physiotherapy. These treatments were compared with a placebo, no treatment, or another active treatment. The studies followed people for different lengths of time, from less than 3 months to more than 6 months. The review did not say where the studies took place or who funded them.\n\nWhat are the effects of the treatments?\nTaking antioxidants by mouth probably helps people with this condition. After 3 to 6 months of treatment, antioxidants may help people open their mouths slightly wider. However, the studies found this improvement was small and may not be large enough to make a real difference in daily life. Antioxidants also probably lessen the burning feeling in the mouth for 6 months or more. We are not sure if other treatments—such as the drug pentoxifylline, steroid injections, or physiotherapy—have an effect because there is not enough reliable evidence. We did not find enough information to be sure about the unwanted side effects of any treatment. No studies looked at whether people were able to go back to eating, chewing, and speaking normally.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. We are moderately confident about the effects of antioxidants. However, we have little confidence in the evidence for other treatments. This is for two main reasons. First, the results are less reliable because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were receiving. This could have affected how they reported their symptoms. Second, there were not enough studies to be sure about the effects of most treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks have passed. However, it can be made even more accessible for patients by focusing on three areas related to vocabulary and sentence structure. The goal is to shift the tone from slightly academic to more direct and conversational.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** Some sentences rely on clinical-sounding noun phrases where a simple verb would be more direct and easier for readers to picture.\n   - **Example:** \"...taking medicines called antioxidants...may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce the burning sensation in the mouth.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"improve mouth opening\" is abstract and clinical. It describes a result rather than an action a person can take.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...taking medicines called antioxidants...might help people open their mouths a little wider and reduce the burning feeling in their mouth.\"\n\n2. **Simplify vocabulary and sentence structure.** While the readability scores are good, some sentences combine complex ideas or use words that could be simpler, which can slow readers down.\n   - **Example:** \"Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting disease that causes the inside of the mouth and cheeks to become tighter and stiffer over time.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence combines the definition and the effect into one clause. Splitting them can make the information easier to digest.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a disease that lasts a long time. It causes the inside of the mouth and cheeks to slowly become tighter and stiffer.\"\n\n3. **Break up sentences that contain lists.** Packing a list of treatments into a single sentence can make it hard for readers to distinguish and remember the different options.\n   - **Example:** \"The studies looked at different treatments, such as oral drugs (antioxidants and pentoxifylline), injections into the affected area (such as steroids), and physiotherapy.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This format is dense and requires the reader to parse the list within the flow of the sentence.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies looked at different treatments, including:\n- drugs taken by mouth (like antioxidants and pentoxifylline)\n- injections into the affected area (like steroids)\n- physiotherapy\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:** Your draft is very well-written, but these suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), total nouns, complex words, and long words were higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. The suggested edits will help address this pattern and make the text even clearer for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 72.2% of metrics falling in the best quartile. Readability scores are excellent. However, four metrics deviate from the typical range: nominalization (25.0), nouns (158.0), Dale-Chall complex words (220.0), and long words (170.0). This suggests the text, while readable, could be improved by using more active verbs and simpler, more common vocabulary."
