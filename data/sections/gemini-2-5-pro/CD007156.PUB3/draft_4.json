  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with oral submucous fibrosis (a condition that causes stiffening and reduced opening of the mouth), taking medicines called antioxidants (substances that may protect cells from damage) may help people open their mouths slightly wider and may lessen the burning feeling in the mouth. Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, the benefits and risks of other treatments are not clear.\n- Although antioxidants may help people open their mouths wider, the change found in the studies was small and may not be important to people living with the condition.\n- Better-quality studies are needed to find out which treatments work best for oral submucous fibrosis and to better understand their possible unwanted effects. Future studies should also measure results that are important to patients, such as being able to eat and speak normally.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting disease that causes the inside of the mouth and cheeks to become tighter and stiffer over time. This can lead to severe pain and make it difficult to open the mouth, which affects how well a person can eat, swallow, and speak, and impacts their quality of life. People with OSF also have an increased risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause of OSF is chewing areca nut (also known as betel nut), so a key part of treatment is helping people to stop this habit.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments used to manage oral submucous fibrosis.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or each other. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated how certain we were about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 adults with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies looked at different treatments, such as oral drugs (antioxidants and pentoxifylline), injections into the affected area (such as steroids), and physiotherapy. These treatments were compared with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or another active treatment. The studies followed people for different lengths of time, from less than 3 months to more than 6 months. The review does not say where the studies were conducted or who funded them.\n\nWhat are the effects of the treatments?\nFor people with oral submucous fibrosis, antioxidants taken by mouth probably help people open their mouths slightly wider (measured between 3 and 6 months) and probably lessen the burning feeling in the mouth (for up to and beyond 6 months). We are not sure if other treatments—such as the drug pentoxifylline, steroid injections, or physiotherapy—have an effect because there is not enough reliable evidence. We did not find enough information to be sure about the unwanted side effects of any treatment. No studies looked at whether people were able to go back to eating, chewing, and speaking normally.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for two main reasons. First, people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results. Second, there were not enough studies to be sure about the effects of most treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is well-structured and clear, but it is NOT_APPROVED because of a critical inconsistency in how the certainty of the main finding is described. Here are the 3 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make the Certainty Language Consistent:** The Key Message downplays the certainty of the evidence compared to the Results section, which could confuse readers about the main takeaway.\n- **Current Key Message:** '...antioxidants... **may help** people open their mouths slightly wider and **may lessen** the burning feeling...'\n- **Current Results:** '...antioxidants... **probably help** people open their mouths slightly wider... and **probably lessen** the burning feeling...'\n- **Suggested Rewrite (Key Message):** To accurately reflect the moderate-certainty evidence, change 'may' to 'probably' in the key message: '...antioxidants... **probably helps** people open their mouths slightly wider and **probably lessens** the burning feeling...'\n\n2. **Simplify the Methods Description:** The sentence explaining the methods combines several steps, making it a bit dense.\n- **Current Text:** 'We then combined and summarized the results, and rated how certain we were about the evidence.'\n- **Problem:** This merges two distinct actions. Shorter, more focused sentences are easier to read.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We combined and summarized the results. We then rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n\n3. **Refine Phrasing for Clarity and Tone:** The description of what the review didn't find sounds slightly critical of the review itself.\n- **Current Text:** 'The review does not say where the studies were conducted or who funded them.'\n- **Problem:** This phrasing could be misinterpreted. It's clearer to state that the information was not in the source studies.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'The studies included in the review did not report where they were conducted or who funded them.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The draft is very readable overall, but the linguistic analysis shows a high number of 'complex words' (Dale-Chall score in the 90th percentile). The suggestions above, while minor, will help simplify language and improve clarity for the reader.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability, sentence length, and active voice. However, the text has a higher-than-typical number of words from outside the Dale-Chall list of common words (complex_words_dc is in the 90th percentile), suggesting some vocabulary could be simplified where possible."
