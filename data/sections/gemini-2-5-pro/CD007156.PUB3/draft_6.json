  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n- Medicines called antioxidants (substances that may protect cells from damage) probably help people with oral submucous fibrosis to open their mouths slightly wider and lessen the burning feeling in their mouth. Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, the benefits and risks of other treatments are not clear.\n- Although antioxidants may help people open their mouths wider, the change found in the studies was small and may not be important to people living with the condition.\n- Better-quality studies are needed to find out which treatments work best for oral submucous fibrosis and to better understand their possible unwanted effects. Future studies should also measure results that are important to patients, such as being able to eat and speak normally.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting disease that causes the inside of the mouth and cheeks to become tighter and stiffer over time. This can lead to severe pain and make it difficult to open the mouth, which affects how well a person can eat, swallow, and speak, and impacts their quality of life. People with OSF also have an increased risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause of OSF is chewing areca nut (also known as betel nut), so a key part of treatment is helping people to stop this habit.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments used to manage oral submucous fibrosis.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or each other. We combined and summarized the results. We then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 adults with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies looked at different treatments, such as oral drugs (antioxidants and pentoxifylline), injections into the affected area (such as steroids), and physiotherapy. These treatments were compared with a placebo, no treatment, or another active treatment. The studies followed people for different lengths of time, from less than 3 months to more than 6 months. The studies included in the review did not report where they were conducted or who funded them.\n\nWhat are the effects of the treatments?\nFor people with oral submucous fibrosis, antioxidants taken by mouth probably help people open their mouths slightly wider (measured between 3 and 6 months) and probably lessen the burning feeling in the mouth (for up to and beyond 6 months). We are not sure if other treatments—such as the drug pentoxifylline, steroid injections, or physiotherapy—have an effect because there is not enough reliable evidence. We did not find enough information to be sure about the unwanted side effects of any treatment. No studies looked at whether people were able to go back to eating, chewing, and speaking normally.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. We are moderately confident about the effects of antioxidants. However, we have little confidence in the evidence for other treatments. This is for two main reasons. First, people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. This awareness can influence how they report their symptoms, which could affect the accuracy of the results. Second, there were not enough studies to be sure about the effects of most treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

I have three suggestions to make it even better, including one important correction for accuracy.\n\n**1. Correct a statement about study reporting for accuracy.**\n\nThe draft currently says:\n> \"The studies included in the review did not report where they were conducted or who funded them.\"\n\nThis is not quite accurate. The source material states the *review* did not provide this information, which is different from the original *studies* not reporting it. This wording incorrectly suggests a flaw in the original research.\n\nPlease change it to:\n> \"The review authors did not report where the studies were conducted or who funded them.\"\n\n**2. Simplify the explanation of study limitations.**\n\nThe section explaining the reliability of the evidence uses some abstract words that could be simpler. The high number of Dale-Chall complex words (220) in the analysis supports this.\n\nThe draft currently says:\n> \"This awareness can influence how they report their symptoms, which could affect the accuracy of the results.\"\n\nThis is a bit vague. A more direct explanation would be clearer for readers.\n\nPlease consider this alternative:\n> \"Knowing which treatment they received could change how people reported their symptoms, making the results less reliable.\"\n\n**3. Make the first key message more direct.**\n\nThe first key message is a little long and could be more concise to improve its impact.\n\nThe draft currently says:\n> \"- Medicines called antioxidants (substances that may protect cells from damage) probably help people with oral submucous fibrosis to open their mouths slightly wider and lessen the burning feeling in their mouth.\"\n\nThe version from the source material is more direct and just as clear.\n\nPlease consider revising it to:\n> \"- For people with oral submucous fibrosis, taking medicines called antioxidants may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce the burning sensation in the mouth.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 16 of 18 metrics (89%) falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. Sentence length and readability scores are excellent. However, the text deviates from typical patterns on one metric: `complex_words_dc` (Dale-Chall complex words) is in the 90th percentile, suggesting some vocabulary could be simplified for a lay audience."
