  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with oral submucous fibrosis, taking medicines called antioxidants (substances that may protect cells from damage) might help them open their mouths a little wider and reduce the burning feeling in their mouth. Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, the benefits and risks of other treatments are uncertain.\n- Although antioxidants may help people open their mouths wider, the improvement found in the studies was small and may not be meaningful to people living with the condition.\n- Better-quality studies are needed to find out which treatments work best for oral submucous fibrosis and to better understand their potential unwanted effects. Future studies should also measure results that are important to patients, such as being able to eat and speak normally.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a disease that lasts a long time. It causes the inside of the mouth and cheeks to slowly become tighter and stiffer. This can cause severe pain and make it hard to open the mouth. These problems affect how well a person can eat, swallow, and speak, and can lower their quality of life. People with OSF also have an increased risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause of OSF is chewing areca nut (also known as betel nut). A key part of treatment is helping people to stop this habit.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments used to manage oral submucous fibrosis.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or each other. We combined and summarized the results. We then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 adults with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies looked at different treatments, including:\n- drugs taken by mouth (like antioxidants and pentoxifylline)\n- injections into the affected area (like steroids)\n- physiotherapy\nThese treatments were compared with a placebo, no treatment, or another active treatment. The studies followed people for different lengths of time, from less than 3 months to more than 6 months. The review did not say where the studies took place or who funded them.\n\nWhat are the effects of the treatments?\nTaking antioxidants by mouth probably helps people with this condition. After 3 to 6 months of treatment, antioxidants may help people open their mouths slightly wider. However, the studies found this improvement was small and may not be large enough to make a real difference in daily life. Antioxidants also probably lessen the burning feeling in the mouth for 6 months or more. We are not sure if other treatments—such as the drug pentoxifylline, steroid injections, or physiotherapy—have an effect because there is not enough reliable evidence. We did not find enough information to be sure about the unwanted side effects of any treatment. No studies looked at whether people were able to go back to eating, chewing, and speaking normally.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence varies. We are moderately confident about the effects of antioxidants. However, we have little confidence in the evidence for other treatments. This is for two main reasons. First, the results are less reliable because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were receiving. This could have affected how they reported their symptoms. Second, there were not enough studies to be sure about the effects of most treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

The feedback below focuses on minor stylistic refinements to make the language even more direct and active for the reader. The main opportunity is to replace abstract nouns with active verbs, which will enhance readability.\n\nHere are the top 3 suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Use verbs instead of abstract nouns (nominalizations).** Some sentences can be more direct and easier to understand by using a verb instead of its noun form. This is a common issue, and the linguistic analysis shows a high number of 'nominalizations' (24 instances).\n   - **Original sentence:** \"Although antioxidants may help people open their mouths wider, the improvement found in the studies was small and may not be meaningful to people living with the condition.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The noun \"improvement\" is less direct than the verb \"improved\".\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Although antioxidants may help people open their mouths wider, the studies found they improved only slightly. This small change may not be meaningful for people living with the condition.\"\n\n2. **Make sentences more active and concise.** Starting sentences with the 'doer' of the action can make them more engaging.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"After 3 to 6 months of treatment, antioxidants may help people open their mouths slightly wider.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly passive. It's clearer to state who is doing the action (people taking the treatment).\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"After taking antioxidants for 3 to 6 months, people may be able to open their mouths slightly wider.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the explanation of study limitations.** The description of bias can be simplified to ensure all readers understand why the evidence is less certain.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"First, the results are less reliable because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were receiving. This could have affected how they reported their symptoms.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"could have affected\" is a bit vague.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"First, the results are less reliable because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. This awareness could have influenced their reporting of symptoms.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, three metrics deviate from the typical range: 'nominalization' (P90), 'nouns' (P90), and 'complex_words_dc' (P90). This suggests the text is more noun-heavy and uses slightly more uncommon words than is typical, supporting the editorial recommendation to replace abstract nouns with active verbs to improve clarity and directness."
