  "draft": "What are the benefits and risks of treatments for oral submucous fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n- For people with oral submucous fibrosis (a condition that causes stiffening and reduced opening of the mouth), taking medicines called antioxidants may slightly improve mouth opening and reduce the burning sensation in the mouth. Due to a lack of good-quality evidence, the benefits and risks of other treatments are uncertain.\n- Although antioxidants may improve mouth opening, the improvement found in the studies was small and may not be meaningful to people living with the condition.\n- Better-quality studies are needed to find out which treatments work best for oral submucous fibrosis and to better understand their potential unwanted effects. Future studies should also measure results that are important to patients, such as being able to eat and speak normally.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long-lasting disease that causes the inside of the mouth and cheeks to become tighter and stiffer over time. This can lead to severe pain and make it difficult to open the mouth, which affects a person's ability to eat, swallow, and speak, impacting their quality of life. People with OSF also have an increased risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause of OSF is chewing areca nut (also known as betel nut), so a key part of treatment is helping people to stop this habit.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out about the benefits and harms of different treatments used to manage oral submucous fibrosis.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nTo find out, we searched for studies that compared different treatments for oral submucous fibrosis against a placebo (a dummy treatment) or each other. We then combined and summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 studies that involved 2176 adults with oral submucous fibrosis. The studies looked at different treatments, such as oral drugs (antioxidants and pentoxifylline), injections into the affected area (such as steroids), and physiotherapy. These treatments were compared with a placebo (a dummy treatment), no treatment, or another active treatment. The studies followed people for different lengths of time, from less than 3 months to more than 6 months. The review does not say where the studies were conducted or who funded them.\n\nWhat are the effects of the treatments?\nFor people with oral submucous fibrosis, antioxidants taken by mouth probably increase mouth opening slightly (measured between 3 and 6 months) and probably reduce the burning sensation in the mouth (for up to and beyond 6 months). For other treatments reviewed, such as another drug called pentoxifylline, steroid injections, or physiotherapy, it is unclear if they have an effect because the evidence is very uncertain. There was not enough information to be certain about unwanted side effects from any of the treatments. No studies looked at whether people were able to resume normal eating, chewing, and speech.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for most treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it is not yet approved because a few key improvements are needed to make it as clear as possible for readers. Here are the top 3 areas to focus on:\n\n1. **Explain the key treatment term 'antioxidants'.** Readers may not know what this term means in a medical context, which could cause confusion about the main finding. This relates to the high number of complex words identified in the evaluation.\n    *   **Problem:** '...taking medicines called antioxidants may slightly improve mouth opening...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Add a brief, simple explanation. For example: '...taking medicines called antioxidants (substances that may protect cells from damage) may slightly improve mouth opening...'\n\n2. **Simplify the sentence explaining the evidence limitations.** The current sentence is long (33 words) and combines two different reasons, making it hard to follow.\n    *   **Problem:** 'We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results for most treatments.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break this into two shorter sentences. For example: 'We have little confidence in the evidence for two main reasons. First, people in the studies may have been aware of which treatment they were getting, which could affect the results. Second, there were not enough studies to be certain about the effects of most treatments.'\n\n3. **Use more direct, active phrasing for the results.** Some sentences are a bit wordy and indirect, which can make the findings less clear. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of 'nominalizations' (noun-form verbs).\n    *   **Problem:** 'For other treatments reviewed, such as another drug called pentoxifylline, steroid injections, or physiotherapy, it is unclear if they have an effect because the evidence is very uncertain.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase using a more active voice. For example: 'We are uncertain if other treatments—such as the drug pentoxifylline, steroid injections, or physiotherapy—have an effect because the evidence is very uncertain.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 83.3% of features in the best quartile. However, two metrics deviate significantly: nominalization (use of noun-form verbs) and Dale-Chall complex words (uncommon vocabulary) are both in the 90th percentile range. This suggests the text could be made more direct and use simpler, better-explained language to improve clarity."
