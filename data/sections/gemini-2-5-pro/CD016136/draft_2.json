  "draft": "Is IV iron safer and more effective than oral iron for treating anemia in pregnancy?\n\nKey messages\n- For pregnant people with anaemia (low iron), giving iron through a vein (intravenously) is likely better at raising haemoglobin levels than iron taken by mouth. Haemoglobin is a substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen. However, giving iron through a vein does not seem to change the risk of serious problems, like heavy bleeding after birth or needing a blood transfusion.\n- We found very little reliable information about other serious side effects for either treatment because the studies did not report them well. Future studies should focus on collecting better information on safety, especially for rare but important problems.\n\nWhat is iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnancy?\nDuring pregnancy, the body needs more iron to support the growing baby. If a person does not have enough iron, they can develop iron-deficiency anaemia. This is a condition where the blood has fewer red blood cells than normal. It can lead to health problems for both the mother and baby. The most common treatment is iron taken by mouth (oral iron) in pills or liquids. Another option is to give iron directly into a vein through a drip (intravenous iron).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how intravenous iron compares with oral iron for treating iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnant women. We looked at which treatment is better at improving iron levels and reducing anaemia. We also wanted to understand how safe both treatments are by looking at their side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are assigned to a treatment group by chance. We looked for trials that compared giving iron into a vein versus by mouth to treat anaemia in pregnant women. We then combined and compared the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 studies with 3939 pregnant women who had iron-deficiency anaemia. Most studies took place in India and Africa. The studies compared giving iron directly into a vein with iron taken by mouth. Most studies did not report how long they lasted or who funded them.\n\nCompared to oral iron, giving iron through a vein probably increases haemoglobin levels and reduces the number of women with anaemia, both during pregnancy and around the time of birth. After birth, intravenous iron may slightly increase haemoglobin levels and may reduce anaemia. However, we do not know if it affects severe anaemia.\n\nRegarding safety, giving iron through a vein probably makes little to no difference to the need for a blood transfusion or to breastfeeding rates. It may also make little to no difference to heavy bleeding after birth.\n\nFor other side effects, intravenous iron probably makes little to no difference to the risk of severe infections or a long hospital stay. It may make little to no difference to needing intensive care or the number of serious side effects. We are very uncertain about the effect on the number of mothers who die.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low for a few reasons:\n- The studies did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\n- There were not enough studies to be certain about some results.\n- The studies included different groups of people or used different ways to give the iron treatments.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, clear draft that meets all critical requirements. I'm recommending a few minor revisions to make it even more accessible for readers. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Use consistent terminology for your audience.** The summary starts by using the inclusive term 'pregnant people' but then switches to 'pregnant women' in the results section. This can be jarring for the reader.\n   - **Quote:** \"We found 13 studies with 3939 pregnant women...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** For consistency, please change 'women' to 'people' throughout the text. For example: \"We found 13 studies with 3939 pregnant people...\"\n\n2. **Make the methods section more concise.** The description of the study type is a bit repetitive and can be streamlined into a single, clearer sentence.\n   - **Quote:** \"We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are assigned to a treatment group by chance. We looked for trials that compared giving iron into a vein versus by mouth to treat anaemia in pregnant women.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Combine these ideas for better flow: \"We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared giving iron into a vein with giving it by mouth to treat anaemia in pregnant people.\"\n\n3. **Simplify clinical phrasing in the results.** Some phrases are technically correct but could be more direct and easier for a lay audience to understand.\n   - **Quote:** \"...reduces the number of women with anaemia...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase this to be more active and less clinical. For example: \"...means fewer people had anaemia...\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The linguistic analysis is excellent, with most metrics in the best quartile. The only flag was for a high noun count (P90), which is common for this topic. The suggestions above, particularly simplifying clinical phrasing, will help address this by replacing noun-heavy constructions with more direct verb-based statements.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 94.4% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and clarity. Sentence length and use of active voice are excellent. The only notable deviation is a high noun count (172, in the 90th percentile), which is common in technical summaries but suggests that some sentences could be simplified by using more direct verbs."
