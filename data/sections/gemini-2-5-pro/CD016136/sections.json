  "plain_title": "Is IV iron safer and more effective than oral iron for treating anemia in pregnancy?",
  "key_messages": [
    "For pregnant people with anaemia (a condition caused by low iron), iron given directly into a vein (intravenously) is likely better at increasing levels of haemoglobin (a substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen) than iron taken by mouth. However, giving iron intravenously seems to make little to no difference to the risk of serious complications, such as heavy bleeding after birth or the need for a blood transfusion.",
    "The review found very little reliable information about other serious unwanted effects of either type of iron treatment because they were not well reported in the studies. Future research should focus on collecting better information on the safety of these treatments, especially on rare but important complications."

      "subheading": "What is iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnancy and how is it treated?",
      "content": "During pregnancy, the body needs more iron to support the growing baby. If a person does not have enough iron, they can develop iron-deficiency anaemia, a condition where the blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. This can lead to health problems for both the mother and baby. The most common treatment is iron taken by mouth (oral iron), such as in pills or liquids. Another option is to give iron directly into a vein through a drip (intravenous iron). Intravenous iron is being used more often to treat this condition in pregnancy."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out how intravenous iron compares with oral iron for treating iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnant women. We were interested in which treatment is better at improving iron levels and reducing anaemia. We also wanted to understand the safety of both treatments by looking at their side effects and whether they affected the risk of serious problems, such as heavy bleeding after birth (postpartum haemorrhage) or the need for a blood transfusion."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are assigned to a treatment group by chance) that compared giving iron into a vein versus by mouth to treat anaemia in pregnant women. We then combined and compared the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review found 13 studies with 3939 pregnant women who had iron deficiency anaemia. The studies were mainly carried out in India and Africa. The women had haemoglobin levels between 5.0 g/dL and 11.0 g/dL. The studies compared giving iron directly into a vein (intravenously) with iron taken by mouth (orally). The most common comparison was intravenous iron sucrose versus oral ferrous sulfate. The studies did not report on how long they lasted or who funded them."

      "subheading": "Main results: Intravenous iron compared with oral iron for anaemia in pregnancy",
      "content": "For pregnant women with iron deficiency anaemia, intravenous iron (given through a drip) compared to oral iron (taken by mouth) probably slightly increases haemoglobin levels (a substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen) and probably reduces the number of women with anaemia, both during pregnancy and around the time of birth. After birth, intravenous iron may slightly increase haemoglobin levels and may reduce anaemia, but we do not know if it has an effect on severe anaemia.\n\nRegarding safety and complications, intravenous iron probably makes little to no difference to the need for a blood transfusion or to breastfeeding rates. It may make little to no difference to heavy bleeding after birth.\n\nFor other unwanted effects, intravenous iron probably makes little to no difference to the risk of severe infections, a prolonged hospital stay, or the overall number of unwanted effects. It may make little to no difference to admissions to the intensive care unit or the number of serious unwanted effects. The effect on the number of mothers who die is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2024."
