  "draft": "Can psychological and social support programs improve mental well-being for people affected by major crises (like wars or disasters) in countries with fewer resources?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear if psychological and social support programs improve mental well-being for people affected by major crises in countries with fewer resources. For adults, these programs may offer a slight improvement, but for children and adolescents, there was no clear difference. The included studies did not report on unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The review found very few studies on this topic, and the evidence that is available is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions. More and better-quality studies are needed to understand the true effects of these support programs on the mental health of people living in crisis situations.\n\nWhy did we do this review?\nMillions of people around the world are forced to leave their homes because of war, conflict, and other humanitarian crises. The vast majority of these people live in low- and middle-income countries. The constant stress of these situations can harm their mental health. Psychological and social support programs (psychosocial interventions) may help. These programs aim to promote positive aspects of mental health, such as well-being, quality of life, and the ability to cope with difficulties, rather than treating specific mental illnesses.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if psychosocial support programs improve the mental health of adults and children living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. We compared people who received these programs to people who received no support, usual support, or were on a waiting list.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychosocial support with no support for people affected by humanitarian crises. The studies were randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups). We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 13 studies with a total of 7917 participants. Nine studies focused on children and adolescents, and four focused on adults. The studies took place in several low- and middle-income countries. The support programs were delivered to groups, usually by trained local people rather than mental health specialists. We compared these programs to groups who received no support, usual support, or were on a waiting list. The effects of these support programs on the mental health of people in humanitarian crises are unclear because of a lack of strong evidence. For children and adolescents, these support programs may make little to no difference to their mental well-being or their prosocial behaviour (how they act to benefit others). The programs may improve daily functioning, but we are very uncertain about this result. For adults, the support programs may slightly improve mental well-being shortly after the program ends, but this effect may not last over time. We did not find any studies that looked at how these programs affect daily functioning or prosocial behaviour in adults.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies were very small. Our confidence is also limited because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were receiving. The studies also included different groups of people and used different support programs, which makes the results harder to compare.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and factually accurate. All critical checks passed. However, a few minor revisions could make it even more accessible to a lay audience by simplifying some of the vocabulary and phrasing. Here are the top 3 suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Make sentences more direct and less noun-heavy.** The analysis shows a high count of nouns, which can sometimes make sentences feel dense and abstract. Using more active verbs can improve clarity.\n   - **Original sentence:** 'Our confidence is also limited because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were receiving.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is a bit abstract. A more direct sentence explaining *why* this is a problem for the evidence is clearer for the reader.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'We have less confidence in the results because people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. This awareness could have influenced the outcomes.'\n\n2. **Simplify vocabulary to reduce complexity.** The draft has a high number of words that are uncommon (Dale-Chall complex words) and long. Replacing some of these with more everyday terms will help a wider audience understand the text.\n   - **Original sentence:** 'For children and adolescents, these support programs may make little to no difference to their mental well-being or their prosocial behaviour (how they act to benefit others).'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** 'Adolescents' and 'prosocial behaviour' are technical terms. While 'prosocial' is defined, the sentence can be simplified further.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'For children and teenagers, these support programs may make little to no difference to their mental well-being or their positive social actions (like helping others).'\n\n3. **Clarify the meaning of 'usual support'.** This term is common in research but may be unclear to a lay reader.\n   - **Original sentence:** 'We compared people who received these programs to people who received no support, usual support, or were on a waiting list.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** A reader may not know what 'usual support' means in a humanitarian crisis setting.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'We compared people who took part in these programs to people who received either no support, the support that is usually available in their area, or were on a waiting list for the program.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, it deviates on vocabulary complexity, with higher than typical counts for nouns (170), Dale-Chall complex words (240), and long words (174). This suggests that while the sentence structure is excellent, the word choice could be simplified further to improve readability for a lay audience."
