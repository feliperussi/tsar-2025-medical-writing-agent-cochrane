  "draft": "Can psychological and social support programs improve mental well-being for people affected by major crises (like wars or disasters) in countries with fewer resources?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of strong evidence, it is unclear if psychological and social support programs improve mental well-being for people affected by major crises in countries with fewer resources. For adults, these programs may offer a slight improvement, but for children and teenagers, there was no clear difference. The included studies did not report on unwanted or harmful effects.\n- The review found very few studies on this topic, and the evidence that is available is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions. More and better-quality studies are needed to understand the true effects of these support programs on the mental health of people living in crisis situations.\n\nWhy did we do this review?\nMillions of people around the world are forced to leave their homes because of war, conflict, and other humanitarian crises. The vast majority of these people live in low- and middle-income countries. The constant stress of these situations can harm their mental health. Psychological and social support programs (psychosocial interventions) may help. These programs aim to promote positive aspects of mental health, such as well-being, quality of life, and the ability to cope with difficulties, rather than treating specific mental illnesses.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if psychosocial support programs improve the mental health of adults, children, and teenagers living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. We compared people who took part in these programs to people who received either no support, the support that is usually available in their area, or were on a waiting list.\n\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared psychosocial support with no support for people affected by humanitarian crises. The studies were randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups). We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 13 studies with a total of 7917 people. Nine studies focused on children and teenagers, and 4 focused on adults. The studies took place in several low- and middle-income countries. Trained local people, not mental health specialists, usually delivered the support programs to groups. We compared these programs to groups who received no support, the support usually available in their area, or were on a waiting list. The effects of these support programs on the mental health of people in major crises are unclear because of a lack of strong evidence. For children and teenagers, these support programs may make little to no difference to their mental well-being or their positive social actions (like helping others). The programs may help people better manage their daily lives and activities, but we are very uncertain about this result. For adults, the support programs may slightly improve mental well-being shortly after the program ends, but this effect may not last over time. We did not find any studies that looked at how these programs affect daily life or positive social actions in adults.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence for several reasons. There were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies were very small. We are less confident in the results because people in the studies knew which support program they were in. Knowing this might have changed how they answered questions about their well-being. Finally, the studies included different groups of people and used different support programs, which makes the results harder to compare.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023.",

While the counts for nouns, long words, and complex words are higher than average (P90 range), this is likely due to necessary terminology for the topic, and the overall high readability scores indicate this has not negatively impacted reader comprehension."
