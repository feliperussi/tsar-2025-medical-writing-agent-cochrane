  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear if psychological and social support programs improve mental well-being for people affected by major crises in countries with fewer resources. For adults, these programs may offer a slight improvement, but for children and adolescents, there was no clear difference. The included studies did not report on unwanted or harmful effects.",
    "The review found very few studies on this topic, and the evidence that is available is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions. More and better-quality studies are needed to understand the true effects of these support programs on the mental health of people living in crisis situations."

      "subheading": "How can we support the mental health of people affected by humanitarian crises?",
      "content": "Millions of people around the world are forced to leave their homes because of war, conflict, and other humanitarian crises. The vast majority of these people live in low- and middle-income countries. The constant stress of these situations can harm their mental health. Psychological and social support programs (psychosocial interventions) may help. These programs aim to promote positive aspects of mental health, such as well-being, quality of life, and the ability to cope with difficulties, rather than treating specific mental illnesses."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if psychosocial support programs improve the mental health of adults and children living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. We compared people who received these programs to people who received no support, usual support, or were on a waiting list."

      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared psychosocial support with no support for people affected by humanitarian crises. The studies were randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups). We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 13 studies with a total of 7917 participants. Nine studies focused on children and adolescents, and four focused on adults. The studies took place in several low- and middle-income countries. The interventions were psychosocial and delivered in groups, mainly by non-specialists, and were compared to no intervention, usual intervention, or a waiting list. The effects of these support programs on the mental health of people in humanitarian crises are unclear because of a lack of strong evidence. For children and adolescents, these support programs may make little to no difference to their mental well-being or their prosocial behaviour (how they act to benefit others). The programs may improve daily functioning, but we are very uncertain about this result. For adults, the support programs may slightly improve mental well-being shortly after the program ends, but this effect may not last over time. We did not find any studies that looked at how these programs affect daily functioning or prosocial behaviour in adults."

  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies were very small. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search."
