  "draft": "For people with heart problems, how does a recovery program at home compare to one in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation)?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people recovering from a heart attack, heart surgery, or who have heart failure, supervised recovery programs at home appear to be as effective as programs based in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation). The available evidence shows similar results for both types of programs on survival, exercise ability, and quality of life for up to 1 year. The review did not find information to compare unwanted or harmful effects.\n- Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects (beyond 1 year) of these programs and to find out if home-based programs are also suitable for people with other kinds of heart conditions.\n\nWhat helps people recover from heart problems?\nDiseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease) are the most common cause of death globally. After a heart attack, heart surgery, or other heart problem, doctors often offer people 'cardiac rehabilitation'. These are programmes of exercise, education, and support that help people recover, improve their health, and prevent future heart problems. Traditionally, people attend these programmes in a group setting at a hospital or community centre ('centre-based'). However, to make it easier for more people to take part, researchers have developed programmes that people can follow in their own homes ('home-based'), sometimes with support from healthcare staff via phone or the internet.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if home-based cardiac rehabilitation is as effective as supervised, centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We compared the two approaches by looking at their effects on death and illness, a person's ability to exercise, their quality of life, and other risk factors for heart disease.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where people are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 24 studies with 3046 adults who had experienced a heart attack (myocardial infarction), heart surgery (revascularisation), or heart failure. The studies compared home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, which sometimes included digital or telehealth support, with supervised, centre-based programmes. Most studies were short-term, with follow-up lasting up to 12 months, and only 3 studies reported outcomes beyond this period. For people with heart disease, home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes supported by healthcare staff seem to have similar effects to centre-based programmes. Compared with centre-based rehabilitation, home-based programmes may make little to no difference to the number of deaths, a person's exercise capacity, or their quality of life for up to 2 years. In the longer term (beyond 1 year), home-based programmes probably make little to no difference to exercise capacity. There may also be little to no difference in how many people complete the 2 types of programmes.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. Many studies did not provide enough detail about their methods, which makes it hard to judge if their results are reliable. Also, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the long-term effects of the programs.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is NOT_APPROVED. It requires revisions for a critical factual inaccuracy and several areas of low clarity that make it difficult for a lay audience to understand.\n\n**Critical Issue for Correction:**\n\n\n*   **Factual Inaccuracy in Results:** The summary incorrectly states that outcomes for deaths, exercise capacity, and quality of life were all measured 'for up to 2 years'. The source abstract specifies that evidence for deaths and exercise capacity is for up to 1 year, while quality of life is up to 2 years. This must be corrected to avoid misleading the reader.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"Compared with centre-based rehabilitation, home-based programmes may make little to no difference to the number of deaths, a person's exercise capacity, or their quality of life for up to 2 years.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"For up to 1 year, home-based programmes may make little to no difference to the number of deaths or a person's ability to exercise. For up to 2 years, they may make little to no difference to quality of life.\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed for Clarity:**\n\n1.  **Simplify Complex and Technical Vocabulary:** The text uses more complex words than is typical for a PLS. After defining a technical term, use the simpler, plain language version in the rest of the text.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"This review included 24 studies with 3046 adults who had experienced a heart attack (myocardial infarction), heart surgery (revascularisation), or heart failure.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"This review included 24 studies with 3046 adults who had experienced a heart attack, heart surgery, or heart failure.\" (The technical terms were already defined in the previous section).\n\n2.  **Use More Direct Verbs Instead of Nouns:** Some sentences are built around nouns (nominalizations) rather than action verbs, which makes them less direct and harder to read. The high 'nominalization' score of 25.0 (vs. a typical median of <13.0) supports this.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"The review did not find information to compare unwanted or harmful effects.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies did not report on unwanted or harmful effects, so we could not compare them.\"\n\n3.  **Break Up Dense Paragraphs:** The 'Methods' section combines several distinct steps into a single, dense paragraph, which can be overwhelming. Use shorter paragraphs to improve readability.\n    *   **Problematic paragraph:** \"How did we find and assess the evidence? We searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where people are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:**\n        \"**How did we find the evidence?**\n        We searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where people are randomly put into one of two treatment groups.\n\n        **How did we assess the evidence?**\n        We combined the results from the studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows MODERATE CONFORMITY with typical PLS patterns. While readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (10.79) and sentence length (19.10 words) are good, the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary and style. Six key metrics are in the P90 range, indicating the text is more complex than 90% of PLS in the corpus. Specifically, high counts for 'passive_voice' (23.0), 'nominalization' (25.0), 'complex_words' (127.0), and 'long_words' (23.0), 'nominalization' (25.0), 'complex_words' (127.0), and 'long_words' (172.0) suggest the text is overly formal and dense, which supports the need for the recommended edits to improve clarity."
