  "draft": "For people with heart problems, how does a recovery program at home compare to one in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation)?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people recovering from a heart attack, heart surgery, or heart failure, recovery programs at home seem to be as effective as programs in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation). Evidence up to 1 year shows similar results for both on survival and ability to exercise. Evidence up to 2 years shows similar results for quality of life. The studies did not report on unwanted or harmful effects, so we could not compare them.\n- Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects (beyond 1 year) of these programs and to find out if home-based programs are also suitable for people with other kinds of heart conditions.\n\nWhat helps people recover from heart problems?\nDiseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease) are the most common cause of death globally. After a heart attack, heart surgery, or other heart problem, doctors often offer people 'cardiac rehabilitation'. These are programmes of exercise, education, and support that help people recover, improve their health, and prevent future heart problems. Traditionally, people attend these programmes in a group setting at a hospital or community centre ('centre-based'). However, to make it easier for more people to take part, researchers have developed programmes that people can follow in their own homes ('home-based'), sometimes with support from healthcare staff via phone or the internet.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if home-based cardiac rehabilitation is as effective as supervised, centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We compared the two approaches by looking at their effects on death and illness, a person's ability to exercise, their quality of life, and other risk factors for heart disease.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where people are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.\n\nHow did we assess the evidence?\nWe combined the results from all the studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 24 studies with 3046 adults who had a heart attack, heart surgery, or heart failure. The studies compared home-based recovery programs with supervised programs in a hospital or clinic. Most studies were short-term, lasting up to 12 months, and only 3 studies looked at outcomes beyond this period.\n\nFor people with heart disease, home-based recovery programs supported by healthcare staff seem to have similar effects to programs in a hospital or clinic.\n- For up to 1 year, home-based programs may make little to no difference to the number of deaths or a person's ability to exercise.\n- For up to 2 years, they may make little to no difference to quality of life.\n\nBeyond 1 year, home-based programs probably make little to no difference to a person's ability to exercise. There may also be little to no difference in how many people complete the 2 types of programs.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. Many studies did not provide enough detail about their methods, making it hard to judge if their results are reliable. We also did not find enough studies to be certain about the long-term effects of the programs.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, factually accurate draft that meets all critical requirements. However, it's graded as NOT_APPROVED to allow for a few key improvements that will make it much clearer and more direct for readers. The main opportunity is to replace noun-heavy phrases with stronger, more active verbs, which will make the summary easier to read and understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make the main finding more direct.** The current phrasing is a bit passive and wordy.\n   - **Current sentence:** 'For people with heart disease, home-based recovery programs supported by healthcare staff seem to have similar effects to programs in a hospital or clinic.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'For people with heart disease, recovery programs at home supported by healthcare staff seem to work as well as programs in a hospital or clinic.'\n\n2. **Simplify the description of program completion.** The current sentence is complex and hard to follow.\n   - **Current sentence:** 'There may also be little to no difference in how many people complete the 2 types of programs.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'Similar numbers of people may complete both home-based and centre-based programs.'\n\n3. **Use simpler, more common vocabulary in the introduction.** The term 'globally' is less common than 'worldwide'.\n   - **Current sentence:** 'Diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease) are the most common cause of death globally.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'Diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease) are the most common cause of death worldwide.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of nouns and 'nominalizations' (verbs turned into nouns). Addressing these points will make the text more engaging and align it better with plain language best practices.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 88.9% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity, specifically in its use of nouns and nominalizations (verbs turned into nouns), both of which are in the P90 range. This indicates the text is more noun-heavy than typical summaries and could be improved by using more direct, active verbs to enhance clarity."
