  "draft": "For people with heart problems, how does a recovery program at home compare to one in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation)?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people recovering from a heart attack, heart failure, or after a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart (like bypass surgery or inserting a stent), recovery programs at home seem to work as well as programs in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation). Evidence up to 1 year shows similar results for both on survival and how well people can exercise. Evidence up to 2 years shows similar results for quality of life. The studies did not report on unwanted or harmful effects, so we could not compare them.\n- Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects (beyond 1 year) of these programs and to find out if home-based programs are also suitable for people with other kinds of heart conditions.\n\nWhat helps people recover from heart problems?\nDiseases of the heart and blood vessels, known as cardiovascular disease, cause the most deaths worldwide. After a heart attack, a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart, or other heart problem, doctors often offer people 'cardiac rehabilitation'. These are programmes of exercise, education, and support that help people recover, improve their health, and prevent future heart problems. Traditionally, people attend these programmes in a group setting at a hospital or community centre ('centre-based'). However, to make it easier for more people to take part, researchers have developed programmes that people can follow in their own homes ('home-based'), sometimes with support from healthcare staff via phone or the internet.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if home-based cardiac rehabilitation is as effective as supervised, centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We compared the two approaches by looking at their effects on death and illness, how well people can exercise, their quality of life, and other risk factors for heart disease.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where researchers randomly assign people to one of two treatment groups.\n\nHow did we assess the evidence?\nWe combined the results from all the studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 24 studies with 3046 adults who had a heart attack, heart failure, or a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart. The studies compared home-based recovery programs with supervised programs in a hospital or clinic. Most studies were short-term, lasting up to 12 months, and only 3 studies looked at outcomes beyond this period.\n\nFor people with heart disease, recovery programs at home supported by healthcare staff seem to work as well as programs in a hospital or clinic.\n- For up to 1 year, home-based programs may make little to no difference to the number of deaths or how well people can exercise.\n- For up to 2 years, they may make little to no difference to quality of life.\n\nBeyond 1 year, home-based programs probably make little to no difference to how well people can exercise. Similar numbers of people may complete both home-based and centre-based programs.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. Many studies did not provide enough detail about their methods, making it hard to judge if their results are reliable. We also did not find enough studies to be certain about the long-term effects of the programs.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to September 2022.",

The readability scores are excellent. I am flagging this as 'NOT_APPROVED' to provide a few minor but important suggestions that will make the text even more accessible to readers, primarily by making the language more direct and active, as suggested by the linguistic analysis.\n\nHere are the top 2 improvements I recommend:\n\n**1. Combine and Simplify the Methods Section**\n\nThe current methods section is broken into two very short parts that feel disconnected. Combining them under a single, more descriptive heading would improve the flow.\n\n- **Problematic Text:**\n\"How did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where researchers randomly assign people to one of two treatment groups.\n\nHow did we assess the evidence?\nWe combined the results from all the studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\"\n\n- **Why it's an issue:** The separation is choppy, and phrases like \"rated our confidence\" are abstract for a lay audience.\n\n- **Suggested Rewrite:**\n\"**What did we do in this review?**\nWe searched for studies (called randomised controlled trials) that randomly assigned people to receive either home-based or centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We then combined the results from all the studies and judged how reliable the overall evidence was.\"\n\n**2. Replace Noun-Heavy Phrases with Active Verbs**\n\nThe linguistic analysis noted that the summary has a high number of nouns and 'nominalizations' (nouns made from verbs). This can make sentences feel passive and less direct. Using more action verbs will make the text more engaging.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"This review updates our previous review.\"\n\n- **Why it's an issue:** This is slightly formal and uses a noun (\"review\") where a verb would be stronger. It goes against the style guide principle of using direct verbs.\n\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We updated our previous review.\"\n\nBy making these small changes, you can further improve an already excellent summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation results indicate the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and style. Key readability scores, such as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (8.76), are excellent (P25), and the use of active voice and pronouns is strong (P75). The only deviations are a slightly higher-than-typical count for nouns (197.0) and nominalizations (21.0), both in the P90 range, suggesting the text is somewhat dense with nouns. Despite this, the overall linguistic profile is very strong."
