  "plain_title": "For people with heart problems, how does a recovery program at home compare to one in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "For people recovering from a heart attack, heart surgery, or who have heart failure, supervised recovery programs at home appear to be as effective as programs based in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation). The available evidence shows similar results for both types of programs on survival, exercise ability, and quality of life for up to one year. The review did not find information to compare unwanted or harmful effects.",
    "Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects (beyond one year) of these programs and to find out if home-based programs are also suitable for people with other kinds of heart conditions."

      "subheading": "What helps people recover from heart problems?",
      "content": "Diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease) are the most common cause of death globally. After a heart attack, heart surgery, or other heart problem, people are often offered 'cardiac rehabilitation'. These are programmes of exercise, education, and support that help people recover, improve their health, and prevent future heart problems. Traditionally, these programmes are delivered in a group setting at a hospital or community centre ('centre-based'). However, to make it easier for more people to take part, programmes have been developed that people can follow in their own homes ('home-based'), sometimes with support from healthcare staff via phone or the internet."

      "content": "We wanted to find out if home-based cardiac rehabilitation is as effective as supervised, centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We compared the two approaches by looking at their effects on death and illness, a person's ability to exercise, their quality of life, and other risk factors for heart disease."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review included 24 trials with a total of 3046 participants. The participants were adults with a history of heart conditions such as myocardial infarction, revascularisation, or heart failure. The studies compare home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, which sometimes included digital or telehealth support, with supervised, centre-based programmes. Most studies were short-term, with follow-up lasting up to 12 months, and only three studies reported outcomes beyond this period. For people with heart disease, home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes supported by healthcare staff seem to have similar effects to centre-based programmes. Compared with centre-based rehabilitation, home-based programmes may make little to no difference to the number of deaths, a person's exercise capacity, or their quality of life for up to two years. In the longer term (beyond one year), home-based programmes probably make little to no difference to exercise capacity. There may also be little to no difference in how many people complete the two types of programmes."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search."
