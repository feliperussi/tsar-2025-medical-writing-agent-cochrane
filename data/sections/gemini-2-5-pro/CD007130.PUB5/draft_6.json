  "draft": "For people with heart problems, how does a recovery program at home compare to one in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation)?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people recovering from a heart attack, heart failure, or after a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart (like bypass surgery or inserting a stent), recovery programs at home seem to work as well as programs in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation). Evidence up to 1 year shows similar results for both on survival and how well people can exercise. Evidence up to 2 years shows similar results for quality of life. The studies did not report on unwanted or harmful effects, so we could not compare them.\n- Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects (beyond 1 year) of these programs and to find out if home-based programs are also suitable for people with other kinds of heart conditions.\n\nWhat helps people recover from heart problems?\nDiseases of the heart and blood vessels, known as cardiovascular disease, cause the most deaths worldwide. After a heart attack, a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart, or other heart problem, doctors often offer people 'cardiac rehabilitation'. These are programmes of exercise, education, and support that help people recover, improve their health, and prevent future heart problems. Traditionally, people attend these programmes in a group setting at a hospital or community centre ('centre-based'). However, to make it easier for more people to take part, researchers have developed programmes that people can follow in their own homes ('home-based'), sometimes with support from healthcare staff via phone or the internet.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if home-based cardiac rehabilitation is as effective as supervised, centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We compared the two approaches by looking at their effects on death and illness, how well people can exercise, their quality of life, and other risk factors for heart disease.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies (called randomised controlled trials) that randomly assigned people to receive either home-based or centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We then combined the results from all the studies and judged how reliable the overall evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 24 studies with 3046 adults who had a heart attack, heart failure, or a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart. The studies compared home-based recovery programs with supervised programs in a hospital or clinic. Most studies were short-term, lasting up to 12 months, and only 3 studies looked at outcomes beyond this period.\n\nFor people with heart disease, recovery programs at home supported by healthcare staff seem to work as well as programs in a hospital or clinic.\n- For up to 1 year, home-based programs may make little to no difference to the number of deaths or how well people can exercise.\n- For up to 2 years, they may make little to no difference to quality of life.\n\nBeyond 1 year, home-based programs probably make little to no difference to how well people can exercise. Similar numbers of people may complete both home-based and centre-based programs.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. Many studies did not provide enough detail about their methods, making it hard to judge if their results are reliable. We also did not find enough studies to be certain about the long-term effects of the programs.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nWe updated our previous review. The evidence is current to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is very well-written and meets all critical requirements, including accuracy and readability. However, a few improvements are needed to make it even clearer for patients before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Make the language more active and direct.** The text has a high number of passive sentences and nouns, which can make it feel a bit formal and indirect. For example, in the limitations section:\n   - **Original:** \"Many studies did not provide enough detail about their methods, making it hard to judge if their results are reliable.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"This is because many of the included studies were not reported well, which makes their results less certain.\"\n\n2. **Explain technical terms consistently.** You do a great job explaining a complex procedure in the Key Messages, but the explanation is missing later in the text. This can confuse readers who don't read the summary from top to bottom.\n   - **Original (in 'What did we find?'):** \"...a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"...a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart (such as bypass surgery or having a stent inserted).\"\n\n3. **Use more personal and direct phrasing in the Key Messages.** Some phrases are still a bit clinical.\n   - **Original:** \"Evidence up to 1 year shows similar results for both on survival and how well people can exercise.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"For up to one year, both types of programs seem to have a similar effect on a person's risk of dying and on their ability to exercise.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable, with most metrics (83%) falling in the best quartile for clarity and simplicity. However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in two stylistic areas: the number of passive voice constructions (20 instances, P90) and the total noun count (194, P90). These suggest the text could be more direct and active in its phrasing to better engage readers."
