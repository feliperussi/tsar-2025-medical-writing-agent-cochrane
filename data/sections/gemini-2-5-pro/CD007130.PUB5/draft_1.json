  "draft": "For people with heart problems, how does a recovery program at home compare to one in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation)?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people recovering from a heart attack, heart surgery, or who have heart failure, supervised recovery programs at home appear to be as effective as programs based in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation). The available evidence shows similar results for both types of programs on survival, exercise ability, and quality of life for up to one year. The review did not find information to compare unwanted or harmful effects.\n- Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects (beyond one year) of these programs and to find out if home-based programs are also suitable for people with other kinds of heart conditions.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nWhat helps people recover from heart problems?\nDiseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease) are the most common cause of death globally. After a heart attack, heart surgery, or other heart problem, people are often offered 'cardiac rehabilitation'. These are programmes of exercise, education, and support that help people recover, improve their health, and prevent future heart problems. Traditionally, these programmes are delivered in a group setting at a hospital or community centre ('centre-based'). However, to make it easier for more people to take part, programmes have been developed that people can follow in their own homes ('home-based'), sometimes with support from healthcare staff via phone or the internet.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if home-based cardiac rehabilitation is as effective as supervised, centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We compared the two approaches by looking at their effects on death and illness, a person's ability to exercise, their quality of life, and other risk factors for heart disease.\n\nMETHODS\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched for studies that compared home-based with centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programs.\nStudy Selection\nWe included studies called randomized controlled trials (where people are randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups).\nData Synthesis\nWe combined their results.\nConfidence Assessment\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 24 trials with a total of 3046 participants. The participants were adults with a history of heart conditions such as myocardial infarction, revascularisation, or heart failure. The studies compare home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes, which sometimes included digital or telehealth support, with supervised, centre-based programmes. Most studies were short-term, with follow-up lasting up to 12 months, and only three studies reported outcomes beyond this period. For people with heart disease, home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes supported by healthcare staff seem to have similar effects to centre-based programmes. Compared with centre-based rehabilitation, home-based programmes may make little to no difference to the number of deaths, a person's exercise capacity, or their quality of life for up to two years. In the longer term (beyond one year), home-based programmes probably make little to no difference to exercise capacity. There may also be little to no difference in how many people complete the two types of programmes.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nCURRENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions to meet Cochrane standards for clarity and style before it can be approved. A critical issue is that the subheadings in the 'Methods' section are not phrased as questions, which is required by the style guide. Additionally, the text relies heavily on passive voice and technical terms, making it difficult for a lay audience to understand. The metrics confirm these issues, showing significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in passive voice, nominalizations, and word complexity.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Rephrase Methods subheadings as questions and combine the section into a clear paragraph.** The current format is a list of statements that doesn't explain the process clearly.\n    *   **Problem:** The subheadings 'Search Strategy', 'Study Selection', 'Data Synthesis', and 'Confidence Assessment' violate the style guide rule that subheadings should be questions. The one-sentence descriptions are disconnected.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Replace the entire 'Methods' section with a single subheading and paragraph, like this:\n        **How did we find and assess the evidence?**\n        'We searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where people are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. We then combined the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.'\n\n2.  **Replace technical terms with simpler language and use active voice.** The Results section contains medical jargon that will be unfamiliar to many readers.\n    *   **Problem:** The sentence \"The participants were adults with a history of heart conditions such as myocardial infarction, revascularisation, or heart failure\" uses passive voice and technical terms.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rewrite this for clarity: 'The studies included 3046 adults who had experienced a heart attack, heart surgery (revascularisation), or heart failure.'\n\n3.  **Make the 'Limitations of the evidence' section more specific.** The current explanation is too vague to be helpful.\n    *   **Problem:** The sentence \"...not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes\" doesn't explain *why* you have little confidence.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Provide more specific reasons: 'Our confidence in the evidence is low. Many studies did not provide enough detail about their methods, which makes it hard to judge if their results are reliable. Also, there were not enough studies for us to be certain about the long-term effects of the programs.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with only 16.7% of features falling in the best quartile. The draft deviates significantly in 7 of 18 metrics, indicating a need for revision. The most critical deviations are in 'passive_voice' and 'nominalization', both of which are 'BEYOND_P90'. This overuse of passive constructions and noun-heavy phrases makes the text less direct and harder to read. Additionally, metrics for vocabulary complexity ('smog_index', 'complex_words', 'long_words') are in the P90 range, supporting the editorial finding that the draft uses unnecessarily technical language."
