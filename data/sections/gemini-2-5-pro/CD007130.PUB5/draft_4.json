  "draft": "For people with heart problems, how does a recovery program at home compare to one in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation)?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- For people recovering from a heart attack, heart surgery, or heart failure, recovery programs at home seem to work as well as programs in a hospital or clinic (cardiac rehabilitation). Evidence up to 1 year shows similar results for both on survival and how well people can exercise. Evidence up to 2 years shows similar results for quality of life. The studies did not report on unwanted or harmful effects, so we could not compare them.\n- Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects (beyond 1 year) of these programs and to find out if home-based programs are also suitable for people with other kinds of heart conditions.\n\nWhat helps people recover from heart problems?\nDiseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease) are the most common cause of death worldwide. After a heart attack, heart surgery, or other heart problem, doctors often offer people 'cardiac rehabilitation'. These are programmes of exercise, education, and support that help people recover, improve their health, and prevent future heart problems. Traditionally, people attend these programmes in a group setting at a hospital or community centre ('centre-based'). However, to make it easier for more people to take part, researchers have developed programmes that people can follow in their own homes ('home-based'), sometimes with support from healthcare staff via phone or the internet.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if home-based cardiac rehabilitation is as effective as supervised, centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. We compared the two approaches by looking at their effects on death and illness, how well people can exercise, their quality of life, and other risk factors for heart disease.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies called randomised controlled trials, where people are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.\n\nHow did we assess the evidence?\nWe combined the results from all the studies and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThis review included 24 studies with 3046 adults who had a heart attack, heart surgery, or heart failure. The studies compared home-based recovery programs with supervised programs in a hospital or clinic. Most studies were short-term, lasting up to 12 months, and only 3 studies looked at outcomes beyond this period.\n\nFor people with heart disease, recovery programs at home supported by healthcare staff seem to work as well as programs in a hospital or clinic.\n- For up to 1 year, home-based programs may make little to no difference to the number of deaths or how well people can exercise.\n- For up to 2 years, they may make little to no difference to quality of life.\n\nBeyond 1 year, home-based programs probably make little to no difference to how well people can exercise. Similar numbers of people may complete both home-based and centre-based programs.\n\nHow reliable is the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low. Many studies did not provide enough detail about their methods, making it hard to judge if their results are reliable. We also did not find enough studies to be certain about the long-term effects of the programs.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and meets most of our guidelines. The readability scores are excellent. I have three suggestions to make it even more precise and easier for readers to understand before approval.\n\n1. **Use more precise language for medical procedures.**\n   - **The issue:** In the 'Key Messages' and 'What did we find?' sections, the text uses the term \"heart surgery.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is an imprecise simplification of \"revascularisation,\" which includes both surgical procedures (like bypass) and non-surgical ones (like inserting a stent). A patient who had a stent may not consider it \"surgery\" and could be confused about whether this evidence applies to them.\n   - **Suggested change:** Replace \"heart surgery\" with a more inclusive phrase. For example, change \"...recovering from a heart attack, heart surgery, or heart failure...\" to \"...recovering from a heart attack, heart failure, or after a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart (like bypass surgery or inserting a stent).\"\n\n2. **Use active voice to clarify who is doing the action.**\n   - **The issue:** The methods section contains passive voice: \"...where people are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Passive voice can make text feel less direct. It's clearer to state who is performing the action, which in this case is the researchers.\n   - **Suggested change:** Rewrite the sentence in active voice. For example: \"...where researchers randomly assign people to one of two treatment groups.\"\n\n3. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with strong verbs.**\n   - **The issue:** The first sentence of the background section is noun-heavy: \"Diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease) are the most common cause of death worldwide.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Sentences built around the verb 'to be' are less direct than sentences with strong action verbs. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which flagged a high number of nouns and nominalizations.\n   - **Suggested change:** Rephrase the sentence to use a more active verb. For example: \"Diseases of the heart and blood vessels, known as cardiovascular disease, cause the most deaths worldwide.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 83.3% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. The text is well under the word count and has excellent readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade 8.5). However, the analysis identified two areas for improvement: the number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) and the total noun count are both in the 90th percentile, suggesting some sentences could be more direct and verb-driven."
