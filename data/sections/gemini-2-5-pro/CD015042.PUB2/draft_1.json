  "draft": "What are the effects of talking therapies (psychosocial interventions) and medicines for helping pregnant people stop or drink less alcohol?\n\nKey messages\n- Brief talking therapies may help pregnant people to stop drinking alcohol completely, but it is uncertain if they help to reduce the amount of alcohol consumed. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of these therapies.\n- The review found no studies that looked at the effects of medicines for helping pregnant people stop or drink less alcohol.\n- More research is needed to understand the effects and safety of both talking therapies and medicines, especially for pregnant people with more severe drinking problems (known as alcohol use disorder).\n\nWhy is it important to address drinking alcohol during pregnancy?\nDrinking alcohol during pregnancy can be harmful to the unborn baby. Despite the known risks, it is common for people to drink alcohol while pregnant, with about 1 in 10 doing so globally. To help pregnant people stop or reduce their drinking, different types of support can be offered. These include talking therapies, such as counselling or brief advice sessions (known as psychosocial interventions), and medications.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how effective psychosocial interventions and medications are at helping pregnant people to stop or reduce drinking alcohol.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared psychosocial support or medications with usual care for helping pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found eight studies with a total of 1369 pregnant women who consumed alcohol. Six studies were conducted in the USA, one in Spain, and one in the Netherlands. In one study, nearly half of the participants had a current diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and in another, 40% had a lifetime diagnosis of AUD. All studies assessed brief talking therapies (psychosocial interventions), which ranged from a single 10- to 60-minute session to five 10-minute sessions. These interventions were compared to usual care. We did not find any studies that assessed medications for this purpose.\n\nMain results: Brief talking therapies for pregnant women who drink alcohol\nFor pregnant women who drink alcohol, brief talking therapies may increase the number of women who stop drinking alcohol completely. These interventions probably make little to no difference to the number of women who complete the treatment. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of these interventions on the number of drinks consumed per day. We do not know if these interventions cause any unwanted effects because none of the included studies looked at this.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. Additionally, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-written. However, it cannot be approved because several subheadings do not follow the mandatory question format required by the style guide. Addressing this and a few minor clarity issues will make the summary ready for publication.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions.**\nThe style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions to help guide the reader. Several current subheadings are statements.\n- **Current:** \"Methods\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\"\n- **Suggestion:** Please change these to questions, for example: \"How did we conduct the review?\", \"How reliable is the evidence?\", and \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n2. **Simplify the 'Limitations' section for easier reading.**\nThe first sentence in this section is quite long and contains multiple ideas, which can be hard to follow.\n- **Current:** \"We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\"\n- **Suggestion:** Break this into shorter, more direct sentences. For example: \"Our confidence in the evidence is low. This is because people in the studies may have known which treatment they received, which could affect the results. Also, some studies did not report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\"\n\n3. **Ensure consistent terminology for participants.**\nThe text alternates between \"pregnant people\" and \"pregnant women\". While both are acceptable, using one term consistently improves readability.\n- **Current:** The title uses \"pregnant people,\" but the 'What did we find?' section uses \"1369 pregnant women.\"\n- **Suggestion:** Choose one term and use it throughout the summary. For example, change \"1369 pregnant women\" to \"1369 pregnant people\" to match the title.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 17 of 18 metrics falling within the median or best quartile ranges. Readability scores and sentence length are excellent (P25). The only minor deviation is a slightly high count of long words (P90), which is likely due to necessary technical terms like 'psychosocial' and 'interventions' that are appropriately explained."
