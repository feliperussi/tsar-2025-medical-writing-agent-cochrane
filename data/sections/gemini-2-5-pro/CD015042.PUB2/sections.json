  "key_messages": [
    "Brief talking therapies may help pregnant people to stop drinking alcohol completely, but it is uncertain if they help to reduce the amount of alcohol consumed. The studies did not report on any unwanted or harmful effects of these therapies.",
    "The review found no studies that looked at the effects of medicines for helping pregnant people stop or drink less alcohol.",
    "More research is needed to understand the effects and safety of both talking therapies and medicines, especially for pregnant people with more severe drinking problems (known as alcohol use disorder)."

      "subheading": "Why is it important to address drinking alcohol during pregnancy?",
      "content": "Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can be harmful to the unborn baby. Despite the known risks, it is common for people to drink alcohol while pregnant, with about 1 in 10 doing so globally. To help pregnant people stop or reduce their drinking, different types of support can be offered. These include talking therapies, such as counselling or brief advice sessions (known as psychosocial interventions), and medications."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out how effective psychosocial interventions and medications are at helping pregnant people to stop or reduce drinking alcohol."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared psychosocial support or medications with usual care for helping pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol. We then combined and summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."
    }
  ],
  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found eight studies with a total of 1369 pregnant women who consumed alcohol. Six studies were conducted in the USA, one in Spain, and one in the Netherlands. In one study, nearly half of the participants had a current diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and in another, 40% had a lifetime diagnosis of AUD. All studies assessed brief talking therapies (psychosocial interventions), which ranged from a single 10- to 60-minute session to five 10-minute sessions. These interventions were compared to usual care. We did not find any studies that assessed medications for this purpose."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Brief talking therapies for pregnant women who drink alcohol",
      "content": "For pregnant women who drink alcohol, brief talking therapies may increase the number of women who stop drinking alcohol completely. These interventions probably make little to no difference to the number of women who complete the treatment. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of these interventions on the number of drinks consumed per day. We do not know if these interventions cause any unwanted effects because none of the included studies looked at this."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. Additionally, there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2024."
