  "key_messages": [
    "When people use decision aids (tools that explain the pros and cons of medical options), they feel more knowledgeable, are clearer about what matters to them, and are more involved in making the decision. They are also more likely to make choices that are consistent with their personal values. The review found no difference in feelings of regret about the decision.",
    "Further studies are needed to understand if using decision aids affects whether people follow through with their chosen treatment, and the impact on healthcare costs and resources."

      "subheading": "What are patient decision aids?",
      "content": "People often face difficult decisions about their health, such as choosing a treatment or deciding whether to have a screening test. Patient decision aids are tools designed to help people make these choices. These tools explain the decision clearly, provide evidence-based information about the different options (including their benefits and harms), and help people think about what is most important to them and their own personal values."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if using patient decision aids helps adults make better health decisions compared to the usual care they get from their healthcare provider. We were interested in whether decision aids improve people's knowledge, help them make choices that align with their personal values, and increase their involvement in the decision-making process. We also wanted to know if there were any unwanted effects, such as people regretting their choice."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 209 studies involving a total of 107,698 adults. These studies compared patient decision aids to usual care for 71 different health decisions. The most common decisions were about cardiovascular treatments, cancer screening (for colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer), cancer treatments, mental health treatments, and joint replacement surgery. Compared to usual care, patient decision aids probably help more people make choices that are in line with their personal values. Patient decision aids cause a large increase in people's knowledge about their health options and their ability to accurately understand the risks. They also cause a large reduction in people feeling uninformed, reduce indecision about personal values, and reduce the number of people who are passive in making decisions about their health. Using a decision aid makes little to no difference to whether people regret their decision."

  "limitations": "Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns that it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and that not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search."
