  "draft": "Can decision aids (tools that explain the pros and cons of medical options) help people make choices about treatments or screening tests?\n\nKey messages\n- When people use decision aids (tools that explain the pros and cons of medical options), they feel more knowledgeable, are clearer about what matters to them, and are more involved in making the decision. They are also more likely to make choices that are consistent with their personal values. The review found no difference in feelings of regret about the decision.\n- Further studies are needed to understand if using decision aids affects whether people follow through with their chosen treatment, and the impact on healthcare costs and resources.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat are patient decision aids?\nPeople often face difficult decisions about their health, such as choosing a treatment or deciding whether to have a screening test. Patient decision aids are tools designed to help people make these choices. These tools explain the decision clearly, provide evidence-based information about the different options (including their benefits and harms), and help people think about what is most important to them and their own personal values.\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using patient decision aids helps adults make better health decisions compared to the usual care they get from their healthcare provider. We were interested in whether decision aids improve people's knowledge, help them make choices that align with their personal values, and increase their involvement in the decision-making process. We also wanted to know if there were any unwanted effects, such as people regretting their choice.\n\nMethods\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched for studies that compared using patient decision aids with usual care for adults making health decisions.\nStudy Selection\nWe included studies that met our eligibility criteria and directly compared patient decision aids to usual care.\nData Synthesis\nWe combined the results of these studies using meta‑analysis techniques to estimate overall effects.\nConfidence Rating\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 209 studies involving a total of 107,698 adults. These studies compared patient decision aids to usual care for 71 different health decisions. The most common decisions were about cardiovascular treatments, cancer screening (for colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer), cancer treatments, mental health treatments, and joint replacement surgery. Compared to usual care, patient decision aids probably help more people make choices that are in line with their personal values. Patient decision aids cause a large increase in people's knowledge about their health options and their ability to accurately understand the risks. They also cause a large reduction in people feeling uninformed, reduce indecision about personal values, and reduce the number of people who are passive in making decisions about their health. Using a decision aid makes little to no difference to whether people regret their decision.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns that it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and that not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "This draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it fails a critical style guide rule and has several areas where clarity can be significantly improved for a lay audience. The main issue is that most subheadings are not phrased as questions, as required. Additionally, some sentences in the results and methods sections are too long, technical, and noun-heavy, which can make them difficult for readers to understand. \n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase all subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires subheadings to be questions to help guide the reader. Many current subheadings are just labels.\n   - **Problematic Subheadings:** \"Methods\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\".\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Change these to questions like \"How did we conduct this review?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", and \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\". The sub-headings under 'Methods' should be removed and the section written as a simple paragraph.\n\n2. **Simplify long, complex sentences in the results.** One key sentence is over 45 words long and uses abstract nouns instead of simple verbs, making it hard to follow.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** \"Patient decision aids cause a large increase in people's knowledge about their health options and their ability to accurately understand the risks. They also cause a large reduction in people feeling uninformed, reduce indecision about personal values, and reduce the number of people who are passive in making decisions about their health.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Patient decision aids greatly increased people's knowledge of their health options and their ability to understand risks. People using them felt more informed, were more certain about what was important to them, and took a more active role in making decisions.\"\n\n3. **Remove technical jargon from the Methods section.** Terms like 'meta-analysis' and 'GRADE' are meaningless to a lay audience and make the section unhelpful.\n   - **Problematic Phrases:** \"...using meta‑analysis techniques to estimate overall effects\" and \"...using the GRADE approach.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Combine the methods section into a single, simple paragraph. For example: \"We searched for studies that compared patient decision aids with usual care. We then combined the results of these studies and used a standard method to rate our confidence in the evidence.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 50% of features falling into the best quartile. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid (11.64) are strong. However, the analysis also highlights significant deviation in three key areas related to vocabulary complexity. The counts for nouns (171), Dale-Chall complex words (223), and long words (173) are all in the P90 range, indicating the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex and long words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This supports the editorial recommendation to simplify sentence structures and replace abstract nouns with simpler verbs."
