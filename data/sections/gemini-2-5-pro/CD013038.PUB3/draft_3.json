  "draft": "For babies born early who are fed through a tube, can letting them smell and taste milk help them learn to feed by mouth sooner?\n\nKey messages\n- For babies born early who are fed through a tube, letting them smell and taste milk seems to have little to no effect on how long it takes them to learn to feed fully by mouth. The review also found no clear difference in harmful effects, such as serious gut problems or infections.\n- The evidence is not strong because the studies were small and had limitations in their methods. Future, larger studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of this practice on feeding skills, safety, and growth in babies born early.\n\nWhy do babies born early have feeding problems?\nBabies born early (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), known as preterm infants, are often not developed enough to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing all at once. This means they cannot feed from a breast or bottle right away. To get the nutrition they need to grow, they are fed milk through a soft tube that goes through their nose or mouth into their stomach. A problem with tube feeding is that the baby misses out on the smell and taste of the milk. These senses are believed to play an important role in helping the body get ready to digest food. It is thought that providing the smell and taste of milk during tube feeds could help these babies transition to feeding by mouth sooner.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if letting babies born early smell or taste (or both) breastmilk or formula while they were being tube-fed could help them learn to feed fully by mouth more quickly. We also wanted to know if this approach had any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving babies born early the smell or taste of milk during tube feeds against not giving it. We combined and summarized the results, and then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved a total of 1277 babies born early. These studies compared letting infants smell or taste (or both) breastmilk or formula during tube feeds against not doing so. Letting babies born early smell and taste milk while they are being tube-fed may have little to no effect on the time it takes for them to be able to feed fully by mouth. However, the evidence is very uncertain. This approach probably makes little to no difference to the risk of developing a late infection. It may also make little to no difference to the length of time infants need nutrition given through a vein or to the risk of a serious gut problem. The evidence is also very uncertain about whether it affects the time it takes to reach full tube feeds. The review found no information about whether this practice causes feeding problems, such as vomiting or a swollen belly (known as feeding intolerance).\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. This is because in some studies, the people involved may have known which treatment the babies received. Also, the studies were small and used different methods.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very clear and well-written summary that is close to approval. The readability scores are excellent. However, a few revisions are needed to improve clarity and adhere to Cochrane style guidelines before it can be approved. The main issue is a pattern of using passive voice, which makes the text less direct.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Change passive voice to active voice.** The summary frequently uses passive constructions, which can make sentences less direct. The goal is to clearly state who is performing the action.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"It is thought that providing the smell and taste of milk during tube feeds could help these babies transition to feeding by mouth sooner.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** It's unclear who is doing the thinking. Using the active voice makes this more direct and authoritative.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Researchers think that providing the smell and taste of milk during tube feeds could help these babies transition to feeding by mouth sooner.\"\n\n2. **Remove unnecessary technical terms.** You do an excellent job of explaining concepts in plain language. Including the technical term in parentheses after the explanation can add unnecessary clutter.\n   - **Problematic phrase:** \"...babies born early (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), known as preterm infants...\" and \"...a swollen belly (known as feeding intolerance).\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The plain language descriptions are clear enough on their own. The technical terms are not needed for a patient audience and slightly disrupt the reading flow.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Simply remove the parenthetical phrases: \"Babies born early (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) are often not developed enough...\" and \"...causes feeding problems, such as vomiting or a swollen belly.\"\n\n3. **Improve clarity in the limitations section.** The description of the study limitations is a bit vague and could be more specific to help the reader understand the potential for bias.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"This is because in some studies, the people involved may have known which treatment the babies received.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** \"The people involved\" is not specific. It's more helpful to state who knew (e.g., parents, staff) as this clarifies how the results might have been influenced.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This is because in some studies, parents and healthcare staff may have known which treatment the babies received, which could have influenced the results.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft HIGHLY CONFORMS to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. The readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 7.5) are excellent. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the use of passive voice is in the 90th percentile (22 instances). This metric supports the editorial recommendation to convert passive sentences to active voice to improve directness and align with Cochrane style."
