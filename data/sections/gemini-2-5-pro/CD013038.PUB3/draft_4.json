  "draft": "For babies born early who are fed through a tube, can letting them smell and taste milk help them learn to feed by mouth sooner?\n\nKey messages\n- For babies born early who are fed through a tube, letting them smell and taste milk seems to have little to no effect on how long it takes them to learn to feed fully by mouth. The review also found no clear difference in harmful effects, such as serious gut problems or infections.\n- The evidence is not strong because the studies were small and had limitations in their methods. Future, larger studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of this practice on feeding skills, safety, and growth in babies born early.\n\nWhy do babies born early have feeding problems?\nBabies born early (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) are often not developed enough to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing all at once. This means they cannot feed from a breast or bottle right away. To get the nutrition they need to grow, healthcare staff feed them milk through a soft tube that goes through their nose or mouth into their stomach. A problem with tube feeding is that the baby misses out on the smell and taste of the milk. Researchers believe these senses play an important role in helping the body get ready to digest food. Researchers think that providing the smell and taste of milk during tube feeds could help these babies transition to feeding by mouth sooner.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if letting babies born early smell or taste (or both) breastmilk or formula while they received tube feeds could help them learn to feed fully by mouth more quickly. We also wanted to know if this approach had any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving babies born early the smell or taste of milk during tube feeds against not giving it. We combined and summarized the results, and then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved a total of 1277 babies born early. These studies compared letting infants smell or taste (or both) breastmilk or formula during tube feeds against not doing so. Letting babies born early smell and taste milk while they receive tube feeds may have little to no effect on the time it takes for them to be able to feed fully by mouth. However, the evidence is very uncertain. This approach probably makes little to no difference to the risk of developing a late infection. It may also make little to no difference to the length of time infants need nutrition they receive through a vein or to the risk of a serious gut problem. The evidence is also very uncertain about whether it affects the time it takes to reach full tube feeds. The review found no information about whether this practice causes feeding problems, such as vomiting or a swollen belly.\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. This is because in some studies, parents and healthcare staff may have known which treatment the babies received, which could have influenced the results. Also, the studies were small and used different methods.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong, highly readable draft that meets all critical checks for structure and accuracy. The readability scores are excellent. However, it's not approved because it consistently misses opportunities to connect its excellent plain language descriptions with the specific medical terms that parents and caregivers are likely to hear from their healthcare team. Adding these terms in parentheses will make the summary much more useful. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Clarify the term for the serious gut problem.**\n   - **Current sentence:** \"The review also found no clear difference in harmful effects, such as serious gut problems or infections.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** While 'serious gut problems' ' is good plain language, parents will likely hear the specific medical term from their doctors. Not including it here is a missed opportunity to help them connect the information.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The review also found no clear difference in harmful effects, such as a serious gut problem (necrotising enterocolitis) or serious infections.\"\n\n2. **Define the term for nutrition given through a vein.**\n   - **Current sentence:** \"It may also make little to no difference to the length of time infants need nutrition they receive through a vein or to the risk of a serious gut problem.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Similar to the first point, 'nutrition they receive through a vein' is a great description, but linking it to the medical term 'parenteral nutrition' empowers the reader to understand clinical discussions.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"It may also make little to no difference to the length of time infants need nutrition they receive through a vein (parenteral nutrition) or to the risk of a serious gut problem.\"\n\n3. **Be more precise about the lack of data on feeding problems.**\n   - **Current sentence:** \"The review found no information about the whether this practice causes feeding problems, such as vomiting or a swollen belly.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is slightly vague. The issue isn't that there's 'no information' in general, but that the included studies did not report on this specific outcome. It's also another chance to introduce a relevant medical term.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies did not report on whether this practice caused feeding problems (known as feeding intolerance), such as vomiting or a swollen belly.\"\n\nThe PLS evaluation results are excellent, showing the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the best quartile or median ranges, with no significant deviations. Readability scores like the Flesch‑Kincaid Grade (7.53) and words per sentence (17.76) are in the best quartile (P25), indicating the text is significantly easier to read than most summaries in the corpus. The issues identified are related to content clarity and linking to clinical terminology, which are not captured by these linguistic metrics.",
