  "draft": "For babies born early who are fed through a tube, can letting them smell and taste milk help them learn to feed by mouth sooner?\n\nKey messages\n- For babies born early who are fed through a tube, letting them smell and taste milk seems to have little to no effect on how long it takes them to learn to feed fully by mouth. The review also found no clear difference in harmful effects, such as a serious gut problem (necrotising enterocolitis) or serious infections.\n- The evidence is not strong because the studies were small and had limitations in their methods. Future, larger studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of this practice on feeding skills, safety, and growth in babies born at different stages of early pregnancy.\n\nWhy do babies born early have feeding problems?\nBabies born early (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), known as preterm infants, are often not developed enough to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing all at once. This means they cannot feed from a breast or bottle right away. To get the nutrition they need to grow, they are fed milk through a soft tube that goes through their nose or mouth into their stomach. A problem with tube feeding is that the baby misses out on the smell and taste of the milk. These senses are believed to play an important role in helping the body get ready to digest food. It is thought that providing the smell and taste of milk during tube feeds could help these babies transition to feeding by mouth sooner.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if exposing preterm infants to the smell or taste (or both) of breastmilk or formula while they were being tube-fed could help them learn to feed fully by mouth more quickly. We also wanted to know if this approach had any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared giving preterm infants the smell or taste of milk during tube feeds against not giving it. We combined and summarized the results, and then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included eight studies involving a total of 1277 preterm infants. The studies evaluated exposing infants to the smell or taste (or both) of breastmilk or formula during tube feeds compared to no exposure. Exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk while they are being tube-fed may have little to no effect on the time it takes for them to be able to feed fully by mouth, but the evidence is very uncertain. This approach probably makes little to no difference to the risk of developing a late infection. It may also make little to no difference to the length of time infants need nutrition given through a vein or to the risk of a serious gut problem. The evidence is also very uncertain about whether it affects the time it takes to reach full tube feeds. The review found no information about whether this practice causes feeding intolerance.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were very small, and they used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nCurrency of the evidence\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-written. However, it is not approved because it fails a critical check: several subheadings do not follow the required question format. Addressing this and a few other minor clarity issues will make the summary even more accessible to readers.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rewrite subheadings as questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions to better guide the reader. Three subheadings are currently statements.\n   - **Original:** \"Methods\", \"Limitations of the evidence\", \"Currency of the evidence\"\n   - **Problem:** These statement-style headings are less engaging and violate a key structural rule in the style guide.\n   - **Suggestion:** Change them to questions. For example:\n     - \"Methods\" → \"What did we do in this review?\"\n     - \"Limitations of the evidence\" → \"How reliable is this evidence?\"\n     - \"Currency of the evidence\" → \"How up to date is this evidence?\"\n\n2. **Simplify the main finding by splitting a long sentence.** The first sentence of the results section is 38 words long and combines the main finding with the level of certainty, which can be hard for readers to process at once.\n   - **Original:** \"Exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk while they are being tube-fed may have little to no effect on the time it takes for them to be able to feed fully by mouth, but the evidence is very uncertain.\"\n   - **Problem:** This sentence is long and complex, making a key message difficult to absorb.\n   - **Suggestion:** Break it into two shorter, more direct sentences.\n     - \"Letting preterm infants smell and taste milk during tube-feeding may have little to no effect on how long it takes them to feed fully by mouth. However, the evidence for this is very uncertain.\"\n\n3. **Define the technical term \"feeding intolerance\".** This term is used at the end of the results section without any explanation, which may confuse readers.\n   - **Original:** \"The review found no information about whether this practice causes feeding intolerance.\"\n   - **Problem:** A lay reader is unlikely to know what \"feeding intolerance\" means in this context.\n   - **Suggestion:** Add a brief, simple explanation in parentheses.\n     - \"The review found no information about whether this practice caused feeding problems, such as vomiting or a swollen belly (known as feeding intolerance).\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical linguistic patterns, with 94.4% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and simplicity. Key readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (9.47) and average words per sentence (21.74) are excellent. The only minor deviations are the counts for passive voice and nominalizations, which are in the P75 range. This indicates a slightly higher use of passive phrasing and noun-form verbs than is typical, supporting the editorial feedback to favor more direct, active language where possible."
