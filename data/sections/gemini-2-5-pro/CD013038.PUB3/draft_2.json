  "draft": "For babies born early who are fed through a tube, can letting them smell and taste milk help them learn to feed by mouth sooner?\n\nKey messages\n- For babies born early who are fed through a tube, letting them smell and taste milk seems to have little to no effect on how long it takes them to learn to feed fully by mouth. The review also found no clear difference in harmful effects, such as a serious gut problem (necrotising enterocolitis) or serious infections.\n- The evidence is not strong because the studies were small and had limitations in their methods. Future, larger studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of this practice on feeding skills, safety, and growth in babies born at different stages of early pregnancy.\n\nWhy do babies born early have feeding problems?\nBabies born early (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), known as preterm infants, are often not developed enough to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing all at once. This means they cannot feed from a breast or bottle right away. To get the nutrition they need to grow, they are fed milk through a soft tube that goes through their nose or mouth into their stomach. A problem with tube feeding is that the baby misses out on the smell and taste of the milk. These senses are believed to play an important role in helping the body get ready to digest food. It is thought that providing the smell and taste of milk during tube feeds could help these babies transition to feeding by mouth sooner.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if letting preterm infants smell or taste (or both) breastmilk or formula while they were being tube-fed could help them learn to feed fully by mouth more quickly. We also wanted to know if this approach had any unwanted or harmful effects.\n\nWhat did we do in this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving preterm infants the smell or taste of milk during tube feeds against not giving it. We combined and summarized the results, and then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved a total of 1277 preterm infants. These studies compared letting infants smell or taste (or both) breastmilk or formula during tube feeds against not doing so. Letting preterm infants smell and taste milk while they are being tube-fed may have little to no effect on the time it takes for them to be able to feed fully by mouth. However, the evidence is very uncertain. This approach probably makes little to no difference to the risk of developing a late infection. It may also make little to no difference to the length of time infants need nutrition given through a vein or to the risk of a serious gut problem. The evidence is also very uncertain about whether it affects the time it takes to reach full tube feeds. The review found no information about whether this practice causes feeding problems, such as vomiting or a swollen belly (known as feeding intolerance).\n\nHow reliable is this evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were very small, and they used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very clear and well-written summary, but a few final refinements are needed to make it even better for readers. Here are the top 3 suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify the Key Message by removing technical jargon.** The key messages should be the most accessible part of the summary. Introducing a complex term right at the start can be a barrier for some readers.\n   - **Original sentence:** '...harmful effects, such as a serious gut problem (necrotising enterocolitis) or serious infections.'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** '...harmful effects, such as serious gut problems or infections.'\n\n2. **Use consistent, plain language terminology.** The summary uses 'babies born early', 'preterm infants', and 'babies born at different stages of early pregnancy'. Sticking to one simple term after the initial definition improves readability.\n   - **Example:** After defining 'preterm infants' once, use the simpler term 'babies born early' consistently throughout the rest of the text.\n   - **Suggested rewrite (in Key Message 2):** '...in babies born at different stages of early pregnancy.' should become '...in babies born early.'\n\n3. **Use more direct, active language in the limitations section.** The current phrasing is a bit passive and wordy, which can make the limitations harder to grasp.\n   - **Original sentence:** 'We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting...'\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'We have low confidence in the evidence. This is because in some studies, the people involved may have known which treatment the babies received. Also, the studies were small and used different methods.'\n\nThese changes will help ensure the summary is as clear and easy to follow as possible for all readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the best quartile for readability and style (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 8.3, average sentence length of 19 words). This indicates the text is generally very easy to read. The passive voice count (15 instances) is within the typical range but on the higher side (P75), supporting the recommendation to convert key sentences to active voice for better clarity."
