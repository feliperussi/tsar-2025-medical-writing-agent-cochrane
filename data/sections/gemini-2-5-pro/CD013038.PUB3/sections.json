  "key_messages": [
    "For babies born early who are fed through a tube, letting them smell and taste milk seems to have little to no effect on how long it takes them to learn to feed fully by mouth. The review also found no clear difference in harmful effects, such as a serious gut problem (necrotising enterocolitis) or serious infections.",
    "The evidence is not strong because the studies were small and had limitations in their methods. Future, larger studies are needed to be more certain about the effects of this practice on feeding skills, safety, and growth in babies born at different stages of early pregnancy."

      "subheading": "Why do babies born early have feeding problems?",
      "content": "Babies born early (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), known as preterm infants, are often not developed enough to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing all at once. This means they cannot feed from a breast or bottle right away. To get the nutrition they need to grow, they are fed milk through a soft tube that goes through their nose or mouth into their stomach. A problem with tube feeding is that the baby misses out on the smell and taste of the milk. These senses are believed to play an important role in helping the body get ready to digest food. It is thought that providing the smell and taste of milk during tube feeds could help these babies transition to feeding by mouth sooner."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "We wanted to find out if exposing preterm infants to the smell or taste (or both) of breastmilk or formula while they were being tube-fed could help them learn to feed fully by mouth more quickly. We also wanted to know if this approach had any unwanted or harmful effects."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared giving preterm infants the smell or taste of milk during tube feeds against not giving it. We combined and summarized the results, and then rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included eight studies involving a total of 1277 preterm infants. The studies evaluated exposing infants to the smell or taste (or both) of breastmilk or formula during tube feeds compared to no exposure. Exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk while they are being tube-fed may have little to no effect on the time it takes for them to be able to feed fully by mouth, but the evidence is very uncertain. This approach probably makes little to no difference to the risk of developing a late infection. It may also make little to no difference to the length of time infants need nutrition given through a vein or to the risk of a serious gut problem. The evidence is also very uncertain about whether it affects the time it takes to reach full tube feeds. The review found no information about whether this practice causes feeding intolerance."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were very small, and they used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to April 2023."
