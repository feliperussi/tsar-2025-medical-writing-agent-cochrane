  "draft": "Do primary health‑care workers (e.g., nurses) and community health workers help prevent mental illness and improve well‑being in low‑ and middle‑income countries?\n\nKey messages\n- Primary‑level health workers and community health workers can deliver mental‑health promotion and prevention programmes that lead to small improvements in anxiety, depression, distress/post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and quality of life, and may reduce functional impairment (difficulty doing daily activities) and adverse events (unwanted side effects). No increase in harms was reported, but the evidence is limited and of low quality.\n- The modest benefits are seen across universal prevention (offered to everyone), selective prevention (targeting higher‑risk groups) and indicated prevention (early‑sign interventions), and in both adults and children, although the size of the effect varies between studies.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm which approaches work best and to understand potential harms and costs.\n\nWhy is mental health promotion and prevention needed in low‑ and middle‑income countries?\nMany people in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) experience mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We see reduced quality of life, difficulty working or studying, and higher risk of other health issues. LMICs often have few trained mental‑health professionals, unequal distribution of resources, and strong stigma that stops people from seeking help. Because of these barriers, researchers are exploring ways to prevent mental disorders before they start (universal prevention), to target groups at higher risk (selective prevention), or to intervene early when early signs appear (indicated prevention). One promising approach is task‑shifting, where primary‑level health workers (e.g., nurses, doctors in first‑line clinics) and community health workers (people from the community trained to provide basic health services) deliver mental‑health programmes.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about primary‑level and community worker interventions?\nWe wanted to know whether interventions delivered by primary‑level or community health workers can effectively promote mental well‑being and prevent mental disorders in LMICs. Specifically, we examined (1) how well these programmes improve mental‑health outcomes for adults and children across universal, selective and indicated prevention, and (2) whether using these workers affects health‑care use and costs compared with usual care or other controls.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared primary‑level or community‑worker mental‑health promotion or prevention programmes with any control condition in LMICs. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 113 studies that together included 32,992 participants from low‑, lower‑middle‑, upper‑middle‑ and mixed‑income countries. The studies involved 83 adult trials and 30 child trials. Primary‑level health workers delivered the programmes in 38 studies, community workers in 71 studies, both types in 2 studies, and the worker type was not reported in 2 studies. The interventions were classified as universal prevention/promotion in 22 studies, selective prevention in 36 studies and indicated prevention in 55 studies.\nOverall, the evidence suggests that programmes delivered by primary‑level or community health workers provide small mental‑health benefits.\n- In adults, the programmes probably reduce anxiety a little and may lower depressive symptoms when used for selective prevention. They may also slightly reduce distress or PTSD symptoms, reduce adverse events and improve functional ability.\n- In children, the programmes may slightly improve quality of life and may reduce adverse events, depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms.\n- For selective prevention in children, the programmes probably reduce depressive symptoms and distress/PTSD symptoms a little, and may also reduce anxiety a little.\n- For indicated prevention in children, the programmes may slightly reduce functional impairment, depressive symptoms and distress/PTSD symptoms.\nWe have limited confidence in many of the studies because participants often knew which treatment they received, not all outcomes were reported, and the studies varied in populations and delivery methods.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because (1) participants were often aware of their treatment group, (2) many studies did not report all outcomes of interest, and (3) the studies involved different types of people and used varied delivery methods.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to November 2021, the date of our most recent search.",

They may also slightly lower distress or PTSD symptoms, reduce adverse events, and improve functional ability.\"\n2. **Passive voice and nominalisation** – many statements describe actions passively, e.g., \"The programmes were delivered by primary‑level health workers…\" which obscures who did what. *Rewrite*: \"Primary‑level health workers delivered the programmes…\"\n3. **Unexplained jargon** – the term *task‑shifting* appears without a plain‑language definition. Readers may not understand this concept. *Rewrite*: \"Task‑shifting, where tasks normally done by specialists are shared with trained primary‑level or community health workers, …\"\n4. **Technical term without lay definition** – *functional impairment* is used without explanation. *Rewrite*: \"functional impairment (difficulty doing everyday activities)\".\nThese issues reduce readability for patients and conflict with the style guide’s emphasis on active voice, short sentences, and plain language. The PLS evaluation also flags high passive voice (22, P90), excessive nominalisation (36, BEYOND_P90) and many long/complex words, confirming the editorial concerns. To meet Cochrane PLS standards, the draft should be revised to address the points above before it can be approved.",
