  "draft": "Do primary health‑care workers (e.g., nurses) and community health workers help prevent mental illness and improve well‑being in low‑ and middle‑income countries?\n\nKey messages\n- Primary‑level health workers (such as nurses or clinic doctors) and community health workers (people from the community trained to provide basic health services) can deliver mental‑health promotion and prevention programmes that lead to small improvements in anxiety, depression, distress or post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and quality of life. They may also reduce functional impairment (difficulty doing everyday activities) and adverse events (unwanted side effects). No increase in harms was reported, but the evidence is limited and of low quality.\n- These modest benefits were seen across universal prevention (offered to everyone), selective prevention (targeting higher‑risk groups) and indicated prevention (early‑sign interventions), and in both adults and children, although the size of the effect varied between studies.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm which approaches work best and to understand any potential harms or costs.\n\nWhy is mental‑health promotion and prevention needed in low‑ and middle‑income countries?\nMany people in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) experience anxiety, depression, or post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These conditions lower quality of life, make it harder to work or study, and increase the risk of other health problems. LMICs often have few trained mental‑health professionals, unequal distribution of resources, and strong stigma that stops people from seeking help. Because of these barriers, researchers are exploring ways to prevent mental disorders before they start (universal prevention), to target groups at higher risk (selective prevention), or to intervene early when early signs appear (indicated prevention). One promising approach is task‑shifting, where tasks normally done by specialists are shared with trained primary‑level or community health workers.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about primary‑level and community worker interventions?\nWe wanted to know whether programmes delivered by primary‑level health workers or community health workers can effectively promote mental well‑being and prevent mental disorders in LMICs. Specifically, we examined (1) how well these programmes improve mental‑health outcomes for adults and children across universal, selective and indicated prevention, and (2) whether using these workers affects health‑care use and costs compared with usual care or other controls.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared primary‑level or community‑worker mental‑health promotion or prevention programmes with any control condition in LMICs. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 113 studies that together included 32,992 participants from low‑, lower‑middle‑, upper‑middle‑ and mixed‑income countries. The studies involved 83 adult trials and 30 child trials. Primary‑level health workers delivered the programmes in 38 studies, community workers in 71 studies, both types in 2 studies, and the worker type was not reported in 2 studies. The interventions were classified as universal prevention/promotion in 22 studies, selective prevention in 36 studies and indicated prevention in 55 studies.\nOverall, the programmes probably provide small mental‑health benefits.\nIn adults, the programmes probably reduce anxiety a little and, when used for selective prevention, probably reduce depressive symptoms a little. They may also slightly lower distress or PTSD symptoms, reduce adverse events, and improve functional ability.\nIn children, the programmes may slightly improve quality of life and may reduce adverse events, depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. For selective prevention in children, the programmes probably reduce depressive symptoms and distress or PTSD symptoms a little, and may also reduce anxiety a little. For indicated prevention in children, the programmes may slightly reduce functional impairment, depressive symptoms and distress or PTSD symptoms.\nWe have limited confidence in many of the studies because participants often knew which treatment they received, not all outcomes were reported, and the studies varied in populations and delivery methods.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because (1) participants were often aware of their treatment group, (2) many studies did not report all outcomes of interest, and (3) the studies involved different types of people and used varied delivery methods.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to November 2021, the date of our most recent search.",

In addition, the text contains several clarity‑reducing problems:\n1. **Passive voice** – e.g., “The programmes were delivered by primary‑level health workers …” makes it harder for readers to see who is doing what.\n2. **Nominalisations and noun‑heavy sentences** – e.g., “The confidence in many of these studies was limited” uses abstract nouns instead of clear actions.\n3. **Long, complex sentences** – e.g., “Because of these barriers, researchers are exploring ways to prevent mental disorders before they start (universal prevention), to target groups at higher risk (selective prevention), or to intervene early when early signs appear (indicated prevention).” can overwhelm a lay reader.\n4. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as “task‑shifting” are introduced without a plain‑language definition.\n5. **Missing question‑style subheading** – the “Key messages” heading should be re‑phrased as a question (e.g., “What are the key messages?”).\nThese issues, combined with the metric findings (23 passive constructions, 35 nominalisations, 234 nouns, and high readability scores far beyond typical PLS ranges), mean the summary is not yet suitable for a patient audience. Suggested rewrites:\n- Change “Key messages” to “What are the key messages?”\n- Rewrite passive sentence to active: “Primary‑level health workers delivered the programmes in 38 studies, community workers in 71 studies…”\n- Replace nominalisation: “Many of these studies have limited confidence” → “We have limited confidence in many of these studies.”\n- Split the long sentence into two: “Because of these barriers, researchers are looking for ways to prevent mental disorders before they start. They are testing universal prevention (for everyone), selective prevention (for higher‑risk groups), and indicated prevention (for early signs).”\n- Define jargon: “Task‑shifting – where tasks normally done by specialists are shared with trained primary‑level or community health workers.”",
