  "draft": "Do primary health care workers (e.g., nurses) and community health workers help prevent mental illness and improve well‑being in low‑and middle‑income countries?\n\n- Primary health care workers (e.g., nurses) and community health workers (locally trained health aides) delivering mental‑health promotion and prevention programmes in low‑ and middle‑income countries can lead to small improvements in anxiety, depression, distress/PTSD symptoms and quality of life, and may reduce functional impairment (difficulty doing daily activities) and adverse events (unwanted side effects); no increase in harms was reported, but the overall evidence is limited and not of high quality.\n- These modest benefits were observed across different prevention types—universal prevention (programmes offered to everyone), selective prevention (programmes for people at higher risk) and indicated prevention (programmes for people showing early signs)—and in both adults and children, although the size of the effect varied between studies.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up to confirm which approaches work best, to better understand any potential harms or costs, and to strengthen the evidence base for using primary and community health workers in mental‑health prevention.\n\nWhy is mental health promotion and prevention needed in low‑and middle‑income countries?\nMany people in low‑and middle‑income countries (LMICs) experience mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and post‑traumatic stress. These conditions can reduce quality of life, limit the ability to work or study, and increase the risk of other health issues. In LMICs there are often too few trained mental‑health professionals, large gaps in how resources are distributed, and strong stigma that prevents people from seeking help. Because of these barriers, researchers are looking at ways to prevent mental disorders before they start (universal prevention), to target groups at higher risk (selective prevention), or to intervene early when early signs appear (indicated prevention). One promising approach is to use primary‑level health workers (e.g., nurses, doctors in first‑line clinics) and community health workers (people from the community trained to provide basic health services) to deliver mental‑health programmes – a strategy known as \"task‑shifting\".\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about primary‑level and community worker interventions?\nThe authors wanted to know whether interventions delivered by primary‑level or community health workers can effectively promote mental well‑being and prevent mental disorders in LMICs. Specifically, they examined: (1) how well these worker‑delivered programmes improve mental‑health outcomes for adults and children across universal, selective, and indicated prevention strategies; and (2) whether using these workers affects the use of health‑care resources and costs compared with usual care or other control conditions.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies (randomized trials that assigned participants to intervention or control) evaluating primary‑level or community‑worker mental health promotion and prevention interventions in low‑ and middle‑income countries, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 113 studies that together included 32,992 participants from low‑ and middle‑income countries. The studies were carried out in a range of settings – 19 in low‑income countries, 27 in low‑middle‑income countries, 2 in middle‑income countries, 58 in upper‑middle‑income countries, and 7 that spanned mixed settings. Both adults (83 studies) and children (30 studies) were included, although the abstract did not give details on age ranges, gender balance or how severe the mental‑health problems were at the start.\n\nThe programmes were delivered by primary‑level health workers – either primary‑care staff (38 studies), community workers (71 studies), both types (2 studies) or were not reported (2 studies). The interventions were classified as universal prevention/promotion (22 studies), selective prevention (36 studies) and indicated prevention (55 studies) and were compared with usual care or other control conditions.\n\nOverall, the review suggests that programmes delivered by these primary‑level or community health workers probably provide small mental‑health benefits. In adults, the programmes probably reduce anxiety a little and probably reduce depressive symptoms a little when used for selective prevention; they may also slightly lower distress or PTSD symptoms, reduce adverse events and make a modest improvement in functional ability. In children, the programmes may slightly improve quality of life and may reduce adverse events, depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. For selective prevention in children, the programmes probably reduce depressive symptoms and distress or PTSD symptoms a little, and may also reduce anxiety symptoms a little. For indicated prevention in children, the programmes may slightly reduce functional impairment, depressive symptoms and distress or PTSD symptoms. The confidence in many of these studies was limited, but the overall picture is that worker‑delivered mental‑health programmes appear to offer small benefits across a range of outcomes.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nEvidence currency statement\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because two section headings are not phrased as questions, which is required by the Master Style Guide. In addition, several clarity and readability issues make the summary hard for patients to follow:\n1. **Non‑question subheadings** – \"Limitations of the evidence\" and \"Evidence currency statement\" are not questions. They should be re‑phrased, e.g., \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n2. **Very long sentences** – Example: \"Overall, the review suggests that programmes delivered by these primary‑level or community health workers probably provide small mental‑health benefits. In adults, the programmes probably reduce anxiety a little and probably reduce depressive symptoms a little when used for selective prevention; they may also slightly lower distress or PTSD symptoms, reduce adverse events and make a modest improvement in functional ability.\" (44 words). Long sentences overload readers and exceed the optimal 15‑20 word range (metrics show words_per_sentence = 31.1, BEYOND_P90). Break them into shorter sentences.\n   *Rewrite*: \"Overall, the review suggests that programmes delivered by primary‑level or community health workers give small mental‑health benefits. In adults, the programmes probably reduce anxiety a little and may lower depressive symptoms when used for selective prevention. They may also slightly reduce distress or PTSD symptoms, reduce adverse events, and improve functional ability.\"\n3. **Excessive passive voice** – The draft contains 22 passive constructions (passive_voice = 22, P90). Example: \"The programmes were delivered by primary‑level health workers…\" obscures who did the action.\n   *Rewrite*: \"Primary‑level health workers delivered the programmes…\"\n4. **Heavy noun‑heavy, nominalised language** – High nominalisation (41) and noun count (281) make sentences dense. Example: \"The confidence in many of these studies was limited, but the overall picture is that worker‑delivered mental‑health programmes appear to offer small benefits across a range of outcomes.\" Replace nouns with verbs.\n   *Rewrite*: \"We have limited confidence in many studies, but overall the evidence shows that worker‑delivered programmes offer small benefits across many outcomes.\"\n5. **Missing paragraph breaks and bullet formatting** – The introductory question and key messages are presented as a single block, reducing white‑space. Insert blank lines between headings and paragraphs, and use dashes (‑) for bullet points as required.\nThese changes address the most impactful clarity problems and bring the draft into alignment with the style guide and typical PLS readability metrics.",
