  "key_messages": [
    "We are uncertain whether school support programmes help children and teens with chronic health conditions stay engaged in school (continue attending and participating) or improve their grades (academic achievement); the few studies available gave mixed results and did not provide clear evidence of benefit, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "Some evidence suggests that these programmes may have a small positive effect on mental health, such as increasing self‑esteem (how positively a person feels about themselves), but the confidence in this finding is limited.",
    "More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to determine whether school support programmes truly improve school engagement, academic performance, and mental health for children with chronic illnesses, and to explore any possible unintended effects."

      "subheading": "Why is school engagement a concern for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions?",
      "content": "Many children and teens live with long‑lasting illnesses such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, or attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These conditions are called chronic health conditions because they last for months or years, do not go away on their own, and are rarely cured completely. Up to 44 % of young people may have such a condition, and about 5 % have a severe form that makes everyday activities – including going to school – difficult. Regular school attendance is crucial for learning academic subjects, building social skills, and maintaining overall wellbeing. When illness forces a child to miss school, they can become disengaged – meaning they participate less in lessons, fall behind academically, and may feel isolated. Disengagement is linked to poorer grades, lower self‑esteem, and limited future career options. To help keep these children connected to learning, schools and health services sometimes provide education support services (for example, tutoring, individualized learning plans, or assistance with school re‑entry after a hospital stay). However, we do not yet know how well these supports actually improve school attendance, engagement, or academic results."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The reviewers set two main goals: (1) to describe the different types of education support interventions that have been offered to children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, and (2) to examine whether these interventions help improve school engagement (how much a child participates in school life) and academic achievement (how well a child performs in school, such as grades or test scores). In other words, they wanted to see what the support looks like and whether it makes a real difference for the children’s learning and school involvement."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies of educational support for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions that reported school engagement or academic achievement. We summarised the findings using a vote‑counting approach and assessed our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified four randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 359 children and young people aged 4 to 18 years with chronic health conditions (three studies in children with cancer and one in children with attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder). The trials compared educational support programmes aimed at improving school engagement and academic outcomes with usual care or no additional support. Details about the exact nature, duration, or follow‑up of the interventions, as well as the countries where the studies were conducted and their funding sources, were not provided. No study reported quality‑of‑life outcomes or adverse effects, and only two measured mental‑health outcomes (self‑esteem). The evidence was uncertain: it is unclear whether educational support improves school engagement or academic achievement, and the effect on transition back to school is also uncertain. There is a suggestion that self‑esteem might increase slightly, but the confidence in the evidence is low."

  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the support, and the studies were very small and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2021 of search."
