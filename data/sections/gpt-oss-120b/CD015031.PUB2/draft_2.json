  "draft": "Is a flipped‑over eye membrane (inverted internal limiting membrane flap) better than removing the membrane (internal limiting membrane peeling) during eye surgery (pars plana vitrectomy) for closing large holes in the central retina (large macular hole)?\n\nKey messages\n- Using an inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap during surgery probably increases the chance that a large macular hole closes and may improve vision after several months; no serious harms were reported.\n- The evidence comes from four small trials that had some methodological limitations, so our confidence in the findings is limited.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm the benefits and to check for any complications.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why does it matter?\nA macular hole is a small, full‑thickness break in the centre of the retina – the part of the eye that captures sharp images. When the hole forms, people lose central vision, making reading, recognising faces or driving difficult. A \"large\" macular hole is wider than 400 µm (about the width of a thin hair). Large holes are harder for the eye to close on their own and are less likely to respond fully to standard surgery.\n\nHow are large macular holes usually treated?\nThe most common operation is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In PPV the surgeon removes the gel‑like vitreous humour through tiny side‑incisions. During the procedure the internal limiting membrane (ILM) – a thin, transparent layer on the back of the retina – is usually peeled away. ILM peeling helps the hole close and improves visual outcomes, and it is the current standard of care. For large holes, the success rate of conventional peeling is lower. An alternative is the inverted ILM flap technique, where the surgeon creates a small flap of ILM, flips it over and places it on the hole, acting like a biological patch that may promote better closure.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe compared two surgical approaches for large macular holes (idiopathic, traumatic or myopic):\n1. PPV with conventional ILM peeling.\n2. PPV with the inverted ILM flap.\nWe examined whether the flap improves overall hole closure, type 1 closure (a full seal with no remaining defect), and best‑corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measured with a logMAR chart (a standard eye‑test where lower numbers mean sharper vision). We also looked at safety outcomes such as postoperative retinal detachment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trial registries up to 12 December 2022. We included randomised controlled trials that compared the two techniques in eyes with large macular holes. We combined the results for BCVA and hole‑closure rates and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified four randomised trials involving 285 eyes of 275 participants. Most participants were women (≈63 %) and were aged 59–66 years. The trials were conducted in India, Poland and Mexico and followed participants for 3–12 months.\n- Hole closure: The inverted flap probably increases the chance that the hole closes – about 10 more eyes per 100 treated – and probably raises the chance of a type 1 closure by about 30 more eyes per 100 treated.\n- Vision: At three months or later, the flap may improve BCVA by roughly 0.17 logMAR units (equivalent to about one line on an eye chart). Evidence for a benefit at one month is uncertain.\n- Safety: No serious postoperative harms, such as retinal detachment, were reported in the trials.\nThe certainty of the evidence was moderate for hole‑closure outcomes and low to very low for visual‑acuity outcomes because the trials were small, not blinded and showed some variability.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence because:\n- Participants and surgeons likely knew which technique was used, introducing possible bias.\n- The trials enrolled few participants and were conducted in different settings.\n- Not all trials reported all outcomes we wanted, such as long‑term visual changes.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and clinicians?\nThe inverted ILM flap technique appears to help large macular holes close more often and may lead to better vision after several months, without clear safety concerns. However, the evidence is based on a small number of modest‑quality studies, so we cannot be certain of the size of the benefit. Clinicians should discuss the potential advantages and the uncertainty with patients when choosing a surgical approach. More robust, larger trials are needed to confirm these findings and to monitor any long‑term complications.\n\nHow should future research proceed?\nFuture studies should recruit larger numbers of participants, use masking where possible, report outcomes consistently (including BCVA changes and any adverse events), and follow patients for at least a year. Using standard logMAR charts for vision measurement will help compare results across studies.",

      "feedback": "The draft is missing a required \"Currency\" section – there is no heading that tells readers how up‑to‑date the review is (e.g., \"How up to date is this review?\"). This fails the critical completeness check. In addition, several clarity and style issues would likely confuse patients: (1) some technical terms (logMAR, type 1 closure) are used without plain‑language explanations; (2) a few sentences are overly long and dense, especially the one summarising the closure benefits; (3) the text contains a high number of passive constructions and noun‑heavy phrasing, which makes it harder to see who is doing what. Suggested improvements: • Add a currency heading: \"How up to date is this review?\" – \"Our search was completed on 12 December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\" • Define jargon: replace \"logMAR chart (a standard eye‑test where lower numbers mean sharper vision)\" with \"logMAR chart – a vision test where a lower score means clearer sight\" and explain \"type 1 closure\" as \"a complete seal of the hole with no remaining defect\". • Shorten the closure‑benefit sentence: \"The inverted flap probably increases hole closure – about 10 more eyes per 100 treated – and boosts complete (type 1) closure by roughly 30 more per 100 treated.\" • Convert passive phrasing such as \"The evidence comes from four small trials that had some methodological limitations\" to active: \"We found four small trials, but they had methodological limitations, so our confidence is limited.\" • Reduce noun‑heavy sentences like \"The inverted ILM flap technique probably leads to a higher chance that the macular hole closes…\" to \"The inverted flap probably makes the hole close more often…\". These changes will lower the noun count, passive voice, and complex‑word metrics, bringing the draft closer to typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (830 words) and scores well on readability (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 58.97, FK‑grade 9.5). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: passive voice (20, beyond P90), noun count (204, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.2, beyond P90), complex words (161, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall complex words (349, beyond P90), and long words (223, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy, uses many complex/long words, and contains many passive constructions, supporting the suggested style edits."
