  "draft": "Is a flipped‑over eye membrane (inverted internal limiting membrane flap) better than removing the membrane (internal limiting membrane peeling) during eye surgery (pars plana vitrectomy) for closing large holes in the central retina (large macular hole)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Using an inverted internal limiting membrane flap (a method where a thin retinal membrane is lifted and placed back over the hole) during eye surgery probably increases the chance that a large macular hole (a break in the central retina) closes and may lead to better best‑corrected visual acuity (sharpness of vision measured with glasses) after several months, and no serious postoperative harms were reported.\n- These conclusions are based on a small number of trials that had some methodological limitations, so the overall confidence in the findings is limited.\n- Future research should involve larger, well‑designed studies with longer follow‑up to confirm the benefits, evaluate any potential complications, and provide clearer guidance for patients and clinicians.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is a macular hole and why is it a problem?\nA macular hole is a small, full‑thickness break in the centre of the retina – the part of the eye that captures sharp, detailed images. When this hole forms, people lose their central vision, making activities such as reading, recognizing faces, or driving difficult. A \"large\" macular hole is defined as being wider than 400 micrometres (about the width of a thin human hair) at its narrowest point. Larger holes are harder for the eye to close on their own and are associated with a higher chance that surgery will not fully restore vision.\n\nWhat are the current surgical treatments for large macular holes?\nThe most common operation is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), a procedure where the surgeon removes the gel‑like vitreous humour from the eye through tiny incisions at the side of the eye (the \"pars plana\" region). During PPV, the internal limiting membrane (ILM) – a thin, transparent layer that lines the back of the retina – is usually peeled away. This \"ILM peeling\" helps the hole close and improves visual outcomes, and it is the standard of care. However, for large macular holes, the success rate of conventional ILM peeling is lower. An alternative technique, the \"inverted ILM flap,\" involves creating a small flap of the ILM, turning it over, and placing it over the hole, acting like a biological patch that may promote better closure.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to compare two surgical approaches for treating large macular holes (including idiopathic, traumatic, and myopic types): 1. PPV with the traditional ILM peeling technique, and 2. PPV with the inverted ILM flap technique. Specifically, they examined whether the inverted flap improves how well the hole closes (overall closure and \"type 1\" closure, which means the hole is fully sealed without any remaining defect) and whether it leads to better visual acuity after surgery, measured with the logMAR chart (a standard eye‑test scale where lower numbers indicate sharper vision). They also looked at safety outcomes such as postoperative retinal detachment.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared pars plana vitrectomy with an inverted internal limiting membrane flap versus conventional ILM peeling for large macular holes, combined their results on visual acuity and hole closure, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard grading criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified four randomised trials that together enrolled 275 people (285 eyes) with large idiopathic macular holes. Most participants were women (about 63%) and were older adults, with average ages between 59 and 66 years. The studies were carried out in three countries – two in India, one in Poland and one in Mexico – and were mostly single‑centre (one was a three‑site multicentre trial involving four surgeons). Follow‑up ranged from three months to twelve months, and none of the trials reported any conflicts of interest or external funding. All trials compared standard pars plana vitrectomy with conventional internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling to pars plana vitrectomy using an inverted ILM flap technique. Some trials combined the eye surgery with cataract removal at the same time, others did cataract surgery later, and one trial did not mention cataract surgery.\n\nMain results: Macular hole closure\nThe inverted ILM flap technique probably leads to a higher chance that the macular hole closes – about ten more closures per hundred eyes treated – and probably increases the chance of a complete (type 1) closure by roughly thirty more per hundred eyes. It may also give a modest improvement in vision after three months, but the evidence for this is weak. At one month after surgery we cannot tell whether the flap technique makes any difference to vision.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all studies provided all the data we wanted, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft does not meet the mandatory style and length requirements. (1) Subheadings are not phrased as questions – the guide requires headings like \"What is a macular hole?\" or \"How did we find the evidence?\" – but the draft uses generic headings such as \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", and \"Currency\". (2) The total word count is 871, exceeding the 850‑word limit for a Plain Language Summary. (3) The text is noun‑heavy (222 nouns, far above the typical <116) and contains many complex and long words (SMOG 15.6, complex_words 171, long_words 247), which pushes the readability indices above the usual range and makes the summary harder for patients to understand. (4) Several sentences are long and contain passive constructions, e.g., \"The inverted ILM flap technique probably leads to a higher chance that the macular hole closes – about ten more closures per hundred eyes treated – and probably increases the chance of a complete (type 1) closure by roughly thirty more per hundred eyes.\" This sentence is 38 words, uses passive‑like phrasing, and packs multiple numbers, reducing clarity. (5) Some jargon is introduced without simple explanations (e.g., \"type 1 closure\", \"logMAR chart\"). These issues together mean the summary would likely confuse readers and does not comply with the Master Style Guide.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Introduction/Aims\". Problem: Not a question, violating style rule. Rewrite: \"What is a macular hole and why does it matter?\" and separate subsequent questions for each sub‑section.\n2. **Word count** – The draft is 871 words. Problem: Exceeds limit. Rewrite: Trim redundant phrases, combine sentences, and remove less essential details (e.g., the detailed description of cataract surgery timing) to bring total below 850 words.\n3. **Long, complex sentence** – Quote: \"The inverted ILM flap technique probably leads to a higher chance that the macular hole closes – about ten more closures per hundred eyes treated – and probably increases the chance of a complete (type 1) closure by roughly thirty more per hundred eyes.\" Problem: 38 words, multiple clauses, passive tone, and jargon. Rewrite: \"The inverted ILM flap technique probably increases the chance that the hole closes – about 10 more eyes out of 100 – and may also raise the chance of a complete (type 1) closure by about 30 more eyes out of 100.\"\n4. **Jargon without plain explanation** – Quote: \"type 1 closure\" and \"logMAR chart\". Problem: Patients may not know these terms. Rewrite: \"type 1 closure (a full seal with no remaining defect)\" and \"logMAR chart (a standard eye‑test where lower numbers mean sharper vision)\".\n5. **Noun‑heavy, complex wording** – Quote: \"The inverted ILM flap technique probably leads to a higher chance that the macular hole closes…\" Problem: High noun density (222 nouns) and many long words (247). Rewrite using more verbs and shorter words: \"The inverted flap likely helps the hole close more often…\".\n\nSupporting metrics: The evaluation shows 222 nouns (BEYOND_P90), SMOG index 15.6 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words 171 (BEYOND_P90), long_words 247 (BEYOND_P90), and 17 passive constructions (P75). These numbers confirm the draft’s excessive complexity and passive voice, reinforcing the need for the suggested simplifications.",

Readability scores are borderline (Flesch Reading Ease 49.9, higher than typical 32‑48) but grade‑level indices (FKGL 11.8, GFI 16.8) remain high. Word count exceeds the 850‑word limit (871 words).
