  "draft": "Is a flipped‑over eye membrane (inverted internal limiting membrane flap) better than removing the membrane (internal limiting membrane peeling) during eye surgery (pars plana vitrectomy) for closing large holes in the central retina (large macular hole)?\n\nKey messages\n- Using an inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap probably increases the chance that a large macular hole closes – about 10 more closures per 100 eyes – and may raise the chance of a complete (type 1) closure by roughly 30 per 100 eyes.\n- Vision may improve a little after three months or more; the benefit at one month is uncertain.\n- The evidence comes from four small trials with some methodological limitations, so our confidence is limited and no serious harms were reported.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why does it matter?\nA macular hole is a small, full‑thickness break in the centre of the retina – the part of the eye that captures sharp, detailed images. When the hole forms, people lose central vision, making reading, recognising faces or driving difficult. A \"large\" macular hole is wider than 400 µm (about the width of a thin hair). Large holes are harder for the eye to close on their own and are less likely to respond fully to standard surgery.\n\nHow are large macular holes usually treated?\nThe most common operation is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In PPV the surgeon removes the gel‑like vitreous humour through tiny side‑incisions. During the procedure the internal limiting membrane (ILM) – a thin, transparent layer on the back of the retina – is usually peeled away. ILM peeling helps the hole close and improves visual outcomes, and it is the current standard of care. For large holes, the success rate of conventional peeling is lower. An alternative is the inverted ILM flap technique, where the surgeon creates a small flap of ILM, flips it over and places it on the hole, acting like a biological patch that may promote better closure.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe compared two surgical approaches for large macular holes (idiopathic, traumatic or myopic):\n1. PPV with conventional ILM peeling.\n2. PPV with the inverted ILM flap.\nWe examined whether the flap improves overall hole closure, type 1 closure (a complete seal with no remaining defect), and best‑corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measured with a logMAR chart – a vision test where a lower score means clearer sight. We also looked at safety outcomes such as postoperative retinal detachment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trial registries up to 12 December 2022. We included randomised controlled trials that compared the two techniques in eyes with large macular holes. We combined the results for BCVA and hole‑closure rates and rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified four randomised trials involving 285 eyes of 275 participants. Most participants were women (≈63 %) and were aged 59–66 years. The trials were conducted in India, Poland and Mexico and followed participants for 3–12 months.\n- Hole closure: The inverted flap probably increases the chance that the hole closes – about 10 more closures per 100 eyes – and probably raises the chance of a complete (type 1) closure by roughly 30 per 100 eyes.\n- Vision: At three months or later, the flap may improve BCVA by about 0.17 logMAR units (roughly one line on an eye chart). Evidence for a benefit at one month is uncertain.\n- Safety: No serious postoperative harms, such as retinal detachment, were reported in the trials.\nThe certainty of the evidence was moderate for hole‑closure outcomes and low to very low for visual‑acuity outcomes because the trials were small, not blinded and showed some variability.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence because:\n- Participants and surgeons likely knew which technique was used, introducing possible bias.\n- The trials enrolled few participants and were conducted in different settings.\n- Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted, such as long‑term visual changes.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients and clinicians?\nThe inverted ILM flap technique appears to help large macular holes close more often and may lead to better vision after several months, without clear safety concerns. However, the evidence is based on a small number of modest‑quality studies, so we cannot be certain of the size of the benefit. Clinicians should discuss the potential advantages and the uncertainty with patients when choosing a surgical approach.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nOur search was completed on 12 December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nHow should future research proceed?\nFuture studies should recruit larger numbers of participants, use masking where possible, report outcomes consistently (including BCVA changes and any adverse events), and follow patients for at least a year. Using standard logMAR charts for vision measurement will help compare results across studies.",

(2) One subheading – “Key messages” – is not phrased as a question, which breaches the style guide requirement that all section headings be questions. These issues must be fixed before the PLS can be approved. In addition, the draft contains several clarity and style problems that should be addressed:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – “logMAR” appears without a simple explanation. Suggest: “logMAR (a chart that measures how clearly you can see)”.\n2. **Long sentences** – e.g., “The most common operation is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In PPV the surgeon removes the gel‑like vitreous humour through tiny side‑incisions.” This could be combined into a clearer single sentence or split for brevity.\n3. **Passive voice** – many sentences start with “The inverted flap probably increases…”. Rewrite in active voice: “We found that the inverted flap probably increases…”.\n4. **Wordy phrasing** – “the evidence comes from four small trials with some methodological limitations, so our confidence is limited” can be shortened to “the evidence comes from four small trials with methodological limitations, so confidence is limited”.\n5. **Bullet formatting** – the key‑message list uses hyphens correctly, but ensure a blank line before and after the list for better white‑space.\n\nMetrics support these observations: the draft has 211 nouns (well beyond the typical ≤116), a SMOG index of 15.2 (above the typical ≤12.1), and very high counts of complex and long words (354, 159, 223 respectively). Reducing noun‑heavy constructions and simplifying vocabulary will lower these scores and improve readability.\n\nTo meet the critical checks, rewrite the “Key messages” heading as a question (e.g., “What are the key messages?”) and cut the text by at least 5 words – for example, by removing redundant phrases and simplifying technical terms.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is 854 words (over the 850‑word limit). Most readability metrics are good (e.g., Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 9, words per sentence 18), but five features deviate markedly: nouns (211 > 116 median), SMOG index (15.2 > 12.1), complex words (DC 354 > 160), complex words (159 > 84), and long words (223 > 122). These indicate excessive noun‑heavy and complex vocabulary, which should be reduced for a clearer, more patient‑friendly summary."
