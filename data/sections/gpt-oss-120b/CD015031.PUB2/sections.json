  "plain_title": "Is a flipped‑over eye membrane (inverted internal limiting membrane flap) better than removing the membrane (internal limiting membrane peeling) during eye surgery (pars plana vitrectomy) for closing large holes in the central retina (large macular hole)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Using an inverted internal limiting membrane flap (a method where a thin retinal membrane is lifted and placed back over the hole) during eye surgery probably increases the chance that a large macular hole (a break in the central retina) closes and may lead to better best‑corrected visual acuity (sharpness of vision measured with glasses) after several months, and no serious postoperative harms were reported.",
    "These conclusions are based on a small number of trials that had some methodological limitations, so the overall confidence in the findings is limited.",
    "Future research should involve larger, well‑designed studies with longer follow‑up to confirm the benefits, evaluate any potential complications, and provide clearer guidance for patients and clinicians."

      "subheading": "What is a macular hole and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "A macular hole is a small, full‑thickness break in the centre of the retina – the part of the eye that captures sharp, detailed images. When this hole forms, people lose their central vision, making activities such as reading, recognizing faces, or driving difficult. A \"large\" macular hole is defined as being wider than 400 micrometres (about the width of a thin human hair) at its narrowest point. Larger holes are harder for the eye to close on their own and are associated with a higher chance that surgery will not fully restore vision."

      "subheading": "What are the current surgical treatments for large macular holes?",
      "content": "The most common operation is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), a procedure where the surgeon removes the gel‑like vitreous humour from the eye through tiny incisions at the side of the eye (the \"pars plana\" region). During PPV, the internal limiting membrane (ILM) – a thin, transparent layer that lines the back of the retina – is usually peeled away. This \"ILM peeling\" helps the hole close and improves visual outcomes, and it is the standard of care. However, for large macular holes, the success rate of conventional ILM peeling is lower. An alternative technique, the \"inverted ILM flap,\" involves creating a small flap of the ILM, turning it over, and placing it over the hole, acting like a biological patch that may promote better closure."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to compare two surgical approaches for treating large macular holes (including idiopathic, traumatic, and myopic types): 1. PPV with the traditional ILM peeling technique, and 2. PPV with the inverted ILM flap technique. Specifically, they examined whether the inverted flap improves how well the hole closes (overall closure and \"type 1\" closure, which means the hole is fully sealed without any remaining defect) and whether it leads to better visual acuity after surgery, measured with the logMAR chart (a standard eye‑test scale where lower numbers indicate sharper vision). They also looked at safety outcomes such as postoperative retinal detachment."

      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared pars plana vitrectomy with an inverted internal limiting membrane flap versus conventional ILM peeling for large macular holes, combined their results on visual acuity and hole closure, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard grading criteria."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified four randomised trials that together enrolled 275 people (285 eyes) with large idiopathic macular holes. Most participants were women (about 63%) and were older adults, with average ages between 59 and 66 years. The studies were carried out in three countries – two in India, one in Poland and one in Mexico – and were mostly single‑centre (one was a three‑site multicentre trial involving four surgeons). Follow‑up ranged from three months to twelve months, and none of the trials reported any conflicts of interest or external funding. All trials compared standard pars plana vitrectomy with conventional internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling to pars plana vitrectomy using an inverted ILM flap technique. Some trials combined the eye surgery with cataract removal at the same time, others did cataract surgery later, and one trial did not mention cataract surgery."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Macular hole closure",
      "content": "The inverted ILM flap technique probably leads to a higher chance that the macular hole closes – about ten more closures per hundred eyes treated – and probably increases the chance of a complete (type 1) closure by roughly thirty more per hundred eyes. It may also give a modest improvement in vision after three months, but the evidence for this is weak. At one month after surgery we cannot tell whether the flap technique makes any difference to vision."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all studies provided all the data we wanted, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to December 2022 of search."
