  "draft": "Is early removal (within 5 days) of a urinary catheter (a tube placed in the bladder) better than later removal (after 5 days) after a kidney transplant?\n\nKey messages\n- We do not have clear evidence that removing the catheter early changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria). The review found no reliable data on urinary‑tract infections (UTIs) or serious urinary complications, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The evidence comes from only two small studies, one of which gave very limited details. Overall confidence in the evidence is low and the findings are uncertain.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials with longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether early or late catheter removal influences infection rates or other important outcomes after kidney transplantation.\n\nWhat is kidney transplantation and why is a urinary catheter used?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys have stopped working. During the operation a thin tube called a urinary catheter (a tube placed in the bladder) is inserted. The catheter drains urine and reduces pressure on the new kidney‑bladder connection, helping the surgical join heal. However, the catheter also creates a pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary‑tract infection (UTI) – an infection that makes urination painful or frequent. The longer the tube stays in, the higher the chance of infection and other problems such as the surgical join breaking down.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared two strategies: removing the urinary catheter early (before five days after the transplant) versus removing it later (five days or more after the transplant). We wanted to see whether early removal reduced the number of infections that show no symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), the number of symptomatic UTIs, and serious urinary problems that need extra treatment.\n\nHow did we look for the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that removed the urinary catheter early (≤5 days) or late (≥5 days) after kidney transplantation. We combined the results for infection and complication outcomes and assessed our confidence using risk‑of‑bias tools and GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found two studies that together included 197 kidney‑transplant patients. One group had the catheter removed before five days, the other after five days. The studies followed patients for up to one month and did not report details such as age, gender, setting, or funding.\nThe evidence shows that early removal might lower, raise, or have little impact on the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms, but we are very uncertain about these effects. The studies did not report data on symptomatic UTIs or major urological complications, so we cannot say whether early removal affects those outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because:\n1. participants may have known which timing they received;\n2. some outcomes were not reported;\n3. the studies used different patient groups and methods;\n4. each study was very small.\nThese factors make the results uncertain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date with searches completed in April 2023.",
