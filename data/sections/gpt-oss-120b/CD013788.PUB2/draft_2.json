  "draft": "Is early removal (within 5 days) of a urinary catheter (a tube placed in the bladder) better than later removal (after 5 days) after a kidney transplant?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We do not have clear evidence that removing the catheter early changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria). The review also found no reliable data on whether early removal affects urinary tract infections (UTIs) or serious urinary problems, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The evidence comes from only two small studies, one of which provided very limited details. Overall confidence in the evidence is low and the findings are uncertain.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials with longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether early or late catheter removal influences infection rates or other important outcomes after kidney transplantation.\n\nWhat is kidney transplantation and why do we use a urinary catheter?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys have stopped working. During the operation a thin tube called a urinary catheter is placed into the bladder. The catheter helps drain urine and reduces pressure on the surgical connection between the new kidney and the bladder, allowing it to heal. At the same time the catheter can let bacteria enter the bladder, which may cause a urinary tract infection (UTI) – an infection that makes urination painful or frequent. The longer the tube stays in, the higher the risk of infection and other problems such as the surgical connection breaking down.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe compared two strategies: removing the urinary catheter early (before five days after the transplant) versus removing it later (five days or more after the transplant). We wanted to see whether early removal reduced the number of asymptomatic bacteriuria cases, the number of symptomatic UTIs, and serious urinary problems that need extra treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register for randomised trials that compared early (≤5 days) with late (≥5 days) catheter removal after kidney transplantation. Two reviewers screened the records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results for each outcome and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two studies that together included 197 transplant recipients. Both studies compared early removal (less than 5 days) with later removal (5 days or more). The follow‑up lasted only up to one month and the reports gave few details about participants or settings. The pooled result suggests that early removal might lower, raise, or have little impact on the chance of asymptomatic bacteriuria, but the evidence is very uncertain. We could not determine any effect on symptomatic UTIs or serious urinary complications because the studies did not report these outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. Participants and researchers likely knew which timing was used, the studies were small, and they differed in how the intervention was delivered. Important outcomes were missing or poorly reported, and the follow‑up was short.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the April 2023 search.",

In the studies, participants probably knew which timing they received, and many important outcomes were not reported. The studies also involved different types of patients, used different methods, and were very small, so the results are uncertain.\"\n3. **Unexplained jargon** – The term \"asymptomatic bacteriuria\" appears in the results without a reminder of its meaning. *Suggested rewrite*: \"asymptomatic bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine without any symptoms)\".\n4. **Passive/nominal style** – Phrases such as \"The pooled result suggests\" and \"The follow‑up lasted only up to one month\" use nominalisations that reduce readability. *Suggested rewrite*: \"We found\" and \"We followed patients for up to one month\".\n5. **High lexical complexity** – The evaluation shows the draft has far more nominalisations (26 vs typical <13), complex Dale‑Chall words (236 vs typical <160) and long words (166 vs typical <122). Reducing these will make the text easier for a lay audience.\nThese three or more significant clarity problems mean the PLS does not yet meet the required standard.\n\n**Metrics support**: The PLS evaluation flagged nominalisation, complex_words_dc and long_words as outliers (P90), confirming the need to simplify language and reduce noun‑heavy constructions.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (77.8% of features in best quartile) but deviates on three key metrics: nominalisation (26, beyond typical <13), complex Dale‑Chall words (236, beyond typical <160) and long words (166, beyond typical <122). These deviations indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words, supporting the recommended simplifications."
