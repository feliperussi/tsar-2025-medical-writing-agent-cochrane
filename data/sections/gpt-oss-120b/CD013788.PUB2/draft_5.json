  "draft": "Is early removal (within 5 days) of a urinary catheter (a tube placed in the bladder) better than later removal (after 5 days) after a kidney transplant?\n\nKey messages:\n- We do not have clear evidence that removing the catheter early changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria). The review found no reliable data on urinary‑tract infections (UTIs) or serious urinary complications, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The evidence comes from only two small studies, one of which gave very limited details. Overall confidence in the evidence is low and the findings are uncertain.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials with longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether early or late catheter removal influences infection rates or other important outcomes after kidney transplantation.\n\nWhat is kidney transplantation and why is a urinary catheter used?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys have stopped working. During the operation a thin tube called a urinary catheter is placed into the bladder. The catheter helps drain urine and reduces pressure on the surgical connection between the new kidney and the bladder, giving the join a chance to heal. However, the catheter also creates a pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary‑tract infection (UTI) – an infection that makes urination painful or frequent. The longer the tube stays in, the higher the chance of infection and other problems such as the surgical join breaking down.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared two strategies: removing the urinary catheter early (before five days after the transplant) versus removing it later (five days or more after the transplant). We wanted to see whether early removal reduced the number of infections that show no symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), the number of symptomatic UTIs, and serious urinary problems that need extra treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared early (≤5 days) versus late (≥5 days) urinary‑catheter removal after kidney transplantation, combined their results on infection and complication outcomes, and judged the quality of the evidence using the risk‑of‑bias tool and GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found two studies that together included 197 transplant recipients.\n- Both studies compared early (<5 days) with later (≥5 days) catheter removal.\n- Participants were adults (some children may have been included) and received kidneys from any donor type.\n- Follow‑up was only up to one month, and details such as age, gender, setting, or funding were not reported.\nThe evidence shows that early removal might lower, raise, or have little impact on the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms, but we are very uncertain about these effects. The studies did not report data on symptomatic UTIs or serious urinary complications, so we cannot tell whether early removal changes those risks.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants probably knew which timing they received, many important outcomes were not reported, the studies involved different types of patients and methods, and the studies were very small. These factors make the results uncertain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date with the April 2023 search.",

Participants may have known which timing they received, some outcomes were not reported, the studies used different patient groups and methods, and each study was very small. These factors make the results uncertain.\"\n\nThese issues affect readability and could leave patients unsure about who was studied and what the results mean. The PLS evaluation also shows high nominalisation (25 vs median <13) and many complex/long words (236 complex‑word‑DC, 167 long words), which contribute to the dense wording noted above. Reducing nominalisations and choosing simpler words will further improve clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most PLS patterns (overall good conformity). Readability scores are within typical ranges (FRE 48.75, FKGL 11.8). However, three metrics deviate: nominalisation (25, beyond typical median), complex words (Dale‑Chall 236, beyond median), and long words (167, beyond median). These suggest the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words than usual, supporting the need to simplify wording and reduce nominalisations."
