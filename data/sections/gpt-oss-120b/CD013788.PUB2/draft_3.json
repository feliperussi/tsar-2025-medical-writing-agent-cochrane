  "draft": "Is early removal (within 5 days) of a urinary catheter (a tube placed in the bladder) better than later removal (after 5 days) after a kidney transplant?\n\nKey messages:\n- We do not have clear evidence that removing the catheter early changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria). The review found no reliable data on urinary‑tract infections (UTIs) or serious urinary complications, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The evidence comes from only two small studies, one of which gave very limited details. Overall confidence in the evidence is low and the findings are uncertain.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials with longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether early or late catheter removal influences infection rates or other important outcomes after kidney transplantation.\n\nWhat is kidney transplantation and why do we use a urinary catheter?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys have stopped working. During the operation a thin tube called a urinary catheter is placed into the bladder. The catheter helps drain urine and reduces pressure on the new kidney’s connection to the bladder, allowing the surgical join to heal. At the same time the catheter can let bacteria enter the bladder, which may cause a urinary‑tract infection (UTI) – an infection that makes urination painful or frequent. The longer the tube stays in, the higher the chance of infection and other problems such as the surgical join breaking down.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe compared two strategies: removing the urinary catheter early (before five days after the transplant) versus removing it later (five days or more after the transplant). We wanted to see whether early removal reduced the number of infections that show no symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), the number of symptomatic UTIs, and serious urinary problems that need extra treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register for randomised trials that compared early (≤5 days) with late (≥5 days) catheter removal after kidney transplantation. Two reviewers screened the records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results for each outcome and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found two studies that together included 197 transplant recipients. Both studies compared early removal (less than 5 days) with later removal (5 days or more). We followed patients for up to one month and the reports gave few details about participants or settings. The combined data show that early removal could increase, decrease, or have no effect on the chance of finding bacteria in the urine without symptoms, and we are very uncertain which is true. The studies did not report data on symptomatic UTIs or serious urinary complications, so we could not determine any effect on those outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. In the studies, participants probably knew which timing they received, and many important outcomes were not reported. The studies also involved different types of patients, used different methods, and were very small, so the results are uncertain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the April 2023 search.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failed: the subheading \"Key messages:\" is not phrased as a question, which breaches the style guide requirement that all section subheadings be questions. Additionally, the draft contains several clarity and style issues that could confuse readers and inflate complexity metrics.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Subheading format – Quote: \"Key messages:\". Problem: not a question. Rewrite as: \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. Jargon without definition – Quote: \"asymptomatic bacteriuria\". Problem: term may be unfamiliar to patients. Rewrite: \"bacteria in the urine without any symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria)\".\n3. Long, dense sentence – Quote: \"The combined data show that early removal could increase, decrease, or have no effect on the chance of finding bacteria in the urine without symptoms, and we are very uncertain which is true.\" Problem: 33 words, multiple clauses, hard to follow. Rewrite: \"The combined data are unclear. Early removal might raise, lower, or not change the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms, and we cannot tell which is correct.\".\n4. High nominalisation – Quote: \"The evidence shows that taking the catheter out early might lower, raise, or have little impact on the chance of finding bacteria in the urine without symptoms, but we are very uncertain about these effects.\" Problem: noun‑heavy phrasing. Rewrite using verbs: \"The evidence suggests that early removal may lower, raise, or not affect the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms, but we are very uncertain about these effects.\".\n5. Passive voice – Quote: \"The studies did not report data on symptomatic UTIs or serious urinary complications, so we could not determine any effect on those outcomes.\" Problem: passive construction obscures who did the action. Rewrite to active: \"Because the studies did not report data on symptomatic UTIs or serious urinary complications, we could not determine any effect on those outcomes.\".\n\nThese changes will also address metric deviations: reducing nominalisations (target <13), lowering complex unfamiliar words (target <160) and long words (target <122) as indicated by the PLS evaluation.\n\nOverall, the draft meets factual accuracy and word‑count limits but needs subheading revision and several clarity/style edits before the PLS can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms to most typical PLS patterns (77.8% features in best quartile). However, three metrics deviate: nominalisation (23, beyond P90), complex_words_dc (231, beyond P90) and long_words (168, beyond P90). These suggest the text is noun‑heavy and uses many unfamiliar or long words, which can hinder readability for patients."
