  "draft": "Is early removal (within 5 days) of a urinary catheter (a tube placed in the bladder) better than later removal (after 5 days) after a kidney transplant?\n\nKey messages:\n- We do not have clear evidence that removing the catheter early changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria). The review found no reliable data on urinary‑tract infections (UTIs) or serious urinary complications, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The evidence comes from only two small studies, one of which gave very limited details. Overall confidence in the evidence is low and the findings are uncertain.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials with longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether early or late catheter removal influences infection rates or other important outcomes after kidney transplantation.\n\nWhat is kidney transplantation and why is a urinary catheter used?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys have stopped working. During the operation a thin tube called a urinary catheter (a tube placed in the bladder) is inserted. The catheter helps drain urine and reduces pressure on the new kidney’s connection to the bladder, giving the surgical join time to heal. However, the catheter also creates a pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary‑tract infection (UTI) – an infection that makes urination painful or frequent. The longer the tube stays in, the higher the chance of infection and other problems such as the surgical join breaking down.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared two strategies: removing the urinary catheter early (before five days after the transplant) versus removing it later (five days or more after the transplant). We wanted to see whether early removal reduced the number of infections that show no symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), the number of symptomatic UTIs, and serious urinary problems that need extra treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared early (≤5 days) versus late (≥5 days) urinary‑catheter removal after kidney transplantation, combined their results on infection and complication outcomes, and rated our confidence in the evidence using risk‑of‑bias assessment and GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found two studies that together included 197 transplant recipients.\n- Both studies compared early (less than 5 days) with later (5 days or more) catheter removal.\n- All participants were adults; some studies may have also included children.\n- The studies followed patients for up to one month and did not report details such as age, gender, setting, or funding.\nThe evidence is very uncertain whether early removal reduces, increases, or does not change the chance of asymptomatic bacteriuria. The studies did not report data on symptomatic UTIs or major urological complications, so we cannot tell whether early removal changes those risks.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence for several reasons. Participants may have known which timing they received, some outcomes were not reported, the studies used different patient groups and methods, and each study was very small. These factors make the results uncertain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date with the April 2023 search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several statements that would likely confuse a lay reader. 1) Unexplained technical terms: the draft uses \"asymptomatic bacteriuria\", \"cysto‑ureteric anastomosis\", \"risk‑of‑bias\" and \"GRADE\" without simple definitions, leaving patients unsure what these mean. 2) A long, dense sentence about the uncertain effect of early removal makes the key message hard to grasp: \"The evidence shows that taking the catheter out early might lower, raise, or have little impact on the chance of finding bacteria in the urine without symptoms, but we are very uncertain about these effects.\" 3) Confusing participant description: \"All participants were adults; some studies may have also included children\" contradicts itself and creates doubt about who was studied. 4) A typographical error \"and and\" in the Methods section reduces professionalism. 5) Overall the draft relies on many specialised words (nominalisations, long words, and unfamiliar vocabulary) – the evaluation shows 27 nominalisations (P90), 233 Dale‑Chall complex words (P90) and 166 long words (P90), far above typical PLS ranges, confirming the need to simplify language. Suggested rewrites: • Define terms: \"asymptomatic bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine without any symptoms)\"; \"cysto‑ureteric anastomosis (the surgical connection between the new kidney and the bladder)\"; \"risk‑of‑bias assessment (checking how reliable the studies are)\"; \"GRADE (a system that rates how confident we are in the evidence)\". • Split the long sentence into two: \"We are very uncertain whether removing the catheter early changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms. The evidence could show a lower, higher, or unchanged risk, but the studies are too small to tell us.\" • Clarify participants: \"All participants were adults; no children were included in the studies.\" • Fix typo: change \"and and\" to \"and\". • Reduce nominalisations and long words by using verbs and everyday language (e.g., replace \"assessment\" with \"check\", \"evaluation\" with \"look at\"). These changes will bring the draft into line with the Master Style Guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but three metrics deviate markedly: nominalisation (27, P90), Dale‑Chall complex words (233, P90) and long words (166, P90). These indicate the draft uses many noun‑heavy and unfamiliar terms, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce jargon."
