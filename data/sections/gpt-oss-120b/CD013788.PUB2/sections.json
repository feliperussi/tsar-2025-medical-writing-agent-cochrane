  "plain_title": "Is early removal (within 5 days) of a urinary catheter (a tube placed in the bladder) better than later removal (after 5 days) after a kidney transplant?",
  "key_messages": [
    "We do not have clear evidence that removing the urinary catheter early (within 5 days) after a kidney transplant changes the chance of developing bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria); the review found no reliable data on whether early removal affects urinary tract infections (UTIs) or serious urinary complications, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "The available information comes from only two small studies, one of which provided very limited details, so the overall quality of the evidence is low and the findings are uncertain.",
    "More well‑designed, larger randomised trials with longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether early or late catheter removal influences infection rates or other important outcomes after kidney transplantation."

      "subheading": "What is kidney transplantation and why is a urinary catheter used?",
      "content": "Kidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys have stopped working. During the operation a thin tube called a urinary catheter is placed into the bladder. The catheter helps drain urine and reduces pressure on the new kidney’s connection to the bladder, giving the surgical join (the cysto‑ureteric anastomosis) a chance to heal. However, the catheter also creates a pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can lead to a urinary tract infection (UTI) – an infection that causes painful or frequent urination. The longer the tube stays in, the higher the chance of infection and other problems such as the surgical join breaking down."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review compared two strategies: removing the urinary catheter early (before five days after the transplant) versus removing it later (five days or more after the transplant). The authors wanted to see whether early removal reduced the number of infections that show no symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), the number of symptomatic UTIs, and serious urinary problems that need extra treatment."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared early (≤5 days) versus late (≥5 days) urinary‑catheter removal after kidney transplantation, combined their results on infection and and complication outcomes, and rated our confidence in the evidence using risk‑of‑bias assessment and GRADE."

  ],
  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found two studies that together included 197 people who had received a kidney transplant. The studies compared removing the urinary catheter early (less than 5 days after surgery) with removing it later (5 days or more). All participants were adults (and possibly some children) and could have received kidneys from any type of donor. The studies only followed patients for up to one month after the transplant, and they did not report details such as age, gender, where the research was done, or who funded it.\n\nThe evidence shows that taking the catheter out early might lower, raise, or have little impact on the chance of finding bacteria in the urine without symptoms, but we are very uncertain about these effects. There is not enough evidence to tell whether early removal changes the risk of a urinary tract infection or serious urological problems."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small with few participants, so we cannot be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search."
