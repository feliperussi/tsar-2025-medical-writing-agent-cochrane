  "draft": "Is early removal (within 5 days) of a urinary catheter (a tube placed in the bladder) better than later removal (after 5 days) after a kidney transplant?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We do not have clear evidence that removing the catheter early changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without any symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria). The review found no reliable data on urinary‑tract infections (UTIs) or serious urinary complications, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The evidence comes from only two small studies, one of which gave very limited details. Overall confidence in the evidence is low and the findings are uncertain.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials with longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether early or late catheter removal influences infection rates or other important outcomes after kidney transplantation.\n\nWhat is kidney transplantation and why is a urinary catheter used?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys have stopped working. During the operation a thin tube called a urinary catheter is placed into the bladder. The catheter helps drain urine and reduces pressure on the new kidney’s connection to the bladder, giving the surgical join (the cysto‑ureteric anastomosis) a chance to heal. However, the catheter also creates a pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can lead to a urinary‑tract infection (UTI) – an infection that makes urination painful or frequent. The longer the tube stays in, the higher the chance of infection and other problems such as the surgical join breaking down.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared two strategies: removing the urinary catheter early (before five days after the transplant) versus removing it later (five days or more after the transplant). We wanted to see whether early removal reduced the number of infections that show no clear symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), the number of symptomatic UTIs, and serious urinary problems that need extra treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register for randomised trials that compared early (≤5 days) with late (≥5 days) catheter removal after kidney transplantation. Two reviewers screened the records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results for each outcome and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found two studies that together included 197 transplant recipients. Both studies compared early removal (less than 5 days) with later removal (5 days or more). The studies followed patients for up to one month and gave few details about participants or settings. We are very uncertain about the effects. Early removal might raise, lower, or not change the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms, and we cannot tell which is correct. Because the studies did not report data on symptomatic UTIs or serious urinary complications, we could not determine any effect on those outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants probably knew which timing they the received, many important outcomes were not reported, the studies involved different types of patients, used different methods, and were very small. These factors make the results uncertain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the April 2023 search.",
