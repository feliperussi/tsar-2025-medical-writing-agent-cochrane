  "draft": "Is early removal (within 5 days) of a urinary catheter (a tube placed in the bladder) better than later removal (after 5 days) after a kidney transplant?\n\nKey messages\n- We do not have clear evidence that removing the catheter early changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria). The review found no reliable data on urinary‑tract infections (UTIs) or serious urinary complications, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The evidence comes from only two small studies, one of which gave very limited details. Overall confidence in the evidence is low and the findings are uncertain.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials with longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether early or late catheter removal influences infection rates or other important outcomes after kidney transplantation.\n\nWhat is kidney transplantation and why is a urinary catheter used?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys have stopped working. During the operation a thin tube called a urinary catheter (a tube placed in the bladder) is inserted. The catheter helps drain urine and reduces pressure on the new kidney’s connection to the bladder, giving the surgical connection (the place where the new kidney is attached to the bladder) a chance to heal. However, the catheter also creates a pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary‑tract infection (UTI) – an infection that makes urination painful or frequent. The longer the tube stays in, the higher the chance of infection and other problems such as the surgical connection breaking down.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared two strategies: removing the urinary catheter early (before five days after the transplant) versus removing it later (five days or more after the transplant). We wanted to see whether early removal reduced the number of infections that show no symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), the number of symptomatic UTIs, and serious urinary problems that need extra treatment.\n\nHow did we look for the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared early (≤5 days) with late (≥5 days) urinary‑catheter removal after kidney transplantation. We combined the results on infection and complication outcomes and we rated our confidence in the evidence using risk‑of‑bias assessment and the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found two studies that together included 197 kidney‑transplant patients. One group had the catheter removed before five days, the other after five days. The studies followed patients for up to one month and did not report details such as age, gender, setting, or funding.\nThe evidence shows that early removal might lower, raise, or have little impact on the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms, but we are very uncertain about these effects. The studies did not report data on symptomatic UTIs or major urological complications, so we cannot say whether early removal affects those outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants might have known which timing they received, some outcomes were not reported, the studies used different patient groups and methods, and each study was very small. These factors make the results uncertain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date with searches completed in April 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural checklist (all required sections, question‑style headings, accurate numbers, <850 words) but contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse patients. 1) A long, redundant sentence in the background makes the role of the catheter hard to follow. 2) The methods paragraph has a typo and vague phrasing that obscures what was done. 3) The limitations paragraph is a run‑on sentence that packs many ideas together, making it difficult to grasp each limitation. These issues are reflected in the metric report (high nominalisation, many complex and long words). Suggested rewrites: • \"The catheter helps drain urine and reduces pressure on the new kidney’s connection to the bladder, giving the surgical connection (the place where the new kidney is attached to the bladder) a chance to heal.\" → \"The catheter drains urine and reduces pressure on the new kidney‑bladder connection, helping the surgical join heal.\" • \"We searched for studies that compared early (≤5 days) versus late (≥5 days) urinary‑catheter removal after kidney transplantation, combined their results on infection and and complication outcomes, and rated our confidence in the evidence using risk‑of‑bias assessment and GRADE.\" → \"We searched for studies that removed the urinary catheter early (≤5 days) or late (≥5 days) after kidney transplantation. We combined the results for infection and complication outcomes and assessed our confidence using risk‑of‑bias tools and GRADE.\" • \"We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small with few participants, so we cannot be certain about the results.\" → \"We are not confident in the evidence because: (1) participants may have known which timing they received; (2) some outcomes were not reported; (3) the studies used different patient groups and methods; and (4) each study was very small. These factors make the results uncertain.\" These revisions reduce sentence length, eliminate passive‑voice nominalisations, and improve readability for a lay audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on most metrics (e.g., FKGL 11.5, FRE 49.6, words per sentence 20.7) but shows notable deviations: nominalisation (30 instances, beyond P90), complex_words_dc (232, P90) and long_words (165, P90). These indicate excessive noun‑heavy phrasing and long words, which align with the identified long, complex sentences and run‑on structures."
