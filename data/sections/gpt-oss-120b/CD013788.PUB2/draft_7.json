  "draft": "Is early removal (within 5 days) of a urinary catheter (a tube placed in the bladder) better than later removal (after 5 days) after a kidney transplant?\n\nKey messages:\n- We do not have clear evidence that removing the catheter early changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria). The review found no reliable data on urinary‑tract infections (UTIs) or serious urinary complications, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The evidence comes from only two small studies, one of which gave very limited details. Overall confidence in the evidence is low and the findings are uncertain.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials with longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether early or late catheter removal influences infection rates or other important outcomes after kidney transplantation.\n\nWhat is kidney transplantation and why is a urinary catheter used?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys have stopped working. During the operation a thin tube called a urinary catheter is placed into the bladder. The catheter helps drain urine and reduces pressure on the new kidney’s connection to the bladder (the cysto‑ureteric anastomosis), giving the surgical join time to heal. However, the catheter also creates a pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary‑tract infection (UTI) – an infection that makes urination painful or frequent. The longer the tube stays in, the higher the chance of infection and other problems such as the surgical join breaking down.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared two strategies: removing the urinary catheter early (before five days after the transplant) versus removing it later (five days or more after the transplant). We wanted to see whether early removal reduced the number of infections that show no symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), the number of symptomatic UTIs, and serious urinary problems that need extra treatment.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared early (≤5 days) versus late (≥5 days) urinary‑catheter removal after kidney transplantation, combined their results on infection and complication outcomes, and rated our confidence in the evidence using a risk‑of‑bias assessment (checking how reliable the studies are) and GRADE (a system that rates how confident we are in the evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found two studies that together included 197 adults who had received a kidney transplant. The studies compared removing the catheter early (less than 5 days after surgery) with removing it later (5 days or more). The studies followed patients for up to one month and did not report details such as age, gender, setting, or funding.\nWe are very uncertain whether early removal changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms. The small studies could show a lower, higher, or unchanged risk, but they are too small to tell us.\nThe studies did not report data on symptomatic UTIs or major urological complications, so we cannot say whether early removal affects those outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which timing they received, some outcomes were not reported, the studies used different patient groups and methods, and each study was very small. These factors make the results uncertain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date with the April 2023 search.",

In addition, the text contains several clarity and style problems that would confuse patients:\n1. **Unexplained jargon / heavy nominalisation** – \"risk‑of‑bias assessment\" and \"GRADE (a system that rates how confident we are in the evidence)\" are technical terms and the sentence \"We searched for studies that compared early (≤5 days) versus late (≥5 days) urinary‑catheter removal after kidney transplantation, combined their results on infection and and complication outcomes, and rated our confidence in the evidence using risk‑of‑bias assessment and GRADE (a system that rates how confident we are in the evidence).\" is long, noun‑heavy and contains a duplicate word. *Rewrite*: \"We looked for studies that compared early (≤5 days) with late (≥5 days) catheter removal after kidney transplantation. We combined the results and judged how reliable the evidence was using simple checks for bias and a rating system called GRADE.\"\n2. **Long, complex sentences** – \"We found two studies that together included 197 adults who had received a kidney transplant. The studies compared removing the catheter early (less than 5 days after surgery) with removing it later (5 days or more).\" could be split for easier reading. *Rewrite*: \"We found two studies with a total of 197 kidney‑transplant patients. One group had the catheter removed before five days, the other after five days.\"\n3. **Passive voice** – \"The evidence is up to date with the April 2023 search.\" hides who performed the search. *Rewrite*: \"We updated the evidence using searches completed in April 2023.\"\n4. **Missing question‑style subheading** – \"Key messages:\" should be a question to match the style guide. *Rewrite*: \"What are the main messages?\"\n5. **High nominalisation and long words** – The metrics show 27 nominalisations, 246 Dale‑Chall complex words and 170 long words, far above typical PLS ranges. Re‑write noun‑heavy phrases such as \"the risk of bias in the included studies was generally either high or unclear\" to \"the studies often had high or unclear bias\" and replace long words (e.g., \"investigating\" → \"studying\").\nThese changes will lower the nominalisation, complex‑word and long‑word counts (bringing them closer to the median ranges) and improve readability for patients. Overall, the draft needs to adjust subheading format and simplify language before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall (61% of features in best quartile) but deviates on three metrics: nominalisation (27, beyond typical <13), Dale‑Chall complex words (246, beyond typical <160) and long words (170, beyond typical <122). These indicate excessive noun‑heavy and lengthy wording, supporting the recommended simplifications."
