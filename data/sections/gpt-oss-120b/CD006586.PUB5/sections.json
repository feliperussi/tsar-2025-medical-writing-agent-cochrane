  "key_messages": [
    "Drospirenone‑containing combined oral contraceptives (pills that include both estrogen and a synthetic hormone called drospirenone) may reduce overall premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms (physical and emotional problems that occur before a period) and help with daily activities, but the evidence is limited and the benefit seems modest; these pills also appear to cause more unwanted side effects, such as breast tenderness, nausea, and irregular bleeding, compared with placebo.",
    "The impact of these pills on mood‑related PMS symptoms (feelings such as irritability or sadness before a period) remains uncertain, and no studies have compared them with other combined oral contraceptives that contain different synthetic hormones.",
    "Because the existing studies were few, short‑term, and had methodological weaknesses, further well‑designed, longer‑lasting research is needed to confirm any benefits, better understand side‑effect risks, and compare drospirenone pills with other contraceptive options."

      "subheading": "What is premenstrual syndrome and why does it matter?",
      "content": "Many women feel physical and emotional changes in the days before their period. This is called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). When the symptoms are very severe, the condition is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Symptoms can include mood swings, irritability, low mood, breast tenderness, bloating and fatigue. Because the symptoms repeat each month, they can interfere with work, school, relationships and overall quality of life."

    {
      "subheading": "How are combined oral contraceptives used to treat PMS?",
      "content": "Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) contain two synthetic hormones: an estrogen called ethinylestradiol (EE) and a progestin. One progestin, drospirenone, may help reduce water retention and mood symptoms. A low‑dose COC that combines drospirenone with EE is approved in some countries for women who want both birth control and relief from PMDD. It is not yet clear how well this pill works compared with a placebo or whether it causes more side‑effects."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to determine whether COCs that contain drospirenone and a low dose of EE are effective and safe for treating women with PMS or PMDD. Specifically, the authors looked at whether these pills reduce premenstrual symptoms, improve daily functioning, and how often women stopped the pill because of side‑effects or experienced any adverse events."

      "content": "We searched databases for studies comparing drospirenone‑containing oral contraceptives with placebo or other contraceptives in women with premenstrual syndrome, combined their results, and assessed our confidence in the evidence."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified five randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 858 women, most of whom had premenstrual dysphoric disorder (a severe form of premenstrual syndrome). All participants were female; the abstract did not give details about their ages, the length of each study, where the studies were carried out, or who funded them. The trials compared combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol with a placebo; no studies compared these pills with other combined oral contraceptives.\n\nThe evidence suggests that women taking the drospirenone‑containing pill may experience a moderate reduction in overall premenstrual symptoms and a small improvement in how those symptoms affect daily life, such as work, social activities and relationships, although the certainty of this evidence is low. The pills also appear to increase the chance that a woman will stop treatment because of side‑effects (about 6 to 16 out of 100 women stop the drospirenone pill versus about 3 out of 100 on placebo). Overall side‑effects are likely to be more common (around 40 to 54 out of 100 women on the drospirenone pill versus about 28 out of 100 on placebo). In addition, the pills may increase the likelihood of a positive response to treatment (about 39 to 58 out of 100 women respond compared with about 36 out of 100 on placebo)."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search."
