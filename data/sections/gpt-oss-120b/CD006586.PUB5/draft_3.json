  "draft": "Do birth control pills containing drospirenone (a synthetic hormone) reduce premenstrual syndrome symptoms and cause more side effects than placebo?\n\nKey messages:\n- Drospirenone‑containing birth‑control pills may lower overall premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms and help women carry out daily activities, but the benefit is modest and the evidence is limited.\n- These pills increase the chance of side‑effects such as breast tenderness, nausea and irregular bleeding compared with placebo.\n- We need larger, longer‑term studies to confirm benefits, clarify side‑effect risks and compare drospirenone pills with other birth‑control options.\n\nWhat is premenstrual syndrome and why does it matter?\nMany women experience physical and emotional changes in the days before their period. This is called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). When symptoms are very severe, the condition is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Symptoms can include mood swings, irritability, low mood, breast tenderness, bloating and fatigue. Because the symptoms repeat each month, they can interfere with work, school, relationships and overall quality of life.\n\nHow are combined oral contraceptives used to treat PMS?\nCombined oral contraceptives (COCs), also called birth‑control pills, contain two synthetic hormones: an estrogen called ethinylestradiol (EE) and a progestin such as drospirenone. Drospirenone may reduce water retention and mood symptoms. A low‑dose COC that combines drospirenone with EE is approved in some countries for women who want both contraception and relief from PMDD. It is not yet clear how well this pill works compared with a placebo or whether it causes more side‑effects.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to determine whether drospirenone‑containing COCs are effective and safe for treating women with PMS or PMDD. Specifically, we looked at whether these pills reduce premenstrual symptoms, improve daily functioning, and how often women stop the pill because of side‑effects or experience any adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases up to June 2022 for randomised controlled trials that compared drospirenone‑containing birth‑control pills with placebo or other contraceptives in women with PMS. We combined the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five trials that together enrolled 858 women, most of whom had PMDD. All trials compared drospirenone‑containing COCs with a placebo; none compared them with other COCs. We found that women taking the drospirenone pill experienced a moderate reduction in overall PMS symptoms and a small improvement in daily functioning such as work, social activities and relationships. About 6 to 16 of 100 women stopped the drospirenone pill because of side‑effects, compared with about 3 of 100 on placebo. Overall side‑effects were more common (around 40 to 54 of 100 women on the drospirenone pill versus about 28 of 100 on placebo). The pills also increased the proportion of women who reported a positive response to treatment (about 39 to 58 of 100 women versus about 36 of 100 on placebo).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because participants may have known which pill they were taking, the studies involved different types of people, used different ways of delivering the pill, and were very small. These methodological weaknesses reduce the reliability of the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",
