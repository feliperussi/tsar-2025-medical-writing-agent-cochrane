  "draft": "Do birth control pills containing drospirenone (a synthetic hormone) reduce premenstrual syndrome symptoms and cause more side effects than placebo?\n\nKey messages:\n- Drospirenone‑containing combined oral contraceptives (pills that include both estrogen and the synthetic hormone drospirenone) may reduce overall premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms and help with daily activities. However, the evidence is limited, the benefit is modest, and these pills also appear to cause more side‑effects such as breast tenderness, nausea, and irregular bleeding compared with placebo.\n- The effect of these pills on mood‑related PMS symptoms (feelings such as irritability or sadness before a period) remains uncertain, and no studies have compared them with other combined oral contraceptives that contain different synthetic hormones.\n- Because the existing studies were few, short‑term, and had methodological weaknesses (problems with how the studies were designed or carried out), we need further well‑designed, longer‑lasting research to confirm any benefits, better understand side‑effect risks, and compare drospirenone pills with other contraceptive options.\n\nWhat is premenstrual syndrome and why does it matter?\nMany women feel physical and emotional changes in the days before their period. This is called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). When the symptoms are very severe, the condition is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Symptoms can include mood swings, irritability, low mood, breast tenderness, bloating and fatigue. Because the symptoms repeat each month, they can interfere with work, school, relationships and overall quality of life.\n\nHow are combined oral contraceptives used to treat PMS?\nCombined oral contraceptives (COCs) contain two synthetic hormones: an estrogen called ethinylestradiol (EE) and a progestin. One progestin, drospirenone, may help reduce water retention and mood symptoms. A low‑dose COC that combines drospirenone with EE is approved in some countries for women who want both birth control and relief from PMDD. It is not yet clear how well this pill works compared with a placebo (an inactive pill) or whether it causes more side‑effects.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to determine whether COCs that contain drospirenone and a low dose of EE are effective and safe for treating women with PMS or PMDD. Specifically, we looked at whether these pills reduce premenstrual symptoms, improve daily functioning, and how often women stop the pill because of side‑effects or experience any adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases up to June 2022 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared drospirenone‑containing oral contraceptives with placebo or other contraceptives in women with PMS. We combined the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five RCTs that together enrolled 858 women, most of whom had PMDD. The trials compared drospirenone‑containing COCs with a placebo; no studies compared these pills with other COCs.\nOur analysis suggests that women taking the drospirenone‑containing pill may experience a moderate reduction in overall PMS symptoms and a small improvement in how those symptoms affect daily life, such as work, social activities and relationships. The certainty of this evidence is low.\nThe pills also appear to increase the chance that a woman will stop treatment because of side‑effects (about 6 to 16 out of 100 women stop the drospirenone pill versus about 3 out of 100 on placebo). Overall side‑effects are more common (around 40 to 54 out of 100 women on the drospirenone pill versus about 28 out of 100 on placebo). In addition, the pills may increase the likelihood of a positive response to treatment (about 39 to 58 out of 100 women respond compared with about 36 out of 100 on placebo).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have known which pill they were taking, the studies involved different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small. These methodological weaknesses reduce the reliability of the findings.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural checklist, but several clarity‑related problems would likely confuse a lay reader. 1) Frequent passive constructions and noun‑heavy phrasing make it hard to see who is doing what (e.g., “The certainty of this evidence is low.”). 2) Some sentences exceed 30 words and bundle several ideas, reducing readability (e.g., the long sentence about side‑effects). 3) The abbreviation “COCs” and terms like “drospirenone‑containing COCs” are not fully explained for a non‑expert audience. These issues need revision before the summary can be considered patient‑friendly.\n\nSuggested improvements:\n- Replace passive phrasing with active voice: “We have low confidence in the evidence because participants may have known which pill they were taking…”.\n- Break long sentences into shorter ones: “The pills also appear to increase the chance that a woman will stop treatment because of side‑effects. About 6 to 16 of 100 women stop the drospirenone pill, compared with about 3 of 100 on placebo.”\n- Define abbreviations and simplify terminology: “combined oral contraceptives (COCs), also called birth‑control pills, contain two hormones – ethinylestradiol (EE) and a progestin such as drospirenone.”\n\nMetrics support these edits: the draft shows a high passive‑voice count (21, P90) and unusually many nouns (181, P90). Readability indices (SMOG 14.5, complex words 145) indicate the text is more complex than typical PLS (median SMOG ≈12). Reducing passive voice, shortening sentences, and lowering jargon will bring the draft closer to the typical PLS pattern.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit but deviates on several metrics: passive_voice (21, P90), nouns (181, P90), SMOG index (14.5, P90), complex_words_dc (274, P90), complex_words (145, P90) and long_words (201, P90). These indicate higher complexity and noun‑heaviness than typical Cochrane PLS texts. Other metrics (active_voice, pronouns, readability scores) are within typical ranges."
