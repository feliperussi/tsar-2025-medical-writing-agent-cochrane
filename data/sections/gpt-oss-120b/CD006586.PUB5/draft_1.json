  "draft": "Do birth control pills containing drospirenone (a synthetic hormone) reduce premenstrual syndrome symptoms and cause more side effects than placebo?\n\n- Drospirenone‑containing combined oral contraceptives (pills that include both estrogen and a synthetic hormone called drospirenone) may reduce overall premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms (physical and emotional problems that occur before a period) and help with daily activities, but the evidence is limited and the benefit seems modest; these pills also appear to cause more unwanted side effects, such as breast tenderness, nausea, and irregular bleeding, compared with placebo.\n- The impact of these pills on mood‑related PMS symptoms (feelings such as irritability or sadness before a period) remains uncertain, and no studies have compared them with other combined oral contraceptives that contain different synthetic hormones.\n- Because the existing studies were few, short‑term, and had methodological weaknesses, further well‑designed, longer‑lasting research is needed to confirm any benefits, better understand side‑effect risks, and compare drospirenone pills with other contraceptive options.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\n\nWhat is premenstrual syndrome and why does it matter?\nMany women feel physical and emotional changes in the days before their period. This is called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). When the symptoms are very severe, the condition is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Symptoms can include mood swings, irritability, low mood, breast tenderness, bloating and fatigue. Because the symptoms repeat each month, they can interfere with work, school, relationships and overall quality of life.\n\nHow are combined oral contraceptives used to treat PMS?\nCombined oral contraceptives (COCs) contain two synthetic hormones: an estrogen called ethinylestradiol (EE) and a progestin. One progestin, drospirenone, may help reduce water retention and mood symptoms. A low‑dose COC that combines drospirenone with EE is approved in some countries for women who want both birth control and relief from PMDD. It is not yet clear how well this pill works compared with a placebo or whether it causes more side‑effects.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe review set out to determine whether COCs that contain drospirenone and a low dose of EE are effective and safe for treating women with PMS or PMDD. Specifically, the authors looked at whether these pills reduce premenstrual symptoms, improve daily functioning, and how often women stopped the pill because of side‑effects or experienced any adverse events.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched databases for studies comparing drospirenone‑containing oral contraceptives with placebo or other contraceptives in women with premenstrual syndrome, combined their results, and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWe identified five randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 858 women, most of whom had premenstrual dysphoric disorder (a severe form of premenstrual syndrome). All participants were female; the abstract did not give details about their ages, the length of each study, where the studies were carried out, or who funded them. The trials compared combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol with a placebo; no studies compared these pills with other combined oral contraceptives.\n\nThe evidence suggests that women taking the drospirenone‑containing pill may experience a moderate reduction in overall premenstrual symptoms and a small improvement in how those symptoms affect daily life, such as work, social activities and relationships, although the certainty of this evidence is low. The pills also appear to increase the chance that a woman will stop treatment because of side‑effects (about 6 to 16 out of 100 women stop the drospirenone pill versus about 3 out of 100 on placebo). Overall side‑effects are likely to be more common (around 40 to 54 out of 100 women on the drospirenone pill versus about 28 out of 100 on placebo). In addition, the pills may increase the likelihood of a positive response to treatment (about 39 to 58 out of 100 women respond compared with about 36 out of 100 on placebo).\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because several section subheadings are not phrased as questions (Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement for question‑style subheadings. In addition, the first key‑message bullet is a single, very long sentence that mixes several ideas and uses a semicolon, making it hard for a lay reader to follow. The draft also contains a number of passive‑voice constructions (24 instances, well above the typical PLS range) which obscure who is doing the action and reduces readability. Finally, a few technical terms (e.g., \"combined oral contraceptives\", \"methodological weaknesses\") appear without simple explanations, which can confuse patients. Suggested fixes: 1) Rename subheadings to questions such as “How did we find the evidence?” (Methods), “What did we find?” (Results), “What are the limitations of the evidence?” (Limitations), and “How up to date is this review?” (Currency). 2) Split the opening bullet into two shorter sentences: “Drospirenone‑containing combined oral contraceptives (pills that include both estrogen and the synthetic hormone drospirenone) may reduce overall premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms and help with daily activities. However, the evidence is limited, the benefit is modest, and these pills also appear to cause more side‑effects such as breast tenderness, nausea, and irregular bleeding compared with placebo.” 3) Convert passive sentences to active voice (e.g., change “The evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.” to “We searched the literature up to June 2022.”). 4) Add brief plain‑language explanations for any remaining technical terms (e.g., define “methodological weaknesses” as “problems with how the studies were designed or carried out”). These changes will bring the PLS into full compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits (703 words) and most readability metrics are within typical PLS ranges (e.g., ARI 13.9, GFI 18.1, Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 44). However, it deviates markedly on several complexity measures: passive_voice (24, beyond P90), nouns (187, beyond P90), complex_words_dc (295, beyond P90), complex_words (154, beyond P90), long_words (217, beyond P90), and smog_index (14.75, beyond P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy phrasing, and many long or complex words, supporting the editorial recommendations above."
