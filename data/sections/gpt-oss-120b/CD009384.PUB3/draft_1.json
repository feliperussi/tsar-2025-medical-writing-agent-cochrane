  "draft": "Is giving zinc supplements (a mineral) effective at reducing death, illness, and poor growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Giving zinc supplements to children aged 6 months to 12 years does not appear to lower overall death rates and probably does not change death from diarrhoea, lung infections or malaria; however, it likely reduces how often children get diarrhoea and may lead to a small increase in height, while also increasing the chance of vomiting – the evidence for these effects is fairly reliable.\n- When zinc is taken together with iron, the positive effects on diarrhoea reduction and growth seem to be weaker, suggesting that combining these minerals may diminish zinc’s benefits.\n- More research is needed that follows children for longer periods and includes larger numbers, especially to clarify any impact on death from specific illnesses and to better understand the balance of benefits and unwanted side effects such as vomiting.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is zinc important for children’s health?\nMany children, especially in low- and middle-income countries, do not get enough zinc in their diet. Zinc is a mineral that helps the immune system work, protects against infections, and supports normal growth of the body and bones. When children lack zinc, they are more likely to become sick with illnesses such as diarrhoea, pneumonia (a type of lower-respiratory-tract infection), and malaria, and they may also grow more slowly or become shorter than expected. These problems can lead to higher rates of death (mortality) and illness (morbidity) among young children.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about zinc supplementation?\nThe review authors set out to discover whether giving zinc supplements to healthy children aged 6 months to 12 years can reduce the risk of death and illness and help them grow better. Specifically, they wanted to know if regular preventive zinc (usually given as a syrup containing 10–15 mg of zinc each day) lowers overall mortality, reduces deaths caused by diarrhoea, pneumonia, or malaria, decreases the number of illness episodes, and improves growth measures such as height. They also examined whether taking zinc might cause any unwanted side effects.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that examined preventive zinc supplementation in children aged 6 months to 12 years, combined their findings on mortality, morbidity and growth, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review looked at 96 randomised controlled trials that together included 219,584 children aged 6 months to 12 years (most were under five). The studies were carried out in 34 countries, with 87 % of them in low- or middle-income settings. Zinc was usually given as a syrup containing zinc sulfate at a daily dose of 10–15 mg and was compared with no zinc, a placebo or a waiting‑list control. The median follow‑up time was 26 weeks. No information on funding sources was provided, and the review did not include studies of zinc fortification, sprinkles or therapeutic zinc.\n\nMain results: Effect of preventive zinc supplementation\nGiving zinc to children probably makes little or no difference to overall death rates and to deaths caused by diarrhoea. It probably reduces deaths from lower‑respiratory infections and from malaria. Zinc probably reduces the number of diarrhoea episodes a little, but does not change the overall rate of respiratory infections. It probably leads to a small increase in height and increases the chance that a child will experience vomiting.\n\n**Limitations**\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",

(2) The first key‑message misstates the evidence on mortality from lung infections and malaria – the review suggests a possible reduction (moderate‑certainty) rather than ‘no change’. (3) Several sentences use passive voice and are noun‑heavy, contributing to high noun count (193, P90) and elevated SMOG (13.7, P90) and complex‑word metrics, which reduce readability for patients.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Key messages\" (and other headings). Problem: headings are statements, not questions, violating style guide. Rewrite as: \"What are the main findings?\"; \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"; \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\" etc.\n2. **Factual accuracy in key message** – Quote: \"does not appear to lower overall death rates and probably does not change death from diarrhoea, lung infections or malaria…\" Problem: suggests no effect on lung‑infection or malaria deaths, contrary to the review which indicates a likely reduction (moderate certainty). Rewrite: \"does not appear to lower overall death rates and probably does not change death from diarrhoea, while it may reduce deaths from lung infections and malaria, although the evidence is less certain.\"\n3. **Passive voice** – Quote: \"The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.\" Problem: passive construction obscures who performed the search. Rewrite: \"We updated the review with evidence up to February 2022.\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy sentence** – Quote: \"The review looked at 96 randomised controlled trials that together included 219,584 children aged 6 months to 12 years (most were under five).\" Problem: dense noun cluster makes the sentence hard to follow. Rewrite: \"We examined 96 trials involving 219,584 children aged 6 months to 12 years, most of whom were under five years old.\"\n5. **Long sentence** – Quote: \"When zinc is taken together with iron, the positive effects on diarrhoea reduction and growth seem to be weaker, suggesting that combining these minerals may diminish zinc’s benefits.\" Problem: complex structure may overwhelm readers. Rewrite: \"If zinc is taken with iron, the benefits for reducing diarrhoea and improving growth appear weaker. This suggests that iron may lessen zinc’s positive effects.\"\n\nSupporting metrics: The draft shows a high noun count (193, beyond typical P90), SMOG index 13.7 (above median), many complex words (127) and long words (180), all indicating the text is more difficult than typical PLS. Passive voice count is 17 (P75), confirming the need to shift to active constructions. These metric signals align with the editorial issues identified above.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns but deviates on five key metrics: nouns (193, P90), SMOG index (13.7, P90), complex words (127, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (262, P90) and long words (180, P90). These suggest the text is more noun‑heavy and lexically complex than usual, supporting the recommended reductions in noun density, complex vocabulary, and sentence length."
