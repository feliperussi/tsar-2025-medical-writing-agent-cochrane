  "draft": "Is giving zinc supplements (a mineral) effective at reducing death, illness, and poor growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving zinc supplements to children aged 6 months to 12 years does not lower overall death rates and probably does not change death from diarrhoea, lung infections or malaria; however, it likely reduces how often children get diarrhoea and may lead to a small increase in height, while also increasing the chance of vomiting. The evidence for these effects is moderate‑certainty to high‑certainty.\n- When zinc is taken together with iron, the benefits for reducing diarrhoea and improving growth appear weaker, suggesting that iron may lessen zinc’s positive effects.\n- More research that follows children for longer periods and includes larger numbers is needed, especially to clarify any impact on death from specific illnesses and to better understand the balance of benefits and side effects such as vomiting.\n\nWhy is zinc important for children’s health?\nMany children, especially in low‑ and middle‑income countries, do not get enough zinc in their diet. Zinc is a mineral that helps the immune system work, protects against infections, and supports normal growth of the body and bones. When children lack zinc, they are more likely to become sick with diarrhoea (watery stools), pneumonia (a type of lower‑respiratory‑tract infection or lung infection), and malaria, and they may grow more slowly or become shorter than expected. These problems can lead to higher rates of death (mortality) and illness (morbidity).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about zinc supplementation?\nWe wanted to know whether giving zinc supplements to healthy children aged 6 months to 12 years can reduce the risk of death and illness and help them grow better. Specifically, we asked if daily preventive zinc (usually 10–15 mg as a syrup) lowers overall mortality, reduces deaths caused by diarrhoea, pneumonia, or malaria, decreases the number of illness episodes, and improves growth measures such as height. We also looked for any unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared giving zinc with no zinc, a placebo, or a waiting‑list control in children aged 6 months to 12 years. We excluded hospitalised children, children with chronic diseases, and studies that used zinc fortification, sprinkles, or therapeutic zinc. Two reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 96 trials that included 219,584 children. Most children were under five years old. The trials were carried out in 34 countries, 87 % of which were low‑ or middle‑income. Zinc was usually given as a syrup containing zinc sulfate, at a daily dose of 10–15 mg. The median follow‑up time was 26 weeks.\n\nWhat are the effects of giving zinc?\n- Overall death rates: little or no difference (high‑certainty evidence).\n- Death from diarrhoea: probably no change (moderate‑certainty evidence).\n- Death from lung infections and malaria: probably reduced (moderate‑certainty evidence, but confidence intervals are wide).\n- Diarrhoea episodes: probably reduced (moderate‑certainty evidence).\n- Respiratory infections overall: little or no difference (high‑certainty evidence).\n- Height: probably a small increase (moderate‑certainty evidence).\n- Vomiting: we found that zinc increased the number of children who experienced at least one episode of vomiting (high‑certainty evidence).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in many outcomes is only moderate because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. Some outcomes have wide confidence intervals, meaning the true effect could be larger or smaller than we estimate.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe updated the review with evidence that was available up to February 2022.",

Additionally, the draft contains several clarity and style issues that could confuse readers:\n1. \"Key messages\" – not a question. Rewrite as \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. Long, dense sentence: \"Giving zinc supplements to children aged 6 months to 12 years does not lower overall death rates and probably does not change death from diarrhoea, lung infections or malaria; however, it likely reduces how often children get diarrhoea and may lead to a small increase in height, while also increasing the chance of vomiting.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words and mixes several ideas, making it hard to follow. Rewrite into shorter bullet points.\n3. Jargon without definition: the term \"high‑certainty evidence\" appears without explanation. Readers may not understand what this means. Add a brief definition, e.g., \"high‑certainty evidence (we are very confident the result is correct)\".\n4. Passive construction: \"We examined 96 trials that included 219,584 children.\" While acceptable, the draft contains many nominalisations (23) and noun‑heavy sentences, reducing readability. Convert to more active phrasing where possible, e.g., \"We looked at 96 trials involving 219,584 children.\".\n5. Missing blank line after the title and before the first heading, which reduces white‑space and makes the text appear as a wall of text.\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Change heading to: **What are the key messages?**\n- Break the long key‑message sentence into bullet points:\n  - \"Zinc supplements do not lower overall death rates (high‑certainty evidence).\"\n  - \"They probably do not change death from diarrhoea (moderate‑certainty evidence).\"\n  - \"They probably reduce deaths from lung infections and malaria, but the confidence intervals are wide.\"\n  - \"Zinc probably reduces diarrhoea episodes (moderate‑certainty evidence).\"\n  - \"Zinc probably leads to a small increase in height (moderate‑certainty evidence).\"\n  - \"Zinc increases the chance of vomiting (high‑certainty evidence).\"\n- Define evidence certainty: \"high‑certainty evidence (we are very confident the result is correct)\".\n- Use active verbs: \"We looked at 96 trials involving 219,584 children\".\n- Insert blank lines between the title, each heading, and paragraphs.\n\nMetrics support these suggestions: the draft shows high nominalisation (23, beyond typical P90), many nouns (196, beyond typical P90), and elevated SMOG (14.05) and complex word counts, indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical PLS. Reducing nominalisations and breaking long sentences will improve readability and align the draft with typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit (647 words) and has good readability scores (Flesch Reading Ease 59, words per sentence 20). However, several linguistic features deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisation (23, P90), noun count (196, P90), SMOG index (14.05, P90), complex words (139, P90) and long words (181, P90) are all higher than the median, indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than usual. These metric deviations support the need to reduce nominalisations, simplify language, and break up long sentences."
