  "draft": "Is giving zinc supplements (a mineral) effective at reducing death, illness, and poor growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- Giving zinc supplements to children aged 6 months to 12 years does not lower overall death rates and probably does not change death from diarrhoea, but it may reduce deaths from lower‑respiratory infections (LRTI, including pneumonia) and malaria (moderate‑by‑certainty evidence). \n- Zinc probably reduces how often children get diarrhoea and leads to a small increase in height, but it also raises the chance of vomiting (high‑certainty evidence).\n- When zinc is taken together with iron, the benefits for diarrhoea reduction and growth appear weaker, suggesting iron may lessen zinc’s positive effects.\n\nWhy is zinc important for children’s health?\nMany children, especially in low‑ and middle‑income countries, do not get enough zinc in their diet. Zinc is a mineral that helps the immune system work, protects against infections, and supports normal growth of the body and bones. When children lack zinc, they are more likely to become sick with diarrhoea, pneumonia (a type of lower‑respiratory‑tract infection), and malaria, and they may grow more slowly or become shorter than expected. These problems can lead to higher rates of death (mortality) and illness (morbidity).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about zinc supplementation?\nWe wanted to know whether giving zinc supplements to healthy children aged 6 months to 12 years can reduce the risk of death and illness and help them grow better. Specifically, we asked if daily preventive zinc (10–15 mg) lowers overall mortality, reduces deaths caused by diarrhoea, pneumonia, or malaria, decreases the number of illness episodes, and improves growth measures such as height. We also looked for any unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared preventive zinc supplementation with no zinc, a placebo, or a waiting‑list control in children aged 6 months to 12 years. We excluded hospitalised children, those with chronic diseases, and studies that used zinc fortification, sprinkles, or therapeutic zinc. Two reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 96 trials involving 219,584 children, most of whom were under five years old. The trials were conducted in 34 countries, 87 % of them in low‑ or middle‑income settings. Zinc was usually given as a syrup containing zinc sulfate at a daily dose of 10–15 mg. The median follow‑up time was 26 weeks.\n\nWhat are the effects of preventive zinc supplementation?\n- Overall death rates: little or no difference (high‑certainty evidence).\n- Death from diarrhoea: probably no change (moderate‑certainty evidence).\n- Death from lower‑respiratory infections and malaria: probably reduced (moderate‑certainty evidence, but confidence intervals are wide).\n- Diarrhoea episodes: probably reduced (moderate‑certainty evidence).\n- Respiratory infections overall: little or no difference (high‑certainty evidence).\n- Height: probably a small increase (moderate‑certainty evidence).\n- Vomiting: probably more common (high‑certainty evidence).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in many outcomes is only moderate because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results. Some outcomes have wide confidence intervals, meaning the true effect could be larger or smaller than we estimate.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe updated the review with evidence that was available up to February 2022.\n",

      "feedback": "Critical checks failed: the draft does not include a separate \"Key messages\" section as required by the Master Style Guide, so the completeness criterion is not met. Additionally, the phrase \"moderate‑by‑certainty evidence\" is a typographical error that creates confusion for readers. The draft also contains several clarity and style issues that would hinder patient understanding:\n1. **Unexplained/incorrect jargon** – \"moderate‑by‑certainty evidence\" (quote: \"moderate‑by‑certainty evidence\"). This term is not defined and the hyphenated form is incorrect, making the certainty level unclear. *Rewrite*: \"moderate‑certainty evidence\".\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"We examined 96 trials involving 219,584 children, most of whom were under five years old, the trials were conducted in 34 countries, 87 % of them in low‑ or middle‑income settings, and zinc was usually given as a syrup containing zinc sulfate at a daily dose of 10–15 mg.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words and packs multiple ideas, which can overwhelm readers. *Rewrite*: \"We examined 96 trials that included 219,584 children. Most children were under five years old. The trials were carried out in 34 countries, 87 % of which were low‑ or middle‑income. Zinc was usually given as a syrup containing zinc sulfate, at a daily dose of 10–15 mg.\"\n3. **Passive construction** – \"Zinc supplementation was associated with an increase in the number of participants with at least one vomiting episode\" (quote from original abstract, reflected in the draft as \"Zinc supplementation was associated with an increase in the number of participants with at least one vomiting episode\"). Passive voice hides who observed the effect. *Rewrite*: \"We found that zinc supplementation increased the number of children who experienced at least one episode of vomiting.\"\n4. **Nominalisation and noun‑heavy phrasing** – The draft frequently uses noun‑heavy phrases such as \"preventive zinc supplementation\" and \"the effects of preventive zinc supplementation\". Metrics show nominalisations (25, P90) and nouns (179, P90) far above typical PLS ranges, which reduces readability. *Rewrite*: Replace with verb‑focused language, e.g., \"Giving zinc\" instead of \"preventive zinc supplementation\".\n5. **Missing explicit Key Messages heading** – The draft presents findings under \"What are the main findings?\" but does not label a separate \"Key messages\" section, violating the required structure.\n\nSupporting metrics: The PLS evaluation shows high nominalisation (25, P90), high noun count (179, P90), and high counts of complex words (129, P90) and Dale‑Chall complex words (252, P90). These deviations confirm the need to simplify language, reduce noun‑heavy constructions, and replace complex terms with everyday words.\n\nTo meet the style guide and improve patient comprehension, the draft should add a clear \"Key messages\" section, correct the typo, break long sentences, convert passive voice to active voice, and reduce nominalisations and complex vocabulary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most PLS patterns (overall conformity HIGH), but four metrics deviate significantly: nominalisation (25, P90), nouns (179, P90), complex_words_dc (252, P90), and complex_words (129, P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than typical PLS, suggesting a need to simplify language and increase verb usage."
