  "plain_title": "Is giving zinc supplements (a mineral) effective at reducing death, illness, and poor growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Giving zinc supplements to children aged 6 months to 12 years does not appear to lower overall death rates and probably does not change death from diarrhoea, lung infections or malaria; however, it likely reduces how often children get diarrhoea and may lead to a small increase in height, while also increasing the chance of vomiting – the evidence for these effects is fairly reliable.",
    "When zinc is taken together with iron, the positive effects on diarrhoea reduction and growth seem to be weaker, suggesting that combining these minerals may diminish zinc’s benefits.",
    "More research is needed that follows children for longer periods and includes larger numbers, especially to clarify any impact on death from specific illnesses and to better understand the balance of benefits and unwanted side effects such as vomiting."

      "subheading": "Why is zinc important for children’s health?",
      "content": "Many children, especially in low- and middle-income countries, do not get enough zinc in their diet. Zinc is a mineral that helps the immune system work, protects against infections, and supports normal growth of the body and bones. When children lack zinc, they are more likely to become sick with illnesses such as diarrhoea, pneumonia (a type of lower-respiratory-tract infection), and malaria, and they may also grow more slowly or become shorter than expected. These problems can lead to higher rates of death (mortality) and illness (morbidity) among young children."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out about zinc supplementation?",
      "content": "The review authors set out to discover whether giving zinc supplements to healthy children aged 6 months to 12 years can reduce the risk of death and illness and help them grow better. Specifically, they wanted to know if regular preventive zinc (usually given as a syrup containing 10–15 mg of zinc each day) lowers overall mortality, reduces deaths caused by diarrhoea, pneumonia, or malaria, decreases the number of illness episodes, and improves growth measures such as height. They also examined whether taking zinc might cause any unwanted side effects."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review looked at 96 randomised controlled trials that together included 219,584 children aged 6 months to 12 years (most were under five). The studies were carried out in 34 countries, with 87 % of them in low- or middle-income settings. Zinc was usually given as a syrup containing zinc sulfate at a daily dose of 10–15 mg and was compared with no zinc, a placebo or a waiting‑list control. The median follow‑up time was 26 weeks. No information on funding sources was provided, and the review did not include studies of zinc fortification, sprinkles or therapeutic zinc."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Effect of preventive zinc supplementation",
      "content": "Giving zinc to children probably makes little or no difference to overall death rates and to deaths caused by diarrhoea. It probably reduces deaths from lower‑respiratory infections and from malaria. Zinc probably reduces the number of diarrhoea episodes a little, but does not change the overall rate of respiratory infections. It probably leads to a small increase in height and increases the chance that a child will experience vomiting."
