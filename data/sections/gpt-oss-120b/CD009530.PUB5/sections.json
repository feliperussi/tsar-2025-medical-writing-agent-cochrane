  "key_messages": [
    "Using bronchoscopy (a tube with a camera that collects lung fluid) to guide antibiotic treatment in children with cystic fibrosis does not appear to improve lung function, chest scan scores, nutrition, bacterial counts, quality of life, or the number of lung flare-ups compared with standard care based on symptoms and throat or cough swabs, and it may lead to more hospital stays; the procedure can also cause temporary worsening of cough and, in a small number of cases, serious short-term clinical deterioration.",
    "The available evidence comes from only two small randomised studies in infants and school-age children, with no data for adults, and the overall quality of the evidence is limited, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about benefits, harms, or cost differences.",
    "Future research should include larger, well-designed trials that follow participants for longer periods, include older children and adults, and carefully assess both the potential advantages and the safety and cost implications of bronchoscopy-guided therapy."

      "subheading": "Why are lung infections a concern in cystic fibrosis and how are they usually diagnosed?",
      "content": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that makes thick, sticky mucus build up in the lungs. This mucus traps bacteria, leading to frequent lung infections that damage the airways over time. Early treatment is important to keep lung function as good as possible. \n\nDoctors usually look for the bacteria by testing sputum (the thick mucus a person coughs up) or by taking swabs from the throat or mouth (oropharyngeal samples). Many children with CF cannot produce sputum, and throat swabs may miss the germs that are actually living deeper in the lungs. \n\nBronchoscopy is a procedure where a thin tube is slipped down the airway to collect fluid directly from the lower lungs. The fluid collected by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) – a wash of the lung’s tiny air sacs – often shows more bacteria than throat swabs. The idea is that using BAL results to choose antibiotics might lead to better treatment, but the procedure is invasive and can cause coughing or brief worsening of symptoms."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out about bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotic treatment?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether basing antibiotic choices on BAL results (bronchoscopy‑guided therapy) improves outcomes for people with CF compared with the usual practice of using clinical signs and oropharyngeal cultures. Specifically, they looked at whether this approach changes lung‑function measures such as the lung clearance index (LCI – a test that shows how well air moves through the lungs) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1 – the amount of air a person can forcefully exhale in one second), affects the number of infections, hospital stays, quality of life, and the cost of care. By reviewing randomised controlled trials, they aimed to see if the extra effort and risk of bronchoscopy provide any real benefit for children (and adults, if data existed) with cystic fibrosis."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified two randomised controlled trials that together enrolled about 200 children with cystic fibrosis – 170 infants under six months old and 30 school‑aged to adolescent children. In both studies, doctors compared two approaches to choosing antibiotics: one used bronchoscopy‑guided bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results (and, in the second study, an increase in lung clearance index) to decide treatment, while the other relied on standard clinical assessment and throat or cough cultures.\n\nThe evidence from these trials suggests that using bronchoscopy to guide antibiotic therapy probably makes little or no difference to several important outcomes. Lung function was similar after two and five years of follow‑up, chest‑scan scores showed no clear benefit, and there was little or no effect on nutritional status, the number of Pseudomonas bacteria isolated, overall cost of care, or health‑related quality of life. There may be a slight increase in the number of hospital admissions with bronchoscopy‑guided treatment, but the certainty of this finding is low. Overall, the current evidence does not support a clear benefit of routinely using bronchoscopy to decide antibiotic therapy in children with cystic fibrosis."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2023 of search."
