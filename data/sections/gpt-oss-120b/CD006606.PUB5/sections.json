  "key_messages": [
    "The available research does not provide a clear answer about whether in‑vitro maturation (IVM – maturing eggs in the laboratory) gives the same chance of a live birth (a baby born alive) as standard in‑vitro fertilisation (IVF – fertilising eggs after they have been collected following hormonal stimulation) for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS – a condition causing hormonal imbalance and fertility problems). The evidence is very uncertain about overall success, but IVM appears to increase the risk of miscarriage (loss of a pregnancy after it has been confirmed) and to reduce the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS – a potentially serious reaction to fertility drugs).",
    "Other outcomes such as preterm birth (baby born before full term) and congenital anomalies (birth defects) seem to be similar between IVM and IVF, although the data are limited.",
    "Future research should include larger, high‑quality trials that directly compare IVM with IVF and report long‑term outcomes, so that the true benefits and harms for women with PCOS can be clarified."

      "subheading": "What is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and why does it affect fertility?",
      "content": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal condition that affects about 8 % to 13 % of women of child‑bearing age. Women with PCOS often have irregular periods, higher levels of male‑type hormones, and ovaries that contain many small cysts. These changes can make it harder for an egg to mature and be released, leading to difficulty getting pregnant. In fact, PCOS is found in roughly half of all women who seek help because they have not become pregnant after a year of regular, unprotected sex."

      "subheading": "What are the usual assisted‑reproduction techniques and their problems for women with PCOS?",
      "content": "When natural conception is unlikely, many couples turn to assisted reproductive technologies such as in‑vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In IVF/ICSI, doctors stimulate the ovaries with high doses of medicines called gonadotrophins to produce many eggs, retrieve those eggs, fertilise them in the laboratory, and then transfer the resulting embryos back into the uterus. For women with PCOS, this strong stimulation often leads to an exaggerated response: a large number of immature or uneven‑quality eggs are produced, and there is a higher risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially serious condition where the ovaries become swollen and fluid leaks into the body. To avoid these issues, a newer approach called in‑vitro maturation (IVM) has been explored. In IVM, doctors collect eggs that are still immature (at the germinal‑vesicle stage) and let them mature in the lab before fertilisation, potentially reducing the need for high‑dose stimulation and the risk of OHSS."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to compare the benefits and harms of using IVM (followed by IVF or ICSI) with the standard IVF/ICSI approach in women with PCOS. Specifically, they looked at whether IVM changes the chances of a live birth, the risk of miscarriage, the likelihood of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and other important outcomes such as preterm birth and congenital anomalies."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found four randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 810 women with polycystic ovarian syndrome who were undergoing assisted reproductive technology. The trials compared in‑vitro maturation (IVM) of immature eggs followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI performed under a GnRH‑antagonist protocol. The abstract did not give details about how long the studies lasted, where they were conducted, or who funded them. All participants were women of reproductive age diagnosed with PCOS and experiencing subfertility.\n\nWe are uncertain whether IVM changes the chance of having a live birth or achieving a clinical pregnancy compared with standard IVF. IVM probably increases the risk of miscarriage per clinical pregnancy and probably reduces the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. IVM probably makes little or no difference to preterm birth and may make little or no difference to congenital anomalies."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the studies were very small, and because the studies were done in different types of people/used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
