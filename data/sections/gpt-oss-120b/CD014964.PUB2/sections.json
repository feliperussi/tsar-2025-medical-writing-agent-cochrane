  "key_messages": [
    "Using ultrasound imaging (sound‑based imaging) to guide the placement of spinal or epidural anaesthesia (numbing the back) in adults generally leads to fewer needle attempts and a shorter procedure time compared with using feel‑based anatomical landmarks (body landmarks felt by hand), and it is likely to increase the chance of succeeding on the first try. No clear increase in complications or pain has been identified, but the evidence about these outcomes is uncertain.",
    "Patient satisfaction and technical failure (the procedure not being completed successfully) appear similar between the two approaches, although the current evidence is limited and not definitive.",
    "Future research should include well‑designed studies that evaluate pain during the procedure, rare adverse events, and the use of real‑time ultrasound (ultrasound used while inserting the needle) to provide clearer information on any potential harms and to confirm the observed benefits."

      "content": "Neuraxial anaesthesia – the injection of medicine into the space around the spinal cord (spinal or epidural anaesthesia) – is a common way to numb the lower part of the body for surgery, childbirth, or other procedures. Getting the needle into the right spot is crucial: each extra poke can increase the risk of bleeding, infection, or nerve irritation, and it can make the patient uncomfortable. Traditionally, clinicians locate the correct spot by feeling the patient’s back and using visible body landmarks (the \"anatomical landmarks\"). However, the shape and position of the spinal spaces can vary between people, and what feels right by touch may not match the actual anatomy, leading to multiple attempts and longer procedure times. Reducing the number of needle passes and the time needed for the block can improve safety, lower complications, and increase patient satisfaction."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to compare two ways of guiding the needle for neuraxial anaesthesia: using an ultrasound machine (which creates a real‑time picture of the spine’s structures) versus relying only on the clinician’s feel for the anatomical landmarks. Specifically, they assessed whether ultrasound guidance improves the success of the block (such as achieving the first‑attempt success), reduces the number of attempts and the time needed to place the needle, and whether it affects patient satisfaction, pain during the procedure, technical failures, or any adverse events. In short, the review sought to determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of ultrasound‑guided neuraxial anaesthesia in adults."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at 65 randomised controlled trials that together included 6,823 adult participants (aged 18 years and older). The trials were carried out around the world – in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and Oceania – and were published between 2001 and 2023. About half of the studies (32 trials, 3,149 participants) focused on obstetric patients receiving labour epidural or caesarean‑section anaesthesia; the remaining trials involved patients undergoing various surgical procedures under neuraxial anaesthesia. All studies compared ultrasound guidance (pre‑procedural, and in four trials real‑time ultrasound) with the conventional use of anatomical landmarks for placing the neuraxial block. No funding was reported for the included studies, and the abstract gave no details on gender distribution, severity of the underlying conditions, or the duration of each study."

      "subheading": "Main results: Ultrasound guidance for neuraxial anaesthesia",
      "content": "Ultrasound guidance probably increases the chance of succeeding on the first attempt, reduces the number of attempts needed, and shortens the time taken for the procedure. It may make little or no difference to how satisfied patients feel or to the risk of technical failure, and it is unclear whether it reduces pain during the procedure or prevents adverse events."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
