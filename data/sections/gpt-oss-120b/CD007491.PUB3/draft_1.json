  "draft": "Is receiving hospital-level care at home (hospital at home that avoids admission) as safe and less costly as staying in the hospital for older adults?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Hospital‑at‑home care for older adults appears to be about as safe as staying in the hospital, showing similar mortality (death rate) and similar readmission (being admitted again) rates, and it probably reduces the chance of moving into residential care (a care home); no harmful effects were reported, and the evidence is of moderate quality (studies that are reasonably reliable).\n- People receiving care at home may feel more satisfied (more happy with their care), have similar overall health status, experience shorter initial hospital stays (fewer days in the hospital), and the approach probably lowers health‑service costs (money spent on care); the evidence for these outcomes is also of moderate quality.\n- Future research should include longer‑term studies, more data on caregiver impacts, and high‑quality cost analyses to confirm these findings and address remaining uncertainties.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nWhat is admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home and why is it needed?\nWhen a person becomes seriously ill, the usual response is to admit them to a hospital for acute (short‑term) care. Hospital stays can be expensive, stressful, and may increase the chance that older adults later move into residential care. \"Admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home\" is a service where doctors, nurses and other health professionals provide the same active treatment that would normally be given in a hospital, but they do it in the patient’s own home for a limited period. The goal is to treat conditions that would otherwise require a hospital bed—such as flare‑ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recovery after a stroke, or other acute medical problems—while keeping patients in a familiar environment.\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review authors set out to determine whether admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home works as well as, or better than, traditional inpatient hospital care. Specifically, they wanted to compare the two approaches in terms of health outcomes (like survival and the need for later hospital readmission), patient‑reported wellbeing and satisfaction, the likelihood of ending up in residential care, length of stay, and the overall cost to the health service and society.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched databases for studies that compared admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home with usual inpatient care in adults, combined their results in meta‑analyses, and rated our confidence in the evidence (using the GRADE approach) based on study quality and size.\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nThe review incorporated 20 randomised controlled trials enrolling a total of 3,100 participants aged 18 years and older. The trials compared admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home programmes, in which active treatment is delivered at the patient’s home for a limited period, with standard acute hospital inpatient care. Participants included older adults with a range of conditions: four trials focused on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, two on post‑stroke recovery, seven on acute medical illnesses primarily affecting older people, and the remaining trials involved mixed clinical populations. The abstract does not provide details on the duration of the individual studies, the countries or settings in which they were conducted, or the sources of funding for the trials.\nMain results: Admission avoidance hospital at home\nAdmission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little to no difference to the chance of dying within six months or being readmitted to hospital within three to twelve months. It probably reduces the chance of ending up in residential care within six months (about half as many people as with usual hospital care). It probably makes little to no difference to how patients rate their own health, may increase patients' satisfaction with care, may reduce the initial length of hospital stay, and probably reduces the cost to the health service.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because of concerns that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies provided all needed data, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.\n\nCURRENCY\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check: section headings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"METHODS\", \"RESULTS\", \"LIMITATIONS\", \"CURRENCY\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement that subheadings be question‑style. Additionally, several clarity issues need fixing:\n1. **Long, dense sentence** – \"We searched databases for studies that compared admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home with usual inpatient care in adults, combined their results in meta‑analyses, and rated our confidence in the evidence (using the GRADE approach) based on study quality and size.\" This 33‑word sentence is hard to follow. Rewrite as: \"We searched databases for studies that compared admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home with usual inpatient care in adults. We combined the results in meta‑analyses and used the GRADE approach to rate our confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\"\n2. **Passive voice** – \"The abstract does not provide details on the duration of the individual studies, the countries or settings in which they were conducted, and the sources of funding for the trials.\" Rewrite actively: \"We do not have details on the study durations, the countries or settings where they were conducted, or the funding sources for the trials.\"\n3. **Jargon without definition** – the term \"GRADE\" appears without explanation. Add a brief definition: \"We used the GRADE system, which assesses how confident we can be in the evidence.\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy bullet** – \"Key messages\" paragraph contains long noun strings like \"hospital‑at‑home care for older adults appears to be about as safe as staying in the hospital, showing similar mortality (death rate) and similar readmission (being admitted again) rates, and it probably reduces the chance of moving into residential care (a care home); no harmful effects were reported, and the evidence is of moderate quality (studies that are reasonably reliable).\" Break into shorter bullet points for readability.\n5. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – change headings to questions, e.g., \"How did we find the evidence?\" for Methods, \"What did we find?\" for Results, \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" for Limitations, and \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\" for Currency.\nThese changes address the most confusing elements for patients and bring the draft into line with the style guide. Metrics support the need for simplification: the draft has 30.8 words per sentence (beyond P90), 27 passive constructions, and high readability scores (FKGL 15.3, GFI 21.1), indicating the text is more complex than typical PLS. Overall, the draft needs revised headings, shorter sentences, active voice, clearer explanations of technical terms, and more concise bullet points before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit but deviates from typical PLS patterns on many metrics: words per sentence (30.8, BEYOND_P90), passive voice (27, high), nominalizations (25, BEYOND_P90), and readability indices (FKGL 15.3, GFI 21.1, LIX 60.7) all fall beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the text is longer, more noun‑heavy, and harder to read than usual PLS. These metric alerts align with the identified clarity and style issues."
