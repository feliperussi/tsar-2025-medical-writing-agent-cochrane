  "draft": "Is receiving hospital‑level care at home (hospital‑at‑home that avoids admission) as safe and less costly as staying in the hospital for older adults?\n\nKey messages\n- Hospital‑at‑home is about as safe as a regular hospital stay; death rates and readmission rates are similar, and it probably cuts the chance of moving into a care home (residential care) by about half. We are moderately confident in these findings.\n- People cared for at home tend to be more satisfied, report similar overall health, have shorter initial hospital stays, and the approach probably reduces health‑service costs. The evidence for these outcomes is also of moderate confidence.\n- Future research should look at longer‑term effects, the impact on caregivers, and high‑quality cost analyses.\n\nWhat is admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home and why is it needed?\nWhen a person becomes seriously ill, the usual response is to admit them to a hospital for acute (short‑term) care. Hospital stays can be expensive, stressful, and may increase the chance that older adults later move into residential care (a care home). Admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home is a service where doctors, nurses and other health professionals deliver the same active treatment that would normally be given in a hospital, but they do it in the patient’s own home for a limited period. The goal is to treat conditions that would otherwise need a hospital bed – such as flare‑ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recovery after a stroke, or other acute medical problems – while keeping patients in a familiar environment.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe set out to determine whether admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home works as well as, or better than, traditional inpatient hospital care. Specifically, we compared the two approaches for survival, the need for later hospital readmission, patient‑reported wellbeing and satisfaction, the likelihood of ending up in residential care, length of stay, and overall cost to the health service and society.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home with usual inpatient care in adults. We combined the results in meta‑analyses and used the GRADE system to rate our confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 20 trials with a total of 3,100 participants aged 18 years and older.\n- Mortality within six months was almost the same in both groups (risk ratio 0.88 – a small difference that could be due to chance).\n- Readmission to hospital within three to twelve months was similar (risk ratio 1.14 – a slight increase that was not statistically important).\n- The chance of living in residential care at six months was probably reduced by about half (risk ratio 0.53).\n- Patients’ self‑reported health status showed little or no difference.\n- Satisfaction with care may be higher with hospital‑at‑home.\n- Initial hospital length of stay was probably shorter for the home group.\n- Health‑service costs were probably lower for hospital‑at‑home.\nFor all these outcomes the evidence was of moderate certainty, meaning we are fairly confident in the results but recognise some limitations.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Some uncertainty remains because participants often knew which treatment they received, not all studies provided all needed data, the studies involved different types of people and varied ways of delivering the intervention, and many trials were small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work. The evidence is current to February 2022.",

Patients may not know what these mean. *Rewrite examples*: \"COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung condition that makes breathing difficult)\"; \"risk ratio (RR) tells us how likely an outcome is in the hospital‑at‑home group compared with the usual hospital group\"; \"We used the GRADE system, which rates how confident we are in the evidence, from low to high.\"\n3. **Statistical language without context** – the sentence \"mortality within six months was almost the same in both groups (risk ratio 0.88 – a small difference that could be due to chance)\" uses the numeric RR without explaining its implication. *Rewrite*: \"The chance of dying within six months was almost the same in both groups; the risk ratio of 0.88 means there was a 12% lower risk with hospital‑at‑home, but this difference could be due to chance.\"\n4. **Confidence statement needs plain language** – \"We are moderately confident in the evidence\" does not explain why. *Rewrite*: \"We are fairly sure about these results, but some uncertainty remains because the studies were small and participants knew which treatment they received.\"\n5. **Nominalisation and noun‑heavy phrasing** – the draft uses many noun forms (e.g., \"the likelihood of ending up in residential care\") which makes sentences dense. Re‑phrase to active verbs where possible, e.g., \"hospital‑at‑home probably cuts the chance of moving into a care home by about half.\"\nThese changes will lower the high nominalisation (21) and noun (165) counts noted in the PLS evaluation, improve readability, and ensure the summary is truly understandable for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on most readability metrics (e.g., FKGL 9.15, Flesch Reading Ease 61.5) and is within the word limit. However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns in four areas: nominalisation (21, above the median of 13), noun count (165, above median 116), complex Dale‑Chall words (236, above median 160) and complex words (129, above median 84). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many technical terms, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
