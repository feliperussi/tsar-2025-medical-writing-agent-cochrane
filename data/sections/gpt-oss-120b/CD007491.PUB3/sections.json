  "plain_title": "Is receiving hospital-level care at home (hospital at home that avoids admission) as safe and less costly as staying in the hospital for older adults?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Hospital‑at‑home care for older adults appears to be about as safe as staying in the hospital, showing similar mortality (death rate) and similar readmission (being admitted again) rates, and it probably reduces the chance of moving into residential care (a care home); no harmful effects were reported, and the evidence is of moderate quality (studies that are reasonably reliable).",
    "People receiving care at home may feel more satisfied (more happy with their care), have similar overall health status, experience shorter initial hospital stays (fewer days in the hospital), and the approach probably lowers health‑service costs (money spent on care); the evidence for these outcomes is also of moderate quality.",
    "Future research should include longer‑term studies, more data on caregiver impacts, and high‑quality cost analyses to confirm these findings and address remaining uncertainties."

      "subheading": "What is admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home and why is it needed?",
      "content": "When a person becomes seriously ill, the usual response is to admit them to a hospital for acute (short‑term) care. Hospital stays can be expensive, stressful, and may increase the chance that older adults later move into residential care. \"Admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home\" is a service where doctors, nurses and other health professionals provide the same active treatment that would normally be given in a hospital, but they do it in the patient’s own home for a limited period. The goal is to treat conditions that would otherwise require a hospital bed—such as flare‑ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recovery after a stroke, or other acute medical problems—while keeping patients in a familiar environment."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors set out to determine whether admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home works as well as, or better than, traditional inpatient hospital care. Specifically, they wanted to compare the two approaches in terms of health outcomes (like survival and the need for later hospital readmission), patient‑reported wellbeing and satisfaction, the likelihood of ending up in residential care, length of stay, and the overall cost to the health service and society."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched databases for studies that compared admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home with usual inpatient care in adults, combined their results in meta‑analyses, and rated our confidence in the evidence (using the GRADE approach) based on study quality and size."
    }
  ],
  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review incorporated 20 randomised controlled trials enrolling a total of 3,100 participants aged 18 years and older. The trials compared admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home programmes, in which active treatment is delivered at the patient’s home for a limited period, with standard acute hospital inpatient care. Participants included older adults with a range of conditions: four trials focused on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, two on post‑stroke recovery, seven on acute medical illnesses primarily affecting older people, and the remaining trials involved mixed clinical populations. The abstract does not provide details on the duration of the individual studies, the countries or settings in which they were conducted, or the sources of funding for the trials."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Admission avoidance hospital at home",
      "content": "Admission avoidance hospital at home probably makes little to no difference to the chance of dying within six months or being readmitted to hospital within three to twelve months. It probably reduces the chance of ending up in residential care within six months (about half as many people as with usual hospital care). It probably makes little to no difference to how patients rate their own health, may increase patients' satisfaction with care, may reduce the initial length of hospital stay, and probably reduces the cost to the health service."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because of concerns about it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies provided all needed data, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search."
