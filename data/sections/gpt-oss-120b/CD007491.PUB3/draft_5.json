  "draft": "Is receiving hospital‑level care at home (hospital‑at‑home that avoids admission) as safe and less costly as staying in the hospital for older adults?\n\nKey messages\n- Hospital‑at‑home for older adults is about as safe as a regular hospital stay: death rates and readmission rates are similar, and it probably cuts the chance of moving into a care home by about half. We are fairly sure about these results, but some uncertainty remains because the studies were small and participants knew which treatment they received.\n- People cared for at home tend to be more satisfied, report similar overall health, have shorter initial hospital stays, and the approach probably reduces health‑service costs. The evidence for these outcomes is also of moderate confidence.\n- Future research should look at longer‑term effects, the impact on caregivers, and high‑quality cost analyses.\n\nWhat is admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home and why is it needed?\nWhen a person becomes seriously ill, the usual response is to admit them to a hospital for short‑term (acute) care. Hospital stays can be expensive, stressful, and may increase the chance that older adults later move into a residential care home. In admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home, doctors, nurses and other health professionals provide the same treatment they would give in a hospital, but they do it in the patient’s own home for a short time. The service aims to treat conditions that would otherwise need a hospital bed – such as flare‑ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, a lung condition that makes breathing difficult), recovery after a stroke, or other acute medical problems – while keeping patients in a familiar environment.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe set out to see whether admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home works as well as, or better than, traditional inpatient hospital care. Specifically, we compared the two approaches for survival, the need for later hospital readmission, patient‑reported wellbeing and satisfaction, the likelihood of ending up in residential care, length of stay, and overall cost to the health service and society.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home with usual inpatient care in adults. We combined the results in meta‑analyses and used the GRADE system (which rates how confident we are in the evidence, from low to high) to assess our confidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 20 trials with a total of 3,100 participants aged 18 years and older.\n- The chance of dying within six months was almost the same in both groups; the risk ratio (RR) of 0.88 means a 12 % lower risk with hospital‑at‑home, but this difference could be due to chance.\n- Readmission to hospital within three to twelve months was similar; the RR of 1.14 indicates a slight increase that was not statistically important.\n- The chance of living in residential care at six months was probably reduced by about half (RR 0.53).\n- Patients’ self‑reported health status showed little or no difference.\n- Satisfaction with care may be higher with hospital‑at‑home.\n- Initial hospital length of stay was probably shorter for the home group.\n- Health‑service costs were probably lower for hospital‑at‑home.\nFor all these outcomes the evidence was of moderate certainty, meaning we are fairly confident in the results but recognise some limitations.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe are fairly sure about these findings, but some uncertainty remains because participants often knew which treatment they received, not all studies provided all needed data, the studies involved different types of people and varied ways of delivering the intervention, and many trials were small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work. The evidence is current to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failed: the draft incorrectly states that *all* outcomes have moderate‑certainty evidence. The source says satisfaction with care and the reduction in length of stay are supported by low‑certainty evidence, not moderate. This factual inaccuracy must be corrected. Additionally, the draft could be improved in the following ways:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – \"risk ratio (RR)\" is used without definition. Rewrite: \"We measured the difference using a risk ratio (RR), which compares the chance of an event in the hospital‑at‑home group with the chance in the hospital group. An RR of 1 means the same risk; an RR below 1 means lower risk.\"\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"The chance of dying within six months was almost the same in both groups; the risk ratio (RR) of 0.88 means a 12 % lower risk with hospital‑at‑home, but this difference could be due to chance.\" Rewrite as two sentences: \"The chance of dying within six months was almost the same in both groups. The risk ratio (RR) was 0.88, suggesting a 12 % lower risk with hospital‑at‑home, but this difference could be due to chance.\"\n3. **Nominalisation / noun‑heavy phrasing** – \"The evidence is current to February 2022.\" Rewrite in active voice: \"We searched the literature up to February 2022.\"\n4. **Over‑nouned sentence** – \"Hospital‑at‑home probably reduces costs to the health service compared with hospital admission.\" Rewrite with a verb: \"Hospital‑at‑home probably lowers health‑service costs compared with staying in the hospital.\"\n5. **Incorrect certainty statements** – In the Results section the sentence \"For all these outcomes the evidence was of moderate certainty\" is wrong. Correct to: \"For most outcomes the evidence was of moderate certainty, but the evidence for satisfaction with care and for the reduction in length of stay was of low certainty.\"\nThese changes address the most important clarity and factual issues. Metrics support the need for these edits: the draft shows high nominalisation (22, beyond typical P90), a high noun count (171, beyond typical P90) and many complex words (126 complex words, 247 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words), which contribute to the dense, hard‑to‑read style. Overall, while the draft meets structural requirements and word‑count limits, the factual inaccuracy and the identified clarity/style problems prevent approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall (high conformity score) but deviates on four metrics: nominalisation (22, P90), nouns (171, P90), complex_words_dc (247, P90) and complex_words (126, P90). These indicate the text’s noun‑heavy and complex wording exceeds typical PLS patterns and should be reduced for better readability."
