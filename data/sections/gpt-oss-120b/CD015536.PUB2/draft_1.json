  "draft": "Is the antiviral drug entecavir (a medicine that blocks hepatitis B virus) better than no treatment or a dummy pill (placebo) for children and adults with chronic hepatitis B?\n\nKey messages\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, we cannot say whether entecavir (an antiviral medicine that blocks hepatitis B virus) is better than no treatment or a dummy pill (placebo) for people with chronic hepatitis B (long‑term liver infection caused by hepatitis B virus); the studies did not show clear benefits for survival and did not provide reliable information on serious side effects (serious unwanted effects).\n- The trials also did not provide any data on health‑related quality of life (how treatment affects daily wellbeing), and no deaths were reported, leaving uncertainty about the true impact of the drug.\n- More well‑...‑designed, larger studies that follow participants for longer periods and record survival, quality of life, and serious side effects are needed to answer these questions.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhat is chronic hepatitis B and why is it a public health problem?\nChronic hepatitis B is a long‑lasting infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus. It can lead to serious liver damage, liver cancer, and early death. Around 300 million people worldwide live with this infection, making it a major global health concern. The disease can be present for many years without obvious symptoms, but it still harms the liver and can be passed to others, especially through blood or from mother to child at birth.\n\nWhat treatments are available for chronic hepatitis B and what is entecavir?\nDoctors use medicines that stop the virus from multiplying to control chronic hepatitis B. One common type of medicine is called a nucleos(t)ide analogue – a drug that looks like a building block of the virus’s genetic material and blocks its replication. Entecavir is one such nucleos(t)ide analogue and is recommended in many clinical guidelines as a first‑line (initial) treatment for both children and adults with chronic hepatitis B. It is taken as a pill and aims to keep the virus at low levels, reducing liver damage.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to determine whether entecavir is truly beneficial and safe compared with no treatment or a placebo (a dummy pill). Specifically, they looked at people of any age – children and adults – who have chronic hepatitis B, whether they are positive or negative for a marker called hepatitis B e‑antigen (HBeAg, a protein that indicates active virus replication). The review set out to assess the drug’s impact on important outcomes such as overall death rates, serious side‑effects, and health‑related quality of life.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared entecavir with no treatment or placebo in children and adults with chronic hepatitis B, combined their results using meta‑analysis or narrative synthesis, and rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 22 randomised clinical trials published between 2005 and 2022 that together enrolled 2,940 people with chronic hepatitis B. All trials used a parallel‑group design and tested oral entecavir against either no treatment (12 trials) or placebo (10 trials); in 14 trials both groups also received the same additional co‑interventions. Study lengths varied from 5 weeks to 228 weeks, with an average follow‑up of about 58 weeks for those providing quantitative data. Most participants were adults; one trial included only children, one covered ages 14–55, and one did not report age. The review did not give details about the countries, settings, or funding sources of the individual studies. No trial reported health‑related quality‑of‑life outcomes, and none recorded deaths.\n\nWe do not know whether entecavir changes the risk of death, serious adverse events, or health‑related quality of life for people with chronic hepatitis B.\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and because the evidence is based on few cases of condition/type of event.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search.",

In addition, several clarity and style issues reduce readability:\n1. Long, dense sentence – \"We examined 22 randomised clinical trials published between 2005 and 2022 that together enrolled 2,940 people with chronic hepatitis B...\" – exceeds 30 words and packs multiple ideas. Rewrite as two shorter sentences.\n2. Passive constructions – e.g., \"The review did not give details about the countries, settings, or funding sources of the individual studies.\" – obscure who is responsible. Change to active voice.\n3. Noun‑heavy phrasing – e.g., \"More well‑...‑designed, larger studies that follow participants for longer periods and record survival, quality of life, and serious side effects are needed to answer these questions.\" – can be simplified and made more verb‑focused.\n4. Bullet points use hyphens but the introductory line \"Key messages\" could be clearer with a colon and a blank line before the list.\n5. Paragraph breaks are missing after some subheadings, creating walls of text.\nSuggested concrete rewrites:\n- Change subheading \"Methods\" to \"How did we find and evaluate the evidence?\" and rewrite the paragraph in active voice.\n- Change subheading \"Limitations\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and replace passive sentences with active ones.\n- Change subheading \"Currency\" to \"How up to date is this review?\".\n- Split the long sentence: \"We examined 22 randomised clinical trials published between 2005 and 2022 that together enrolled 2,940 people with chronic hepatitis B. All trials used a parallel‑group design and tested oral entecavir against either no treatment (12 trials) or placebo (10 trials).\"\n- Rewrite passive sentence: \"We did not collect details about the countries, settings, or funding sources of the individual studies.\"\n- Simplify the final bullet: \"We need larger, well‑designed studies that follow participants longer and record survival, quality of life, and serious side effects.\"\nMetrics support these suggestions: the draft has a high average sentence length (25.68 words, P90), many passive constructions (20, P90), excessive nominalizations (22, P90), and an unusually high noun count (209, BEYOND_P90) and complex‑word counts (complex_words 133, long_words 197, complex_words_dc 289), all of which contribute to reduced readability. Addressing the subheading format and the above clarity/style issues will bring the PLS into compliance with the style guide and improve patient‑friendly readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is within the 850‑word limit (719 words) but shows moderate conformity overall. Several metrics deviate markedly from typical PLS patterns: words per sentence (25.68, P90), passive voice (20, P90), nominalizations (22, P90), noun count (209, BEYOND_P90), complex words (133, P90), long words (197, P90), and Dale‑Chall complex words (289, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is longer, more noun‑heavy, and uses more complex vocabulary than usual, supporting the need for shorter sentences, more active voice, and simpler wording."
