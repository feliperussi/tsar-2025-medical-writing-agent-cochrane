  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, we cannot say whether entecavir (an antiviral medicine that blocks hepatitis B virus) is better than no treatment or a dummy pill (placebo) for people with chronic hepatitis B (long‑term liver infection caused by hepatitis B virus); the studies did not show clear benefits for survival and did not provide reliable information on serious side effects (serious unwanted effects).",
    "The trials also did not provide any data on health‑related quality of life (how treatment affects daily wellbeing), and no deaths were reported, leaving uncertainty about the true impact of the drug.",
    "More well‑designed, larger studies that follow participants for longer periods and record survival, quality of life, and serious side effects are needed to answer these questions."

      "subheading": "What is chronic hepatitis B and why is it a public health problem?",
      "content": "Chronic hepatitis B is a long‑lasting infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus. It can lead to serious liver damage, liver cancer, and early death. Around 300 million people worldwide live with this infection, making it a major global health concern. The disease can be present for many years without obvious symptoms, but it still harms the liver and can be passed to others, especially through blood or from mother to child at birth."

      "subheading": "What treatments are available for chronic hepatitis B and what is entecavir?",
      "content": "Doctors use medicines that stop the virus from multiplying to control chronic hepatitis B. One common type of medicine is called a nucleos(t)ide analogue – a drug that looks like a building block of the virus’s genetic material and blocks its replication. Entecavir is one such nucleos(t)ide analogue and is recommended in many clinical guidelines as a first‑line (initial) treatment for both children and adults with chronic hepatitis B. It is taken as a pill and aims to keep the virus at low levels, reducing liver damage."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to determine whether entecavir is truly beneficial and safe compared with no treatment or a placebo (a dummy pill). Specifically, they looked at people of any age – children and adults – who have chronic hepatitis B, whether they are positive or negative for a marker called hepatitis B e‑antigen (HBeAg, a protein that indicates active virus replication). The review set out to assess the drug’s impact on important outcomes such as overall death rates, serious side‑effects, and health‑related quality of life."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We examined 22 randomised clinical trials published between 2005 and 2022 that together enrolled 2,940 people with chronic hepatitis B. All trials used a parallel‑group design and tested oral entecavir against either no treatment (12 trials) or placebo (10 trials); in 14 trials both groups also received the same additional co‑interventions. Study lengths varied from 5 weeks to 228 weeks, with an average follow‑up of about 58 weeks for those providing quantitative data. Most participants were adults; one trial included only children, one covered ages 14–55, and one did not report age. The review did not give details about the countries, settings, or funding sources of the individual studies. No trial reported health‑related quality‑of‑life outcomes, and none recorded deaths.\n\nWe do not know whether entecavir changes the risk of death, serious adverse events, or health‑related quality of life for people with chronic hepatitis B."

  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and because the evidence is based on few cases of condition/type of event.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search."
