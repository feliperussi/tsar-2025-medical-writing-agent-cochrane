  "plain_title": "Does applying silver diamine fluoride (a liquid that can stop cavities) prevent or treat tooth decay in children and adults?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Applying silver diamine fluoride (SDF) (a liquid that can stop cavities) may reduce new decay on the roots of teeth (root caries) and may help stop (arrest) existing cavities in primary teeth (baby teeth), but the overall evidence is uncertain and we do not have clear information about adverse effects such as tooth staining.",
    "When compared with fluoride varnish (a coating applied to teeth to prevent decay), SDF appears to provide little or no extra benefit for preventing new cavities in primary teeth, and the evidence for other outcomes, including permanent teeth (adult teeth), remains very uncertain.",
    "Because most of the available studies have methodological problems (issues with how the studies were done), further well‑designed research (studies that are carefully planned and carried out) is needed to determine how effective SDF is for different types of teeth, to assess any unwanted effects such as staining, and to compare it directly with other common treatments."

      "subheading": "Why is dental caries a major health problem?",
      "content": "Tooth decay, also called dental caries, is the most common disease worldwide. When decay is not treated it can cause pain, make it hard to eat, and affect a person’s confidence and social life. The damage can happen to baby (primary) teeth, adult (permanent) teeth, and even the roots of teeth. Because it is so common, finding simple and affordable ways to stop new decay or to stop existing decay from getting worse is a big public‑health priority."

      "subheading": "What is silver diamine fluoride and how is it used?",
      "content": "Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a liquid that can be painted on a tooth. It contains a small amount of silver, which kills bacteria, and fluoride, which helps the tooth surface become stronger. The treatment is quick, does not need drilling, and can be applied by a dentist or trained health worker. A known side‑effect is that the treated part of the tooth can turn a dark colour, which may be a concern for appearance."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether applying SDF helps prevent new cavities or stops existing cavities from getting worse in both baby and adult teeth. They compared SDF with doing nothing, with a placebo, and with other common treatments such as fluoride varnish, sealants, or restorative procedures. The review also looked at any side‑effects, pain, or changes in how the teeth look after treatment."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with placebo, no treatment, or other caries interventions; we combined and summarized their findings; and we assessed our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review identified 29 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 13,036 participants (12,020 children and 1,016 older adults). The trials used parallel‑group or split‑mouth designs and tested topical silver diamine fluoride (SDF) applied at different concentrations, frequencies and durations. Comparators were placebo or no treatment, fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, or atraumatic restorative treatment with glass‑ionomer cement. Participants ranged from children to older adults and could have had existing carious lesions or been lesion‑free. The abstract does not give details on participants’ gender, exact ages, length of follow‑up, countries where the studies were conducted, or funding sources."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Effect of silver diamine fluoride on new root caries",
      "content": "Silver diamine fluoride probably reduces the development of new root caries compared with doing nothing. Evidence for other outcomes, such as caries arrest in primary teeth, side‑effects, or comparisons with fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration or atraumatic restorative treatment, is very uncertain."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search."
