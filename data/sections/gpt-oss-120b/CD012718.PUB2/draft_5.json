  "draft": "Does applying silver diamine fluoride (a liquid that can stop cavities) prevent or treat tooth decay in children and adults?\n\nKey messages\n– Applying silver diamine fluoride (SDF) (a liquid that can stop cavities) may reduce new decay on the roots of teeth (root caries) and may help stop (arrest) existing cavities in baby teeth, but the overall evidence is uncertain and we do not have clear information about side effects such as tooth staining.\n– When compared with fluoride varnish (a coating applied to teeth to prevent decay), SDF appears to give little or no extra benefit for preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and the evidence for other outcomes, including adult teeth, remains very uncertain.\n– Because most studies had methodological problems (issues with how the studies were done), we need better‑designed research to confirm how well SDF works, to assess staining, and to compare it directly with other common treatments.\n\nWhy is dental caries a major health problem?\nTooth decay, also called dental caries, is the most common disease worldwide. When decay is not treated it can cause pain, make eating difficult, and affect confidence and social life. Decay can affect baby (primary) teeth, adult (permanent) teeth, and the roots of teeth. Because it is so common, finding simple and affordable ways to stop new decay or to halt existing decay is a public‑health priority.\n\nWhat is silver diamine fluoride and how is it used?\nSilver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a liquid that we can paint on a tooth. It contains a small amount of silver, which kills bacteria, and fluoride, which strengthens the tooth surface. The treatment is quick, does not need drilling, and can be applied by a dentist or a trained health worker. A known side effect is that the treated part of the tooth can turn a dark colour, which may be a concern for appearance.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether applying SDF helps prevent new cavities or stops existing cavities from getting worse in both baby and adult teeth. We compared SDF with doing nothing, with a placebo, and with other common treatments such as fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, or atraumatic restorative treatment (a minimally invasive filling technique). We also looked at side effects, pain, and changes in how the teeth look after treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies published up to June 2023 that compared SDF with placebo, no treatment, or other caries interventions. We combined the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings, following Cochrane guidelines.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 29 studies that randomly gave participants one of two treatments (randomised controlled trials, or RCTs). In some studies each person received only one treatment (parallel‑group). In other studies each person received two different treatments, one on each side of the mouth (split‑mouth). The trials involved a total of 13,036 people – 12,020 children and 1,016 older adults.\n\nSDF probably reduces new decay that forms on the roots of teeth compared with no treatment. Evidence for other outcomes – such as stopping cavities in baby teeth, side effects, or comparisons with fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, or atraumatic restorative treatment – is very uncertain.\n\nWhy is the evidence uncertain?\nBecause the colour change caused by SDF makes it easy for participants to see which treatment they received, many studies were not blinded. This awareness can influence how participants report outcomes. In addition, most studies were small, which reduces the reliability of the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe included all studies published up to June 2023, so the evidence covers everything that was available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, word‑count limit and factual accuracy, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Over‑long, parenthetical‑heavy key‑message sentence** – “Applying silver diamine fluoride (SDF) (a liquid that can stop cavities) may reduce new decay on the roots of teeth (root caries) and may help stop (arrest) existing cavities in baby teeth, but the overall evidence is uncertain and we do not have clear information about side effects such as tooth staining.” This sentence packs three ideas, uses multiple brackets and a double negative, making it hard to follow. *Rewrite:* “Applying silver diamine fluoride (SDF) may reduce new decay on tooth roots and may help stop cavities in baby teeth, but the evidence is uncertain and we do not know how often staining occurs.”\n2. **Unexplained research jargon** – terms like “parallel‑group” and “split‑mouth” appear without definition (e.g., “In some studies each person received only one treatment (parallel‑group). In other studies each person received two different treatments, one on each side of the mouth (split‑mouth).”). Readers may not understand these designs. *Rewrite:* “In some studies each participant received the same treatment on all teeth (parallel‑group). In other studies each participant received two different treatments, one on each side of the mouth (split‑mouth design).”\n3. **Noun‑heavy, nominalised phrasing** – the draft frequently uses noun clusters that reduce readability, e.g., “The trials involved a total of 13,036 people – 12,020 children and 1,016 older adults.” This contributes to the high noun (182) and nominalisation (22) counts. *Rewrite:* “We enrolled 13,036 participants – 12,020 children and 1,016 older adults.”\n4. **Excessive parentheses for definitions** – many sentences embed definitions in brackets, which interrupts flow (e.g., “Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a liquid that we can paint on a tooth.”). A smoother style uses short, separate sentences. *Rewrite:* “Silver diamine fluoride, or SDF, is a liquid that can be painted onto a tooth.”\n5. **Missing explicit statement of certainty levels** – the draft says “Evidence for other outcomes … is very uncertain” but does not convey the graded certainty (low, moderate, etc.) that the review used. Adding a brief phrase clarifies how confident we are. *Rewrite:* “Evidence for other outcomes is very uncertain (low‑certainty evidence).”\nThese three or more significant clarity issues mean the summary is not yet ready for patients.\n\n**Metrics support**: The evaluation shows high nominalisation (22, beyond typical P90), a high noun count (182, beyond typical P90), many complex Dale‑Chall words (265, beyond typical P90) and many long words (173, beyond typical P90). These numbers confirm the draft is noun‑heavy and uses overly complex vocabulary, matching the editorial concerns above.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall (high conformity) but deviates on four metrics: nominalisation (22, beyond typical P90), nouns (182, beyond typical P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (265, beyond typical P90) and long words (173, beyond typical P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses longer, less familiar words than typical Cochrane PLSs."
