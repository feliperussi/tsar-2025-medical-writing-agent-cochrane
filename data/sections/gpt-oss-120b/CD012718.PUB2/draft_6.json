  "draft": "Does applying silver diamine fluoride (a liquid that can stop cavities) prevent or treat tooth decay in children and adults?\n\nKey messages\n– Applying silver diamine fluoride (SDF) may reduce new decay on tooth roots and may help stop cavities in baby teeth, but the evidence is uncertain and we do not know how often staining occurs (low‑certainty evidence).\n– Compared with fluoride varnish, SDF shows little or no extra benefit for preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and the evidence for other outcomes, including adult teeth, is very uncertain (low‑certainty evidence).\n– Most studies had design problems, so we need better‑designed research to confirm how well SDF works, to assess staining, and to compare it directly with other common treatments.\n\nWhy is dental caries a major health problem?\nTooth decay, also called dental caries, is the most common disease worldwide. When decay is not treated it can cause pain, make eating difficult, and affect confidence and social life. Decay can affect baby (primary) teeth, adult (permanent) teeth, and the roots of teeth. Because it is so common, finding simple and affordable ways to stop new decay or to halt existing decay is a public‑health priority.\n\nWhat is silver diamine fluoride and how is it used?\nSilver diamine fluoride, or SDF, is a liquid that can be painted onto a tooth. It contains a small amount of silver, which kills bacteria, and fluoride, which strengthens the tooth surface. The treatment is quick, does not need drilling, and can be applied by a dentist or a trained health worker. A known side effect is that the treated part of the tooth can turn a dark colour, which may be a concern for appearance.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether applying SDF helps prevent new cavities or stops existing cavities from getting worse in both baby and adult teeth. We compared SDF with doing nothing, with a placebo, and with other common treatments such as fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, or atraumatic restorative treatment (a minimally invasive filling technique). We also looked at side effects, pain, and changes in how the teeth look after treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies published up to June 2023 that compared SDF with placebo, no treatment, or other caries interventions. We combined the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings, following Cochrane guidelines.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 29 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 13,036 participants – 12,020 children and 1,016 older adults. The trials used either a parallel‑group design (all teeth received the same treatment) or a split‑mouth design (different treatments on each side of the mouth). Participants ranged from children to older adults and could have had existing cavities or none.\n\nEffect on new root caries\nSDF probably reduces the development of new root caries compared with doing nothing (moderate‑certainty evidence). Evidence for other outcomes – such as stopping cavities in baby teeth, side‑effects, or comparisons with fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, or atraumatic restorative treatment – is very uncertain (low‑certainty evidence).\n\nWhy is the evidence uncertain?\nMany studies allowed participants to see which treatment they received because SDF causes a colour change, so the studies were not blinded. Small sample sizes also reduced reliability. These factors lower our confidence in the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe included all studies published up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects everything that was available at that time.\n\nWhat are the implications?\nWe cannot be sure how well SDF works for most outcomes, and we do not know how often staining happens. Better‑designed, larger studies are needed to confirm the benefits, assess side effects, and compare SDF directly with other common treatments.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical checks: (1) One subheading ('Effect on new root caries') is not phrased as a question, breaching the style rule that all subheadings must be questions. (2) The key message about root caries states the evidence is low‑certainty, but the source indicates moderate‑certainty evidence – a factual inaccuracy. (3) The text contains several noun‑heavy and nominalised sentences that make it harder for lay readers, reflected in the metric deviations (high noun count, nominalisations, complex‑word and long‑word counts). Suggested improvements: \n- Change the subheading to a question, e.g., \"Does SDF reduce new root caries?\". \n- Correct the certainty level in the key message to “moderate‑certainty evidence”. \n- Rewrite noun‑heavy sentences to use more active verbs and simpler words, e.g., replace \"The trials used either a parallel‑group design (all teeth received the same treatment) or a split‑mouth design (different treatments on each side of the mouth)\" with \"We used two designs: one where all teeth got the same treatment, and another where each side of the mouth received a different treatment.\" \nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the master style guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall (77.8% of features in best quartile), but four metrics deviate: nominalisations (24, above typical median), noun count (180, high), complex Dale‑Chall words (275, high) and long words (175, high). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex/long words, supporting the recommendation to simplify wording and reduce nominalisations."
