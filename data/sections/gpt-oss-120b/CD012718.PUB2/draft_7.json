  "draft": "Does applying silver diamine fluoride (a liquid that can stop cavities) prevent or treat tooth decay in children and adults?\n\nKey messages\n- Applying silver diamine fluoride (SDF) (a liquid that can stop cavities) probably reduces new decay on the roots of teeth (root caries) with moderate‑certainty evidence, and it may help stop (arrest) existing cavities in primary teeth (baby teeth), but the overall evidence for most outcomes is uncertain and we lack clear data on side‑effects such as tooth staining.\n- When compared with fluoride varnish (a coating applied to teeth to prevent decay), SDF shows little or no extra benefit for preventing new cavities in primary teeth, and the evidence for other outcomes, including permanent teeth (adult teeth), remains very uncertain.\n- Most studies had design problems, so we need larger, well‑designed trials to confirm how well SDF works, to measure staining, and to compare it directly with other common treatments.\n\nWhy is dental caries a major health problem?\nTooth decay, also called dental caries (tooth decay), is the most common disease worldwide. If it is not treated it can cause pain, make eating difficult, and affect confidence and social life. Decay can affect baby (primary) teeth, adult (permanent) teeth, and the roots of teeth. Because it is so common, finding simple and affordable ways to stop new decay or to halt existing decay is a public‑health priority.\n\nWhat is silver diamine fluoride and how is it used?\nSilver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a liquid that we can paint onto a tooth. It contains a small amount of silver, which kills bacteria, and fluoride, which strengthens the tooth surface. The treatment is quick, does not need drilling, and can be applied by a dentist or a trained health worker. A known side‑effect is that the treated part of the tooth can turn a dark colour, which may be a concern for appearance.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether applying SDF helps prevent new cavities or stops existing cavities from getting worse in both baby and adult teeth. We compared SDF with doing nothing, with a placebo, and with other common treatments such as fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, or atraumatic restorative treatment (a minimally invasive filling technique). We also looked at side‑effects, pain, and changes in how the teeth look after treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched databases for randomised controlled trials that compared SDF with placebo, no treatment, or other caries interventions up to June 2023. We combined the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings using Cochrane and GRADE methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 29 trials that together enrolled 13,036 participants (12,020 children and 1,016 older adults). The trials used two designs: one where all teeth received the same treatment, and another where each side of the mouth received a different treatment. Studies tested different concentrations, frequencies and durations of SDF and compared it with placebo or no treatment, fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, or atraumatic restorative treatment.\n\nDoes SDF reduce new root caries?\nYes. The evidence shows that SDF probably reduces the development of new root caries compared with doing nothing, and we have moderate‑certainty evidence for this benefit.\n\nWhy is the evidence uncertain?\nMany studies allowed participants to see which treatment they received because SDF causes a colour change, so the trials were not blinded. Small sample sizes also reduced reliability. These factors lower our confidence in most results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe included all studies published up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects everything that was available at that time.\n\nWhat are the implications?\nWe cannot be sure how well SDF works for most outcomes, and we do not know how often staining happens. Better‑designed, larger studies are needed to confirm the benefits, assess side‑effects, and compare SDF directly with other common treatments.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several patient‑facing problems: (1) frequent use of technical terms such as “caries”, “arrest”, “moderate‑certainty evidence”, and “split‑mouth design” without plain‑language definitions; (2) a very long, compound key‑message sentence that overloads the reader with multiple ideas; (3) an unclear description of the trial designs that may leave readers unsure what “parallel‑group” or “split‑mouth” means. These issues would likely confuse a lay audience and need to be rewritten. Minor style issues (high nominalisation, many long words) also support the need for simplification.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Jargon** – Quote: “caries”, “arrest”, “moderate‑certainty evidence”, “split‑mouth design”. Why problematic: readers may not know these terms. Rewrite: replace with simple explanations (e.g., “tooth decay (caries)”, “stop the decay from getting worse”, “moderate‑certainty (we have a fair amount of confidence)”, “split‑mouth design (one side of the mouth got one treatment and the other side got another)”).\n2. **Over‑long key‑message** – Quote: “Applying silver diamine fluoride (SDF) (a liquid that can stop cavities) probably reduces new decay on the roots of teeth (root caries) with moderate‑certainty evidence, and it may help stop (arrest) existing cavities in primary teeth (baby teeth), but the overall evidence for most outcomes is uncertain and we lack clear data on side‑effects such as tooth staining.” Why problematic: contains several ideas in one sentence, making it hard to follow. Rewrite into two short bullets: “Applying silver diamine fluoride (SDF) probably reduces new decay on the roots of teeth (root caries) – we have moderate‑certainty evidence for this benefit. It may also help stop existing cavities in baby teeth, but for most other outcomes the evidence is uncertain and we do not yet know how often staining occurs.”\n3. **Unclear design description** – Quote: “The trials used two designs: one where all teeth received the same treatment, and another where each side of the mouth received a different treatment.” Why problematic: does not explain what the designs are called or why they matter. Rewrite: “The studies used either a parallel‑group design (all teeth in a participant received the same treatment) or a split‑mouth design (one side of the mouth received SDF while the other side received the comparison treatment).”\n\nThese revisions address the most confusing elements and bring the summary in line with the Cochrane plain‑language style guide.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability metrics (grade ≈ 10, reading ease ≈ 59). However, it deviates on four linguistic features: nominalisation (24 vs <13 typical), total nouns (180 vs <116), long words (183 vs <122) and especially complex Dale‑Chall words (283 vs <160). These indicate a noun‑heavy, jargon‑rich style that aligns with the identified clarity issues. These issues are significant enough to warrant a NOT_APPROVED grade."
