  "draft": "Does applying silver diamine fluoride (a liquid that can stop cavities) prevent or treat tooth decay in children and adults?\n\nKey messages\n– Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) may lower the chance of new decay on tooth roots and may help stop existing cavities in baby teeth, but the overall evidence is uncertain and we lack clear data on side effects such as tooth staining.\n– Compared with fluoride varnish (a coating applied to teeth), SDF shows little or no extra benefit for preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and evidence for other outcomes, including adult teeth, is very uncertain.\n– Most studies had methodological problems, so better‑designed research is needed to confirm how well SDF works, to assess staining, and to compare it directly with other common treatments.\n\nWhy is dental caries a major health problem?\nTooth decay, also called dental caries, is the most common disease worldwide. When decay is untreated it can cause pain, make eating difficult, and affect confidence and social life. Decay can affect baby (primary) teeth, adult (permanent) teeth, and the roots of teeth. Because it is so common, finding simple and affordable ways to stop new decay or to halt existing decay is a public‑health priority.\n\nWhat is silver diamine fluoride and how is it used?\nSilver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a liquid that we can paint on a tooth. It contains a small amount of silver, which kills bacteria, and fluoride, which strengthens the tooth surface. The treatment is quick, does not require drilling, and can be applied by a dentist or a trained health worker. A known side effect is that the treated part of the tooth can turn a dark colour, which may be a concern for appearance.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether applying SDF helps prevent new cavities or stops existing cavities from getting worse in both baby and adult teeth. We compared SDF with doing nothing, with a placebo, and with other common treatments such as fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, or atraumatic restorative treatment (a minimally invasive filling technique). We also looked at side effects, pain, and changes in how the teeth look after treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies published up to June 2023 that compared SDF with a placebo, no treatment, or other ways of preventing cavities. We then combined the results and judged how confident we could be in the findings, following Cochrane guidelines.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 29 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 13 036 participants (12 020 children and 1 016 older adults). The trials used two simple designs: (1) parallel‑group, where different participants received different treatments, and (2) split‑mouth, where each participant received two different treatments on opposite sides of the mouth. Researchers tested different concentrations of SDF and different application schedules. Comparators included placebo or no treatment, fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, and atraumatic restorative treatment with glass‑ionomer cement.\nWe found that SDF probably reduces the development of new root caries compared with doing nothing. We found the evidence for other outcomes—such as stopping cavities in baby teeth, side effects, or comparisons with fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration or atraumatic restorative treatment—to be very uncertain.\n\nWhy is the evidence uncertain?\nBecause the colour change caused by SDF makes it easy for participants to see which treatment they received, many studies were not blinded. This awareness can influence how participants report outcomes. In addition, most studies were small, which reduces the reliability of the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence reflects studies published up to June 2023, so it includes all research available at that time.",
