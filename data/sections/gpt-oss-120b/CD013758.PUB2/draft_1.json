  "draft": "Is feeding healthy full‑term babies formula with higher protein (more protein per calorie) better than formula with lower protein?\n\n- Feeding healthy full‑term babies formula with higher protein does not show clear benefits over formula with lower protein for growth measures (such as weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age, and weight‑for‑height), later overweight or obesity, and it does not appear to increase common side effects (like diarrhea, vomiting, or milk allergy), but the evidence is limited and uncertain.\n- The same uncertainty applies when comparing standard‑protein formula with low‑protein formula; there is little evidence of any effect on growth or side effects.\n- Because the existing studies are few, small, and of limited quality, more well‑designed, longer‑term research is needed to determine whether protein content in infant formula influences growth, weight outcomes, or safety.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is the amount of protein in infant formula a health concern for babies?\nMany newborns who are not breast‑fed receive infant formula to support their growth. Formula can contain different amounts of protein – the building blocks of the body. Some formulas are made with a high protein level (at least 2.5 grams of protein for every 100 calories) because manufacturers think this might help babies gain weight faster. However, giving too much protein could potentially affect a child’s growth pattern, leading to problems such as being underweight (too light for age), stunted (shorter than expected for age), or wasted (thin for height). It might also influence the risk of becoming overweight or obese later in childhood. Because the balance of benefits (better growth) and harms (possible future weight issues or other side‑effects like diarrhea or milk allergy) is unclear, researchers need to understand whether higher‑protein formulas are truly better, worse, or about the same as formulas with lower protein levels (less than 1.8 g per 100 kcal for exclusive formula feeding).\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review aimed to compare the effects of feeding healthy, full‑term infants formula that contains a higher amount of protein with formula that contains a lower amount of protein. Specifically, the authors wanted to determine whether higher‑protein formula improves or harms children’s growth (weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age, weight‑for‑height), influences the chances of becoming overweight or obese, and whether it leads to more or fewer adverse events such as diarrhea, vomiting, or milk‑protein hypersensitivity.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared high‑protein with lower‑protein infant formula in healthy term babies, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 11 randomised trials that together involved 1,185 healthy, full‑term babies who were fed infant formula for at least three months from birth. The studies were done in high‑income countries. The trials compared formulas with different amounts of protein: (1) a high‑protein formula (at least 2.5 g per 100 kcal) versus a standard‑protein formula, and (2) a standard‑protein formula versus a low‑protein formula (less than 1.8 g per 100 kcal for babies fed only formula, or less than 1.7 g per 100 kcal when they also ate solid foods). Follow‑up ranged from the first year of life up to 11 years, with most growth and obesity outcomes reported at one year and at five years.\n\nThe review could not determine whether feeding babies a higher‑protein formula, compared with a standard‑protein formula, changes their growth in the first year or their chances of being overweight or obese by age five. It also could not tell whether the risk of side‑effects such as diarrhoea, vomiting or milk allergy differs between the two formulas. Likewise, it was unclear whether a standard‑protein formula, compared with a lower‑protein formula, affects growth in the first year or the likelihood of side‑effects. In all cases, the evidence was very uncertain.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the formula, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because several subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement that subheadings should be question‑style where possible. In addition, the text contains a few clarity problems that would confuse readers: a very long opening bullet sentence that packs multiple ideas together; high noun and complex‑word density making sentences feel noun‑heavy; and occasional passive constructions that obscure who is doing the action. These issues are reflected in the metric report (nouns = 196 → P90, complex_words = 135 → P90, complex_words_dc = 316 = BEYOND_P90, passive_voice = 16 → P75). The most important improvements are:\n1. Re‑write subheadings as questions (e.g., change \"Methods\" to \"How did we find the studies?\", \"Results\" to \"What did we find?\", \"Limitations\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"Currency\" to \"How up‑to‑date is the evidence?\").\n2. Shorten the opening bullet point: \"Feeding healthy full‑term babies formula with higher protein does not show clear benefits over formula with lower protein for growth measures (such as weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age, and weight‑for‑height), later overweight or obesity, and it does not appear to increase common side‑effects (like diarrhea, vomiting, or milk allergy), but the evidence is limited and uncertain.\" → \"Feeding healthy full‑term babies a higher‑protein formula does not clearly improve growth (weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age, weight‑for‑height), prevent overweight or obesity, or increase side‑effects such as diarrhea, vomiting, or milk allergy. The evidence is limited and uncertain.\"\n3. Reduce noun‑heavy phrasing in the results paragraph: replace \"The review could not determine whether feeding babies a higher‑protein formula, compared with a standard‑protein formula, changes their growth in the first year or their chances of being overweight or obese by age five\" with \"We could not tell if a higher‑protein formula changes growth in the first year or the risk of overweight or obesity by age five.\"\n4. Convert passive statements to active voice, e.g., \"The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search\" → \"We searched up to October 2022, so the evidence is current.\"\n5. Where possible, replace long or complex words with simpler alternatives (e.g., \"uncertain\" → \"not clear\", \"standard‑protein\" → \"regular‑protein\"). These changes will lower the noun and complex‑word counts, improve readability, and bring the draft into compliance with the style guide. Overall, the draft meets factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but the subheading format and several clarity issues prevent approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights deviations in noun count (196 → P90), Dale‑Chall‑chall readability (8.39 → P90), complex words (135 → P90) and especially complex words (DC) (316 → BEYOND_P90). Words per sentence (23.86) and passive voice (16) are in the higher‑range (P75).
