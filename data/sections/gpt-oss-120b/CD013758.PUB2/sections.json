  "key_messages": [
    "Feeding healthy full‑term babies formula with higher protein does not show clear benefits over formula with lower protein for growth measures (such as weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age, and weight‑for‑height), later overweight or obesity, and it does not appear to increase common side effects (like diarrhea, vomiting, or milk allergy), but the evidence is limited and uncertain.",
    "The same uncertainty applies when comparing standard‑protein formula with low‑protein formula; there is little evidence of any effect on growth or side effects.",
    "Because the existing studies are few, small, and of limited quality, more well‑designed, longer‑term research is needed to determine whether protein content in infant formula influences growth, weight outcomes, or safety."

      "subheading": "Why is the amount of protein in infant formula a health concern for babies?",
      "content": "Many newborns who are not breast‑fed receive infant formula to support their growth. Formula can contain different amounts of protein – the building blocks of the body. Some formulas are made with a high protein level (at least 2.5 grams of protein for every 100 calories) because manufacturers think this might help babies gain weight faster. However, giving too much protein could potentially affect a child’s growth pattern, leading to problems such as being underweight (too light for age), stunted (shorter than expected for age), or wasted (thin for height). It might also influence the risk of becoming overweight or obese later in childhood. Because the balance of benefits (better growth) and harms (possible future weight issues or other side‑effects like diarrhea or milk allergy) is unclear, researchers need to understand whether higher‑protein formulas are truly better, worse, or about the same as formulas with lower protein levels (less than 1.8 g per 100 kcal for exclusive formula feeding)."

      "content": "The review aimed to compare the effects of feeding healthy, full‑term infants formula that contains a higher amount of protein with formula that contains a lower amount of protein. Specifically, the authors wanted to determine whether higher‑protein formula improves or harms children’s growth (weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age, weight‑for‑height), influences the chances of becoming overweight or obese, and whether it leads to more or fewer adverse events such as diarrhea, vomiting, or milk‑protein hypersensitivity."

      "content": "We looked at 11 randomised trials that together involved 1,185 healthy, full‑term babies who were fed infant formula for at least three months from birth. The studies were done in high‑income countries. The trials compared formulas with different amounts of protein: (1) a high‑protein formula (at least 2.5 g per 100 kcal) versus a standard‑protein formula, and (2) a standard‑protein formula versus a low‑protein formula (less than 1.8 g per 100 kcal for babies fed only formula, or less than 1.7 g per 100 kcal when they also ate solid foods). Follow‑up ranged from the first year of life up to 11 years, with most growth and obesity outcomes reported at one year and at five years. \n\nThe review could not determine whether feeding babies a higher‑protein formula, compared with a standard‑protein formula, changes their growth in the first year or their chances of being overweight or obese by age five. It also could not tell whether the risk of side‑effects such as diarrhoea, vomiting or milk allergy differs between the two formulas. Likewise, it was unclear whether a standard‑protein formula, compared with a lower‑protein formula, affects growth in the first year or the likelihood of side‑effects. In all cases, the evidence was very uncertain."
