  "draft": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (a non‑invasive brain stimulation) as effective and better tolerated than electroconvulsive therapy (electric shock treatment) for people with schizophrenia?\n\nKey messages\n- Based on the only available study, magnetic seizure therapy (MST) works about as well as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for overall symptoms of schizophrenia, and it may cause fewer memory problems and better overall thinking ability (cognitive function). The evidence is very uncertain because the study was small and had several methodological problems.\n- The study did not show clear differences between MST and ECT in the number of people who stopped treatment because of side‑effects or because the treatment did not help. Confidence in these findings is low.\n- More high‑quality, larger randomised trials (studies where participants are assigned by chance) are needed to confirm whether MST truly offers similar benefits and fewer cognitive side‑effects than ECT for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhy is schizophrenia a serious health problem?\nSchizophrenia is a common mental illness that can make thinking, feeling and social interaction very difficult. It often starts in early adulthood and can last a lifetime, affecting work, relationships and overall quality of life. Antipsychotic medication is the main treatment, but about one in five people do not get enough relief and need other options.\n\nWhat is magnetic seizure therapy and could it help people who do not respond to usual medicines?\nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer, non‑invasive technique that uses magnetic fields to create brief, controlled seizures in the brain. It is similar to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) but delivers the stimulus in a different way, targeting the brain more precisely. Researchers hope MST might improve symptoms of schizophrenia while causing fewer memory and thinking (cognitive) side‑effects than ECT.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether MST reduces the symptoms of schizophrenia and whether it is safe and tolerable for patients. In other words, we compared MST (alone or together with standard care – the usual medicines and support) to other treatments such as ECT to see if it works better, the same, or causes fewer unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases for studies that compared MST with other treatments for schizophrenia, combined any results we found and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found only one small randomised controlled trial (a study where participants are randomly assigned to treatment groups) that enrolled 79 adults with acute schizophrenia (a severe, recent episode of the illness). The four‑week trial compared MST plus standard care with ECT plus standard care. The report did not give details such as participants’ ages, gender, country or funding sources. Because the trial had many problems, we are very uncertain about the results. Therefore we cannot say whether MST improves overall mental state, the positive symptoms (such as hallucinations) or negative symptoms (such as reduced motivation), memory, other thinking abilities, or safety outcomes like side‑effects or early drop‑out compared with ECT.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, not all outcomes were reported, and the study was very small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the \"Key messages\" heading is not phrased as a question, which the Master Style Guide requires for all subheadings. In addition, several clarity and readability problems would likely confuse readers:\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Key messages\" should be re‑phrased as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\").\n2. **Overly long bullet sentence** – The first key‑message bullet runs over 30 words and packs several ideas together, making it hard to follow. Suggested split: \"Based on the only available study, magnetic seizure therapy (MST) works about as well as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for overall symptoms of schizophrenia. It may also cause fewer memory problems and improve overall thinking ability (cognitive function).\"\n3. **High lexical complexity** – The draft contains 118 complex (≥3‑syllable) words and 175 long (≥7‑character) words, well above the typical PLS median (≤84 and ≤122 respectively). Replace terms such as \"methodological problems\" with \"study weaknesses\" and \"non‑invasive brain stimulation\" with \"magnetic brain treatment\" where possible.\n4. **Passive voice** – Sentences like \"The evidence is very uncertain because the study was small and had several methodological problems\" use passive constructions. Rewrite actively: \"We are very uncertain about the evidence because the study was small and had several weaknesses.\"\n5. **Dense wording in methods paragraph** – \"We searched multiple databases for studies that compared MST with the other treatments for schizophrenia, combined any results we found and rated our confidence in the evidence.\" can be simplified to: \"We searched several databases for studies comparing MST with other treatments, combined the results, and judged how confident we are in the evidence.\"\nThese issues, together with the metric alerts (smog_index 13.6, complex_words 118, long_words 175), indicate the draft is harder to read than typical Cochrane PLS texts. Revising the headings, shortening sentences, reducing complex/long words, and converting passive voice to active will bring the summary within expected readability ranges and meet the style guide.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights four metrics that deviate from typical PLS patterns: smog_index (13.6, beyond the median), complex_words_dc (238), complex_words (118) and long_words (175) are all higher than the median values for Cochrane PLS. These indicate the draft is more complex than usual and support the need to simplify wording and reduce long/complex words."
