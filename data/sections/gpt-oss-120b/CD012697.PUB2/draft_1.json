  "draft": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (MST) (a brain treatment that uses magnets to trigger seizures) as effective and safe as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (a brain treatment that uses electricity to trigger seizures) for people with schizophrenia?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Current evidence from a single small trial does not show a clear difference between magnetic seizure therapy (MST) (a brain treatment that uses magnets to trigger seizures) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (a brain treatment that uses electricity to trigger seizures) in improving overall symptoms of schizophrenia, and the quality of this evidence is very low.\n- The same trial suggested that MST may lead to fewer problems with delayed memory deficit (difficulty remembering after the treatment) and may improve cognitive function (thinking abilities) compared with ECT, but these findings are also based on very limited and uncertain evidence.\n- Because the evidence is limited, of low quality, and comes from only one study, further well‑designed, larger randomised trials are needed to determine whether MST is truly as effective and safe as ECT for people with schizophrenia.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is schizophrenia and why is it a problem?\nSchizophrenia is a common mental health condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It can cause hallucinations, delusions, and difficulties with motivation and social interaction, making everyday life very challenging. About one in 100 people develop schizophrenia, and it is one of the most disabling illnesses in mental health. The main treatment is medication called antipsychotics, which helps many people, but roughly 20 % do not get enough relief from these drugs and continue to have severe symptoms. For these individuals, doctors need other treatment options.\n\nWhat is magnetic seizure therapy and how does it differ from other treatments?\nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer, non‑invasive brain‑stimulation technique. It uses brief, focused magnetic pulses to trigger a short seizure in the brain, similar to the older method called electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) which uses electrical currents. The idea behind MST is that it might produce the therapeutic benefits of ECT while causing fewer side‑effects, especially on memory and thinking. Because it does not require surgery or implants, it is considered \"non‑invasive\" – meaning it does not involve cutting into the body.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review authors set out to determine whether MST is effective and safe for people with schizophrenia. Specifically, they wanted to compare MST (used alone or together with standard care) to other treatments such as ECT, looking at how well it improves overall symptoms, positive symptoms (like hallucinations), negative symptoms (like lack of motivation), and cognitive function, as well as whether it causes fewer side‑effects or treatment drop‑outs.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies comparing magnetic seizure therapy with other treatments for schizophrenia, combined their findings, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWe identified a single randomised controlled trial that enrolled 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The four‑week study compared magnetic seizure therapy (MST) plus standard care with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care. The abstract did not give details about participants’ ages, gender balance, country or setting, and it did not disclose funding sources. The review found that MST probably makes little or no difference to the core symptoms of schizophrenia compared with ECT, but the evidence is very uncertain. For memory and overall thinking abilities, MST may reduce the number of people who develop memory problems and may improve cognitive scores, yet we are very uncertain about these possible benefits. There is also no clear evidence that MST changes the chance of stopping treatment early because of side‑effects or lack of benefit. Overall, we do not know whether MST has any real effect on symptoms, cognition or safety when compared with ECT.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.",

This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement. Additionally, the draft contains several clarity and style problems that could confuse readers: (1) overly long, compound sentences that overload the reader; (2) excessive noun‑heavy phrasing and nominalisations that make the text dense; (3) passive‑voice constructions that hide who performed actions. Suggested improvements: \n- Change “Methods” to a question such as “How did we find the evidence?” and rewrite the paragraph in active voice.\n- Change “Limitations” to “What are the limitations of the evidence?” and simplify the sentence “We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.” to a shorter active version: “We are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, some outcomes were not reported, and only one small study is available.”\n- Change “Currency” to “How up‑to‑date is this review?” and keep the statement concise.\n- Break the long sentence in the Key messages “The same trial suggested that MST may lead to fewer problems with delayed memory deficit …” into two sentences and replace nominalisations: “The trial suggests MST may cause fewer delayed‑memory problems and may improve thinking abilities, but the evidence is very limited.”\n- Reduce noun‑heavy phrasing throughout (e.g., replace “the review found that MST probably makes little or no difference to the core symptoms of schizophrenia compared with ECT” with “We found that MST probably does not change core symptoms compared with ECT”). These changes will also address metric deviations (high nominalisation, noun count, complex‑word and long‑word counts).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and has moderate conformity overall. Readability scores are near median (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 43, FKGL 12.7). However, several metrics are far beyond typical PLS ranges: nominalisations (33, beyond P90), noun count (182, beyond P90), SMOG (14.7, beyond P90), complex words (145, beyond P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (299, beyond P90) and long words (232, beyond P90). These indicate the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many complex terms, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
