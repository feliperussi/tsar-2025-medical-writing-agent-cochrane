  "draft": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (a non‑invasive brain stimulation) as effective and better tolerated than electroconvulsive therapy (electric shock treatment) for people with schizophrenia?\n\nKey messages:\n- Based on the only available study, magnetic seizure therapy (MST) – a non‑invasive brain stimulation using magnetic fields – works about as well as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) – an electric shock treatment – for overall symptoms of schizophrenia. The study suggests MST may cause fewer memory problems and may improve thinking abilities, but the evidence is very uncertain because the study was small and had several problems.\n- The study did not show clear differences between MST and ECT in the number of people who stopped treatment because of side‑effects or because it did not help. Our confidence in these findings is low.\n- More high‑quality, larger studies where participants are randomly assigned to treatment (randomised controlled trials) are needed to confirm whether MST truly offers similar benefits and fewer cognitive side‑effects than ECT.\n\nWhy is schizophrenia a serious health problem?\nSchizophrenia is a common mental illness that can make thinking, feeling and social interaction very difficult. It often starts in early adulthood and can last a lifetime, affecting work, relationships and overall quality of life. The main treatment is antipsychotic medication, but about one in five people do not get enough relief and need other options.\n\nWhat is magnetic seizure therapy and could it help people who do not respond to usual medicines?\nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer, non‑invasive technique that uses magnetic fields to create brief, controlled seizures in the brain. It is similar to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) – which uses electric shock – but the magnetic stimulus can be targeted more precisely. Researchers hope MST might improve symptoms of schizophrenia while causing fewer memory problems and fewer thinking‑ability side‑effects than ECT.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether MST reduces the symptoms of schizophrenia and whether it is safe and tolerable for patients. In other words, we compared MST – either alone or together with standard care (the usual medicines and support that people with schizophrenia receive) – to other treatments such as ECT. We wanted to see whether MST works better, works the same, or causes fewer unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for studies that compared MST with other treatments for schizophrenia. We combined the results and rated how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found only one small study where participants were randomly assigned to treatment (a randomised controlled trial). The trial enrolled 79 adults with acute schizophrenia and lasted four weeks. It compared MST plus standard care with ECT plus standard care. The report did not give details such as participants’ ages, gender, country or funding sources.\nBecause the trial had many problems and the evidence is very uncertain, we cannot tell whether MST improves overall mental state, positive symptoms (for example, hallucinations), negative symptoms (for example, reduced motivation), memory, other thinking abilities, or safety outcomes such as side‑effects or early drop‑out compared with ECT.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, not all outcomes were reported, and the study was very small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failure: The first subheading is not phrased as a question. It reads \"Why is schizophrenia a serious health problem?\" which is a statement, not a question. All subheadings must be questions according to the Master Style Guide. Additionally, several clarity and style improvements are needed:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – \"delayed memory deficit\" appears in the key messages without plain‑language explanation. Rewrite to clarify what this means for patients.\n2. **Wordy sentence** – \"The study suggests MST may cause fewer memory problems and may improve thinking abilities, but the evidence is very uncertain because the study was small and had several problems.\" This long sentence can be split and simplified.\n3. **Passive construction** – \"The report did not give details such as participants’ ages, gender, country or funding sources.\" Rephrase to active voice for clearer attribution.\n4. **Missing paragraph break** – The transition from the key messages to the first background subheading runs together without a blank line, making the text appear as a wall of text.\n5. **Bullet formatting** – The key messages use a hyphen but the list is introduced with \"Key messages:\" on the same line; placing a line break before the list improves readability.\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Replace \"delayed memory deficit\" with \"problems with remembering things later\".\n- Split the wordy sentence into: \"The study suggests MST may cause fewer memory problems. It may also improve thinking abilities. However, the evidence is very uncertain because the study was small and had several problems.\"\n- Change to active voice: \"We did not have details such as participants’ ages, gender, country or funding sources.\"\n- Insert a blank line before the subheading \"Why is schizophrenia a serious health problem?\" and after the \"Key messages:\" heading.\n- Format the key messages as a separate bulleted list on its own line.\nMetrics support these suggestions: the draft has 15 passive voice instances (higher than typical PLS range of 9‑23) and a high count of complex words (126, above the typical median of ≤84) and long words (179, above the typical median of ≤122), indicating the text could be simplified for better readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well overall (61% of features in best quartile). Word count is within limit (574 words). Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 48.4, FKGL 11.3). However, four metrics deviate: smog_index (13.7, above typical <12.1), complex_words_dc (252, above typical <160), complex_words (126, above typical <84), and long_words (179, above typical <122). These indicate higher lexical complexity than typical PLS texts, supporting the need to simplify wording and reduce long/complex words."
