  "draft": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (a magnetic brain treatment) as effective and better tolerated than electroconvulsive therapy (electric shock treatment) for people with schizophrenia?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Based on the only study, magnetic seizure therapy (MST) works about as well as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for overall symptoms of schizophrenia. It may cause fewer memory problems and improve thinking abilities (cognitive function). We are very uncertain about these results because the study was small and had several weaknesses.\n- The study did not show clear differences between MST and ECT in the number of people who stopped treatment because of side‑effects or because it did not help. Our confidence in these findings is low.\n- More high‑quality, larger randomised trials (studies where participants are assigned by chance) are needed to confirm whether MST truly offers similar benefits and fewer cognitive side‑effects than ECT.\n\nWhy is schizophrenia a serious health problem?\nSchizophrenia is a common mental illness that can make thinking, feeling and social interaction very difficult. It often starts in early adulthood and can last a lifetime, affecting work, relationships and overall quality of life. The main treatment is antipsychotic medication, but about one in five people do not get enough relief and need other options.\n\nWhat is magnetic seizure therapy and could it help people who do not respond to usual medicines?\nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer, magnetic brain treatment that uses magnetic fields to create brief, controlled seizures in the brain. It is similar to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) but delivers the stimulus in a different way, targeting the brain more precisely. Researchers hope MST might improve symptoms of schizophrenia while causing fewer memory and thinking (cognitive) side‑effects than ECT.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether MST reduces the symptoms of schizophrenia and whether it is safe and tolerable for patients. In other words, we compared MST (alone or together with standard care – the usual medicines and support) to other treatments such as ECT to see if it works better, the same, or causes fewer unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for studies comparing MST with other treatments, combined the results, and judged how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found only one small randomised controlled trial that enrolled 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The four‑week trial compared MST plus standard care with ECT plus standard care. The report did not give details such as participants’ ages, gender, country or funding sources. Because the trial had many problems and the evidence is very uncertain, we cannot say whether MST improves overall mental state, positive symptoms (such as hallucinations), negative symptoms (such as reduced motivation), memory, other thinking abilities, or safety outcomes like side‑effects or early drop‑out compared with ECT.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, not all outcomes were reported, and the study was very small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to March 2022.",

The most important issues are:\n1. **Overly long sentence in the Results section** – the sentence that lists all outcomes is 47 words long and packs many technical details, making it hard to follow.\n   - *Problematic text*: \"Because the trial had many problems and the evidence is very uncertain, we cannot say whether MST improves overall mental state, positive symptoms (such as hallucinations), negative symptoms (such as reduced motivation), memory, other thinking abilities, or safety outcomes like side‑effects or early drop‑out compared with ECT.\"\n   - *Suggested rewrite*: \"Because the trial had many problems and the evidence is very uncertain, we cannot tell whether MST improves overall mental state, positive symptoms (for example, the hallucinations), negative symptoms (for example, reduced motivation), memory, other thinking abilities, or safety outcomes such as side‑effects or early drop‑out compared with ECT.\"\n2. **Another long sentence in the Aims section** – the second sentence exceeds 30 words and mixes several ideas.\n   - *Problematic text*: \"In other words, we compared MST (alone or together with standard care – the usual medicines and support) to other treatments such as ECT to see if it works better, the same, or causes fewer unwanted effects.\"\n   - *Suggested rewrite*: \"In other words, we compared MST – either alone or together with standard care (the usual medicines and support) – to other treatments such as ECT.

Simplifying terms such as “electroconvulsive therapy”, “cognitive function”, and “delayed memory deficit” (e.g., using “memory problems”) will lower these counts and improve readability.\n\nThese issues together exceed the threshold of three significant clarity problems, so the draft cannot be approved in its current form.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most PLS patterns (72% of features in the best quartile). However, two metrics deviate: complex_words_dc (222, P90) and long_words (165, P90), indicating many unfamiliar and lengthy words. This supports the recommendation to simplify the vocabulary and shorten sentences."
