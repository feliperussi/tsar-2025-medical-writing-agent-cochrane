  "draft": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (a non‑invasive brain stimulation) as effective and better tolerated than electroconvulsive therapy (electric shock treatment) for people with schizophrenia?\n\nKey messages\n- Based on the only available study, magnetic seizure therapy (MST) (a non‑invasive brain stimulation using magnetic fields) appears to work about as well as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (electric shock treatment) for improving overall symptoms of schizophrenia, and it may cause fewer memory problems (delayed memory deficit) and better thinking abilities (cognitive function), but the evidence is very uncertain because the study was small and had methodological problems.\n- The same study did not show clear differences between MST and ECT in terms of people stopping treatment because of side effects or lack of benefit, but confidence in these findings is low.\n- More high‑quality, larger randomised trials (studies where participants are assigned by chance) are needed to determine whether MST truly offers similar benefits and fewer cognitive side effects than ECT for people with schizophrenia, including longer‑term follow‑up and careful monitoring of safety.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhy is schizophrenia a serious health problem?\nSchizophrenia is a common mental illness that can make it very hard for people to think clearly, feel emotions, and interact with others. It often starts in early adulthood and can last a lifetime, affecting work, relationships, and overall quality of life. The main treatment is medication called antipsychotics, but about one in five people with schizophrenia do not get enough relief from these drugs and need other options.\n\nWhat is magnetic seizure therapy and could it help people who do not respond to usual medicines?\nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer, non‑invasive technique that uses magnetic fields to create brief, controlled seizures in the brain, similar to the older method called electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) but with a different way of delivering the stimulus. Because it targets the brain more precisely, researchers hope MST might improve symptoms of schizophrenia while causing fewer memory and cognitive side‑effects than ECT.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors set out to determine whether MST is effective at reducing the symptoms of schizophrenia and whether it is safe and tolerable for patients. In other words, they wanted to compare MST (alone or together with standard care) to other treatments such as ECT to see if it works better, works the same, or causes fewer unwanted effects.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared magnetic seizure therapy with other treatments for schizophrenia, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWe found only one small randomised controlled trial that enrolled 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The four‑week study compared magnetic seizure therapy (MST) added to standard care with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) added to standard care. The abstract did not give details about the participants’ ages, gender, or the country where the study was done, and it did not report any funding sources. Because the trial had many problems and the evidence is very uncertain, we cannot tell whether MST makes any difference compared with ECT for overall mental state, positive or negative symptoms, memory, other cognitive abilities, or safety outcomes such as side‑effects or stopping the study early.\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which the Master Style Guide requires. In addition, the text contains a few clarity problems that would confuse patients:\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Methods\". Patients expect subheadings to be questions that guide them. *Rewrite*: \"How did we find the evidence?\".\n2. **Subheading not a question** – \"Limitations\". *Rewrite*: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\".\n3. **Subheading not a question** – \"Currency\". *Rewrite*: \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n4. **Very long sentence** – \"Because the trial had many problems and the evidence is very uncertain, we cannot tell whether MST makes any difference compared with ECT for overall mental state, positive or negative symptoms, memory, other cognitive abilities, or safety outcomes such as side‑effects or stopping the study early.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words and packs many ideas, making it hard to follow. *Rewrite*: \"The trial had many problems, so we are very uncertain about the evidence. Because of this, we cannot say whether MST changes overall mental state, positive or negative symptoms, memory, other cognitive abilities, or safety outcomes such as side‑effects or early withdrawal compared with ECT.\"\n5. **Unexplained jargon** – \"randomised controlled trial\" and \"acute schizophrenia\" appear without plain‑language definitions. *Rewrite*: \"a study where participants were randomly assigned to treatment groups (a randomised controlled trial)\" and \"people with a recent, severe episode of schizophrenia (acute schizophrenia)\".\nThese changes will also help address the metric deviations: the draft averages 28.8 words per sentence (beyond the typical 19‑28 range), uses 160 nouns (higher than the typical ≤116), and scores a Flesch‑Kincaid grade of 15.2 (above the typical ≤13). Shortening sentences, using more verbs, and reducing noun‑heavy phrasing will bring the readability indices closer to the usual PLS range.\nOverall, the draft needs to re‑phrase the non‑question subheadings, break up long sentences, and simplify technical terms before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: words per sentence (28.8, BEYOND P90), nouns (160, P90), readability grades (FKGL 15.2, ARI 16.4, GFI 19.9 – all P90), and lexical complexity (complex words, long words, etc.). These indicate the text is more complex than usual PLS, supporting the need to shorten sentences, reduce noun density, and simplify language."
