  "draft": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (a non‑invasive brain stimulation) as effective and better tolerated than electroconvulsive therapy (electric shock treatment) for people with schizophrenia?\n\nKey messages\n- Based on one small study, magnetic seizure therapy (MST) works about as well as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for overall schizophrenia symptoms, and it may cause fewer memory problems (delayed memory deficit) and better thinking abilities (cognitive function). The evidence is very uncertain because the study was small and had methodological problems.\n- The same study did not show clear differences between MST and ECT in the number of people who stopped treatment because of side‑effects or lack of benefit. Confidence in these findings is low.\n- More high‑quality, larger randomised trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to treatment groups) are needed to confirm whether MST truly offers similar benefits and fewer cognitive side‑effects than ECT for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhy is schizophrenia a serious health problem?\nSchizophrenia is a common mental illness that can make thinking, feeling, and social interaction very difficult. It often starts in early adulthood and can last a lifetime, affecting work, relationships, and overall quality of life. Antipsychotic medication is the main treatment, but about one in five people do not get enough relief and need other options.\n\nWhat is magnetic seizure therapy and could it help people who do not respond to usual medicines?\nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer, non‑invasive technique that uses magnetic fields to create brief, controlled seizures in the brain. It is similar to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) but delivers the stimulus differently, targeting the brain more precisely. Researchers hope MST might improve schizophrenia symptoms while causing fewer memory and cognitive side‑effects than ECT.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether MST reduces schizophrenia symptoms and whether it is safe and tolerable for patients. In other words, we compared MST (alone or with standard care) to other treatments such as ECT to see if it works better, the same, or causes fewer unwanted effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases for studies that compared MST with other treatments for schizophrenia. We combined any results we found and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified one four‑week randomised controlled trial (a study where participants are randomly assigned to treatment groups) that enrolled 79 adults with acute schizophrenia (people with a recent, severe episode of schizophrenia). The trial compared MST plus standard care with ECT plus standard care. The abstract did not report participants’ ages, gender, country, or funding sources. The trial had many problems, so we are very uncertain about the evidence. Because of this, we cannot say whether MST changes overall mental state, positive or negative symptoms, memory, other cognitive abilities, or safety outcomes such as side‑effects or early withdrawal compared with ECT.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, not all outcomes were reported, and the study was very small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several patient‑facing problems that could confuse readers:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as “randomised controlled trial”, “acute schizophrenia”, “standard care”, and “positive or negative symptoms” appear without simple definitions. This makes the text inaccessible to non‑experts.\n   *Rewrite example*: \"We found one four‑week randomised controlled trial (a study where participants are randomly assigned to different treatments) that included 79 adults with acute schizophrenia (a severe, recent episode of the illness). The participants received either MST plus the usual medicines (standard care) or ECT plus the usual medicines.\"\n2. **Overly long, dense sentences** – the paragraph under “What did we find?” packs many ideas into a few sentences, e.g., “The abstract did not report participants’ ages, gender, country, or funding sources. The trial had many problems, so we are very uncertain about the evidence. Because of this, we cannot say whether MST changes overall mental state, positive or negative symptoms, memory, other cognitive abilities, or safety outcomes such as side‑effects or early withdrawal compared with ECT.” This can be broken into shorter, clearer statements.\n   *Rewrite example*: \"The study report did not give details such as participants’ ages, gender, country or funding. Because the trial had many problems, we are very uncertain about the results. Therefore we cannot tell whether MST improves overall mental state, the positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia, memory, other thinking abilities, or safety outcomes like side‑effects or early drop‑out compared with ECT.\"\n3. **Ambiguous phrasing** – the phrase “better thinking abilities (cognitive function)” in the first key‑message bullet is vague and repeats the term “cognitive”. Readers may not understand what is meant.\n   *Rewrite example*: \"and it may lead to fewer memory problems and better overall thinking ability (cognitive function).\"\n4. **Repetition of the full name** – the draft repeatedly writes “magnetic seizure therapy (MST)” even after the first mention, which adds unnecessary length and reduces readability.\n   *Rewrite example*: After the first definition, use “MST” or “it” in subsequent sentences, e.g., “MST may cause fewer memory problems…\".\n5. **Generic wording** – “overall schizophrenia symptoms” is vague. Replacing it with “overall symptoms of schizophrenia” clarifies that it refers to the whole range of symptoms.\n   *Rewrite example*: \"works about as well as ECT for overall symptoms of schizophrenia.\"\nThese issues are supported by the metric analysis, which shows unusually high counts of complex words (117) and long words (168) – well above the typical PLS range – indicating the text is more difficult than necessary. Reducing jargon, shortening sentences, and using simpler vocabulary will bring the draft into line with typical PLS readability standards.\n\nTo achieve approval, the author should address the five points above, especially providing plain‑language definitions for technical terms and breaking long sentences into shorter, active‑voice statements.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and includes all required sections, but metric analysis flags high lexical complexity: complex_words_dc (234, P90), complex_words (117, P90) and long_words (168, P90) are well above typical PLS ranges. Readability indices are acceptable (Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 11.25, words per sentence 18.55), yet the elevated complex‑word counts indicate the text is harder for patients than necessary. Reducing jargon and long words will improve readability."
