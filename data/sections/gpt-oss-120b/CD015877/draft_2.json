  "draft": "Do personalized nutrition plans (precision nutrition) work better than standard diets for treating obesity in children and teenagers?\n\nKey messages\n- Current evidence does not show a clear benefit of personalized nutrition plans over usual \"one‑size‑fits‑all\" diets for reducing weight or body‑mass index (BMI, a measure of weight relative to height) in children and teenagers, and no harmful side effects were reported.\n- Only two small randomised trials were found. Together they enrolled 105 participants, but only 65 participants (35 aged 0‑9 years and 30 aged 10‑19 years) provided data on weight and BMI outcomes. Other important outcomes such as mental well‑being, quality of life, or side effects were not reported.\n- Because the evidence is limited and of low certainty, larger well‑designed trials that include diverse age groups and report both physical and mental health outcomes are needed.\n\nWhy is childhood and adolescent obesity a concern, and how is it usually treated?\nObesity in children and teenagers is becoming common worldwide. Carrying extra weight at a young age raises the risk of type‑2 diabetes, heart disease, joint pain, and mental‑health problems, and it often continues into adulthood. The usual approach is a \"one‑size‑fits‑all\" diet or lifestyle programme that gives the same food and activity advice to everyone, regardless of individual differences.\n\nWhat is precision nutrition and why might it be useful for young people with obesity?\nPrecision nutrition tailors diet advice to each person’s unique characteristics. This can include a child’s genetics, current eating habits, sleep patterns, gut bacteria (the tiny organisms living in the digestive system), socioeconomic background, mental health, and activity level. By using this detailed information – sometimes with computer algorithms or artificial‑intelligence tools – we aim to create a personalised eating plan that is more likely to work for that individual than a generic plan.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether personalised, precision‑nutrition interventions help children and adolescents (aged 0‑19 years) reduce or maintain their weight or BMI compared with standard, non‑personalised programmes or no special diet. We also looked for effects on overall well‑being, physical activity, quality of life, and any side effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases up to July 2024 for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared a precision‑nutrition approach with a standard diet in children or teenagers with overweight or obesity. We combined the results for weight and BMI and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two small randomised trials that together enrolled 105 participants. One trial in Ukraine involved younger children (0‑9 years, 35 participants) and the other in Greece involved older children and adolescents (10‑19 years, 30 participants). Both trials used a computer‑based decision‑support tool to give personalised dietary advice and compared it with a standard \"one‑size‑fits‑all\" diet. The reports gave little information about funding and did not state how long the interventions lasted. The data on weight and BMI were very uncertain: the Ukrainian trial suggested a possible reduction in BMI (mean difference −1.40 kg/m²) and weight (mean difference −2.6 kg), while the Greek trial suggested a possible increase in BMI (mean difference +3.0 kg/m²) and weight (mean difference +11.4 kg). Because the studies are tiny and have very low certainty, we cannot say whether personalised nutrition helps, harms, or makes no difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the findings because the trials were very small, participants likely knew which diet they received, and the studies did not report many outcomes we were interested in, such as mental well‑being or side effects.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence we reviewed is up to date to July 2024.",

No harmful side effects were reported.\"\n2. **Passive, jargon‑laden sentence about results** – \"The data on weight and BMI were very uncertain: the Ukrainian trial suggested a possible reduction in BMI (mean difference −1.40 kg/m²) and weight (mean difference −2.6 kg), while the Greek trial suggested a possible increase in BMI (mean difference +3.0 kg/m²) and weight (mean difference +11.4 kg).\" The passive construction (\"were very uncertain\") and the statistical term \"mean difference\" are not explained for a non‑expert audience. *Rewrite*: \"We are very uncertain about the weight and BMI results. In the Ukrainian study, children lost about 1.4 kg/m² in BMI and 2.6 kg in weight. In the Greek study, children gained about 3.0 kg/m² in BMI and 11.4 kg in weight.\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy, long sentence in the methods** – \"We searched multiple databases up to July 2024 for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared a precision‑nutrition approach with a standard diet in children or teenagers with overweight or obesity.\" This 27‑word sentence packs several technical nouns, reducing readability. *Rewrite*: \"We searched many databases up to July 2024 for randomised trials that compared a personalised nutrition plan with a standard diet in children and teenagers who were overweight or obese.\"\nThese three issues correspond to the metric alerts: the draft has a very high number of nominalisations (25 vs typical <13), many nouns (181 vs typical <116), and an excess of complex and long words (complex_words_dc 279, long_words 183). Together they push the text into the beyond‑P90 range for several readability indicators, confirming the editorial concerns. The draft should be revised to reduce noun‑heavy phrasing, replace passive constructions with active voice, and simplify statistical jargon before it can be approved.",
