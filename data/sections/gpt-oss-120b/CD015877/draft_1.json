  "draft": "Do personalized nutrition plans (precision nutrition) work better than standard diets for treating obesity in children and teenagers?\n\n**Key messages**\n- The current evidence does not show a clear advantage of personalised nutrition plans (precision nutrition – diet advice tailored to an individual’s genetics, habits, gut microbes, etc.) over usual standard diets for reducing weight or body mass index (a measure of weight relative to height) in children and teenagers, and no harmful side effects were reported.\n- Only two small studies involving a small number of participants were found, and they measured mainly weight outcomes; other important outcomes such as mental well‑being, quality of life, or any unwanted side effects were not reported.\n- Because of the limited and low‑quality evidence, larger well‑designed trials are needed that include diverse age groups, report both physical and mental health outcomes, and clearly describe how participants were randomised and followed, to determine whether precision nutrition can truly improve obesity treatment in young people.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is childhood and adolescent obesity a concern, and how is it usually treated?\nBeing overweight or obese is becoming common among children and teenagers worldwide. Carrying extra weight at a young age raises the risk of health problems such as type‑2 diabetes, heart disease, joint pain, and mental‑health issues, and it often continues into adulthood. The usual approach to help young people lose weight is a \"one‑size‑fits‑all\" diet or lifestyle programme – the same set of food advice and activity recommendations for everyone, regardless of their individual differences. While these programmes can help some, they often do not work for many because people respond differently to the same diet.\n\nWhat is precision nutrition and why might it be useful for young people with obesity?\nPrecision nutrition tries to tailor diet advice to each person’s unique characteristics. This can include a child’s genetics, current eating habits, sleep patterns, gut bacteria (the tiny organisms living in the digestive system), socioeconomic background, mental health, and how active they are. By using this detailed information – sometimes with the help of computer algorithms or artificial‑intelligence tools – the goal is to create a personalised eating plan that is more likely to work for that individual than a generic plan.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe researchers set out to examine whether these personalised, precision‑nutrition interventions actually help children and adolescents (aged 0‑19 years) reduce or maintain their body weight or body‑mass‑index (BMI) compared with standard, non‑personalised programmes or no special diet at all. They also wanted to see if such approaches affect overall well‑being, physical activity, quality of life, and any possible side effects.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies evaluating precision‑nutrition interventions for overweight or obesity in children and adolescents, combined their results on weight and BMI, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two small randomised trials that together enrolled 105 children and teenagers with overweight or obesity. One trial was done in Ukraine with younger children aged 0‑9 years (35 participants) and the other in Greece with older children and adolescents aged 10‑19 years (30 participants). Both studies compared a precision‑nutrition approach that used a computer‑based decision‑support tool to give personalised dietary advice with a standard \"one‑size‑fits‑all\" diet plan. The reports gave little information about funding (one mentioned nonprofit support, the other gave no details) and did not state how long the interventions lasted. Based on these very small studies, we are very uncertain whether personalised nutrition changes body weight or body‑mass index in children or teenagers. The available data do not allow us to say the intervention definitely helps, probably helps, may help, or makes little or no difference.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and because the studies were very small and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search.",

The Results section contains a factual inconsistency – it states the two trials enrolled 105 participants but then lists only 35 and 30 participants, omitting the remaining 40 participants and misrepresenting the data from the source. These issues would confuse readers and do not meet the required format. Additionally, the draft is heavy on nouns, nominalisations and long, complex words (e.g., 203 nouns, 25 nominalisations, SMOG 14.7, 153 complex words, 210 long words) which lowers readability. The most important improvements are: (1) rewrite non‑question subheadings as questions; (2) correct the participant numbers to reflect the source (105 total, with 35 and 30 contributing primary outcomes); (3) replace nominalised noun‑heavy phrases with active verbs; (4) simplify long, technical wording; (5) break any sentences over 30 words into shorter ones. Metrics support these edits: passive_voice = 17 (P75) and high noun/complex‑word counts indicate the draft is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical PLS texts, contributing to reduced clarity.",

These indicate excessive noun‑heavy and complex language, which aligns with the high‑noun, high‑complexity issues identified in the feedback."
