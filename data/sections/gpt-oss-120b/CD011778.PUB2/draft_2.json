  "draft": "Does adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (a light‑based antibacterial treatment) to standard deep cleaning improve gum disease and dental‑implant disease?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- Adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) – a light‑based treatment that kills bacteria – to standard deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation, SI) does not give clear or important benefits for gum disease. The evidence is very uncertain and any small improvements are unlikely to be clinically meaningful. No harmful effects were reported.\n- No studies examined aPDT for peri‑implantitis (inflammation around dental implants with bone loss). Only one very small study looked at peri‑implant mucositis (inflammation without bone loss) and it did not provide six‑month results, so we do not know the effect of aPDT on implant‑related disease.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up, especially in people with implant‑related disease, to see whether aPDT offers any real benefit and to assess any potential risks.\n\nWhy are gum disease and implant disease important?\nPeriodontitis and peri‑implant diseases are long‑lasting gum infections that cause inflammation around natural teeth or dental implants. If left untreated, the inflammation can destroy the bone and tissue that hold teeth or implants in place, leading to tooth loss or implant failure. Tiny communities of bacteria (sub‑gingival biofilm) hide deep in the pockets between the gum and the tooth or implant, making them hard to reach.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trial registers up to 14 February 2024. We looked for randomised controlled trials that compared subgingival instrumentation with adjunctive aPDT to instrumentation alone or to a placebo light treatment. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 50 trials involving 1,407 participants with periodontitis, peri‑implantitis or peri‑implant disease. All trials reported outcomes six months after treatment, measuring probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, gingival recession and adverse effects. The aPDT protocols were either a single session (39 studies) or multiple sessions (11 studies). No trial directly addressed peri‑implantitis, and the single small trial on peri‑implant mucositis did not report six‑month data.\nAdding aPDT to the usual cleaning probably makes little or no difference to pocket depth, bleeding on probing, attachment level or gum recession after six months. The evidence for these outcomes is very uncertain, so any small changes may not be real. Moderate‑certainty evidence suggests that aPDT does not increase side‑effects; most studies reported no adverse effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, which can bias results. Not all studies provided data for every outcome we wanted. The studies involved different types of people and used varied interventions. Most studies were very small, which reduces certainty.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched up to 14 February 2024, so the evidence is current to that date.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms to most PLS norms (high overall conformity, 88.9% in best quartile). However, nominalisation count (24) falls in the P90 deviation range and complex_words_dc (229) also exceeds typical levels, indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many unfamiliar words than usual. Addressing these two metrics will enhance plain‑language clarity."
