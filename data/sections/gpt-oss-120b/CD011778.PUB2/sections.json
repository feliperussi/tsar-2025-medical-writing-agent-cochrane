  "key_messages": [
    "Adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) – a light‑based treatment that kills bacteria – to standard deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation, SI) does not show clear or important benefits for gum disease; the evidence is very uncertain and any small improvements are unlikely to be clinically meaningful, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "There were no studies that examined aPDT for peri‑implantitis (inflammation around dental implants with bone loss), and only one very small study on peri‑implant mucositis (inflammation without bone loss) that did not provide six‑month results, so the effect of aPDT on implant‑related disease remains unknown.",
    "Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up, especially focusing on people with implant‑related disease, to determine whether aPDT offers any real benefit and to assess any potential risks."

      "subheading": "What are periodontitis and peri‑implant diseases, and why do they matter?",
      "content": "Periodontitis and peri‑implant diseases are long‑lasting gum infections that cause inflammation around natural teeth or dental implants. If they are not treated, the inflammation can slowly destroy the bone and tissue that hold teeth or implants in place, leading to tooth loss or implant failure. The main problem is that tiny communities of bacteria (called sub‑gingival biofilm) hide deep in the pockets between the gum and the tooth or implant, making them hard to reach.\n\nThe usual first step in treatment is a thorough cleaning of these pockets, known as scaling and root planing (or sub‑gingival instrumentation). This involves using hand‑held or powered tools to scrape away the bacterial plaque and smooth the root surfaces. Good oral hygiene, quitting smoking, and sometimes surgery are also part of standard care.\n\nA newer add‑on treatment is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). In aPDT, a special light‑sensitive liquid (a photosensitising agent) is applied to the gum pocket, and then a specific colour of light is shone on it. The light activates the liquid, producing a short burst of energy that kills the bacteria without harming the surrounding tissue."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to discover about adding aPDT to standard cleaning?",
      "content": "The review set out to find out whether using aPDT together with the usual cleaning (scaling and root planing) gives better results than cleaning alone or cleaning with a fake (placebo) light treatment. The researchers looked at several important outcomes measured six months after treatment, such as:\n- Probing pocket depth (how deep the gum pockets are after cleaning)\n- Bleeding on probing (whether the gums bleed when gently examined)\n- Clinical attachment level (how much of the tooth’s supporting structure has been restored)\n- Gingival recession (whether the gums have moved back, exposing more of the tooth)\n- Pocket closure (whether the deep pockets have disappeared)\n- Any side‑effects from the aPDT treatment.\nIn short, they wanted to know if adding this light‑based therapy helps keep gums healthier and protects teeth or implants better than the standard cleaning alone."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 50 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 1,407 participants who had clinically diagnosed periodontitis, peri‑implantitis or peri‑implant disease. All studies reported outcomes at six months after treatment, focusing on probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, gingival recession and adverse effects. The interventions evaluated were adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) given after subgingival or submucosal instrumentation, compared with instrumentation alone or with a placebo aPDT. Both single‑session protocols (used in 39 studies) and multiple‑session protocols (used in 11 studies) were examined. Study designs were mainly split‑mouth, with 18 parallel‑group trials. Funding sources, participant age, gender, disease severity and geographic locations were not described in the abstract. No trials directly addressed peri‑implantitis, and the single small trial on peri‑implant mucositis did not provide six‑month outcome data."

      "subheading": "Main results: Effect of adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy",
      "content": "Adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy to the usual cleaning of teeth and implants probably makes little or no difference to pocket depth, bleeding on probing, attachment level or gum recession after six months, and we are very uncertain whether it provides any benefit. The evidence for these outcomes is very uncertain, so any small changes may not be real. Moderate‑certainty evidence suggests that the therapy probably does not increase side‑effects, with most studies reporting no adverse effects."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. The studies were done in different types of people/used different ways of intervention. Studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search."
