  "draft": "Are combined drug, nutrition, and exercise treatments effective for managing weight loss and muscle wasting (cachexia) in people with chronic illnesses?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- The research we found does not show that combined drug, nutrition and exercise treatments clearly improve weight, muscle loss, daily activity ability, muscle strength, or overall wellbeing (quality of life) in people with cachexia. The studies also did not show a clear increase in unwanted side‑effects.\n- Comparing these combined treatments with a single treatment or with a different version of the programme did not show clear benefits. Most evidence comes from a small number of trials that mainly involved people with cancer and a few other chronic illnesses.\n- The trials were small, had design weaknesses, and followed participants for only short periods. Larger, well‑designed studies that look at longer‑term effects and include more types of chronic conditions are needed.\n\nWhat is cachexia and why does it matter?\nCachexia, also called disease‑related wasting, is a serious condition that can develop in people with long‑term illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, or chronic lung disease (COPD). It means the body loses weight and muscle even when a person eats enough. This leads to fatigue, loss of appetite, and a poorer quality of life. Because loss of muscle and strength makes everyday activities harder and can worsen the underlying illness, finding ways to treat or stop cachexia is an important health challenge.\n\nWhat treatments are currently used for cachexia?\nDoctors usually try several separate approaches: medicines that may affect metabolism, special nutrition plans to boost calories and protein, and exercise programmes to preserve muscle. Each approach can help a little, but they often do not fully stop the wasting. Researchers think that combining two or more of these strategies – called a \"combined\" treatment – might work better because the different parts could support each other.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether combined drug, nutrition and/or exercise treatments improve outcomes for people with cachexia. Specifically, we looked at whether these treatments help people walk farther or lift more weight (physical function and strength), reduce unwanted side‑effects, improve body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or relevant lab tests. We also examined whether any harms were linked to the combined approaches.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared combined treatments with usual care, a variation of the programme, or a single‑component treatment in adults with cachexia. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We then combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study methods, sample sizes and other factors.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified nine trials involving 926 adults (average age‑group about 63 years). Six trials enrolled people with cancer; the others involved COPD, chronic kidney disease, or HIV/AIDS. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 332 participants, and interventions lasted from six weeks to seven months. All trials tested combined treatments that included at least two of the following: medication, nutrition support, and exercise.\nWe found little or no benefit of these combined treatments for how well people with cachexia can move, their muscle strength, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or the chance of unwanted side‑effects. The certainty of this conclusion is very low, so we cannot be sure about the true effect.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, which can bias results. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, and the small size of the trials limits reliability. The evidence does not cover all possible people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched up to July 2024, which is the date of our most recent search.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the mandatory completeness, accuracy and length checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse readers:\n1. Inconsistent terminology – the draft alternates between “combined drug, nutrition and exercise treatments” and “multimodal programmes” without explaining they are the same. This can leave readers unsure whether the terms refer to the same intervention.\n2. Overly long result sentence – the sentence “The evidence suggests that these multimodal programmes probably make little or no difference to how well people with cachexia can move, their muscle strength, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or the chance of side‑effects.” packs many concepts into one long clause, making it hard to follow.\n3. Unexplained jargon – the term “adverse events” appears in the key messages without a plain‑language definition, which may be unfamiliar to a patient audience.\n4. Wordy phrasing – the phrase “average age‑group about 63 years” is awkward and harder to read than a simpler version.\n5. Passive voice and nominalisations – the draft contains many passive constructions (19 instances) and noun‑heavy phrases (22 nominalisations), reducing readability. Re‑writing these in active voice will improve clarity.\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Replace “combined drug, nutrition and exercise treatments” with “multimodal programmes (combined drug, nutrition and exercise)”.\n- Split the long result sentence into two: “The evidence suggests that these multimodal programmes probably make little or no difference to how well people with cachexia can move or to their muscle strength. They also appear to have little impact on body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or the chance of side‑effects.”\n- Define “adverse events” the first time it appears, e.g., “unwanted side‑effects (adverse events)”.\n- Simplify the age phrase to “average age about 63 years”.\n- Convert passive statements to active, e.g., change “The evidence suggests that these multimodal programmes probably make little or no difference…” to “We found that these multimodal programmes probably make little or no difference…”.\n\nThese changes address the most critical readability issues while preserving the factual content.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 54.9, FKGL 10.4) are within the best quartile. However, several metrics deviate markedly: passive voice (19, beyond P90), nominalisation (22, beyond P90), noun count (203, beyond P90), SMOG (14.2, beyond P90), complex words (141, beyond P90) and long words (201, beyond P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and contains many complex terms, supporting the need to reduce passive constructions, nominalisations, and simplify vocabulary."
