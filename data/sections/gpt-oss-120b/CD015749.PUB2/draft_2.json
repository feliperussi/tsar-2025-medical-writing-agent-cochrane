  "draft": "Are combined drug, nutrition, and exercise treatments effective for managing weight loss and muscle wasting (cachexia) in people with chronic illnesses?\n\nKey messages\n- The research we found does not show that combined drug, nutrition, and exercise programmes (multimodal interventions) clearly improve weight, muscle loss, ability to perform daily activities, muscle strength, or overall wellbeing (quality of life) in people with cachexia, and the studies did not show a clear increase in unwanted side‑effects.\n- Comparing multimodal programmes with a single treatment or with a different version of the programme also did not show clear benefits. Most of the evidence comes from a small number of trials that mainly involved people with cancer and a few other chronic illnesses.\n- The trials were small, had design weaknesses, and followed participants for only short periods. Larger, well‑designed studies that look at longer‑term effects and include a broader range of chronic conditions are needed.\n\nWhat is cachexia and why does it matter?\nCachexia, also called disease‑related wasting, is a serious condition that can develop in people with long‑term illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, or chronic lung disease (COPD). It means the body loses weight and muscle even when a person eats enough. This leads to fatigue, loss of appetite, and a poorer quality of life. Because loss of muscle and strength makes everyday activities harder and can worsen the underlying illness, finding ways to treat or stop cachexia is an important health challenge.\n\nWhat treatments are currently used for cachexia?\nDoctors usually try several separate approaches: medicines that may affect metabolism, special nutrition plans to boost calories and protein, and exercise programmes to preserve muscle. Each approach can help a little, but they often do not fully stop the wasting. Researchers think that combining two or more of these strategies – called a \"multimodal\" intervention – might work better because the different parts could support each other.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether multimodal programmes that mix medicines, nutrition, and/or exercise improve outcomes for people with cachexia. Specifically, we looked at physical function (how far a person can walk), strength (how much weight they can lift), side‑effects, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, and relevant lab tests. We also examined whether any harms were linked to the combined approaches.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared multimodal interventions with usual care, a variation of the programme, or a single‑component treatment in adults with cachexia. We screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We then combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study methods, sample sizes, and other factors.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified nine trials involving 926 adults (average age about 63 years). Six trials enrolled people with cancer; the others involved COPD, chronic kidney disease, or HIV/AIDS. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 332 participants, and interventions lasted from six weeks to seven months. All trials tested programmes that combined at least two of the following: medication, nutrition support, and exercise.\nThe evidence suggests that these multimodal programmes probably make little or no difference to how well people with cachexia can move, their muscle strength, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or the chance of side‑effects. However, the certainty of this conclusion is very low, so we cannot be sure about the true effect.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, which can bias results. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, and the small size of the trials limits reliability. The evidence does not cover all possible people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to July 2024, the date of our most recent search.",

In addition, several clarity and style issues reduce readability for a patient audience:\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Key messages\" should be re‑phrased as a question.\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"The evidence suggests that these multimodal programmes probably make little or no difference to how well people with a cachexia can move, their muscle strength, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or the chance of side‑effects.\" This 38‑word sentence is hard to follow.\n3. **Heavy nominalisation and noun‑heavy phrasing** – the draft contains many noun‑based constructions (e.g., \"multimodal programmes\", \"the evidence suggests\", \"the chance of side‑effects\") which increase the noun count (205, beyond typical range) and nominalisation score (25, beyond P90).\n4. **Jargon without plain‑language alternatives** – terms like \"multimodal programmes\" and \"adverse events\" appear without simpler. \n5. **Passive‑voice instance** – \"The evidence is current to July 2024, the date of our most recent search.\" can be made more active.\n\nSuggested concrete rewrites:\n- Change heading to: **\"What are the key messages?\"**\n- Split the long sentence: \"The evidence suggests that these combined treatments probably make little or no difference to how well people with cachexia can move. They also appear to have little effect on muscle strength, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or the chance of side‑effects.\"\n- Replace nominalisations: use verbs instead of nouns, e.g., \"We found little or no benefit\" instead of \"The evidence suggests\".\n- Use plain language: replace \"multimodal programmes\" with \"combined drug, nutrition and exercise treatments\"; replace \"adverse events\" with \"unwanted side‑effects\".\n- Make the currency sentence active: \"We searched up to July 2024, which is the date of our most recent search.\"\n\nMetrics support these edits: the draft shows high nominalisation (25, P90), excessive nouns (205, BEYOND_P90), and many complex words (148, BEYOND_P90). Reducing nominalisations and simplifying vocabulary will lower these scores toward typical PLS ranges and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most structural requirements, but deviates on several linguistic metrics: nominalisation (25, P90), noun count (205, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (14.6, P90), complex words (148, BEYOND_P90) and complex Dale‑Chall words (‑295, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need for the suggested simplifications and active‑voice changes."
