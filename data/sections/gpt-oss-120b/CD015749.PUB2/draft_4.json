  "draft": "Are combined drug, nutrition, and exercise treatments effective for managing weight loss and muscle wasting (cachexia) in people with chronic illnesses?\n\nKey messages –\n- We found that multimodal programmes (combined drug, nutrition and exercise) do not clearly improve weight, muscle loss, daily activity ability, muscle strength, or overall wellbeing (quality of life) in people with cachexia, and the studies did not show a clear increase in unwanted side‑effects (unwanted side‑effects (adverse events)).\n- Comparing these multimodal programmes with a single treatment or with a different version of the programme also did not show clear benefits. Most of the evidence comes from a small number of trials that mainly involved people with cancer and a few other chronic illnesses.\n- The trials were small, had design weaknesses, and followed participants only for short periods. Larger, well‑designed studies that look at longer‑term effects and include more types of chronic conditions are needed.\n\nWhat is cachexia and why does it matter? –\nCachexia, also called disease‑related wasting, is a serious condition that can develop in people with long‑term illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, or chronic lung disease (COPD). It means the body loses weight and muscle even when a person eats enough. This leads to fatigue, loss of appetite, and a poorer quality of life. Because loss of muscle and strength makes everyday activities harder and can worsen the underlying illness, finding ways to treat or stop cachexia is an important health challenge.\n\nWhat treatments are currently used for cachexia? –\nDoctors usually try several separate approaches: medicines that may affect metabolism, special nutrition plans that boost calories and protein, and exercise programmes that preserve muscle. Each approach can help a little, but they often do not fully stop the wasting. Researchers think that combining two or more of these strategies – called a multimodal programme – might work better because the different parts could support each other.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out? –\nWe wanted to know whether multimodal programmes that mix medicines, nutrition and/or exercise improve outcomes for people with cachexia. Specifically, we looked at whether these programmes help people walk farther or lift more weight (physical function and strength), reduce unwanted side‑effects, improve body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or relevant lab tests. We also examined whether any harms were linked to the combined approaches.\n\nHow did we find the evidence? –\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared multimodal programmes with usual care, a variation of the programme, or a single‑component treatment in adults with cachexia. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We then combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study methods, sample sizes and other factors.\n\nWhat did we find? –\nWe identified nine trials involving 926 adults (average age about 63 years). Six trials enrolled people with cancer; the others involved COPD, chronic kidney disease, or HIV/AIDS. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 332 participants, and interventions lasted from six weeks to seven months. All trials tested multimodal programmes that included at least two of the following: medication, nutrition support, and exercise.\nWe found that these multimodal programmes probably make little or no difference to how well people with cachexia can move or to their muscle strength. They also appear to have little impact on body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or the chance of unwanted side‑effects. The certainty of this conclusion is very low, so we cannot be sure about the true effect.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? –\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, which can bias results. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, and the small size of the trials limits reliability. The evidence does not cover all possible people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review? –\nWe searched up to July 2024, and that is the date of our most recent search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the \"Key messages –\" heading is not phrased as a question, which the Master Style Guide requires for all subheadings. In addition, several clarity problems would confuse readers:\n1. Redundant and overly long bullet: \"We found that multimodal programmes (combined drug, nutrition and exercise) do not clearly improve weight, muscle loss, daily activity ability, muscle strength, or overall wellbeing (quality of life) in people with cachexia, and the studies did not show a clear increase in unwanted side‑effects (unwanted side‑effects (adverse events)).\" – This sentence is wordy, repeats \"unwanted side‑effects\", and packs many ideas together.\n   *Rewrite*: \"We found that combined drug, nutrition, and exercise programmes did not clearly improve weight, muscle loss, daily activities, strength, or overall wellbeing, and they did not increase side‑effects (adverse events).\"\n2. Unexplained jargon: Terms such as \"multimodal programmes\", \"adverse events\", and \"certainty of evidence\" appear without plain‑language definitions, leaving patients unsure of their meaning.\n   *Rewrite*: Introduce a brief definition, e.g., \"multimodal programmes – treatments that combine medicines, special nutrition, and exercise\"; \"adverse events – unwanted side‑effects\"; \"certainty of evidence – how confident we are that the results are true.\"\n3. Long, dense result sentence: \"We found that these multimodal programmes probably make little or no difference to how well people with cachexia can move, their muscle strength, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or the chance of side‑effects.\" – This runs on and may overwhelm readers.\n   *Rewrite*: Break into two sentences: \"We found that these programmes probably make little or no difference to how well people with cachexia can move or to their muscle strength. They also appear to have little impact on body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or side‑effects.\"\n4. Nominalisation and noun‑heavy language: The draft contains many noun forms (e.g., \"assessment\", \"intervention\", \"evaluation\") contributing to a high noun count (206, beyond P90) and nominalisation score (22, beyond P90). Re‑phrasing these as verbs improves readability.\n   *Example*: Change \"We assessed the evidence\" to \"We looked at the evidence\".\n5. Subheading consistency: All section headings should be questions. Replace the non‑question heading \"Key messages –\" with a question format, e.g., \"What are the main findings?\".\nThese issues, together with the metric deviations (high nominalisation, noun count, complex and long words), indicate the draft needs revision before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and shows good active‑voice (78, P75) and pronoun use (40, P75). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in several metrics: nominalisation (22, beyond P90), noun count (206, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.66, P90), complex words (152, beyond P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (304, beyond P90), and long words (205, beyond P90). These indicate excessive noun‑heavy and complex language, supporting the recommended reductions in nominalisations, long/complex words, and clearer verb‑focused phrasing."
