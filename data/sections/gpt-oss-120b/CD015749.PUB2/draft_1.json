  "draft": "Are combined drug, nutrition, and exercise treatments effective for managing weight loss and muscle wasting (cachexia) in people with chronic illnesses?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Based on the available research, we cannot say that combined drug, nutrition, and exercise programmes (multimodal interventions) clearly improve weight, muscle loss, physical function (ability to perform daily activities), strength (muscle power), or quality of life (overall wellbeing) in people with cachexia (wasting syndrome), and the studies did not show a clear increase in unwanted side effects (adverse events).\n- Comparisons of these combined programmes with either a single treatment or a different version of the programme also did not demonstrate clear benefits, and the evidence comes from a small number of the trials that mainly included people with cancer and a few other chronic illnesses.\n- Because the existing trials were limited in size, had methodological weaknesses (issues with study design), and followed participants only for short periods, larger, well‑designed studies that examine longer‑term effects (effects over many months or years) and include a broader range of chronic conditions (different long‑term illnesses) are needed to determine whether multimodal interventions can help manage cachexia.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is cachexia and why does it matter?\nCachexia, also called disease‑related wasting, is a serious condition that can develop in people who have long‑term illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, or chronic lung disease (COPD). It means the body loses weight and muscle even when a person is eating enough, leading to fatigue, loss of appetite, and a poorer quality of life. Because the loss of muscle and strength makes everyday activities harder and can worsen the underlying illness, finding ways to treat or stop cachexia is an important health challenge.\n\nWhat treatments are currently used for cachexia?\nDoctors usually try several separate approaches: medicines that may affect metabolism, special nutrition plans to boost calorie and protein intake, and exercise programmes to preserve muscle. Each of these on its own can help a little, but they often do not fully stop the wasting. Researchers think that combining two or more of these strategies – called a \"multimodal\" intervention – might work better because the different parts could support each other.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether multimodal programmes that mix medicines, nutrition, and/or exercise actually improve outcomes for people with cachexia. Specifically, they looked at whether these combined treatments help people walk farther or lift more weight (physical function and strength), reduce side‑effects, improve body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, and relevant lab tests. They also wanted to see if any harms were linked to the combined approaches.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared multimodal interventions (combining nutrition, exercise, and/or medication) with usual care, variations, or single‑component treatments in adults with cachexia. We combined the findings across these studies and and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sample sizes.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at nine randomised controlled trials that together involved 926 adults (average age about 63 years) who had cachexia or were at risk of it. The studies were carried out in six European countries, plus Turkey, New Zealand and the United States. Six of the trials enrolled people with cancer, and one each focused on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and HIV/AIDS. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 332 participants, and the interventions lasted from six weeks up to seven months. All trials tested multimodal programmes that combined two or more approaches – medication, nutrition support and/or exercise – and compared them with usual care, a variation of the programme, or a single‑component intervention.\n\nThe evidence suggests that these multimodal programmes probably make little or no difference to how well people with cachexia can move, their muscle strength, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or the chance of side‑effects. However, the certainty of this conclusion is very low, so we cannot be sure about the true effect.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search.",

This breaches the Master Style Guide (5.3 Structure) which mandates subheadings be phrased as questions. Additionally, the draft contains several clarity and style problems that would confuse readers:\n1. \"We combined the findings across these studies and and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sample sizes.\" – duplicated \"and\", passive‑heavy, and vague. Rewrite to active, concise language.\n2. \"The evidence suggests that these multimodal programmes probably make little or no difference to how well people with cachexia can move, their muscle strength, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or the chance of side‑effects.\" – very long sentence (31 words) with many stacked items, making it hard to follow. Break into shorter sentences.\n3. \"We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. The draft uses a noun‑heavy construction and lacks a clear first‑person voice. Rewrite to active voice with \"we\".\n4. Bullet points in Key messages use hyphens but the list is a single paragraph; separate each point onto its own line for better white‑space.\n5. The \"Methods\" heading is not a question; change to \"How did we find the evidence?\" and similarly rename \"Limitations\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and \"Currency\" to \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\nMetrics support these edits: the draft has 18 passive constructions (P75), 27 nominalizations (P90), 225 nouns (BEYOND_P90), and high lexical complexity (SMOG 15.4, complex words 167). Reducing passive voice, nominalizations, and noun density will improve readability and align with typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate overall conformity but highlights several deviations: words per sentence (25.5, P90), nominalizations (27, P90), nouns (225, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15.4, BEYOND_P90), and high counts of complex and long words. These indicate the draft is more complex and noun‑heavy than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need for shorter sentences, more active voice, and fewer nominalizations."
