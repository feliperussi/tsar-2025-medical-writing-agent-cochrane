  "draft": "Are combined drug, nutrition, and exercise treatments effective for managing weight loss and muscle wasting (cachexia) in people with chronic illnesses?\n\nKey messages –\n- We found that combined drug, nutrition, and exercise programmes did not clearly improve weight, muscle loss, daily activities, strength, or overall wellbeing, and they did not increase side‑effects (adverse events).\n- Comparing these programmes with a single treatment or with a different version of the programme also showed no clear benefits. Most evidence comes from a small number of trials that mainly involved people with cancer and a few other chronic illnesses.\n- The trials were small, had design weaknesses, and followed participants only for short periods. Larger, well‑designed studies that look at longer‑term effects and include more types of chronic conditions are needed.\n\nWhat is cachexia and why does it matter? –\nCachexia, also called disease‑related wasting, is a serious condition that can develop in people with long‑term illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, or chronic lung disease (COPD). It means the body loses weight and muscle even when a person eats enough, leading to fatigue, loss of appetite, and a poorer quality of life. Because loss of muscle and strength makes everyday activities harder and can worsen the underlying illness, finding ways to treat or stop cachexia is an important health challenge.\n\nWhat treatments are currently used for cachexia? –\nDoctors usually try several separate approaches: medicines that may affect metabolism, special nutrition plans that boost calories and protein, and exercise programmes that preserve muscle. Each approach can help a little, but they often do not fully stop the wasting. Researchers think that combining two or more of these strategies – called a multimodal programme (treatments that combine medicines, special nutrition, and exercise) – might work better because the different parts could support each other.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out? –\nWe wanted to know whether multimodal programmes that mix medicines, nutrition, and/or exercise improve outcomes for people with cachexia. Specifically, we looked at whether these programmes help people walk farther or lift more weight (physical function and strength), reduce side‑effects (adverse events), improve body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or relevant lab tests, and whether any harms were linked to the combined approaches.\n\nHow did we find the evidence? –\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared multimodal programmes with usual care, a variation of the programme, or a single‑component treatment in adults with cachexia. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We then combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence (certainty of evidence – how confident we are that the results are true) based on study methods, sample sizes, and other factors.\n\nWhat did we find? –\nWe identified nine trials involving 926 adults (average age about 63 years). Six trials enrolled people with cancer; the others involved COPD, chronic kidney disease, or HIV/AIDS. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 332 participants, and interventions lasted from six weeks to seven months. All trials tested multimodal programmes that included at least two of the following: medication, nutrition support, and exercise.\nWe found that these programmes probably make little or no difference to how well people with cachexia can move or to their muscle strength. They also appear to have little impact on body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or side‑effects. The certainty of this conclusion is very low, so we cannot be sure about the true effect.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? –\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, which can bias results. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, and the small size of the trials limits reliability. The evidence does not cover all possible people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review? –\nWe searched up to July 2024, and that is the date of our most recent search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical style requirement: all subheadings must be phrased as questions, but the \"Key messages –\" heading is not a question. This violates the Master Style Guide and therefore the PLS cannot be approved. In addition, several clarity issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Problematic subheading**: \"Key messages –\" is not a question. *Why problematic*: The style guide mandates question‑format subheadings to guide readers. *Suggested rewrite*: \"What are the main findings? –\"\n2. **Overly long sentence with many items**: \"We found that these programmes probably make little or no difference to how well people with cachexia can move, their muscle strength, body composition, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or the chance of side‑effects.\" *Why problematic*: The sentence is dense and hard to follow for a lay audience. *Suggested rewrite*: \"We found that these programmes probably make little or no difference to:\\n   - how well people can move,\\n   - their muscle strength,\\n   - body composition,\\n   - weight,\\n   - appetite,\\n   - fatigue,\\n   - quality of life,\\n   - and the chance of side‑effects.\"\n3. **Passive construction**: \"All outcomes in all comparisons had very low‑certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and/or indirectness and twice for imprecision.\" *Why problematic*: Passive voice hides who performed the assessment. *Suggested rewrite*: \"We judged all outcomes to have very low‑certainty evidence because we downgraded them once for risk of bias or indirectness and twice for imprecision.\"\n4. **Jargon without definition**: The term \"multimodal programmes\" appears early without a simple definition. *Why problematic*: Readers may not know what \"multimodal\" means. *Suggested rewrite*: \"multimodal programmes (treatments that combine medicines, special nutrition, and exercise)\"\n5. **Missing blank line after headings**: The draft sometimes runs headings directly into the paragraph, reducing white‑space. *Why problematic*: Lack of visual separation makes the text harder to scan. *Suggested rewrite*: Insert a blank line between each heading and its first paragraph.\n\nMetrics support these observations: the draft shows high nominalisation (24, beyond P90) and a very high noun count (205, beyond P90), indicating noun‑heavy sentences. Complex words (146) and long words (205) are also far above typical PLS ranges, contributing to the dense sentence identified above. Passive voice count (12) is at the median but could be reduced for clarity. These metric deviations align with the editorial suggestions.\n\nTo meet approval, revise the \"Key messages\" heading into a question, simplify long noun‑ or verb‑heavy sentences, replace passive voice with active constructions, define technical terms, and improve spacing between sections.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is 682 words (within the 850‑word limit). Readability scores are good (Flesch‑Reading Ease 52, FKGL 11). However, several linguistic features deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisation (24, beyond P90), nouns (205, beyond P90), complex words (146, beyond P90), long words (205, beyond P90), and SMOG index (14.4, beyond P90). These indicate a noun‑heavy, complex style that should be simplified for a lay audience."
