  "plain_title": "Is iron given through a vein (intravenous iron) safer and more effective than iron taken by mouth (oral iron) for treating iron deficiency anemia (low‑iron blood condition) in pregnant women?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Intravenous iron (iron given through a vein) likely results in slightly higher hemoglobin (the oxygen‑carrying protein in red blood cells) levels and reduces anemia (low‑iron blood condition) during pregnancy and at birth compared with oral iron (iron taken by mouth); it does not appear to increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage (excessive bleeding after delivery), the need for blood transfusion, or affect breastfeeding rates, and overall adverse events (unwanted side effects) are similar between the two methods. The evidence for hemoglobin and anemia outcomes is of moderate quality (studies are fairly reliable but have some limitations), while evidence for some postpartum outcomes is less certain.",
    "No trials reported on maternal satisfaction (women’s personal assessment of treatment) or well‑being, and serious outcomes such as maternal mortality (death of the mother), severe infections, or intensive‑care unit admission remain very uncertain because few events were observed and reporting was inconsistent.",
    "Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that follow women into the postpartum period, use consistent definitions for outcomes, and report detailed safety information, especially for severe anemia after birth and rare serious events, to address the current gaps in knowledge."

      "subheading": "What is iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy and why does it matter?",
      "content": "During pregnancy many women develop iron deficiency anaemia – a condition where the blood does not have enough iron to make healthy red blood cells. This is measured by a low level of haemoglobin (Hb), the protein that carries oxygen in the blood. When Hb falls below 11 g/dL, the World Health Organization says a woman has anaemia. Low iron can make mothers feel tired, weak, and short‑of‑breath, and it can increase the risk of complications around birth, such as heavy bleeding after delivery (post‑partum haemorrhage, or PPH) and the need for a blood transfusion. The usual first‑line treatment is oral iron tablets (e.g., ferrous sulfate), which are taken by mouth. However, oral iron can cause stomach upset and may not raise iron levels quickly enough. An alternative is intravenous (IV) iron, which is given as a drip directly into a vein and can raise iron stores faster, but it requires a clinic visit and has its own safety considerations."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to compare the two ways of giving iron – IV iron versus oral iron – to see which one works better and is safer for pregnant women with iron‑deficiency anaemia. Specifically, they looked at how each treatment affected blood‑iron levels (haemoglobin) during pregnancy and after birth, the rates of anaemia, the occurrence of serious problems such as postpartum haemorrhage or the need for a blood transfusion, and any side‑effects or other health outcomes for the mother."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 13 randomised controlled trials with a total of 3,939 pregnant women who had iron‑deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin < 11 g/dL). Women were recruited between 13 and 37 weeks of gestation and some had very low baseline haemoglobin values (as low as 5.0 g/dL), indicating moderate to severe anaemia. The trials were conducted mainly in India and several African countries. The interventions compared intravenous iron preparations (iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose, ferric derisomaltose, ferumoxytol) with oral iron formulations (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate); the most common comparison was intravenous iron sucrose versus oral ferrous sulfate, reported in five trials. Details on the length of each study were not provided, and the funding sources for the individual trials were not reported. The review itself was partially funded by the World Health Organization and supported by the UK Medical Research Council. No studies evaluated other routes of iron administration or non‑iron comparators."

      "subheading": "Main results: Effect on haemoglobin and anaemia",
      "content": "Intravenous iron probably increases haemoglobin levels slightly during pregnancy and around the time of birth, and probably reduces the proportion of women who are anaemic during pregnancy, at birth, and after birth. It is unclear whether intravenous iron reduces severe anaemia after birth. Intravenous iron may make little to no difference to postpartum haemorrhage, the need for blood transfusion, breastfeeding rates, maternal mortality, severe infections, prolonged hospital stay, overall adverse events, admission to intensive care, and serious adverse events."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2024 of search."
