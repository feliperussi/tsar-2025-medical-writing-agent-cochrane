  "draft": "Is iron given through a vein (intravenous iron) safer and more effective than iron taken by mouth (oral iron) for treating iron‑deficiency anaemia in pregnant women?\n\nKey messages:\n- Intravenous iron probably raises haemoglobin (the oxygen‑carrying protein in red blood cells) a little more than oral iron during pregnancy and at birth, and it probably reduces the number of women who are anaemic (low‑iron blood condition) at those times. The evidence is of moderate quality (studies are fairly reliable but have some limitations).\n- Intravenous iron does not appear to increase the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (excessive bleeding after delivery), the need for a blood transfusion, or changes in breastfeeding rates. Overall side‑effects are similar between the two methods.\n- No trials reported on how satisfied women felt with the treatment, and serious outcomes such as maternal death, severe infections, or intensive‑care admission remain very uncertain because few events were observed.\n\nWhy does iron‑deficiency anaemia matter in pregnancy?\nDuring pregnancy many women develop iron‑deficiency anaemia – a condition where the blood does not have enough iron to make healthy red blood cells. We measure it with haemoglobin (Hb); the World Health Organization defines anaemia as Hb below 11 g/dL. Low iron can make mothers feel tired, weak, and short‑of‑breath, and it can raise the risk of complications around birth, such as heavy bleeding after delivery (post‑partum haemorrhage) and the need for a blood transfusion.\nThe usual first‑line treatment is oral iron tablets (for example, ferrous sulfate). Oral iron can cause stomach upset and may not raise iron levels quickly enough. Intravenous (IV) iron is given as a drip directly into a vein and can raise iron stores faster, but it requires a clinic visit and has its own safety considerations.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare IV iron with oral iron to see which method works better and is safer for pregnant women with iron‑deficiency anaemia. Specifically, we looked at haemoglobin levels and anaemia status during pregnancy and after birth, the occurrence of serious problems such as postpartum haemorrhage or the need for a blood transfusion, and any side‑effects or other health outcomes for the mother.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase) and two trial registries for randomised controlled trials that compared IV and oral iron in pregnant women with confirmed iron‑deficiency anaemia (Hb < 11 g/dL). Two reviewers screened studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We pooled results using standard Cochrane methods and rated the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 13 trials involving 3,939 pregnant women (Hb < 11 g/dL). Women were recruited between 13 and 37 weeks of pregnancy, and some had very low baseline Hb (as low as 5.0 g/dL). Most trials were conducted in India or African countries. The most common comparison was IV iron sucrose versus oral ferrous sulfate.\n- Haemoglobin: IV iron likely increased Hb by about 0.5 g/dL three to six weeks after starting treatment and by a similar amount around birth (moderate‑quality evidence).\n- Anaemia: IV iron probably reduced the risk of anaemia during pregnancy, at birth, and after birth (moderate‑quality evidence). Evidence for reducing severe anaemia after birth is very uncertain.\n- Post‑partum haemorrhage: IV iron may make little or no difference (low‑quality evidence).\n- Blood transfusion: IV iron likely makes little or no difference in the need for transfusion (moderate‑quality evidence).\n- Breastfeeding, maternal mortality, severe infections, prolonged hospital stay, intensive‑care admission, and serious adverse events: IV iron probably does not increase these outcomes, but the evidence ranges from low to very low certainty.\n- Overall side‑effects: Similar between IV and oral iron (moderate‑quality evidence).\nNo trials reported on maternal satisfaction or well‑being.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings, but several issues reduce certainty. Participants and clinicians often knew which treatment was given, which could influence results. Not all trials reported every outcome we were interested in. The studies involved different populations and were generally small, leading to imprecision.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe search was last run in March 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat should future research address?\nFuture trials should be larger and well‑designed, follow women into the postpartum period, use consistent definitions for outcomes, and report detailed safety information, especially for severe anaemia after birth and rare serious events.",

Minor clarity‑style improvements are recommended: (1) a very long, noun‑heavy sentence in the Results section could be split into shorter bullet points to aid scanning; (2) a few passive/nominalised constructions (e.g., “The most common comparison was…”) can be rewritten in active voice (“We most often compared…”) to make the text more direct; (3) some complex words and long‑word density are higher than typical PLS texts (SMOG 15.3, complex_words 165, long_words 212), so replacing a few technical terms with everyday alternatives (e.g., “severe infections” → “serious infections”) will lower reading difficulty. Implementing these tweaks will align the draft more closely with the metric benchmarks (reducing nominalisations, nouns, and SMOG) while preserving the accurate, patient‑friendly content.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit and scores well on readability (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 51.8, Grade 11.3). However, it deviates on several complexity metrics: nominalisations (26, beyond P90), noun count (236, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.3, beyond P90), and counts of complex/long words are all higher than typical PLS texts. These indicate a more noun‑heavy, technical style, suggesting the need for simplification and more active phrasing."
