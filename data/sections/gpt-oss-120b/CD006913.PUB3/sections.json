  "key_messages": [
    "Psychological therapies such as talk therapy (psychotherapy), education (information sessions), and relaxation techniques (methods to reduce stress) probably lead to small improvements in overall wellbeing (quality of life), depression, and anxiety for adults with inflammatory bowel disease, and talk therapy may also improve overall wellbeing in children and adolescents; no clear effect was seen on how active the disease is (disease activity), and no unwanted or harmful effects were reported.",
    "The evidence comes from many studies that differed a lot in how the therapies were delivered and measured, and most follow‑up periods were short, so confidence in the findings is limited.",
    "Future research should include well‑designed, longer‑term trials that examine the impact of these therapies on disease activity and include children, and should also monitor any possible unwanted or harmful effects."

      "subheading": "What is inflammatory bowel disease and why does it matter?",
      "content": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of long‑lasting conditions, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, that cause inflammation and damage to the digestive tract. People with IBD often experience painful gut symptoms, frequent bowel movements, and sometimes serious complications that can affect daily life. In addition to these physical problems, many people with IBD also develop psychological difficulties like anxiety and depression. Researchers think the relationship works both ways: the stress of living with a chronic gut disease can worsen mental health, and poor mental health can, in turn, make the gut symptoms feel worse. Standard medical care for IBD focuses on medicines that reduce gut inflammation, but these treatments do not directly address the emotional and mental‑health side of the disease."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether psychological interventions – such as psychotherapy, patient education, or relaxation techniques – can improve three key outcomes for people with IBD: (1) quality of life (QoL), which is a simple way of describing how well a person feels they are living day‑to‑day; (2) emotional state, meaning levels of depression and anxiety; and (3) disease activity, which refers to how active the gut inflammation is. They examined studies that compared these mental‑health approaches with usual care or other treatments, looking at both adults and children, to see if the interventions provide real benefits."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 68 randomised trials that together enrolled 6,405 people with inflammatory bowel disease – 6,111 adults and 294 children or adolescents. All studies followed participants for at least two months. The trials tested psychological approaches – such as multimodular psychotherapy, patient‑education programmes and relaxation techniques – often combined with educational components. They compared these approaches with usual care, sham or other active treatments.\n\nIn adults, these psychological interventions probably improve quality of life and probably reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, although the effects are modest. In children and adolescents, psychotherapy probably improves quality of life, but its impact on anxiety is unclear.\n\nEducational programmes probably improve quality of life and may slightly reduce depression and anxiety in adults, with little or no effect on disease activity; in children, education may give a small quality‑of‑life benefit but its effect on depression is uncertain.\n\nRelaxation techniques probably improve quality of life and probably reduce depression and anxiety slightly in adults, while their effects in children remain very uncertain."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search."
