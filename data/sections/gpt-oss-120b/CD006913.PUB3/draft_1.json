  "draft": "analysisWe need to assemble plain language summary with formatting: Title as Heading (maybe just plain line?), main sections as **Bold Headings**, key messages as list with dashes, introduction sections with subheadings. No markdown? It says no markdown, but they mention using **Bold Headings** which is markdown style. However they say no markdown. Possibly they want plain text with bold indicated by uppercase? But they said formatting rules: Title as `Heading`. Main sections as `**Bold Headings**`. That is markdown syntax. But final output must be only final validated plain language summary in a single block of text with no markdown. Contradiction. Likely they want plain text without markdown formatting characters. So we should present title as plain line, sections as uppercase headings maybe. But they explicitly said apply basic formatting rules: Title as Heading, Main sections as **Bold Headings**, Key messages as list with dashes, Introduction sections with subheadings. Then final output must be only final validated plain language summary in a single block of text with no markdown. So we must strip markdown symbols? Probably we need to present without markdown syntax, i.e., just plain text with headings capitalized, but not using markdown characters. Let's interpret: Title as heading (maybe just line). Main sections as bold headings but without markdown, maybe just uppercase and line break. Key messages as list with dashes (dash is plain). Subheadings as maybe italic? Not needed.\n\nThus produce:\n\nTitle line: Do psychological therapies (talk therapy, education, relaxation) improve quality of life, depression, anxiety, or disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?\n\nThen sections: Key messages, Introduction, Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency.\n\nEach section heading in bold? We'll just write in uppercase or with surrounding asterisks? But no markdown. So maybe we write the heading on its own line, maybe preceded by \"Key messages:\".\n\nLet's assemble:\n\nTitle line.\n\nKey messages:\n- first message\n- second\n- third\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why does it matter?\n[content]\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\n[content]\n\nMethods\n[content]\n\nResults\n[content]\n\nLimitations\n[content]\n\nCurrency\n[content]\n\nMake sure no markdown like **.

People with IBD often experience painful gut symptoms, frequent bowel movements, and sometimes serious complications that can affect daily life. In addition to these physical problems, many people with IBD also develop psychological difficulties like anxiety and depression. Researchers think the relationship works both ways: the stress of living with a chronic gut disease can worsen mental health, and poor mental health can, in turn, make the gut symptoms feel worse. Standard medical care for IBD focuses on medicines that reduce gut inflammation, but these treatments do not directly address the emotional and mental‑health side of the disease.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether psychological interventions – such as psychotherapy, patient education, or relaxation techniques – can improve three key outcomes for people with IBD: (1) quality of life (QoL), which is a simple way of describing how well a person feels they are living day‑to‑day; (2) emotional state, meaning levels of depression and anxiety; and (3) disease activity, which refers to how active the gut inflammation is. They examined studies that compared these mental‑health approaches with usual care or other treatments, looking at both adults and children, to see if the interventions provide real benefits.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies evaluating psychological interventions in inflammatory bowel disease, combined their findings on quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity, and assessed the confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWe identified 68 randomised trials that together enrolled 6,405 people with inflammatory bowel disease – 6,111 adults and 294 children or adolescents. All studies followed participants for at least two months. The trials tested psychological approaches – such as multimodular psychotherapy, patient‑education programmes and relaxation techniques – often combined with educational components. They compared these approaches with usual care, sham or other active treatments.\n\nIn adults, these psychological interventions probably improve quality of life and probably reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, although the effects are modest. In children and adolescents, psychotherapy probably improves quality of life, but its impact on anxiety is unclear.\n\nEducational programmes probably improve quality of life and may slightly reduce depression and anxiety in adults, with little or no effect on disease activity; in children, education may give a small quality‑of‑life benefit but its effect on depression is uncertain.\n\nRelaxation techniques probably improve quality of life and probably reduce depression and anxiety slightly in adults, while their effects in children remain very uncertain.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails several critical checks: (1) many section headings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"), which the style guide requires; (2) the total word count is 1,086, exceeding the 850‑word limit; (3) the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many nominalisations, making it hard for lay readers (e.g., \"The evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search.\").\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Section headings as questions** – Quote: \"Key messages\". Problem: Not a question, violating the required format. Rewrite: \"What are the main take‑away messages?\".\n2. **Reduce overall length** – Quote: \"Psychological therapies such as talk therapy (psychotherapy), education (information sessions), and relaxation techniques (methods to reduce stress) probably lead to small improvements…\" (long sentence). Problem: Contributes to word‑count excess and readability. Rewrite: \"Talk therapy, education, and relaxation probably give small improvements in wellbeing, depression and anxiety for adults with IBD.\".\n3. **Replace nominalisations and noun‑heavy phrasing** – Quote: \"The evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search.\" Problem: Uses a noun phrase and is awkward. Rewrite: \"We searched up to May 2023, so the evidence is current.\".\n4. **Simplify complex vocabulary** – Quote: \"multimodular psychotherapy\". Problem: Technical term without explanation. Rewrite: \"combined talk‑therapy programmes\" (and add a brief definition if needed).\n5. **Break long sentences and use active voice** – Quote: \"We identified 68 randomised trials that together enrolled 6,405 people…\" (sentence >30 words). Problem: Long, passive‑leaning sentence reduces clarity. Rewrite: \"We found 68 trials that included 6,405 participants – 6,111 adults and 294 children or adolescents.\".\n\n**Supporting metrics**: The evaluation shows extreme deviations in nominalisation (34, beyond P90), noun count (339, beyond P90), SMOG index (17.9, beyond P90), complex words (221, beyond P90) and long words (370, beyond P90). These indicate the draft is far more complex than typical PLS texts, confirming the need to simplify language, reduce noun density, and shorten sentences.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation flags several metrics far outside typical ranges: nominalisations (34, BEYOND_P90), nouns (339, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (17.9, BEYOND_P90), complex words (221, BEYOND_P90) and long words (370, BEYOND_P90). Readability scores are relatively good (Flesch‑Reading Ease 49.5, P75) but overall word count (1086) exceeds the 850‑word limit. These deviations indicate the draft is overly complex and noun‑heavy, requiring substantial simplification and restructuring."
