  "key_messages": [
    "Lowering blood pressure can modestly lower the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy (damage to the retina caused by diabetes) over about five years, especially in people with type 2 diabetes who already have high blood pressure, and the evidence is of moderate quality; however, it does not clearly prevent worsening of existing disease or more severe eye problems, and the main reported side effect is low blood pressure (abnormally low blood pressure).",
    "The benefit was mainly observed in people with type 2 diabetes who have hypertension (high blood pressure), while studies in people without hypertension did not show a clear advantage.",
    "Future research should look at longer‑term effects beyond five years, examine whether blood‑pressure lowering can slow progression of existing retinopathy, and better assess potential unwanted effects such as low blood pressure, particularly in patients without hypertension."

      "subheading": "What is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Diabetic retinopathy is damage to the tiny blood vessels in the eye that can happen to people with diabetes. Over time, these vessels can leak, swell, or close, leading to blurry vision, loss of sight, and even blindness. It is one of the most common eye complications of diabetes and a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide. While good control of blood sugar is known to help prevent this eye damage, doctors have also suggested that keeping blood pressure (the force of blood against artery walls) in a healthy range might protect the eyes further. However, studies have shown mixed results, leaving uncertainty about how much lowering blood pressure really helps prevent or slow eye problems in people with diabetes."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to gather and summarise all the best‑quality research that compared more intensive blood‑pressure control with less intensive control, usual care, or no treatment in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. They wanted to know whether tighter blood‑pressure control reduces the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy, slows its progression, preserves visual acuity (sharpness of vision), and what side‑effects, quality‑of‑life impacts, or costs might be involved."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that randomly assigned people with diabetes to more intensive versus less intensive blood pressure control (or usual care), combined their findings on retinopathy outcomes, and assessed our confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at 29 randomised controlled trials that together included 27,185 people with diabetes (4,620 with type 1 and 22,565 with type 2). The studies were carried out in many regions – North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa and the Middle East – and followed participants for periods ranging from less than a year up to nine years. Participants included diabetic individuals who were either normotensive or hypertensive. The trials compared more intensive blood‑pressure control with less intensive control, usual care or placebo, and in some trials a specific class of antihypertensive medication was contrasted with another class or with placebo. Funding came from a mix of sources: eight trials were fully sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, ten received partial industry sponsorship, nine were supported by other organisations, and two did not disclose their funding."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Diabetic retinopathy",
      "content": "More intensive blood‑pressure control probably reduces the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy over five years. It may also reduce the combined risk of developing or worsening diabetic retinopathy, although the evidence for this is less certain. For people who already have retinopathy, more intensive control probably makes little or no difference to its progression, to the risk of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, clinically significant macular edema, vitreous haemorrhage, or loss of visual acuity. More intensive blood‑pressure control probably reduces the risk of death slightly, but it may increase the chance of experiencing hypotension, and the certainty of this finding is low."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, because the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we are interested in, and because the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to September 2021 of search."
