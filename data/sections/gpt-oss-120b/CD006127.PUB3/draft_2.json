  "draft": "Does lowering blood pressure reduce the risk of diabetic eye disease (diabetic retinopathy)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Lowering blood pressure modestly reduces the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy over about five years, especially for people with type 2 diabetes who already have high blood pressure; the evidence is of moderate quality.\n- The benefit is mainly seen in people with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, while studies in people without high blood pressure did not show a clear advantage.\n- Future research should explore effects beyond five years, whether blood‑pressure lowering can slow worsening of existing retinopathy, and the risk of low blood pressure (hypotension), especially in patients without hypertension.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nDiabetic retinopathy is damage to the tiny blood vessels in the eye that can occur in people with diabetes. Over time these vessels may leak, swell, or close, leading to blurry vision, loss of sight, or blindness. It is one of the most common eye complications of diabetes and a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to gather all high‑quality randomised trials that compared more intensive blood‑pressure control with less intensive control, usual care, or no treatment in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We asked whether tighter blood‑pressure control reduces the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy, slows its worsening (progression), preserves visual acuity (sharpness of vision), and what side‑effects, quality‑of‑life impacts, or costs might occur.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched electronic databases and trial registries up to 3 September 2021. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We combined results from 29 randomised controlled trials that enrolled 27 185 participants (4 620 with type 1 and 22 565 with type 2 diabetes) from many regions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nMore intensive blood‑pressure control probably reduces the chance of developing diabetic retinopathy over five years (moderate‑certainty evidence). The combined risk of developing or worsening retinopathy may also be lower, but the evidence is less certain.\nFor people who already have retinopathy, more intensive control probably makes little or no difference to its progression, to the risk of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (advanced stage), clinically significant macular edema (swelling of the central retina), vitreous haemorrhage (bleeding inside the eye), or loss of visual acuity.\nMore intensive control probably reduces the risk of death slightly, but it may increase the chance of experiencing hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure); the certainty of this finding is low.\nThe benefit was strongest in participants with type 2 diabetes who had hypertension (high blood pressure). Studies in people without hypertension did not show a clear advantage.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings because the trials varied in participants, interventions, and outcomes, and many were small or few in number. The evidence does not cover all patient groups or long‑term outcomes beyond five years.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the September 2021 search.\n",

In addition, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers: (1) \"Key messages:\" should be re‑worded as a question; (2) the phrase \"moderate‑certainty evidence\" uses technical jargon that patients may not understand; (3) a 30‑word sentence about death and hypotension is hard to follow; (4) some sentences are noun‑heavy (e.g., \"the combined risk of developing or worsening diabetic retinopathy\"), contributing to the high noun count (160, P90) and complex‑word metrics; (5) occasional passive constructions reduce immediacy. Suggested rewrites are provided below. These changes will bring the draft into full compliance with the Master Style Guide and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (44% of features in best quartile). However, five metrics deviate: nouns (160, P90), SMOG index (13.9, P90), complex words (127, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (232, P90) and long words (168, P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long/complex words, supporting the recommended simplifications."
