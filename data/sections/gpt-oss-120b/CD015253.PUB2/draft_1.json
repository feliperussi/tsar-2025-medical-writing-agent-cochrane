  "draft": "Is blowing up a nasal balloon (autoinflation) effective for treating fluid behind the eardrum (otitis media with effusion) in children?\n\nKey messages\n- Blowing up a nasal balloon (autoinflation) might help children with fluid behind the eardrum (otitis media with effusion) by improving hearing and reducing the fluid, but the evidence is limited and uncertain, and there may be a small chance of ear pain (pain in the ear).\n- The available studies suggest that autoinflation could lead to a modest improvement in ear‑related quality of life (how the condition affects daily well‑being) and may slightly lower the chance that fluid remains in the middle ear in the short term.\n- Because the current research is small, short‑term, and of limited quality, more well‑designed, larger studies that follow children for longer periods are needed to determine the true benefits and any potential harms of autoinflation.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhat is otitis media with effusion and why does it matter?\nOtitis media with effusion (OME) is a condition where fluid collects in the middle ear. This fluid can block sound from reaching the inner ear, causing hearing loss. In young children, reduced hearing can lead to behavioural problems, delayed language development, and difficulties in school. Because OME is common in early childhood, clinicians often start with watchful waiting (monitoring without immediate treatment), use medicines, consider surgery (such as inserting tiny ventilation tubes in the eardrum), or try mechanical methods that help the ear drain. One mechanical method is autoinflation—a self‑administered technique where the child blows air into a nasal balloon or similar device to create positive pressure in the nose and throat. This pressure can open the Eustachian tube (the passage that connects the middle ear to the back of the nose) and help fluid move out of the ear.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about autoinflation?\nThe review aimed to determine whether autoinflation is effective and safe for treating OME in children. Specifically, the authors wanted to know if using this self‑inflation technique improves hearing, enhances quality of life related to ear problems, reduces pain or distress, and lowers the chance that fluid remains in the ear. They also examined any possible harms, such as ear pain or eardrum damage. In short, the goal was to assess the benefits and risks of autoinflation compared with doing nothing or with other standard treatments.\n\nMethods\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared autoinflation with no treatment or other therapies in children with otitis media with effusion, combined their findings on hearing, quality of life and related outcomes, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 11 completed randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that together included 1,036 children aged about 3 to 11 years with otitis media with effusion. The studies were carried out in Europe and North America, in hospitals and community settings. All trials compared a self‑administered autoinflation technique (using a nasal balloon or handheld device) with no treatment (watchful waiting). Children were usually asked to do the autoinflation two to three times a day for 2 to 12 weeks, and the longest follow‑up reported was 11 weeks. No information on funding sources was given, and no studies looked at other treatments or children outside the 6‑month‑to‑12‑year age range.\n\nMain results: Middle‑ear fluid and other outcomes\nThe evidence is very uncertain whether autoinflation helps children regain normal hearing. It may improve quality of life related to otitis media, and it is unclear whether it increases ear pain. Autoinflation may slightly reduce the chance that fluid remains in the middle ear – about nine fewer children per hundred still had fluid after three months.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search.",

The sections “Methods”, “Results”, “Limitations” and “Currency” are headings, not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, several sentences are overly long, noun‑heavy and contain nominalisations that make the text harder for patients to follow. Recommended improvements: \n1. **Subheading wording** – change “Methods” to a question such as “How did we find the evidence?”; change “Results” to “What did we find?” (already used as a sub‑heading, but the main heading should be removed or re‑phrased); change “Limitations” to “What are the limitations of the evidence?”; change “Currency” to “How up‑to‑date is this review?”. \n2. **Long sentence** – original: “Children were usually asked to do the autoinflation two to three times a day for 2 to 12 weeks, and the longest follow‑up reported was 11 weeks.” Rewrite: “Children were usually asked to do the autoinflation two to three times a day for 2 to 12 weeks. The longest follow‑up reported was 11 weeks.” \n3. **Nominalisation / noun‑heavy** – original: “We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in.” Rewrite: “We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, involved different groups of children, used varied delivery methods, and did not cover all the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we wanted to assess.” \n4. **Clarity of uncertainty statement** – original: “The evidence is very uncertain whether autoinflation helps children regain normal hearing.” Rewrite: “We are very uncertain whether autoinflation helps children regain normal hearing.” \nThese changes address the most critical clarity and style issues while also reducing the high nominalisation (33 instances) and noun count (204) highlighted by the PLS evaluation. The revised draft will better meet the Cochrane Plain Language Summary style requirements and be easier for patients to understand.",
