  "draft": "Is exercise (strengthening knee exercises) effective for treating patellar tendinopathy (pain in the knee tendon)?\n\nKey messages\n- Strengthening knee exercises may reduce pain in people with patellar tendinopathy, but the evidence is very uncertain because it comes from few small studies of athletes; we do not know how they affect everyday function.\n- When we compare strengthening exercises with steroid injections or surgery, the pain relief and functional improvement appear similar, yet the evidence remains limited and uncertain.\n- We need more high‑quality research that includes a wider range of people, reports any side‑effects, and follows participants for longer periods.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy and how is it usually treated?\nPatellar tendinopathy is a painful condition that affects the tendon connecting the kneecap (patella) to the shinbone (tibia). It often occurs in athletes who do repetitive jumping or sprinting and causes front‑knee pain and stiffness. Typical treatment includes exercise programmes that strengthen the tendon, especially eccentric exercises (where the muscle lengthens while under load, such as slowly lowering the body during a squat). Other options are surgery to repair the tendon and glucocorticoid (steroid) injections to reduce inflammation.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about exercise for patellar tendinopathy?\nWe wanted to know whether strengthening exercises – eccentric, concentric, isometric or combined – reduce pain, improve function, help people return to sport, and are safe compared with no treatment, usual care, surgery, steroid injections or other therapies such as stretching.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared strengthening exercise with no treatment, other therapies or alternative exercises. Two reviewers selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence using standard criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified seven trials that enrolled 211 athletes with chronic patellar tendinopathy. About 88 % of participants were male, the average age was 26 years and symptoms had lasted on average 42 months. Three trials compared exercise with no treatment; one each compared exercise with a glucocorticoid injection, surgery, a stretching programme, or pulsed ultrasound plus transverse friction. No trial used a placebo or sham control and none reported adverse events.\n\nWhat were the main results for strengthening exercise?\nCompared with no treatment, we are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain, although one small study suggested lower pain scores. Exercise may improve function slightly, but the evidence is uncertain. When we compare exercise with glucocorticoid injection, the pain and function outcomes appear similar, with little or no difference. Compared with surgery, the evidence is also very uncertain for both pain and function, and exercise may make little or no difference to treatment success or the chance of returning to sport.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants and investigators knew which treatment was given, the trials were small, many did not report all outcomes we wanted, and all participants were young male athletes. Therefore the findings may not apply to the wider population.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe searches were up to date to September 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets all mandatory checks: it includes every required section, all headings are phrased as questions, the title is a question, all numbers and findings match the source, and the word count is well below the 850‑word limit. Minor clarity improvements are recommended:\n1. Explain research jargon – the phrase “randomised controlled trials” appears without explanation. Rewrite as “randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to different treatments)”.\n2. Break up a dense sentence – the paragraph under “What did we find?” packs three facts into one long sentence. Split into two shorter sentences: “We identified seven trials that enrolled 211 athletes with chronic patellar tendinopathy. About 88 % of participants were male, the average age was 26 years, and symptoms had lasted on average 42 months.”\n3. Use active voice for the currency statement – change “How current is the evidence? The evidence is up to date to September 2023.” to “How current is the evidence? We searched the literature up to September 2023.”\n4. Replace a semicolon with a clearer bullet – in the first key message, separate the two ideas: “‑ Strengthening knee exercises may reduce pain in people with patellar tendinopathy, but the evidence is very uncertain because it comes from few small studies of athletes.\n‑ We do not know how they affect everyday function.”\n5. Reduce noun‑heavy phrasing – the sentence “What were the main results for strengthening exercise?” can be simplified to “What did we find about strengthening exercise?”.\nThese edits will lower the high nominalisation (29) and noun (158) counts flagged by the metrics, improve readability (smog index 14.6, complex words 131) and keep the text patient‑friendly. Overall, the PLS evaluation shows good conformity (words per sentence 18.5, active voice strong, pronouns high). The main deviations are the elevated nominalisation, noun density, and complex‑word counts, which the suggested rewrites address.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on most readability metrics (words per sentence 18.5 P25, active voice 62 P75, pronouns 31 P75). However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns in nominalisations (29 BEYOND_P90), noun count (158 P90), SMOG index (14.6 P90), and complex‑word measures (complex_words 131 P90, complex_words_dc 238 P90, long_words 194 P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than usual, suggesting a need to simplify wording and increase verb usage, as reflected in the recommended edits."
