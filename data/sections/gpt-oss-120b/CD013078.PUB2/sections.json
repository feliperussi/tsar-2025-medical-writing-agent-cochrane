  "plain_title": "Is exercise (strengthening knee exercises) effective for treating patellar tendinopathy (pain in the knee tendon)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Strengthening knee exercises (planned programmes that make the muscles around the kneecap stronger) might reduce pain in people with patellar tendinopathy (pain at the front of the knee tendon), but the evidence is very uncertain and mainly comes from small studies of athletes; the effect on everyday function is also unclear and no studies reported any side‑...effects.",
    "When compared with other treatments such as steroid injections (medicine injected into the knee to reduce inflammation) or surgery (operating on the tendon), strengthening exercises appear to give similar levels of pain relief and functional improvement, but again the evidence is limited and uncertain.",
    "More high‑quality research is needed, especially studies that include a broader range of people (not just young male athletes), report any adverse effects, and follow participants for longer periods to determine the true benefits and risks of strengthening exercises for patellar tendinopathy."

      "subheading": "What is patellar tendinopathy and how is it usually treated?",
      "content": "Patellar tendinopathy is a painful condition affecting the tendon that connects the kneecap (patella) to the shinbone (tibia). It commonly occurs in athletes who perform repetitive jumping or sprinting and can cause front‑knee pain and stiffness. Typical management includes exercise programmes that aim to strengthen the tendon, especially eccentric exercises (where the muscle lengthens while under load, such as slowly lowering the body during a squat). Other options are surgery to repair the tendon and glucocorticoid (steroid) injections to reduce inflammation."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out about exercise for patellar tendinopathy?",
      "content": "The review set out to determine whether strengthening exercises—whether eccentric, concentric, isometric, or combined—provide benefits (reduced pain, improved function, faster return to sport) and have acceptable safety compared with no treatment, usual care, surgery, steroid injections, or other therapies such as stretching. In short, it evaluated the effectiveness and harms of exercise as a treatment for patellar tendinopathy."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we do?",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared strengthening exercise for patellar tendinopathy with no treatment, other therapies, or alternative exercises, combined the results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria such as study methods and sample size."
    }
  ],
  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included seven randomized controlled trials with a total of 211 athletes who had chronic patellar tendinopathy. About 88 % of participants were male, the average age was 26 years, and symptoms had been present for an average of 41.6 months. All trials compared a strengthening‑exercise programme with various comparators: three trials used no treatment, and one trial each compared exercise with a glucocorticoid injection, surgery, a stretching programme, or a combination of pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction. No study used a placebo or sham control, and none reported adverse events. Details on the duration of the exercise programmes, the study settings or countries, and funding sources were not provided in the abstract."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Effect of strengthening exercise",
      "content": "It is unclear whether strengthening exercise reduces pain compared with no treatment. Strengthening exercise may improve function slightly compared with no treatment, but the evidence is uncertain. When compared with glucocorticoid injection, strengthening exercise appears to make little or no difference to pain or to function. The effect of strengthening exercise on pain and function compared with surgery is also unclear. Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to treatment success and to the chance of returning to sport when compared with surgery."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all of the people we are interested in.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to September 2023 of search."
