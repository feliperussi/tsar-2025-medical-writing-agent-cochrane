  "key_messages": [
    "We do not know whether favipiravir improves important outcomes such as survival or the need for a ventilator in people with COVID‑19, and it may increase the chance of mild unwanted effects (adverse events) while serious unwanted effects appear similar to other treatments; the evidence is limited and of low quality.",
    "Most of the studies involved adults who were hospitalized with mild to moderate illness and compared favipiravir mainly with placebo or standard care, but they did not provide clear evidence of benefit.",
    "More well‑designed, larger trials that assess both short‑ and long‑term benefits and harms are needed to determine whether favipiravir has a useful role in treating COVID‑19."

      "content": "COVID‑19 is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS‑CoV‑2. Since early 2020 it has spread worldwide, leading to many hospitalisations, long‑term health problems and deaths. The disease can cause severe breathing trouble, which puts a huge strain on hospitals and health workers. Because there was no cure at first, doctors tried many medicines to see if they could help people recover faster or avoid serious complications. One of these medicines is favipiravir – a drug originally developed for influenza that works by stopping the virus from copying its genetic material. Other treatments that have been studied include different antiviral drugs, steroids, and supportive care such as oxygen, fluids and ventilation."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers aim to discover about favipiravir?",
      "content": "The authors of this review wanted to find out whether favipiravir actually helps people with COVID‑19. They compared favipiravir with no specific antiviral treatment, with the usual supportive care, and with other experimental antivirals. The outcomes they looked at were death rates, need for a ventilator, hospital admission, how quickly patients got better, and any side‑effects (adverse events). To do this they gathered evidence from randomised controlled trials – studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive either the drug or a comparison (placebo or standard of care) – so that the results are as unbiased as possible. Their goal was to decide if favipiravir should be recommended as a treatment for COVID‑19."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at 25 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled about 5,750 adults with COVID‑19. Most participants were under 60 years old, were in hospital with mild to moderate disease, and the studies were carried out in many countries including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. In most trials favipiravir was given as an initial dose of 1,600 mg or 1,800 mg twice on the first day 1, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice daily for a total of five to fourteen days. The drug was compared mainly with placebo or standard care (22 trials); two trials compared it with lopinavir/ritonavir and one with umifenovir. The review did not report how the trials were funded.\n\nThe evidence does not tell us whether favipiravir reduces the risk of death or the need for a ventilator in people with COVID‑19; it may have little or no effect and the certainty of the evidence is very low. For out‑patients, the drug may make little or no difference to the chance of later being admitted to hospital, and the certainty is low. It is also unclear whether favipiravir speeds up clinical recovery or reduces the need for oxygen therapy; any effect is probably small and the evidence is very uncertain. Favipiravir may increase the chance of experiencing any side effect slightly, but serious side effects are probably not affected; the certainty of these safety findings is low."
