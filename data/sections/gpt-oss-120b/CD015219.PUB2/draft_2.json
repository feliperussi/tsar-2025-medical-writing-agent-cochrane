  "draft": "Is the antiviral drug favipiravir (a medicine that may stop the virus from copying) effective and safe for treating COVID‑19?\n\nKey messages\n– We do not know if favipiravir improves survival or reduces the need for a ventilator. It may increase mild side‑effects, while serious side‑effects appear similar to other treatments. The evidence is limited and of low quality.\n– Most studies involved adults who were hospitalized with mild to moderate illness and compared favipiravir mainly with placebo or standard care, but they did not provide clear evidence of benefit.\n– More well‑designed, larger trials that assess both short‑ and long‑term benefits and harms are needed to determine whether favipiravir has a useful role in treating COVID‑19.\n\nWhy is COVID‑19 a global health challenge and what treatments are being explored?\nCOVID‑19 is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS‑CoV‑2. Since early 2020 it has spread worldwide, leading to many hospitalisations, long‑term health problems and deaths. The disease can cause severe breathing trouble, which puts a huge strain on hospitals and health workers. Because there was no cure at first, doctors tried many medicines to see if they could help people recover faster or avoid serious complications. One of these medicines is favipiravir – a drug originally developed for influenza that works by stopping the virus from copying its genetic material. Other treatments that have been studied include different antiviral drugs, steroids, and supportive care such as oxygen, fluids and ventilation.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about favipiravir?\nWe wanted to find out whether favipiravir actually helps people with COVID‑19. We compared favipiravir with no specific antiviral treatment, with usual supportive care, and with other experimental antivirals. The outcomes we looked at were death rates, need for a ventilator, hospital admission, speed of recovery, and any side‑effects (adverse events). We gathered evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) – studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive either the drug or a comparison (placebo or standard of care) – to keep the results as unbiased as possible.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched for RCTs that compared favipiravir with no treatment, standard care or other antivirals in people with acute COVID‑19. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria and the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 25 RCTs that together enrolled about 5,750 adults with COVID‑19. Most participants were under 60 years old, were in hospital with mild to moderate disease, and the studies were carried out in many countries. In most trials we compared the drug with placebo or standard care; two trials compared it with lopinavir/ritonavir and one with umifenovir. Most trials gave favipiravir as an initial dose of 1,600 mg or 1,800 mg twice on the first day, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice daily for five to fourteen days.\nThe evidence does not tell us whether favipiravir reduces the risk of death or the need for a ventilator; it may have little or no effect and the certainty of the evidence is very low. For out‑patients, the drug may make little or no difference to the chance of later being admitted to hospital, and the certainty is low. It is also unclear whether favipiravir speeds up clinical recovery or reduces the need for oxygen therapy; any effect is probably small and the evidence is very uncertain. Favipiravir may increase the chance of experiencing any side‑effect slightly, but serious side‑effects are probably not affected; the certainty of these safety findings is low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small and were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required structural checks, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a patient reader. 1) Long, dense sentences (e.g., the opening sentence of the Results section and the sentence describing the evidence on death/ventilator outcomes) exceed 30 words and combine multiple ideas, making them hard to follow. 2) Repeated use of technical phrasing such as “the certainty of the evidence is very low” and noun‑heavy constructions (high noun count, complex and long words) create a noun‑heavy, abstract style that reduces readability (metrics show nouns = 168 (P90), complex_words = 139 (P90), long_words = 185 (P90)). 3) Some jargon is not fully explained for a lay audience (e.g., “randomised controlled trials (RCTs)”, “adverse events”, “clinical recovery”). 4) The limitation paragraph repeats the same idea in a wordy way, which could be simplified. Suggested rewrites: • Split the 38‑word sentence in the Results intro into two sentences: “We looked at 25 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled about 5,750 adults with COVID‑19. Most participants were under 60, were hospitalised with mild‑to‑moderate disease, and the studies were conducted in many countries.” • Replace the long evidence sentence with a clearer version: “We do not know whether favipiravir reduces death or the need for a ventilator. The evidence is very uncertain, so any effect is likely small.” • Define key terms when first used: “randomised controlled trials (RCTs) – studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive the drug or a comparison”. • Simplify the limitation statement: “We are not confident because the studies were small and varied in participants and how the drug was given.” These changes address the major clarity issues and also reduce noun‑heavy language, bringing the draft closer to typical PLS patterns (nouns, complex words, long words currently in the P90 range).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but notable deviations: nouns (168, P90), smog_index (14.3, P90), complex_words_dc (264, P90), complex_words (139, P90), and long_words (185, P90) are all higher than typical PLS ranges, indicating noun‑heavy and complex language. Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch Reading Ease 52.9, P75), but the high noun and complex word counts support the identified clarity concerns."
