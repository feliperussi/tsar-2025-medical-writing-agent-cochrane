  "draft": "Is the antiviral drug favipiravir (a medicine that may stop the virus from copying) effective and safe for treating COVID‑19?\n\n**Key messages**\n- We do not know whether favipiravir improves important outcomes such as survival or the need for a ventilator in people with COVID‑19, and it may increase the chance of mild unwanted effects (adverse events) while serious unwanted effects appear similar to other treatments; the evidence is limited and of low quality.\n- Most of the studies involved adults who were hospitalized with mild to moderate illness and compared favipiravir mainly with placebo or standard care, but they did not provide clear evidence of benefit.\n- More well‑designed, larger trials that assess both short‑ and long‑term benefits and harms are needed to determine whether favipiravir has a useful role in treating COVID‑19.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is COVID‑19 a global health challenge and what treatments are being explored?\nCOVID‑19 is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS‑CoV‑2. Since early 2020 it has spread worldwide, leading to many hospitalisations, long‑term health problems and deaths. The disease can cause severe breathing trouble, which puts a huge strain on hospitals and health workers. Because there was no cure at first, doctors tried many medicines to see if they could help people recover faster or avoid serious complications. One of these medicines is favip and the rest of the text... (content as provided)\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about favipiravir?\nThe authors of this review wanted to find out whether favipiravir actually helps people with COVID‑19. They compared favipiravir with no specific antiviral treatment, with the usual supportive care, and with other experimental antivirals. The outcomes they looked at were death rates, need for a ventilator, hospital admission, how quickly patients got better, and any side‑effects (adverse events). To do this they gathered evidence from randomised controlled trials – studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive either the drug or a comparison (placebo or standard of care) – so that the results are as unbiased as possible. Their goal was to decide if favipiravir should be recommended as a treatment for COVID‑19.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials that compared favipiravir with no treatment, standard care or other antivirals in people with acute COVID‑19, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 25 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled about 5,750 adults with COVID‑19. Most participants were... (content as provided)\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions. The sections \"Methods\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are labelled with plain nouns rather than question‑style headings, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers:\n1. Subheading not a question – \"Methods\". Problem: does not follow the required question format, making navigation harder for lay readers. Rewrite: \"How did we find and evaluate the studies?\"\n2. Subheading not a question – \"Limitations\". Problem: same as above. Rewrite: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n3. Subheading not a question – \"Currency\". Problem: same as above. Rewrite: \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"\n4. Passive construction – \"The drug was compared mainly with placebo or standard care (22 trials); two trials compared it with lopinavir/ritonavir and one with umifenovir.\" Problem: passive voice hides who performed the comparison, reducing readability. Rewrite: \"In most trials we compared the drug with placebo or standard care; two trials compared it with lopinavir/ritonavir and one with umifenovir.\"\n5. Overly long first key‑message bullet – \"We do not know whether favipiravir improves important outcomes such as survival or the need for a ventilator in people with COVID‑19, and it may increase the chance of mild unwanted effects (adverse events) while serious unwanted effects appear similar to other treatments; the evidence is limited and of low quality.\" Problem: a single sentence >30 words, dense and hard to follow. Rewrite: \"We do not know if favipiravir improves survival or reduces the need for a ventilator. It may increase mild side‑effects, while serious side‑effects seem similar to other treatments. The evidence is limited and of low quality.\"\nThese changes address the most impactful clarity problems. The PLS evaluation shows a relatively high passive‑voice count (15, in the P75 range) and a good overall readability (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 52, grade‑level ~11), confirming that the draft is readable but would benefit from the active‑voice and sentence‑length adjustments noted above.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns: words per sentence (19.75, P25), readability scores (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 52, P75), and grade‑level indices (FKGL 10.9, P25). The only notable deviation is a higher passive‑voice count (15, P75) and the presence of subheadings that are not phrased as questions, which violates the style guide despite overall good statistical conformity."
