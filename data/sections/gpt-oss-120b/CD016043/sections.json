  "key_messages": [
    "A range of ways to provide eye‑care services were identified: in community settings school‑based programmes (eye exams and glasses offered at schools), pharmacy‑based services (eye‑care provided through pharmacies), and outreach programmes (teams that travel to communities to deliver eye exams and glasses); in primary‑care settings vision centres (specialised eye‑care units within health facilities), health‑centre based services, and combined door‑to‑door approaches (services delivered directly to people's homes). No harmful effects were reported, but few studies actually evaluated how well these models work, so the benefits remain uncertain.",
    "The choice of model varied by region – school‑based and outreach programmes were common in the African region, outreach was the main model in the Americas, and very few approaches were described for the Eastern Mediterranean region, highlighting gaps in knowledge about effective delivery in some areas.",
    "Because most reports did not assess outcomes, further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness, quality, and any unintended consequences of these service‑delivery approaches, including their impact on access to eye exams and glasses in different settings."

      "subheading": "Why is uncorrected refractive error a problem?",
      "content": "Many people have trouble seeing clearly because the shape of their eyes does not focus light properly – this is called a refractive error (for example, nearsightedness or farsightedness). When these errors are not corrected with glasses or contact lenses, a person’s vision can be blurry, making everyday tasks such as reading, studying, working, or driving difficult or unsafe. Worldwide, uncorrected refractive error is one of the leading causes of vision loss, affecting millions of children and adults. The World Health Assembly set a goal for 2030: to increase the proportion of people who have effective, usable vision correction by 40 percentage points. Achieving this goal means that more people need easy, affordable access to eye‑care services that can test vision and provide the right spectacles, especially in community settings (places like schools, pharmacies, or local outreach programs) and primary‑care settings (local health centres or small vision clinics)."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to map out all the different ways that refractive‑error services are being delivered outside of specialised eye hospitals. Specifically, they asked: (1) what types of community‑based models (such as school‑based programs, pharmacy‑based checks, or mobile outreach teams) and primary‑care models (like vision centres, health‑centre integrations, or door‑to‑door visits) are being used around the world? and (2) how have these models been evaluated to see if they work well? By answering these questions, the review will help the World Health Organization and its member countries choose and improve the most effective ways to bring vision testing and glasses to the people who need them."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The scoping review identified 402 records that met the inclusion criteria. These comprised 175 primary studies from database and grey‑literature searches, 146 records from company reports and 81 records from organisational website searches. The studies covered a wide range of populations, including preschool‑ and school‑aged children and adults, but the abstract did not give details on age ranges, gender distribution, severity of refractive error, or total numbers of participants. Research was conducted across several WHO regions, especially the African region (school‑based and outreach models) and the Americas (outreach models), with limited data from the Eastern Mediterranean. Delivery approaches fell into community‑care models (school‑based, pharmacy, outreach) and primary‑care models (vision centres, health centres, combined or door‑to‑door strategies). Funding for the review was provided by the World Health Organization Vision and Eye Care Programme in partnership with the ATscale Global Partnership."

      "subheading": "Main results: Impact of delivery models on vision outcomes",
      "content": "Very few of the identified studies actually evaluated whether the different service‑delivery models improved people’s vision or their access to spectacles. Because of this lack of rigorous evaluation, we do not know if school‑based, pharmacy, outreach, vision‑centre, health‑centre or door‑to‑door approaches make a difference to vision outcomes."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.",
