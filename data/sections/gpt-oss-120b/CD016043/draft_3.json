  "draft": "What are the different ways to provide eye‑care services (eye exams and glasses) in community places and primary‑care clinics (local health centres)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We identified several ways to deliver eye‑care: school‑based programmes, pharmacy‑based checks, outreach teams that travel to villages, vision centres inside health facilities, health‑centre services and door‑to‑door visits that bring exams and glasses to homes.\n- The model used varied by region. School‑based and outreach programmes were common in the African region, outreach was the main model in the Americas, and few approaches were reported for the Eastern Mediterranean region.\n- Most reports did not assess outcomes, so we cannot say which model works best. We looked for reports of harms and found none.\n\nWhy is uncorrected refractive error a problem?\nMany people have blurry vision because the shape of their eyes does not focus light correctly – this is called a refractive error (for example, nearsightedness or farsightedness). When the error is not corrected with glasses or contact lenses, everyday tasks such as reading, studying, working or driving become difficult or unsafe. Worldwide, uncorrected refractive error is one of the leading causes of vision loss, affecting millions of children and adults. The World Health Assembly set a 2030 goal to increase the proportion of people with effective vision correction by 40 percentage points. To reach this goal, people need easy, affordable access to eye‑care that can test vision and provide the right glasses, especially in community places (schools, pharmacies, outreach programmes) and primary‑care clinics (local health centres or small vision clinics).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to map all the ways refractive‑error services are delivered outside specialised eye hospitals. Specifically, we asked: (1) which community‑based models (school programmes, pharmacy checks, mobile outreach teams) and primary‑care models (vision centres, health‑centre integrations, door‑to‑door visits) are being used around the world? and (2) how have these models been evaluated for effectiveness?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched databases, grey literature, company reports and organisational websites for studies published between Jan 2002 and Nov 2022. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full texts, extracted data and resolved any disagreements through discussion. We then combined the findings into tables, figures and case studies and judged how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 402 records that met our criteria: 175 primary studies, 146 company reports and 81 website records. The records covered preschool‑ and school‑aged children and adults, but they rarely gave details on age, gender, severity of refractive error or participant numbers. Studies came from many WHO regions, especially the African region (school‑based and outreach models) and the Americas (outreach models). We grouped the delivery approaches into community‑care models (school‑based, pharmacy, outreach) and primary‑care models (vision centres, health centres, combined or door‑to‑door strategies). Very few studies evaluated whether these models improved vision or increased access to glasses, so we cannot determine which approach works best.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies do not cover all people, interventions, comparators or outcomes we were interested in, and there are not enough rigorous evaluations to be certain about the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required structural checks, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a patient‑focused audience. 1) Unexplained jargon – terms such as “refractive‑error services”, “primary‑care models” and “door‑to‑door visits” are used without plain‑language definitions. 2) A long, dense sentence in the background: “To reach this goal, people need easy, affordable access to eye‑care, especially in community places (schools, pharmacies, outreach programmes) and primary‑care clinics (local health centres or small vision clinics).” should be split for readability. 3) Ambiguous use of the word “records” – “We identified 402 records …” may be unclear to readers; replace with “documents” or “reports”. 4) The confidence statement is overly complex: “We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies do not cover all people, interventions, comparators or outcomes we were interested in, and there are not enough rigorous evaluations to be certain about the results.” should be rewritten in simpler language. These issues are reflected in the metric analysis, which shows a high noun count (191, above typical range) and many complex/long words (262 complex words DC, 170 long words), indicating a noun‑heavy, jargon‑laden style. Addressing the four points above will bring the summary into line with Cochrane plain‑language. ",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall (72% of features in best quartile), but deviates on four metrics: nouns (191 > median 116), Dale‑Chall readability (8.28 > median 7.7), complex words DC (262 > median 160) and long words (170 > median 122). These indicate excessive noun density and technical vocabulary, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce jargon."
