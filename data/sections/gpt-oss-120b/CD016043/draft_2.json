  "draft": "What are the different ways to provide eye‑care services (eye exams and glasses) in community places and primary‑care clinics (local health centres)?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- We found several ways to deliver eye‑care. In community settings we saw school‑based programmes, pharmacy‑based services, and outreach teams that travel to villages. In primary‑care settings we saw vision centres inside health facilities, services based in health centres, and door‑to‑door visits that bring exams and glasses directly to homes.\n- The model used varied by region. School‑based and outreach programmes were common in the African region, outreach was the main model in the Americas, and few approaches were reported for the Eastern Mediterranean region.\n- Most reports did not measure outcomes, so we cannot say which model works best. We found no harmful effects.\n\nWhy is uncorrected refractive error a problem?\nRefractive error (a mismatch between the eye’s shape and its focus) makes vision blurry. When people do not wear glasses or contact lenses, everyday tasks such as reading, studying, working, or driving become difficult or unsafe. Uncorrected refractive error is one of the leading causes of vision loss worldwide, affecting millions of children and adults. The World Health Assembly set a 2030 goal to increase effective vision correction by 40 percentage points. To reach this goal, people need easy and affordable access to eye‑care that can test vision and provide the right spectacles, especially in community places (schools, pharmacies, outreach programmes) and primary‑care clinics (local health centres or small vision clinics).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to map all the ways refractive‑error services are delivered outside specialised eye hospitals. Specifically, we asked: (1) which community‑based models (school programmes, pharmacy checks, mobile outreach teams) and primary‑care models (vision centres, health‑centre integrations, door‑to‑door visits) are being used around the world? and (2) how have these models been evaluated for effectiveness?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched databases, grey literature, company reports, and organisational websites for studies published between Jan 2002 and Nov 2022. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full texts, extracted data, and resolved any disagreements through discussion. We combined the findings into tables, figures and case studies and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 402 records that met our criteria: 175 primary studies, 146 company reports and 81 website records. The records covered preschool‑ and school‑aged children and adults, but they rarely gave details on age, gender, severity of refractive error or participant numbers. Studies came from many WHO regions, especially the African region (school‑based and outreach models) and the Americas (outreach models). We grouped the delivery approaches into community‑care models (school‑based, pharmacy, outreach) and primary‑care models (vision centres, health centres, combined or door‑to‑door strategies). Very few studies evaluated whether these models improved vision or increased access to spectacles, so we cannot determine which approach works best.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies do not cover all people, interventions, comparators or outcomes we were interested in, and there are not enough rigorous evaluations to be certain about the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, word‑count limit and factual accuracy, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader. 1) A 39‑word sentence in the \"Why is uncorrected refractive error a problem?\" paragraph is too long and packs multiple ideas, making it hard to follow. 2) The term \"spectacles\" is technical jargon that many patients may not recognise; \"glasses\" is the everyday word. 3) The statement \"We found no harmful effects.\" is vague – readers need to know whether harms were assessed and what was found. 4) The sentence \"We combined the findings into tables, figures and case studies and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\" is noun‑heavy and combines two actions, reducing readability. These issues exceed the 30‑word limit for sentences, use unexplained jargon, and create ambiguity, which are critical clarity concerns for a plain‑language summary. The metrics support these observations: the draft has a high noun count (192 > median) and a high number of complex words (255 > median), indicating noun‑heavy, complex phrasing. Reducing sentence length, simplifying vocabulary and clarifying statements will bring the summary in line with Cochrane plain‑language standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall (77.8% of features in best quartile), but three metrics deviate: nouns (192, above typical range), complex_words_dc (255, above typical), and long_words (173, above typical). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex/long words, supporting the need to simplify phrasing and reduce sentence length."
