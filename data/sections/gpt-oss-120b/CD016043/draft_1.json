  "draft": "What are the different ways to provide eye‑care services (eye exams and glasses) in community places and primary care clinics (local health centres)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- A range of ways to provide eye‑care services were identified: in community settings school‑based programmes (eye exams and glasses offered at schools), pharmacy‑based services (eye‑care provided through pharmacies), and outreach programmes (teams that travel to communities to deliver eye exams and glasses); in primary‑care settings vision centres (specialised eye‑care units within health facilities), health‑centre based services, and combined door‑to‑door approaches (services delivered directly to people's homes). No harmful effects were reported, but few studies actually evaluated how well these models work, so the benefits remain uncertain.\n- The choice of model varied by region – school‑based and outreach programmes were common in the African region, outreach was the main model in the Americas, and very few approaches were described for the Eastern Mediterranean region, highlighting gaps in knowledge about effective delivery in some areas.\n- Because most reports did not assess outcomes, further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness, quality, and any unintended consequences of these service‑delivery approaches, including their impact on access to eye exams and glasses in different settings.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is uncorrected refractive error a problem?\nMany people have trouble seeing clearly because the shape of their eyes does not focus light properly – this is called a refractive error (for example, nearsightedness or farsightedness). When these errors are not corrected with glasses or contact lenses, a person’s vision can be blurry, making everyday tasks such as reading, studying, working, or driving difficult or unsafe. Worldwide, uncorrected refractive error is one of the leading causes of vision loss, affecting millions of children and adults. The World Health Assembly set a goal for 2030: to increase the proportion of people who have effective, usable vision correction by 40 percentage points. Achieving this goal means that more people need easy, affordable access to eye‑care services that can test vision and provide the right spectacles, especially in community settings (places like schools, pharmacies, or local outreach programs) and primary‑care settings (local health centres or small vision clinics).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to map out all the different ways that refractive‑error services are being delivered outside of specialised eye hospitals. Specifically, they asked: (1) what types of community‑based models (such as school‑based programs, pharmacy‑based checks, or mobile outreach teams) and primary‑care models (like vision centres, health‑centre integrations, or door‑to‑door visits) are being used around the world? and (2) how have these models been evaluated to see if they work well? By answering these questions, the review will help the World Health Organization and its member countries choose and improve the most effective ways to bring vision testing and glasses to the people who need them.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies and reports on refractive and optical service delivery in community and primary‑care settings, combined their findings into tables, figures and case studies, and assessed the confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe scoping review identified 402 records that met the inclusion criteria. These comprised 175 primary studies from database and grey‑literature searches, 146 records from company reports and 81 records from organisational website searches. The studies covered a wide range of populations, including preschool‑ and school‑aged children and adults, but the abstract did not give details on age ranges, gender distribution, severity of refractive error, or total numbers of participants. Research was conducted across several WHO regions, especially the African region (school‑based and outreach models) and the Americas (outreach models), with limited data from the Eastern Mediterranean. Delivery approaches fell into community‑care models (school‑based, pharmacy, outreach) and primary‑care models (vision centres, health centres, combined or door‑to‑door strategies). Funding for the review was provided by the World Health Organization Vision and Eye Care Programme in partnership with the ATscale Global Partnership.\n\nMain results: Impact of delivery models on vision outcomes\nVery few of the identified studies actually evaluated whether the different service‑delivery models improved people’s vision or their access to spectacles. Because of this lack of rigorous evaluation, we do not know if school‑based, pharmacy, outreach, vision‑centre, health‑centre or door‑to‑door approaches make a difference to vision outcomes.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022 of search.",

Sections such as \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are presented as statements rather than questions, which violates the Master Style Guide. Additionally, the text contains several clarity and style problems that would hinder patient understanding: (1) excessive passive voice (29 instances, far above the typical range of 9‑23, as shown by the PLS evaluation), (2) noun‑heavy sentences and many complex/long words (e.g., 163 complex words, 253 long words, both well beyond typical PLS ranges), and (3) long sentences exceeding 30 words that bundle multiple ideas. These issues reduce readability despite the overall word count being within limits. The following targeted improvements are recommended: 1. Rewrite subheadings as questions (e.g., change \"Key messages\" to \"What are the main findings?\" etc.). 2. Convert passive constructions to active voice (e.g., \"No harmful effects were reported\" → \"We found no harmful effects\"). 3. Replace complex/long words with simpler alternatives (e.g., \"comprehensively describe\" → \"describe\"). 4. Split long sentences into shorter ones (aim for 15‑20 words per sentence). 5. Use dashes for bullet points and ensure blank lines between headings and paragraphs. These changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability for a lay audience.",

These indicate excessive noun‑heavy, complex language and passive constructions, which should be reduced to align with typical PLS patterns."
