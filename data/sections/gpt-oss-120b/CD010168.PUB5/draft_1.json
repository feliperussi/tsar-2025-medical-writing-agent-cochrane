  "draft": "Does using a drain (a tube that removes fluid) after surgery for severe (complicated) appendicitis lower the chance of an internal belly infection (intraperitoneal abscess)?\n\nKey messages\n- Current research does not provide clear evidence that placing a drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis reduces the chance of an intraperitoneal abscess (a pocket of infected fluid fluid inside the abdomen); the available studies are very uncertain and suggest the drain might be linked to a higher chance of mortality (death) and a longer hospital stay (time spent in the hospital).\n- No trials have compared different kinds of drains (for example, open drain – a tube left open to the outside – versus closed drain – a sealed tube) or examined the optimal timing for removing a drain, so we cannot determine whether any specific drain type or removal schedule is better.\n- Because the existing evidence is limited and of low quality, larger, well‑designed studies are needed to clarify whether drains affect infection risk, mortality, and length of hospital stay after complicated appendicitis surgery.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhat health problem does this review focus on?\nAppendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch attached to the large intestine. When the inflammation is severe – the appendix is gangrenous (dead tissue) or has burst (perforated) – doctors call it complicated appendicitis. People with this form of the disease are at higher risk of serious complications after the appendix is surgically removed (an operation called an appendectomy). One of the most feared complications is an intraperitoneal abscess, which is a pocket of pus that forms inside the abdominal cavity and can cause fever, pain, and even life‑threatening infection. To try to prevent this, surgeons sometimes place an abdominal drain – a thin tube that lets fluid and blood escape from the surgical site. However, it is unclear whether using a drain actually reduces the chance of an abscess or whether it might cause other problems such as wound infection, longer hospital stays, or even higher mortality. The question is especially relevant because appendectomies can be performed through a large incision (open surgery) or through small keyhole incisions (laparoscopic surgery), and the benefits of drainage might differ between these approaches.\nWhat did the researchers aim to find out?\nThe review authors set out to answer three main questions: (1) Does placing an abdominal drain after an open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis lower the risk of developing an intraperitoneal abscess? (2) If drains are helpful, are there differences in outcomes between open drains (tubes that remain open to the outside) and closed drains (tubes that are sealed and collect fluid internally)? and (3) What is the best timing for removing the drain – early or later – to maximise benefits and minimise harms? By comparing studies that randomised patients to receive a drain or not, or to receive different types or schedules of drainage, the authors hoped to determine whether drainage improves recovery or, conversely, adds risk.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared abdominal drainage with no drainage, or different drain types or removal schedules after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. We combined their results in meta‑analyses where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nThe review examined eight studies – five randomised controlled trials and three quasi‑randomised trials – that together enrolled 739 participants (370 received an abdominal drain after appendectomy and 369 did not). The participants were children and adults with perforated appendicitis, most of whom had peritonitis, and all received postoperative antibiotics after open or laparoscopic surgery. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia and Africa and were published between 1973 and 2023.\nMain results: Mortality\nWe are very uncertain about most outcomes, but the available evidence suggests that using an abdominal drain probably increases the risk‑of‑death within 30 days after surgery. Evidence for other outcomes – such as abdominal abscess, wound infection, overall complications and length of hospital stay – is very uncertain and does not show clear differences between using a drain and not using one.\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people/used different ways of delivering intervention, and studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the required subheadings are not phrased as questions. All main headings (Key messages, Introduction/Aims, Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency) should be rewritten as interrogative headings (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\", \"What did the researchers aim to find out?\", \"How did we search for studies?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"). Additionally, several clarity issues would confuse readers:\n1. **Long, complex sentence** – \"Current research does not provide clear evidence that placing a drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis reduces the chance of an intraperitoneal abscess (a pocket of infected fluid fluid inside the abdomen); the available studies are very uncertain and suggest the drain might be linked to a higher chance of mortality (death) and a longer hospital stay (time spent in the hospital).\" This sentence exceeds 30 words and mixes several ideas. *Rewrite*: \"Current research does not show that a drain reduces the chance of an intraperitoneal abscess. The studies are very uncertain and suggest the drain may increase the risk of death and lengthen hospital stay.\"\n2. **Unexplained jargon** – the term “intraperitoneal abscess” is only defined once and then repeated without reminder. Readers may forget the meaning. *Rewrite*: \"intraperitoneal abscess (a pocket of pus inside the abdomen)\" each time it first appears, then use the simpler phrase \"abscess\" thereafter.\n3. **Passive voice** – \"The review examined eight studies …\" hides who performed the action. *Rewrite*: \"We examined eight studies …\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy bullet** – \"No trials have compared different kinds of drains (for example, open drain – a tube left open to the outside – versus closed drain – a sealed tube) or examined the optimal timing for removing a drain, so we cannot determine whether any specific drain type or removal schedule is better.\" This sentence is long and noun‑dense. *Rewrite*: \"No trials have compared different drain types (open vs. closed) or the best time to remove a drain. Therefore, we cannot say which type or timing is best.\"\nThese changes will improve readability and bring the draft in line with the Master Style Guide. The metrics support these suggestions: the draft has a high words‑per‑sentence score (27.3, P90) and many complex/long words (e.g., 175 complex words, 244 long words), indicating the need to shorten sentences and simplify vocabulary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several readability metrics: words_per_sentence (27.3, P90), nouns (208, BEYOND_P90), and multiple complexity indices (FKGL 15.5, GFI 20.1, SMOG 16.1, etc.) are all higher than the median ranges, indicating the text is harder to read than most PLSs. Reducing sentence length, simplifying vocabulary, and using more active voice will bring the draft closer to typical PLS readability levels."
