  "draft": "Does using a drain (a tube that removes fluid) after surgery for severe (complicated) appendicitis lower the chance of an internal belly infection (intraperitoneal abscess)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Current research does not show that a drain reduces the chance of an intraperitoneal abscess. The studies are very uncertain and suggest the drain may increase the risk of death and lengthen hospital stay.\n- No trials have compared different drain types (open vs closed) or the best time to remove a drain, so we cannot say which type or timing is best.\n- Because the evidence is limited and of low quality, larger well‑designed studies are needed to clarify the effects of drains on infection risk, mortality, and length of stay.\n\nWhat health problem does this review focus on?\nAppendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch attached to the large intestine. When the appendix is gangrenous (dead tissue) or has burst (perforated), doctors call it complicated appendicitis. People with this condition are at higher risk of serious complications after the appendix is removed (appendectomy). One feared complication is an intraperitoneal abscess (a pocket of pus inside the abdomen) that can cause fever, pain, and life‑threatening infection. Surgeons sometimes place an abdominal drain – a thin tube that lets fluid and blood escape from the surgical site – to try to prevent this, but it is unclear whether drainage helps or causes other problems such as wound infection, longer hospital stays, or higher mortality.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to find out?\nWe set out to answer three questions: (1) Does placing an abdominal drain after an open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis lower the risk of developing an intraperitoneal abscess? (2) If drains are helpful, are there differences in outcomes between open drains (tubes that remain open to the outside) and closed drains (sealed tubes that collect fluid internally)? (3) What is the best timing for removing the drain – early or later – to maximise benefits and minimise harms?\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe searched several databases, trial registers, reference lists, and contacted study authors to find randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared drainage with no drainage, different drain types, or different removal schedules after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. We combined results in meta‑analyses where possible and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined eight studies – five randomised controlled trials and three quasi‑randomised trials – that together enrolled 739 participants (370 received a drain and 369 did not). Participants were children and adults with perforated appendicitis, most had peritonitis, and all received postoperative antibiotics after open or laparoscopic surgery. The evidence is very uncertain about most outcomes. It suggests that using a drain probably increases 30‑day mortality (moderate‑certainty evidence). For other outcomes such as abscess, wound infection, overall complications, and length of hospital stay, the evidence is very low certainty and shows no clear differences between drain and no‑drain groups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants and clinicians often knew which treatment was given, the studies were small, and they varied in how they delivered the intervention and reported outcomes. Not all studies provided data for every outcome we wanted.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the structural and factual checks, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader. 1) **Unexplained jargon** – the term “quasi‑randomised” appears in the Methods and Results without any definition, leaving readers unsure what it means. 2) **Unclear certainty language** – phrases such as “very uncertain” and “moderate‑certainty evidence” are technical and can be interpreted inconsistently; patients need a simpler explanation of how confident we are in the findings. 3) **Noun‑heavy, passive‑style sentence** – “The evidence is very uncertain about most outcomes.” reads passively and uses abstract nouns, making the sentence harder to process. 4) **Complex wording** – the draft contains many long, multi‑syllable words (e.g., “quasi‑randomised”, “intraperitoneal”, “moderate‑certainty”), contributing to a high SMOG index (14.2) and many complex words (134) and long words (171), which are above typical PLS ranges. 5) **Potentially confusing sentence length** – the sentence “We examined eight studies – five randomised controlled trials and three quasi‑randomised trials – that together enrolled 739 participants (370 received a drain and 369 did not).” is close to 30 words and could be split for easier reading.\n\n**Suggested rewrites**:\n- Original: “We searched several databases, trial registers, reference lists, and contacted study authors to find randomised or quasi‑randomised trials …”\n  Rewrite: “We searched several databases, trial registers, reference lists, and contacted study authors to find randomised trials or trials that used a simple method of assigning participants to groups (called quasi‑randomised trials) …”\n- Original: “The evidence is very uncertain about most outcomes.”\n  Rewrite: “We are not sure about most outcomes because the studies were small and varied.”\n- Original: “It suggests that using a drain probably increases 30‑day mortality (moderate‑certainty evidence).”\n  Rewrite: “The best available evidence shows that using a drain may increase the chance of death within 30 days, and we have a moderate level of confidence in this finding.”\n- Original: “We examined eight studies – five randomised controlled trials and three quasi‑randomised trials – that together enrolled 739 participants (370 received a drain and 369 did not).”\n  Rewrite: “We looked at eight studies – five randomised trials and three quasi‑randomised trials – that together included 739 participants. Of these, 370 received a drain and 369 did not.”\n\nThese changes address the jargon, simplify certainty language, reduce noun‑heavy phrasing, and lower the overall lexical complexity, bringing the draft closer to typical PLS readability metrics.\n\n**Metrics support**: The evaluation shows unusually high noun count (164, P90), SMOG index (14.2, P90), complex words (134, P90) and long words (171, P90). Reducing noun density and replacing long, technical terms with simpler alternatives will improve readability and align the draft with the median ranges for these metrics.",

Reducing noun density and simplifying terminology would improve readability."
