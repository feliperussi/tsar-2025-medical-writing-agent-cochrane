  "plain_title": "Does using a drain (a tube that removes fluid) after surgery for severe (complicated) appendicitis lower the chance of an internal belly infection (intraperitoneal abscess)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Current research does not provide clear evidence that placing a drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis reduces the chance of an intraperitoneal abscess (a pocket of infected fluid fluid inside the abdomen); the available studies are very uncertain and suggest the drain might be linked to a higher chance of mortality (death) and a longer hospital stay (time spent in the hospital).",
    "No trials have compared different kinds of drains (for example, open drain – a tube left open to the outside – versus closed drain – a sealed tube) or examined the optimal timing for removing a drain, so we cannot determine whether any specific drain type or removal schedule is better.",
    "Because the existing evidence is limited and of low quality, larger, well‑designed studies are needed to clarify whether drains affect infection risk, mortality, and length of hospital stay after complicated appendicitis surgery."

      "content": "Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch attached to the large intestine. When the inflammation is severe – the appendix is gangrenous (dead tissue) or has burst (perforated) – doctors call it complicated appendicitis. People with this form of the disease are at higher risk of serious complications after the appendix is surgically removed (an operation called an appendectomy). One of the most feared complications is an intraperitoneal abscess, which is a pocket of pus that forms inside the abdominal cavity and can cause fever, pain, and even life‑threatening infection. To try to prevent this, surgeons sometimes place an abdominal drain – a thin tube that lets fluid and blood escape from the surgical site. However, it is unclear whether using a drain actually reduces the chance of an abscess or whether it might cause other problems such as wound infection, longer hospital stays, or even higher mortality. The question is especially relevant because appendectomies can be performed through a large incision (open surgery) or through small keyhole incisions (laparoscopic surgery), and the benefits of drainage might differ between these approaches."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors set out to answer three main questions: (1) Does placing an abdominal drain after an open or laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis lower the risk of developing an intraperitoneal abscess? (2) If drains are helpful, are there differences in outcomes between open drains (tubes that remain open to the outside) and closed drains (tubes that are sealed and collect fluid internally)? and (3) What is the best timing for removing the drain – early or later – to maximise benefits and minimise harms? By comparing studies that randomised patients to receive a drain or not, or to receive different types or schedules of drainage, the authors hoped to determine whether drainage improves recovery or, conversely, adds risk."

      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared abdominal drainage with no drainage, or different drain types or removal schedules after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. We combined their results in meta‑analyses where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review examined eight studies – five randomised controlled trials and three quasi‑randomised trials – that together enrolled 739 participants (370 received an abdominal drain after appendectomy and 369 did not). The participants were children and adults with perforated appendicitis, most of whom had peritonitis, and all received postoperative antibiotics after open or laparoscopic surgery. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia and Africa and were published between 1973 and 2023."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Mortality",
      "content": "We are very uncertain about most outcomes, but the available evidence suggests that using an abdominal drain probably increases the risk‑of‑death within 30 days after surgery. Evidence for other outcomes – such as abdominal abscess, wound infection, overall complications and length of hospital stay – is very uncertain and does not show clear differences between using a drain and not using one."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people/used different ways of delivering intervention, and studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023 of search."
