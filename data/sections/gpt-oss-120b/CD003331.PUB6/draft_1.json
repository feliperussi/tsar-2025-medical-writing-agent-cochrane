  "draft": "Does an exercise program for heart failure patients (exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation) reduce hospital admissions and improve quality of life?\n\nKey messages\n- Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised exercise programme for people with heart failure) does not seem to change overall death rates, but it likely reduces the chance of being hospitalised and improves health‑related quality of life (how health affects daily life); no harmful effects were reported in the studies.\n- The benefits appear similar whether the programme is delivered in a centre, at home, or using digital support, and whether it includes only aerobic exercise or a mix of aerobic and resistance training.\n- More research is needed, especially involving women, older adults, and people with heart failure that has preserved pumping function, and studies with longer follow‑up are required to understand the long‑term effects of these exercise programmes.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart cannot pump blood as well as it should. This leads to symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness, and a swelling of the legs. People with heart failure often have a lower ability to exercise, a poorer health‑related quality of life (HRQoL), a higher chance of dying, and they are more likely to be admitted to hospital. All of this creates a heavy burden for patients, families and health‑care systems.\n\nWhat is exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation and how is it usually delivered?\nExercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) is a programme that uses supervised physical activity – sometimes together with education or other support – to help people with heart problems become more active and improve their health. Traditionally these programmes have been run in hospitals or specialised centres, but newer studies also test home‑based or digitally‑supported versions. The programmes can include only aerobic (cardio) exercise, or a mix of aerobic and resistance (strength) training, and they may be offered alone or as part of a broader cardiac rehabilitation service.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether taking part in exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation changes the chances of dying (all‑cause mortality), reduces the number of hospital admissions (overall and specifically for heart failure), and improves health‑related quality of life for adults with heart failure. They also examined whether the effects differ for the two main types of heart failure – reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, where the heart’s pumping ability is below 45%) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, where pumping ability is 45% or higher) – and whether the setting of the programme (centre‑based versus home‑based) matters.\n\nMethods\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for trials (studies that randomly assign participants to exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation or usual care) involving adults with heart failure, combined their results to assess effects on mortality, hospital admission, and health‑related quality of life, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 60 randomised controlled trials that together included 8,728 adults with heart failure. All the studies followed participants for at least six months (the typical follow‑up was six months). The people studied were men and women aged 18 years or older with either reduced‑ejection‑fraction (HFrEF) or preserved‑ejection‑fraction (HFpEF) heart failure; most had HFrEF and were in New York Heart Association class II–III. The trials tested exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation programmes – either centre‑based or home‑based, and either aerobic‑only or a mix of aerobic and resistance training – compared with usual medical care that did not include exercise. Some studies also used active comparators such as education, psychological support, or additional medical management.\n\nMain results: Hospital admissions and quality of life\nExercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the chance of being admitted to hospital. For every 100 people taking part in such programmes, about eight fewer are admitted compared with usual care, and it probably also slightly reduces heart‑failure‑related hospital admissions. The programmes probably improve health‑related quality of life, although the effect on overall quality of life measured with other questionnaires is unclear. Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation may make little to no difference to overall death rates.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies gave data on everything we wanted, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we are interested in.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions. Several headings (e.g., \"Main results: Hospital admissions and quality of life\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\") are statements rather than questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the draft contains a high amount of passive voice (42 instances, far beyond the typical PLS range) and many long, noun‑heavy sentences that reduce readability. These issues, together with excessive nominalisations and complex vocabulary, make the text harder for patients to follow.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Main results: Hospital admissions and quality of life\". Problem: Not a question, violating the guide. Rewrite: \"What are the main results for hospital admissions and quality of life?\". Apply the same change to \"Limitations\" → \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and \"Currency\" → \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n2. **Passive voice** – Quote: \"The draft contains sentences such as \"The people studied were men and women aged 18 years or older…\". Problem: Passive construction hides who performed the action, making it harder to read. Rewrite: \"We studied men and women aged 18 years or older…\".\n3. **Long sentence** – Quote: \"For every 100 people taking part in such programmes, about eight fewer are admitted compared with usual care, and it probably also slightly reduces heart‑failure‑related hospital admissions, and the programmes probably improve health‑related quality of life, although the effect on overall quality of life measured with other questionnaires is unclear.\" Problem: Over 30 words, multiple ideas jammed together. Rewrite into shorter sentences: \"For every 100 people who take part, about eight fewer are admitted to hospital compared with usual care. The programmes also probably reduce heart‑failure‑related admissions a little. They probably improve health‑related quality of life, although the effect on overall quality of life measured with other questionnaires is unclear.\"\n4. **Nominalisation / noun‑heavy phrasing** – Quote: \"The evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we are interested in.\" Problem: Abstract noun phrase makes the sentence dense. Rewrite: \"We do not have evidence for all people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we are interested in.\"\n5. **Complex vocabulary** – Quote: \"participation in ExCR likely reduced the risk of all‑cause hospital admissions\". Problem: Terms like \"ExCR\" and \"all‑cause\" may be unfamiliar. Rewrite: \"Taking part in the exercise programme likely reduced the chance of any hospital admission\".\n\nMetrics support these edits: passive‑voice count is 42 (BEYOND_P90), nominalisations 36 (BEYOND_P90), nouns 230 (BEYOND_P90), and complex‑word counts far exceed typical ranges, confirming the draft is unusually dense and difficult for a lay audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits but deviates strongly from typical PLS patterns: 42 passive constructions, 36 nominalisations, 230 nouns, and high complexity scores (e.g., SMOG 15.3, Gunning Fog 20.2). Words per sentence average 26.6, exceeding the median range. These metric outliers align with the identified clarity and style issues."
