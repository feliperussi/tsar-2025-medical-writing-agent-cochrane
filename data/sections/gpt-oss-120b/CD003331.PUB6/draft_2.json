  "draft": "Does an exercise program for heart failure patients (exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation) reduce hospital admissions and improve quality of life?\n\nKey messages\n- Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised exercise programme for people with heart failure) does not change overall death rates, but it likely reduces the chance of being hospitalised and improves health‑related quality of life (how health affects daily life); no harmful effects were reported.\n- The benefits are similar whether the programme is delivered in a centre, at home, or with digital support, and whether it includes only aerobic (cardio) exercise or a mix of aerobic and resistance (strength) training.\n- More research is needed that includes women, older adults, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and that follows participants for longer periods.\n\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart cannot pump blood as well as it should. This leads to shortness of breath, tiredness, and swelling in the legs. People with heart failure often have reduced ability to exercise, poorer health‑related quality of life (HRQoL), a higher chance of dying, and a higher risk of hospital admission. All of these effects create a heavy burden for patients, families, and health‑care systems.\n\nWhat is exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation and how is it usually delivered?\nExercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) is a programme that uses supervised physical activity – sometimes together with education or other support – to help people with heart problems become more active and improve their health. Traditionally these programmes have been run in hospitals or specialised centres, but newer studies also test home‑based or digitally‑supported versions. The programmes can include only aerobic (cardio) exercise, or a mix of aerobic and resistance (strength) training, and they may be offered alone or as part of a broader cardiac rehabilitation service.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether taking part in exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation changes the chances of dying (all‑cause mortality), reduces the number of hospital admissions (overall and specifically for heart failure), and improves health‑related quality of life for adults with heart failure. We also examined whether the effects differ for the two main types of heart failure – reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, where the heart’s pumping ability is below 45%) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, where pumping ability is 45% or higher) – and whether the setting of the programme (centre‑based versus home‑based) matters.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched six databases for randomised controlled trials that compared exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation with usual care in adults with heart failure. We included trials that followed participants for at least six months. We combined the results to assess effects on mortality, hospital admission, and HRQoL, and we rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 60 trials that together enrolled 8,728 adults with heart failure. All trials followed participants for a median of six months. We studied men and women aged 18 years or older with either HFrEF or HFpEF; most participants had HFrEF and were in New York Heart Association class II–III. The trials tested centre‑based or home‑based programmes, and aerobic‑only or mixed aerobic‑resistance programmes, compared with usual medical care that did not include exercise. Some studies also used active comparators such as education, psychological support, or additional medical management.\n\nWhat are the main results for hospital admissions and quality of life?\nExercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the chance of any hospital admission. For every 100 people who take part, about eight fewer are admitted compared with usual care. The programmes also probably reduce heart‑failure‑related admissions a little. They probably improve health‑related quality of life, although the effect on overall quality of life measured with other questionnaires remains unclear. The programmes may make little or no difference to overall death rates.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, and we do not have evidence for all people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence searched up to December 2021.\n",

Minor clarity and style tweaks would improve readability for patients:\n1. Reduce noun‑heavy phrasing – after the first definition, replace repeated “exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation” with the simpler “exercise programme”.\n   Example: “Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the chance of any hospital admission.” → “The exercise programme probably reduces the chance of being admitted to hospital.”\n2. Replace vague wording – avoid “a little”.\n   Example: “The programmes also probably reduce heart‑failure‑related admissions a little.” → “The programmes also probably reduce heart‑failure‑related admissions by a small amount.”\n3. Cut passive constructions – use active voice where possible.\n   Example: “All trials followed participants for a median of six months.” → “We followed participants for a median of six months in all trials.”\n4. Simplify complex words – swap long technical terms for everyday language.\n   Example: “We searched six databases for randomised controlled trials…” → “We searched six databases for randomised trials…”\n5. Add brief clarification for abbreviations: remind readers that HRQoL stands for health‑related quality of life when first used in the results section.\nThese edits address the high passive‑voice count, nominalisations, noun density, and complex‑word metrics highlighted in the PLS evaluation, bringing the text closer to typical Cochrane PLS patterns while preserving all factual content.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is within the 850‑word limit (726 words) and scores around the median for most readability indices (e.g., Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 48, FKGL 12). However, several metrics deviate strongly: passive voice (37 instances, beyond the 90th percentile), nominalisations (31, beyond P90), noun count (222, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.2, beyond P90), and high counts of complex, long, and Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words. These suggest the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than typical PLS, supporting the recommended reductions in passive constructions, nominalisations, and complex wording."
