  "draft": "How accurate are toe‑brachial index (a pressure ratio measured at the toe) and toe systolic blood pressure (blood pressure measured at the toe) for detecting peripheral arterial disease (poor blood flow in the leg arteries)?\n\nKey messages\n- We do not have reliable evidence to say how well the toe‑brachial index (a pressure ratio between the toe and the arm) or toe systolic blood pressure (the pressure measured at the toe) identify peripheral arterial disease; the few studies we found were low quality and reported no harms.\n- Both tests are used widely in clinical practice, but because the research is of low quality, we cannot be sure they correctly detect the disease.\n- Future research should use well‑designed studies, test different cut‑off values, and include diverse patient groups to determine the accuracy of these toe‑based measurements.\n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?\nPAD is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked by a build‑up of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis). This reduces blood flow and can cause pain when walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, or even amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. An estimated 236 million people worldwide have PAD, and it is more common in older adults, smokers, people with high blood pressure, diabetes, or other heart problems. Finding PAD early helps prevent serious complications.\n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?\nBoth TBI and TSBP are simple, non‑invasive bedside tests that measure blood pressure in a toe.\n- **Toe‑brachial index (TBI)** compares the pressure in a toe with the pressure in an arm (brachial artery). A low ratio suggests reduced blood flow in the leg.\n- **Toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP)** records the actual pressure reading in the toe.\nThese tests are useful because the small arteries in the toe are less likely to become hardened with calcium. This makes them more reliable than ankle measurements, especially for people with diabetes or kidney disease. Clinicians often use them to decide whether further imaging or treatment is needed, but we need solid evidence about how well they actually detect PAD.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how accurate TBI and TSBP are for diagnosing lower‑leg PAD. Specifically, we aimed to (1) estimate each test’s accuracy at different cut‑off values in people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the performance of TBI versus TSBP. We also planned to explore whether factors such as patient type, equipment used, positivity threshold, or the reference imaging test affected the results.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched major medical databases up to 27 February 2024 for studies that compared TBI or TSBP with a validated imaging reference for PAD. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality using standard tools.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 18 studies. Researchers measured TBI in 1,927 adults (2,550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 adults (701 limbs). Some studies looked at both tests. All participants were 18 years or older and included people with and without symptoms, who were at risk because of diabetes, kidney disease, or other factors. Researchers conducted the studies in several countries and settings, but they did not report where the funding came from.\nThe toe tests were compared with imaging scans that show blood flow, most often a special type of ultrasound called colour‑duplex ultrasound, and sometimes CT scans (a detailed X‑ray) or regular X‑ray angiography. The studies did not report participants’ age distribution, gender balance, or disease severity. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain. We cannot say if the toe‑brachial index or toe systolic blood pressure reliably detect PAD, and the few studies give no clear answers about how useful these tests are.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because some studies may have let participants or researchers know which test was being performed, and many studies did not provide all the data we needed.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched studies up to 27 February 2024, so the evidence reflects research published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural checklist (title, subheadings as questions, all required sections, factual accuracy and word‑count), but three major clarity problems would likely confuse a patient reader:\n1. **Overly long, compound sentences** – e.g., the first key‑message bullet combines several ideas in one sentence, making it hard to follow.\n2. **Excessive passive voice** – many sentences start with \"The toe tests were compared…\" or \"The evidence is very uncertain…\" which hides who did the action and reduces immediacy.\n3. **Jargon without brief explanation** – terms such as \"colour‑duplex ultrasound\", \"CT scans\" and \"cut‑off values\" appear without a simple definition, leaving non‑expert readers unsure of their meaning.\nThese issues are reflected in the metrics (20 passive constructions – P90; 209 nouns – beyond P90; high complex‑word counts). The draft should be revised to use shorter active voice sentences, replace noun‑heavy phrasing with verbs, and add brief lay explanations for technical terms.\n\n**Top improvements needed:**\n- **Key‑message bullet 1** – \"We do not have reliable evidence to say how well the toe‑brachial index (a pressure ratio between the toe and the arm) or toe systolic blood pressure (the pressure measured at the toe) identify peripheral arterial disease; the few studies we found were low quality and reported no harms.\"\n  *Problem*: One long sentence with a semicolon, redundant explanations, and passive tone.\n  *Rewrite*: \"We do not have reliable evidence about how well the toe‑brachial index (the pressure ratio of toe to arm) or toe systolic blood pressure (the pressure measured at the toe) detect peripheral arterial disease. The few studies we found were low quality and did not report any harms.\"\n\n- **Methods sentence** – \"The toe tests were compared with imaging scans that show blood flow, most often a special type of ultrasound called colour‑duplex ultrasound, and sometimes CT scans (a detailed X‑ray) or regular X‑ray angiography.\"\n  *Problem*: Passive voice and a very long clause.\n  *Rewrite*: \"We compared the toe tests with imaging scans that show blood flow. Most studies used colour‑duplex ultrasound (a special type of ultrasound), while some used CT scans (detailed X‑rays) or conventional angiography.\"\n\n- **Results paragraph** – \"Overall, the evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether toe‑brachial index or toe systolic blood pressure can reliably identify peripheral arterial disease, and the few studies give no clear answers about the usefulness of these tests for diagnosis.\"\n  *Problem*: Noun‑heavy, long sentence, and vague phrase \"very uncertain\".\n  *Rewrite*: \"Overall, the evidence is uncertain. We cannot tell if the toe‑brachial index or toe systolic blood pressure reliably detect peripheral arterial disease, and the few studies do not provide clear answers about how useful these tests are.\"\n\n- **Jargon clarification** – The term \"cut‑off values\" appears without explanation.\n  *Problem*: Readers may not understand what a cut‑off value means.\n  *Rewrite*: \"cut‑off values (the pressure level we decide indicates a positive test)\"\n\n- **Technical term definition** – \"colour‑duplex ultrasound\" is mentioned without lay description.\n  *Problem*: May be unfamiliar to patients.\n  *Rewrite*: \"colour‑duplex ultrasound (an imaging test that uses sound waves to show blood flow in the arteries)\"\n\nAddressing these points will bring the draft in line with the Master Style Guide and improve readability for a lay audience.",
