  "key_messages": [
    "The review found that we do not have reliable evidence to say how well the toe‑brachial index (a pressure ratio measured at the toe compared with the arm) or toe systolic blood pressure (the blood pressure measured at the toe) identify peripheral arterial disease (poor blood flow in the leg arteries); the few available studies were of limited quality, so we cannot draw a clear conclusion about any benefit and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "Both toe‑brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure are used widely in clinical practice, but because the existing research is of low methodological quality, their overall ability to correctly detect disease remains uncertain.",
    "Future research should include well‑designed studies with clear reporting, using the tests at different cut‑off values (thresholds used to decide a positive result) and in various patient groups, to determine how accurate these toe‑based measurements are for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease."

      "subheading": "Why is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?",
      "content": "Peripheral arterial disease is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked by a build‑up of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis). This reduces blood flow, causing pain when walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, and sometimes the need for amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. Because it affects an estimated 236 million people worldwide and is more common in older adults, smokers, people with high blood pressure, diabetes, or other heart problems, finding it early is crucial for preventing serious complications."

      "subheading": "What are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?",
      "content": "Both TBI and TSBP are simple, non‑invasive bedside tests that measure blood pressure in a toe. \n- **Toe‑brachial index (TBI)** compares the pressure in a toe with the pressure in an arm (brachial artery). A low ratio suggests reduced blood flow in the leg. \n- **Toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP)** records the actual pressure reading in the toe. \nThese tests are useful because the small arteries in the toes are less likely to be affected by the calcification that can make ankle‑based measurements inaccurate, especially in people with diabetes or kidney disease. Clinicians often use them to decide whether further imaging or treatment is needed, but we need solid evidence about how well they actually detect PAD."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to determine how accurate TBI and TSBP are for diagnosing lower‑leg PAD. Specifically, they aimed to (1) estimate the test accuracy of each method at different cut‑off values in people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the performance of TBI versus TSBP. They also planned to explore whether factors such as the type of patient (e.g., diabetes, kidney disease, general population), the equipment used, the positivity threshold, or the reference imaging test affected the results."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 18 diagnostic accuracy studies that together evaluated toe‑brachial index (TBI) in 1,927 adults (2,550 limbs) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) in 701 adults (701 limbs); some studies looked at both tests. All participants were aged 18 years or older and included both people with symptoms and those without, who were at risk for peripheral arterial disease because of conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, or simply being part of the general population. The studies were carried out in various, unspecified countries and settings, and the funding sources were not reported. The index tests (TBI and/or TSBP) were compared with a range of vascular imaging reference standards, most often colour‑duplex ultrasound, but also computed tomography angiography, multi‑detector row tomography, conventional angiography, or combinations of these. No information was given about participants’ age distribution, gender balance, or disease severity. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether toe‑brachial index or toe systolic blood pressure can reliably identify peripheral arterial disease, and the few studies that exist do not provide clear answers about the usefulness of these tests for diagnosis."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search."
