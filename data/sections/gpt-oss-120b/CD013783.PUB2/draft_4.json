  "draft": "How accurate are toe‑brachial index (a pressure ratio measured at the toe) and toe systolic blood pressure (blood pressure measured at the toe) for detecting peripheral arterial disease (poor blood flow in the leg arteries)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found very limited, low‑quality evidence about how well toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) identify peripheral arterial disease (PAD), so we cannot say the tests are reliable.\n- Both TBI and TSBP are used widely in clinical practice, but the existing research does not tell us how accurately they detect PAD.\n- Future well‑designed studies should test different cut‑off values and include diverse patient groups to determine the true accuracy of these toe‑based measurements.\n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?\nPAD is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked by a build‑up of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis). This reduces blood flow and can cause pain when walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, or even amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. It affects an estimated 236 million people worldwide and is more common in older adults, smokers, people with high blood pressure, diabetes, or other heart problems. Finding PAD early helps prevent serious complications.\n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?\nBoth TBI and TSBP are simple, non‑invasive bedside tests that measure blood pressure in a toe.\n- TBI compares the pressure in a toe with the pressure in an arm (brachial artery). A low ratio suggests reduced blood flow in the leg.\n- TSBP records the actual pressure reading in the toe.\nThese tests are useful because the small arteries in the toes are less likely to be hardened by calcium (calcification), which can make ankle‑based measurements inaccurate, especially in people with diabetes or kidney disease. Clinicians often use them to decide whether further imaging or treatment is needed.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how accurate TBI and TSBP are for diagnosing lower‑leg PAD. Specifically, we aimed to (1) estimate each test’s accuracy at different cut‑off values in people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the performance of TBI versus TSBP. We also planned to explore whether factors such as patient type (e.g., diabetes, kidney disease, general population), equipment used, positivity threshold, or reference imaging test affected the results.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched several databases up to 27 February 2024 for studies that compared TBI or TSBP with a validated imaging reference for PAD. We combined the accuracy results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard quality‑assessment tools.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 18 studies that tested how well the toe tests detect PAD. Together they evaluated TBI in 1,927 adults (2,550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 adults (701 limbs); some studies looked at both tests. All participants were 18 years or older and included both symptomatic and asymptomatic people at risk for PAD because of diabetes, kidney disease, or general risk factors. The studies were carried out in various, unspecified countries and settings, and we did not report funding sources. We compared the index tests with several imaging reference standards, most often colour‑duplex ultrasound (CDU) (an ultrasound that shows blood flow), and also computed tomography angiography (CTA) (a CT scan that visualises blood vessels), multi‑detector row tomography (MDCT) (a detailed CT scan), conventional angiography (an X‑ray test that visualises arteries), or combinations of these. The reports did not give details on participants’ age distribution, gender balance, or disease severity. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether TBI or TSBP can reliably identify PAD, and the few studies that exist do not provide clear answers about the usefulness of these tests for diagnosis.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because some studies may have let participants or investigators know which test was being performed, and not all studies provided data on every outcome we wanted. The methodological quality of the studies was generally low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched studies up to 27 February 2024, so the evidence reflects research published up to that date.",

They included people with symptoms and people without symptoms who were at risk of PAD due to diabetes, kidney disease, or other common risk factors.\"\n2. **Technical jargon without plain‑language explanation** – terms like \"colour‑duplex ultrasound (CDU)\", \"computed tomography angiography (CTA)\", \"multi‑detector row tomography (MDCT)\" and \"angiography\" appear without a simple description. Patients may not know what these tests are. *Rewrite:* \"Most studies used colour‑duplex ultrasound, a special ultrasound that shows how blood moves through the vessels. Some used CT‑angiography (a detailed CT scan of the arteries) or conventional angiography (an X‑ray test that visualises the arteries).\"\n3. **Heavy use of parentheses and bracketed definitions** – the title and many sentences embed definitions in parentheses, creating a choppy reading experience. *Rewrite the title:* \"How accurate are toe‑brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for detecting peripheral arterial disease?\" Then introduce the terms early: \"Toe‑brachial index (TBI) is the pressure ratio between a toe and the arm; toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) is the pressure measured directly at the toe.\"\n4. **Nominalisations and abstract nouns** – the draft frequently turns actions into nouns (e.g., \"the evidence is very uncertain\", \"the methodological quality of the studies was generally low\"). This adds to the high noun count (208, beyond P90) and reduces readability. *Rewrite:* \"We are not sure about the evidence because some studies may have let participants or investigators know which test was being performed, and many studies did not report all the data we wanted.\"\n5. **Long sentence describing why toe tests are useful** – \"These tests are useful because the small arteries in the toes are less likely to be affected by the calcification that can make ankle‑based measurements inaccurate, especially in people with diabetes or kidney disease.\" This sentence is 31 words and dense. *Rewrite:* \"Toe tests are helpful because the tiny arteries in the toes rarely become hardened with calcium. This makes them more reliable than ankle measurements, especially for people with diabetes or kidney disease.\"\n\nThese changes address the most impactful readability issues and bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns (e.g., reducing nominalisations from 22 to <13, nouns from 208 to <116, complex words from 149 to <84, and the SMOG index from 14.4 to <12.1).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit (738 words) but deviates on several linguistic fronts: nominalisations (22, beyond P90), noun count (208, beyond P90), complex words (149, beyond P90), long words (218, beyond P90), and SMOG index (14.4, beyond P90). Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 54.5, Grade 10.9) but the high noun and complex‑word counts indicate the text is still too dense for a lay audience. Reducing these metrics as suggested will improve conformity with typical PLS patterns."
