  "draft": "How accurate are toe‑brachial index (a pressure ratio measured at the toe) and toe systolic blood pressure (blood pressure measured at the toe) for detecting peripheral arterial disease (poor blood flow in the leg arteries)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found only a few low‑quality studies, so we cannot say how well the toe‑brachial index (TBI) or toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) identify peripheral arterial disease (PAD); no harmful effects were reported.\n- Both tests are used widely in clinical practice, but because the existing research is of low methodological quality, we cannot be sure they correctly detect PAD.\n- Future research should use well‑designed studies, test different cut‑off values, and include diverse patient groups to determine the accuracy of TBI and TSBP.\n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?\nPAD is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked by a build‑up of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis). This reduces blood flow and can cause pain when walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, or even amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. An estimated 236 million people worldwide have PAD, and it is more common in older adults, smokers, people with high blood pressure, diabetes, or other heart problems. Finding PAD early helps prevent serious complications.\n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?\nBoth TBI and TSBP are simple, non‑invasive bedside tests that measure blood pressure in a toe.\n- TBI compares the pressure in a toe with the pressure in an arm (brachial artery). A low ratio suggests reduced blood flow in the leg.\n- TSBP records the actual pressure reading in the toe.\nThese tests are useful because the tiny arteries in the toes are less likely to become hardened with calcium, which can make ankle‑based measurements inaccurate, especially in people with diabetes or kidney disease. Clinicians often use them to decide whether further imaging or treatment is needed.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how accurate TBI and TSBP are for diagnosing lower‑leg PAD. Specifically, we aimed to (1) estimate each test’s accuracy at different cut‑off values in people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the performance of TBI versus TSBP. We also planned to explore whether factors such as patient type, equipment used, positivity threshold, or reference imaging test affected the results.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched major medical databases up to 27 February 2024 for studies that compared TBI or TSBP with a validated imaging reference for PAD. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality using standard tools.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 18 diagnostic‑accuracy studies. Researchers evaluated TBI in 1,927 adults (2,550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 adults (701 limbs); some studies looked at both tests. All participants were 18 years or older and included people with symptoms and people without, who were at risk because of diabetes, kidney disease, or other factors. Researchers carried out the studies in several countries and settings, but they did not report where the funding came from. The toe tests were compared with imaging methods such as colour‑duplex ultrasound (a special scan that uses sound waves to see blood flow), CT‑angiography (a detailed X‑ray scan of the blood vessels), multi‑detector row tomography (another type of detailed scan), or conventional angiography. The studies did not report participants’ age distribution, gender balance, or disease severity. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain. We cannot tell if TBI or TSBP reliably detect PAD, and the few studies we have do not provide clear answers about how useful these tests are.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because some studies may have let participants or researchers know which test was being performed, and many studies did not provide all the data we needed.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched studies up to 27 February 2024, so the evidence reflects research published up to that date.",
