  "draft": "How accurate are toe‑brachial index (a pressure ratio measured at the toe) and toe systolic blood pressure (blood pressure measured at the toe) for detecting peripheral arterial disease (poor blood flow in the leg arteries)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found very limited, low‑quality evidence about how well toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) identify peripheral arterial disease, so we cannot say the tests are reliable.\n- Clinicians use TBI and TSBP widely, but current research does not tell us how accurately these tests detect disease.\n- We recommend future well‑designed studies that test different cut‑off values and include diverse patient groups to determine the true accuracy of these toe‑based measurements.\n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?\nPAD is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked by a build‑up of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis). This reduces blood flow and can cause pain when walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, or even amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. It affects an estimated 236 million people worldwide and is more common in older adults, smokers, people with high blood pressure, diabetes, or other heart problems. Finding PAD early helps prevent serious complications.\n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?\nBoth TBI and TSBP are simple, non‑invasive bedside tests that measure blood pressure in a toe.\n- TBI compares the pressure in a toe with the pressure in an arm (brachial artery). A low ratio suggests reduced blood flow in the leg.\n- TSBP records the actual pressure reading in the toe.\nThese tests are useful because the small arteries in the toes are less likely to be hardened by calcium (calcification), which can make ankle‑based measurements inaccurate, especially in people with diabetes or kidney disease. Clinicians often use them to decide whether further imaging or treatment is needed.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how accurate TBI and TSBP are for diagnosing lower‑leg PAD. Specifically, we aimed to (1) estimate each test’s accuracy at different cut‑off values in people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the performance of TBI versus TSBP. We also planned to explore whether factors such as patient type (e.g., diabetes, kidney disease, general population), equipment used, positivity threshold, or reference imaging test affected the results.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched several databases up to 27 February 2024 for studies that compared TBI or TSBP with a validated imaging reference for PAD. We combined the accuracy results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard quality‑assessment tools.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 18 diagnostic‑accuracy studies. Together they evaluated TBI in 1,927 adults (2,550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 adults (701 limbs); some studies looked at both tests. All participants were 18 years or older and included both symptomatic and asymptomatic people at risk for PAD because of diabetes, kidney disease, or general risk factors. The studies were carried out in various, unspecified countries and settings, and funding sources were not reported.\nThe index tests were compared with a range of vascular‑imaging reference standards:\n- colour‑duplex ultrasound (an ultrasound that shows blood flow),\n- computed tomography angiography (a CT scan that visualises blood vessels),\n- multi‑detector row tomography (a detailed CT scan that captures many thin slices),\n- conventional angiography (an X‑ray test that visualises arteries),\n- or combinations of these methods.\nThe reports did not give details on participants’ age distribution, gender balance, or disease severity. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether TBI or TSBP can reliably identify PAD, and the few studies that exist do not provide clear answers about the usefulness of these tests for diagnosis.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because some studies may have let participants or investigators know which test was being performed, and not all studies provided data on every outcome we wanted. The methodological quality of the studies was generally low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe updated our search to February 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft is missing the required \"Currency\" section (a subheading phrased as a question, e.g., \"How current is the evidence?\") which fails the critical completeness check. Additionally, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers:\n1. Passive voice obscures who did what – e.g., \"The studies were carried out in various, unspecified countries and settings, and the funding sources were not reported.\" Rewrite actively: \"We carried out the studies in various, unspecified countries and settings, and we did not report funding sources.\"\n2. Long, noun‑heavy sentence in the results – e.g., \"The index tests were compared with a range of vascular‑imaging reference standards, most often colour‑duplex ultrasound, but also computed tomography angiography, multi‑detector row tomography, conventional angiography, or combinations of these.\" Simplify: \"We compared the index tests with several imaging reference standards, most often colour‑duplex ultrasound, and also CT angiography, multi‑detector row tomography, conventional angiography, or combinations of these.\"\n3. Missing brief paragraph that states the evidence is up‑to‑date – the source of truth says the search was current to February 2024. Add a subheading \"How current is the evidence?\" and a short sentence: \"We searched studies up to 27 February 2024, so the evidence reflects research published up to that date.\"\n4. Overuse of technical nouns makes the text dense – e.g., \"diagnostic‑accuracy studies\" and \"vascular‑imaging reference standards\". Replace with simpler terms: \"studies that tested how well the toe tests detect PAD\" and \"imaging tests used as the reference standard\".\n5. Some bullet points use em‑dashes (–) instead of hyphens (-). Ensure all list items start with a hyphen as required by the style guide.\nThese changes address the missing section, reduce passive constructions (the metrics show 19 passive instances, well above the typical range), lower noun density (212 nouns, beyond typical), and improve overall readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits (732 words) and scores well on readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 55, Grade 10.7). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in several metrics: high passive voice (19, beyond P90, P90), high nominalisation (22, beyond P90), excessive nouns (212, beyond P90), and many complex/long words (complex_words 153, long_words 219, both beyond P90). These metric deviations support the identified style and clarity issues."
