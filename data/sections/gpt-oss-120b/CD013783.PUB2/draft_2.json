  "draft": "How accurate are toe‑brachial index (a pressure ratio measured at the toe) and toe systolic blood pressure (blood pressure measured at the toe) for detecting peripheral arterial disease (poor blood flow in the leg arteries)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found very limited evidence about how well toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) identify peripheral arterial disease; the few studies were low quality, so we cannot say the tests are reliable.\n- Clinicians use TBI and TSBP widely, but current research does not tell us how accurately these tests detect disease.\n- We recommend future well‑designed studies that test different cut‑off values and include diverse patient groups to determine the true accuracy of these toe‑based measurements.\n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?\nPeripheral arterial disease is a condition where arteries that supply blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked by a build‑up of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis). This reduces blood flow and can cause pain when walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, or even amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. Because it affects an estimated 236 million people worldwide and is more common in older adults, smokers, people with high blood pressure, diabetes, or other heart problems, finding it early is crucial for preventing serious complications.\n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?\nBoth TBI and TSBP are simple, non‑invasive bedside tests that measure blood pressure in a toe.\n- TBI compares the pressure in a toe with the pressure in an arm (brachial artery). A low ratio suggests reduced blood flow in the leg.\n- TSBP records the actual pressure reading in the toe.\nThese tests are useful because the small arteries in the toes are less likely to be affected by calcification that can make ankle‑based measurements inaccurate, especially in people with diabetes or kidney disease. Clinicians often use them to decide whether further imaging or treatment is needed, but we need solid evidence about how well they actually detect PAD.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to determine how accurate TBI and TSBP are for diagnosing lower‑leg PAD. Specifically, we aimed to (1) estimate the accuracy of each test at different cut‑off values in people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the performance of TBI versus TSBP. We also planned to explore whether factors such as patient type (for example, diabetes, kidney disease, or general population), equipment used, positivity threshold, or reference imaging test affected the results.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched multiple databases for studies that compared TBI or TSBP with a validated imaging reference for PAD. We combined the accuracy results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard quality appraisal tools.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 18 diagnostic accuracy studies. Together they evaluated TBI in 1,927 adults (2,550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 adults (701 limbs); some studies looked at both tests. All participants were aged 18 years or older and included both symptomatic and asymptomatic people at risk for PAD because of diabetes, kidney disease, or general risk factors. The studies were conducted in various, unspecified countries and settings, and funding sources were not reported. The index tests were compared with a range of vascular imaging reference standards, most often colour‑duplex ultrasound, but also computed tomography angiography, multi‑detector row tomography, conventional angiography, or combinations of these. The reports did not provide details on participants’ age distribution, gender balance, or disease severity. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether TBI or TSBP can reliably identify peripheral arterial disease, and the few studies that exist do not give clear answers about the usefulness of these tests for diagnosis.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because some studies may have allowed participants or investigators to know which test was being performed, and not all studies provided data on every outcome we were interested in. The methodological quality of the studies was generally low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.\n",

These issues together constitute three major clarity problems that would impede patient understanding. Suggested rewrites are provided below. The PLS metrics also show excessive nouns (205, beyond P90), complex words (158, beyond P90) and long words (227, beyond P90), confirming the need to simplify language and reduce noun‑heavy phrasing.",

These indicate the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than typical Cochrane PLS, supporting the identified clarity issues."
