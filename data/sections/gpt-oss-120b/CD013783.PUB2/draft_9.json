  "draft": "How accurate are toe‑brachial index (a pressure ratio measured at the toe) and toe systolic blood pressure (blood pressure measured at the toe) for detecting peripheral arterial disease (poor blood flow in the leg arteries)?\n\nKey messages\n- We do not have reliable evidence to say how well the toe‑brachial index (a pressure ratio between the toe and the arm) or toe systolic blood pressure (the pressure measured at the toe) identify peripheral arterial disease; the few studies we found were low quality and reported no harms.\n- Both tests are used widely in clinical practice, but because the research is of low quality, we cannot be sure they correctly detect the disease.\n- Future research should use well‑designed studies, test different cut‑off values, and include diverse patient groups to determine the accuracy of these toe‑based measurements.\n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?\nPAD is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked by a build‑up of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis). This reduces blood flow and can cause pain when walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, or even amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. An estimated 236 million people worldwide have PAD, and it is more common in older adults, smokers, people with high blood pressure, diabetes, or other heart problems. Finding PAD early helps prevent serious complications.\n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?\nBoth TBI and TSBP are simple, non‑invasive bedside tests that measure blood pressure in a toe.\n- TBI compares the pressure in a toe with the pressure in an arm (brachial artery). A low ratio suggests reduced blood flow in the leg.\n- TSBP records the actual pressure reading in the toe.\nThese tests are useful because the tiny arteries in the toes are less likely to harden with calcium. Calcium can make ankle‑based measurements inaccurate, especially for people with diabetes or kidney disease. Clinicians often use them to decide whether further imaging or treatment is needed.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how accurate TBI and TSBP are for diagnosing lower‑leg PAD. Specifically, we aimed to (1) estimate each test’s accuracy at different cut‑off values in people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the performance of TBI versus TSBP. We also planned to explore whether factors such as patient type, equipment used, positivity threshold, or the reference imaging test affected the results.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched major medical databases up to 27 February 2024 for studies that compared TBI or TSBP with a validated imaging reference for PAD. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality using standard tools.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 18 studies. Researchers measured TBI in 1,927 adults (2,550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 adults (701 limbs). Some studies looked at both tests. All participants were 18 years or older and included people with and without symptoms, who were at risk because of diabetes, kidney disease, or other factors. We compared the toe tests with imaging scans that show blood flow, most often a special ultrasound scan (colour‑duplex ultrasound), but also CT scans (computed tomography angiography) and conventional X‑ray angiography. The studies did not report participants’ age distribution, gender balance, or disease severity. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain – we cannot say whether the toe tests reliably detect PAD, and the few studies provide no clear answers about their usefulness.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because some studies may have let participants or researchers know which test was being performed, and many studies did not provide all the data we needed.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched studies up to 27 February 2024, so the evidence reflects research published up to that date.",

The most important issues are:\n1. **Long, complex sentence about why toe tests are useful** – the sentence exceeds 30 words and packs multiple ideas, making it hard to follow.\n2. **Technical jargon without plain-language explanation** – terms such as “colour‑duplex ultrasound”, “computed tomography angiography” and “multi‑detector row tomography” are not defined for a non‑expert audience.\n3. **Passive‑voice construction** – e.g., “The studies were carried out…”, which obscures who did what and adds unnecessary distance.\n4. **Noun‑heavy, dense sentence summarising the uncertainty of evidence** – the sentence is long and packed with abstract nouns, reducing readability.\nThese issues are flagged by the metrics (high passive_voice count of 18, nouns 198, complex_words 126, long_words 195), indicating the draft is more noun‑ and jargon‑dense than typical PLS texts. The following concrete rewrites address each problem.\n\n**Suggested rewrites:**\n- *Original:* “These tests are useful because the tiny arteries in the toes are less likely to be affected by the calcification that can make ankle‑based measurements inaccurate, especially in people with diabetes or kidney disease.”\n  *Rewrite:* “These tests are useful because the small arteries in the toe are less likely to become hardened with calcium. This makes them more reliable than ankle measurements, especially for people with diabetes or kidney disease.”\n\n- *Original:* “most often colour‑duplex ultrasound, but also CT scans (computed tomography angiography) and conventional X‑ray angiography.”\n  *Rewrite:* “most often a special type of ultrasound called colour‑duplex ultrasound, and sometimes CT scans (a detailed X‑ray) or regular X‑ray angiography.”\n\n- *Original:* “The studies were carried out in various, unspecified countries and settings, and the funding sources were not reported.”\n  *Rewrite:* “Researchers conducted the studies in several countries and settings, but they did not report where the funding came from.”\n\n- *Original:* “Overall, the evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether toe‑brachial index or toe systolic blood pressure can reliably identify peripheral arterial disease, and the few studies provide no clear answers about the usefulness of these tests for diagnosis.”\n  *Rewrite:* “Overall, the evidence is very uncertain. We cannot say if the toe‑brachial index or toe systolic blood pressure reliably detect PAD, and the few studies give no clear answers about how useful these tests are.”\n\nAddressing these points will bring the draft in line with the Master Style Guide’s emphasis on active voice, short sentences, and plain language, and will reduce the high noun and complex‑word counts highlighted by the evaluation metrics.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most metric percentiles (e.g., readability scores are in the P25‑P75 range). However, four metrics deviate significantly: nouns (198, P90), complex_words_dc (277, P90), complex_words (126, P90) and long_words (195, P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long, complex words, which aligns with the identified clarity issues."
