  "draft": "Does continuing treatment (maintenance therapy) after initial therapy improve survival or disease control for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) compared with just observation?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Continuing treatment (maintenance therapy) after initial therapy does not seem to increase overall survival (how long people live) compared with simply observing patients, but it does lengthen progression‑free survival (the time before the disease gets worse). The evidence comes mainly from anti‑CD20 antibodies (lab‑made proteins that target a specific marker on cancer cells) and lenalidomide (a medicine that modifies the immune system). However, maintenance therapy also leads to more serious side effects (grade 3/4 adverse events). The current evidence is limited and not strong enough to be certain.\n- No studies evaluated newer targeted drugs such as BTK inhibitors or BCL‑2 inhibitors, and information on patients’ quality of life was scarce.\n- Future research should include larger, high‑quality trials of these newer agents, with longer follow‑up to assess overall survival, quality of life, and side‑effect profiles, to clarify whether maintenance therapy offers a clear overall benefit.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why might people need ongoing treatment?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common type of blood cancer in adults. It occurs when a group of white blood cells called lymphocytes grows out of control and builds up in the blood, bone marrow and sometimes the spleen. CLL cannot be cured, and each time a person receives a standard treatment (called induction therapy) the time before the disease gets worse again – known as the progression‑free period – tends to become shorter. Because of this, doctors look for ways to keep the disease under control for longer after the initial treatment. One strategy is **maintenance therapy**, which means giving a lower‑dose or different drug after remission to try to deepen the response and delay relapse. Several kinds of maintenance drugs are used, including:\n- **Anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibodies** (e.g., rituximab, ofatumumab) – laboratory‑made proteins that target a marker (CD20) on the cancer cells.\n- **Immunomodulatory drugs** (e.g., lenalidomide) – medicines that help the immune system fight the cancer.\n- **Anti‑CD52 monoclonal antibodies** (e.g., alemtuzumab) – another type of protein that attacks a different marker (CD52) on the cells.\n- **Targeted small‑molecule inhibitors** such as Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors and B‑cell lymphoma‑2 (BCL‑2) inhibitors – pills that block specific signals the cancer cells need to survive.\nPeople who have achieved remission after their first round of treatment can either be simply observed (watch‑and‑wait) or start one of these maintenance options. However, it is still unclear how much benefit these maintenance drugs provide and what side‑effects they may cause.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about maintenance therapies for CLL?\nThe authors set out to find out whether maintenance treatments improve important outcomes for people with CLL and whether they are safe. Specifically, they wanted to compare maintenance drugs – anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, anti‑CD52 monoclonal antibodies, BTK inhibitors, and BCL‑2 inhibitors – with either placebo/observation or with each other. They examined how these therapies affect:\n- **Overall survival (OS)** – how long people live after treatment.\n- **Progression‑free survival (PFS)** – how long people stay free from disease worsening.\n- **Health‑related quality of life (HRQoL)** – how treatment impacts daily well‑being.\n- **Serious side‑effects (grade 3/4 adverse events)**, treatment‑related deaths, treatment discontinuation, and any other adverse events.\nIn short, the review sought to determine the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy for CLL, helping patients and clinicians decide whether to use these treatments after initial remission.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared maintenance therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with observation or other maintenance options, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence using risk‑of‑bias and GRADE assessments.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 11 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 2,393 people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The studies followed participants for between about 1 and 6 years. Participants were typically aged between 54 and 72 years, about 60 % were men, and most had advanced disease or common genetic changes.\n\nThe trials tested three types of maintenance treatment after initial therapy:\n• Anti‑CD20 antibodies (rituximab or ofatumumab) in seven trials involving 1,679 people, compared with no further treatment.\n• Lenalidomide in three trials involving 693 people, compared with placebo or no further treatment.\n• Alemtuzumab in one very small trial of 21 people, compared with no further treatment.\n\nThe main results were:\n• Anti‑CD20 maintenance probably makes little or no difference to overall survival, probably improves progression‑free survival, and may cause a small increase in overall and serious side‑effects.\n• Lenalidomide maintenance probably makes little or no difference to overall survival, probably leads to a large improvement in progression‑free survival, may increase serious side‑effects and treatment‑related mortality slightly, and probably increases overall side‑effects.\n• Evidence for alemtuzumab maintenance is very uncertain, and it is unclear whether it affects progression‑free survival.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022 of search.",

Trim redundant phrasing and combine overlapping points (e.g., merge parts of the Key messages and Introduction).\n2. **Subheading format** – change headings to questions. Example: replace \"Methods\" with \"How did we find and assess the evidence?\"; replace \"Results\" with \"What did we find?\"; replace \"Limitations\" with \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"; replace \"Currency\" with \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n3. **Long sentence** – problematic: \"We identified 11 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 2,393 people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

These metrics confirm the need to shorten sentences, use more active voice, reduce noun‑heavy constructions, and cut down on complex/long words to improve readability."
