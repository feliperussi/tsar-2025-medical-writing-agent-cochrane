  "draft": "Does letting preterm infants smell and taste milk during tube feeding help them reach full sucking feeds sooner?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding does not make them reach full sucking feeds (when they can feed completely by mouth) any faster, and no harmful effects were reported. The studies were small and had design problems, so the evidence is very low certainty.\n- The same approach had little or no impact on (i) how quickly infants reached full enteral feeds (when all nutrition is given through the gut), (ii) how long they needed intravenous nutrition (also called parenteral nutrition), or (iii) the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to find out whether this low‑cost intervention can help any group of preterm infants, to work out the best way to deliver the smell and taste, and to assess longer‑term safety and growth.\n\nWhy is feeding a challenge for babies born early?\nBabies born before 37 weeks are called preterm infants. Their nervous system is still immature, so they often cannot coordinate the three actions needed to eat by mouth – sucking, swallowing and breathing. We therefore give most of their early nutrition through a thin tube that goes into the stomach (orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding). Tube feeding provides calories but bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not get to smell or taste the milk. This lack of sensory exposure may delay readiness for oral feeding, keep the baby in hospital longer and increase the risk of feeding problems or infections.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving preterm infants the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the time of tube feeding helps them reach full sucking feeds faster and does so safely. In other words, we asked if this simple, low‑cost sensory exposure can speed up the move from tube feeding to normal oral feeding without causing harm.\n\nHow did we look for the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Epistemonikos up to 26 April 2023, plus trial registers and conference abstracts. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results in meta‑analyses and rated our confidence using GRADE, a system that grades how certain we are about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight randomised or quasi‑randomised studies that together enrolled 1,277 preterm infants receiving tube feeds. All studies compared giving the smell or taste of breast milk or formula with giving no such exposure. The studies did not report trial duration, locations, or funding sources.\n\nMain results: time to full sucking feeds\nThe studies showed almost no change; on average infants reached full sucking feeds about one day earlier, a difference that is not meaningful. Because the studies were small and had design flaws, we are very unsure about this result (very low‑certainty evidence). The same approach had little or no impact on (i) how quickly infants reached full enteral feeds (when all nutrition is given through the gut), (ii) how long they needed intravenous nutrition (also called parenteral nutrition), or (iii) the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the infants and the way the smell or taste was given varied between studies. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the April 2023 search.",

This alone prevents approval. In addition, several clarity issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Long bullet sentence** – \"Giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding does not make them reach full sucking feeds (when they can feed completely by mouth) any faster, and no harmful effects were reported.\" (37 words). Long sentences are hard to follow for a lay audience. *Rewrite*: \"Giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding does not make them reach full sucking feeds any faster. No harmful effects were reported.\"\n2. **Long bullet sentence** – \"The same approach had little or no impact on (i) how quickly infants reached full enteral feeds (when all nutrition is given through the gut), (ii) how long they needed intravenous nutrition (also called parenteral nutrition), or (iii) the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\" (45 words). *Rewrite*: \"The same approach had little or no impact on: (i) how quickly infants reached full enteral feeds (when all nutrition is given through the gut); (ii) how long they needed intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition); and (iii) the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\"\n3. **Long explanatory sentence** – \"The studies showed almost no change; on average infants reached full sucking feeds about one day earlier, a difference that is not meaningful.\" (23 words, borderline but could be clearer). *Rewrite*: \"The studies showed almost no change. On average, infants reached full sucking feeds about one day earlier, a difference that is not meaningful.\"\n4. **Passive‑voice heavy phrasing** – \"The studies did not report trial duration, locations, or funding sources.\" This hides who omitted the information. *Rewrite*: \"The study reports did not include trial duration, locations, or funding sources.\"\n5. **Nominalisation** – The draft contains many noun‑heavy constructions (e.g., \"the provision of the smell and taste of milk\", \"the lack of sensory exposure may delay readiness\"). Converting to verbs improves readability. *Rewrite example*: Change \"the provision of the smell and taste of milk\" to \"giving the smell and taste of milk\".\n\nThese changes address the most confusing or cumbersome parts of the text and also reduce the high nominalisation count (23, which is in the P90 range). The metrics support the observations: passive voice count (14) is at the upper end of the typical range, and nominalisations, long words, and complex words are all above the median, indicating the draft is more noun‑ and complex‑word heavy than typical PLS texts. To meet the style requirement, rename the subheading to a question such as \"What are the key messages?\". After these revisions, the draft would satisfy all critical checks and be ready for approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms to most typical PLS patterns (66.7% of features in the best quartile). Readability scores are good (Flesch Reading Ease 56.75, FKGL 11.07). However, nominalisations (23, P90), total nouns (173, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (261, P90) and long words (171, P90) are higher than typical, indicating noun‑heavy, complex language. Passive voice (14, P75) is at the high end of the normal range. These metric deviations align with the editorial suggestions to reduce nominalisations and simplify wording."
