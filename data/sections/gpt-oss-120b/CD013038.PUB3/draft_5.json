  "draft": "Does letting preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) smell and taste milk during tube feeding (feeding through a thin tube that goes into the stomach) help them reach full sucking feeds sooner?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding does not make them reach full sucking feeds any faster, and no harmful effects were reported. The studies were small and had design problems, so we are not confident in this result – the evidence is considered very low certainty.\n- The same approach also had little or no impact on how quickly infants achieved full enteral feeds (feeding through the gut), the length of time they needed intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition), or the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to find out whether this low‑cost intervention can help any group of preterm infants, to work out the best way to deliver the smell and taste, and to assess longer‑term safety and growth.\n\nWhy is feeding a challenge for babies born early?\nBabies born before 37 weeks are called preterm infants. Their nervous system is still immature, so they often cannot coordinate the three actions needed to eat by mouth – sucking, swallowing and breathing. Because of this, we usually give them nutrition through a tube that goes into the stomach (orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding). Tube feeding provides calories but bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not get to smell or taste the milk. This lack of sensory exposure may delay readiness for oral feeding, keep the baby in hospital longer and increase the risk of feeding problems or infections.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving preterm infants the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the time of tube feeding helps them reach full sucking feeds faster and does so safely. In other words, we asked if this simple, low‑cost sensory exposure can speed up the move from tube feeding to normal oral feeding without causing harm.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Epistemonikos up to 26 April 2023, plus trial registers and conference abstracts. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results in meta‑analyses and rated our confidence using GRADE (a system that grades how certain we are about the evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight randomised or quasi‑randomised studies (quasi‑randomised means groups were not assigned completely at random) that together enrolled 1,277 preterm infants receiving tube feeds. All studies compared giving the smell and/or taste of breast milk or formula with giving no such exposure. The reports did not tell us how long each trial lasted or where they were carried out. They also did not say who funded the studies, so we cannot judge how these factors might have influenced the results.\n\nWhat are the main results for time to full sucking feeds?\nThe studies showed almost no change – on average about one day less – in the time it took infants to reach full sucking feeds. Because the studies were small and had methodological limitations, we are not very confident in this result. This is described as very low‑certainty evidence, meaning the true effect could be different.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the infants and the way the smell or taste was given varied between studies. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the April 2023 search.",

By simplifying terminology, breaking up long sentences, and using more verbs than nouns, the summary will be clearer for patients and caregivers.\n\n**PLS evaluation summary**: The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (e.g., Flesch‑Kincaid ≈ 10th‑grade level). However, it deviates markedly in two areas: noun density (163 nouns, P90) and complex‑word count (246, P90). These metrics confirm the editorial observations of noun‑heavy, jargon‑laden sentences that need revision.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms to length and most readability scores, but shows significant deviation in noun count (163, beyond typical PLS range) and complex‑word count (246, also beyond typical). These outliers indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce noun density."
