  "key_messages": [
    "Exposing preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) to the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding (feeding through a tube) does not appear to make them reach full sucking feeds (when they can feed by mouth) any faster, and no harmful effects were reported; the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.",
    "The same intervention also showed little or no impact on how quickly infants achieved full enteral feeds (feeding through the gut), the length of time they needed intravenous nutrition, or the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.",
    "More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to determine whether this low‑cost intervention might benefit any group of preterm infants, to identify the best way to deliver the smell and taste, and to assess longer‑term safety and growth outcomes."

      "subheading": "Why is feeding a challenge for babies born early?",
      "content": "Babies who are born before 37 weeks of pregnancy are called preterm infants. Because they are still developing, they often cannot coordinate the three actions needed to eat by mouth – sucking, swallowing, and breathing. As a result, they usually receive their first nutrition through a tube that goes into the stomach (orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding). While tube feeding provides the needed calories, it bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not get to smell or taste the milk. This lack of sensory exposure may slow the baby's readiness to move from tube feeds to full oral (sucking) feeds, keeping them in the hospital longer and increasing the risk of feeding problems or infections."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review aimed to discover whether giving preterm infants the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the time of tube feeding helps them reach full sucking feeds faster, without causing any harm. In other words, the authors wanted to know if this simple, low‑cost sensory exposure could speed up the transition from tube feeding to normal oral feeding and be safe for the babies."

      "subheading": "Methods",

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified eight randomised or quasi‑randomised studies that together enrolled 1,277 preterm infants (born before 37 weeks’ gestation) who were receiving tube feeding. All studies compared giving the smell and/or taste of breast milk or formula alongside tube feeds with giving no such exposure. The abstract did not provide details on how long each study lasted, the countries or settings where they were carried out, or the sources of funding. The participants were very early‑gestation infants needing nutritional support; no further demographic information such as gender or severity sub‑categories was reported."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Time to full sucking feeds",
      "content": "It is unclear whether providing the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding makes any difference to how quickly preterm babies reach full sucking feeds. The evidence suggests that the intervention probably makes little or no difference to this outcome, and no clear safety problems were reported."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search."
