  "draft": "Does letting preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) smell and taste milk during tube feeding (feeding through a tube) help them reach full sucking feeds sooner?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding does not make them reach full sucking feeds (when they can feed completely by mouth) any faster, and no harmful effects were reported. The studies were small and had design problems, so the evidence is very low certainty.\n- The same approach also had little or no impact on how quickly infants achieved full enteral feeds (when all nutrition is given through the gut), the length of time they needed intravenous (IV) nutrition, also called parenteral nutrition, or the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to find out whether this low‑cost intervention can help any group of preterm infants, to work out the best way to deliver the smell and taste, and to assess longer‑term safety and growth.\n\nWhy is feeding a challenge for babies born early?\nBabies born before 37 weeks are called preterm infants. Their nervous system is still immature, so they often cannot coordinate the three actions needed to eat by mouth – sucking, swallowing and breathing. So we usually feed them through a thin tube that goes into the stomach (orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding). Tube feeding provides calories but bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not get to smell or taste the milk. This lack of sensory exposure may delay readiness for oral feeding, keep the baby in hospital longer and increase the risk of feeding problems or infections.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving preterm infants the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the time of tube feeding helps them reach full sucking feeds faster and does so safely. In other words, we asked if this simple, low‑cost sensory exposure can speed up the move from tube feeding to normal oral feeding without causing harm.\n\nHow did we look for the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Epistemonikos up to 26 April 2023, plus trial registers and conference abstracts. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results in meta‑analyses and rated our confidence using GRADE, a system that grades how certain we are about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found eight studies – some randomised, some only partly randomised – that together included 1,277 preterm infants who were receiving tube feeds. All studies compared giving the smell or taste of breast milk or formula with giving no such exposure. The reports did not say how long the trials lasted, where they were carried out, or who funded them.\n\nMain results: Time to full sucking feeds\nThe studies showed almost no change; on average infants reached full sucking feeds about one day earlier, a difference that is not meaningful. Because the studies were small and had design flaws, we are very unsure about this result (very low‑certainty evidence). The intervention also had little or no effect on how quickly infants achieved full enteral feeds, the length of time they needed parenteral nutrition, or the risk of necrotising enterocolitis or late infection.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the infants and the way the smell or taste was given varied between studies. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the April 2023 search.",

Breaking it into two shorter paragraphs (one summarising the studies, the next presenting the main result) would improve white‑space and readability.\n\nThese issues are reflected in the metric report: the draft has a very high noun count (167 vs median ≈ 116) and an unusually high number of complex Dale‑Chall words (247 vs median ≈ 160), both of which signal noun‑heavy, difficult‑to‑read prose.  Addressing the points above will bring the draft back into the typical PLS range and ensure a clear, patient‑friendly summary.",
