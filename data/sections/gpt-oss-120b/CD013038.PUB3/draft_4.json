  "draft": "Does letting preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) smell and taste milk during tube feeding (feeding through a tube) help them reach full sucking feeds sooner?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding does not make them reach full sucking feeds any faster, and no harmful effects were reported. The evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.\n- The same approach also had little or no impact on how quickly infants achieved full enteral feeds (feeding through the gut), the length of time they needed intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition), or the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to find out whether this low‑cost intervention can help any group of preterm infants, to work out the best way to deliver the smell and taste, and to assess longer‑term safety and growth.\n\nWhy is feeding a challenge for babies born early?\nBabies born before 37 weeks are called preterm infants. Their nervous system is still immature, so they often cannot coordinate sucking, swallowing and breathing – the three actions needed to eat by mouth. Because of this, we usually give them nutrition through a tube that goes into the stomach (orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding). Tube feeding provides calories but bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not get to smell or taste the milk. This lack of sensory exposure may delay readiness for oral feeding, keep the baby in hospital longer and increase the risk of feeding problems or infections.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving preterm infants the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the time of tube feeding helps them reach full sucking feeds faster and does so safely. In other words, we asked if this simple, low‑cost sensory exposure can speed up the move from tube feeding to normal oral feeding without causing harm.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Epistemonikos up to 26 April 2023, plus trial registers and conference abstracts. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results in meta‑analyses and rated our confidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight randomised or quasi‑randomised studies that together enrolled 1,277 preterm infants receiving tube feeds. All studies compared giving the smell and/or taste of breast milk or formula with giving no such exposure. The reports did not tell us how long each trial lasted, where they were carried out or who funded them, so we cannot judge how these factors might have influenced the results.\n\nWhat are the main results for time to full sucking feeds?\nWe found that letting babies smell and taste milk during tube feeding does not speed up the time they reach full sucking feeds. The studies showed almost no change – on average about one day less – and the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the infants and the way the smell or taste was given varied between studies. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the April 2023 search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several patient‑facing problems:\n1. **Unexplained technical terms** – words such as “orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding”, “parenteral nutrition”, “necrotising enterocolitis”, “quasi‑randomised” and “GRADE” are used without any plain‑language definition, leaving readers unsure what they mean.\n2. **Overly long sentence** – the sentence “The reports did not tell us how long each trial lasted, where they were carried out or who funded them, so we cannot judge how these factors might have influenced the results.” contains 32 words and packs three ideas together, making it hard to follow.\n3. **Unclear certainty language** – the phrase “the evidence is very uncertain” and references to “very low‑certainty evidence” are not explained, so readers do not understand why the certainty is low or what it means for them.\nThese issues are reflected in the metric profile: the draft has a very high count of unfamiliar (Dale‑Chall) words (complex_words_dc = 224 → well above the typical <160), indicating many words that are not everyday vocabulary. The readability scores are actually good, but the lexical difficulty will still hinder comprehension for a lay audience.\n**Suggested rewrites**:\n- Replace jargon with simple explanations, e.g., “orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding (a thin tube that goes into the stomach)”.\n- Split the long sentence into two: “The reports did not tell us how long each trial lasted or where they were carried out. They also did not say who funded the studies, so we cannot judge how these factors might have influenced the results.”\n- Explain certainty: “Because the studies were small and had some design problems, we are not very confident in the results. This means the evidence is considered ‘very low certainty’ – we cannot be sure the true effect is the same as what the studies showed.”\nAddressing these three points will bring the PLS into line with the Master Style Guide and improve patient understanding.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS meets word‑count limits and most readability metrics (FKGL ≈ 10, Flesch Reading Ease ≈ 62). However, it deviates on the complex_words_dc metric (224 vs typical <160), indicating excessive use of unfamiliar words. This supports the need to simplify terminology and reduce jargon."
