  "draft": "Does letting preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) smell and taste milk during tube feeding (feeding through a tube) help them reach full sucking feeds sooner?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding does not make them reach full sucking feeds any faster, and no harmful effects were reported. The studies were small and had design problems, so we are not confident in this result – the evidence is very low certainty.\n- The same approach also had little or no impact on how quickly infants achieved full enteral feeds (feeding through the gut), the length of time they needed intravenous nutrition (nutrition given through a drip), or the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to find out whether this low‑cost intervention can help any group of preterm infants, to work out the best way to deliver the smell and taste, and to assess longer‑term safety and growth.\n\nWhy is feeding a challenge for babies born early?\nBabies born before 37 weeks are called preterm infants. Their nervous system is still immature, so they often cannot coordinate the three actions needed to eat by mouth – sucking, swallowing and breathing. Because of this, we usually give them nutrition through a thin tube that goes into the stomach (called an orogastric or nasogastric tube). Tube feeding provides calories but bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not get to smell or taste the milk. This lack of sensory exposure may delay readiness for oral feeding, keep the baby in hospital longer and increase the risk of feeding problems or infections.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving preterm infants the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the time of tube feeding helps them reach full sucking feeds faster and does so safely. In other words, we asked if this simple, low‑cost sensory exposure can speed up the move from tube feeding to normal oral feeding without causing harm.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Epistemonikos up to 26 April 2023, plus trial registers and conference abstracts. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results in meta‑analyses and rated our confidence using GRADE, a system that grades how certain we are about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found eight studies – some randomised, some only partly randomised – that together included 1,277 preterm infants who were receiving tube feeds. All studies looked at whether adding the smell or taste of breast milk or formula made a difference compared with not adding it. The reports did not tell us how long each trial lasted, where they were carried out, or who funded them.\n\nWhat are the main results for time to full sucking feeds?\nThe studies showed almost no change – on average about one day less – in the time it took infants to reach full sucking feeds. Because the studies were small and had methodological limitations, we are not very confident in this result. This is described as very low‑certainty evidence, meaning the true effect could be different.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the infants and the way the smell or taste was given varied between studies. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the April 2023 search.",

On average, infants reached full sucking feeds about one day earlier, a difference that is not statistically important.\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy, passive‑style sentence** – \"The reports did not tell us how long each trial lasted, where they were carried out, or who funded them.\" This sentence is noun‑heavy and uses a passive‑like construction that reduces readability. *Rewrite*: \"The reports omitted details such as the trial length, the locations where they were done, and their funding sources.\"\n4. **Missing definition of \"full sucking feeds\"** – The term appears early without a simple explanation. *Rewrite*: \"full sucking feeds (when the baby can feed completely by mouth).\"\n5. **High noun and complex‑word density** – Metrics show nouns (158, P90) and complex Dale‑Chall words (239, P90) far above typical PLS ranges, indicating the text is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words. Reducing noun clusters and replacing complex words (e.g., \"methodological limitations\" → \"study problems\") will improve readability.\nThese issues together exceed the acceptable threshold for patient‑focused clarity, so the PLS cannot be approved in its current form.",

However, noun count (158) and Dale‑Chall complex words (239) are in the P90 range, indicating the draft is unusually noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words. Passive voice (16) and long‑word count (156) are also higher than typical, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce noun density."
