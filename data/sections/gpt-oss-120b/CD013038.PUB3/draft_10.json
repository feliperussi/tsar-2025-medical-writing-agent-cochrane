  "draft": "Does letting preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) smell and taste milk during tube feeding (feeding through a tube) help them reach full sucking feeds sooner?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding does not make them reach full sucking feeds any faster. No harmful effects were reported.\n- The same approach had little or no impact on: (i) how quickly infants reached full enteral feeds (when all nutrition is given through the gut); (ii) how long they needed intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition); and (iii) the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to see whether this low‑cost intervention can help any group of preterm infants, to work out the best way to deliver the smell and taste, and to assess longer‑term safety and growth.\n\nWhy is feeding a challenge for babies born early?\nBabies born before 37 weeks are called preterm infants. Their nervous system is still immature, so they often cannot coordinate the three actions needed to eat by mouth – sucking, swallowing and breathing. We therefore give most of their early nutrition through a thin tube that goes into the stomach (orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding). Tube feeding provides calories but bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not get to smell or taste the milk. This lack of sensory exposure may delay readiness for oral feeding, keep the baby in hospital longer and increase the risk of feeding problems or infections.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving preterm infants the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the time of tube feeding helps them reach full sucking feeds faster and does so safely. In other words, we asked if this simple, low‑cost sensory exposure can speed up the move from tube feeding to normal oral feeding without causing harm.\n\nHow did we look for the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Epistemonikos up to 26 April 2023, plus trial registers and conference abstracts. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results in meta‑analyses and rated our confidence using GRADE, a system that grades how certain we are about the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight randomised or quasi‑randomised studies that together enrolled 1,277 preterm infants receiving tube feeds. All studies compared giving the smell or taste of breast milk or formula with giving no such exposure. The study reports did not include trial duration, locations, or funding sources.\n\nTime to full sucking feeds\nThe studies showed almost no change. On average, infants reached full sucking feeds about one day earlier, a difference that is not meaningful. Because the studies were small and had design flaws, we are very unsure about this result (very low‑certainty evidence).\n\nOther outcomes\nThe same approach had little or no impact on: (i) how quickly infants reached full enteral feeds (when all nutrition is given through the gut); (ii) how long they needed parenteral nutrition (intravenous nutrition); and (iii) the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the infants and the way the smell or taste was given varied between studies. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the April 2023 search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several passages that would likely confuse a lay reader. 1) Technical jargon such as “parenteral nutrition” is only parenthetically defined and may still be unclear; a plain-language definition should be given earlier. 2) The key‑message bullet that lists three outcomes is a single long, complex sentence with numbered sub‑points – it should be broken into separate, simple bullet points. 3) The sentence “The study reports did not include trial duration, locations, or funding sources.” adds methodological detail that is unnecessary for a patient audience and distracts from the main message. 4) Several sentences are noun‑heavy and contain nominalisations (e.g., “The evidence suggests that the intervention probably makes little or no difference to this outcome”), which the metrics flag (nominalisation = 22, nouns = 171, complex_words_dc = 256, long_words = 169). Re‑writing these to use active verbs and shorter words will improve readability. 5) The paragraph under “What did we find?” repeats information and could be streamlined for brevity. Addressing these five issues will bring the summary into line with the Master Style Guide and make it truly understandable for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall (high conformity) but deviates on four metrics: nominalisation (22, beyond typical median), nouns (171, high), complex_words_dc (256, high) and long_words (169, high). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long, unfamiliar words, supporting the editorial recommendation to reduce nominalisations, simplify vocabulary, and break up long sentences."
