  "draft": "Does letting preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) smell and taste milk during tube feeding (feeding through a tube) help them reach full sucking feeds sooner?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Exposing preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) to the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding (feeding through a tube) does not appear to make them reach full sucking feeds (when they can feed by mouth) any faster, and no harmful effects were reported; the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.\n- The same intervention also showed little or no impact on how quickly infants achieved full enteral feeds (feeding through the gut), the length of time they needed intravenous nutrition, or the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\n- More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to determine whether this low‑cost intervention might benefit any group of preterm infants, to identify the best way to deliver the smell and taste, and to assess longer‑term safety and growth outcomes.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is feeding a challenge for babies born early?\nBabies who are born before 37 weeks of pregnancy are called preterm infants. Because they are still developing, they often cannot coordinate the three actions needed to eat by mouth – sucking, swallowing, and breathing. As a result, they usually receive their first nutrition through a tube that goes into the stomach (orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding). While tube feeding provides the needed calories, it bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not get to smell or taste the milk. This lack of sensory exposure may slow the baby's readiness to move from tube feeds to full oral (sucking) feeds, keeping them in the hospital longer and increasing the risk of feeding problems or infections.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review aimed to discover whether giving preterm infants the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the time of tube feeding helps them reach full sucking feeds faster, without causing any harm. In other words, the authors wanted to know if this simple, low‑cost sensory exposure could speed up the transition from tube feeding to normal oral feeding and be safe for the babies.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched multiple databases for studies comparing exposure to the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds versus no exposure in preterm infants, combined their results in meta‑analyses, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight randomised or quasi‑randomised studies that together enrolled 1,277 preterm infants (born before 37 weeks’ gestation) who were receiving tube feeding. All studies compared giving the smell and/or taste of breast milk or formula alongside tube feeds with giving no such exposure. The abstract did not provide details on how long each study lasted, the countries or settings where they were carried out, or the sources of funding. The participants were very early‑gestation infants needing nutritional support; no further demographic information such as gender or severity sub‑categories was reported.\n\nMain results: Time to full sucking feeds\nIt is unclear whether providing the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding makes any difference to how quickly preterm babies reach full sucking feeds. The evidence suggests that the intervention probably makes little or no difference to this outcome, and no clear safety problems were reported.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search.",

This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement that subheadings be question‑style. In addition, the text contains a number of clarity problems that would confuse readers:\n1. **Very long, hard‑to‑follow sentence** – “We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.” This sentence should be split into shorter sentences and written in active voice.\n   *Rewrite:* “We are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and they used different groups of infants and different ways of delivering the intervention. Moreover, not all studies reported all the outcomes we needed.”\n2. **Passive‑voice / noun‑heavy phrasing** – “The participants were very early‑gestation infants needing nutritional support.” Using a verb makes the sentence clearer.\n   *Rewrite:* “Very early‑gestation infants who needed nutritional support took part in the studies.”\n3. **Nominalizations and long words** – Frequent use of nouns such as “exposure”, “intervention”, “methodological limitations” makes the text dense. The metrics show high nominalisation (21, P90) and many long words (189, P90). Replace nouns with verbs where possible.\n   *Rewrite:* “We gave some infants the smell and taste of milk and compared them with infants who did not receive this sensory stimulation.”\n4. **Wordy phrase** – “The abstract did not provide details on how long each study lasted, the countries or settings where they were carried out, or the sources of funding.” Can be shortened.\n   *Rewrite:* “The abstract omitted study duration, location, and funding details.”\n5. **Subheading not a question** – “Methods”.\n   *Rewrite:* “How did we find the evidence?”\nThese issues are supported by the PLS evaluation: the draft has a high average sentence length (25.5 words, P90), many nominalisations (21, P90), a high noun count (182, P90), many complex Dale‑Chall words (266, P90) and long words (189, P90). Reducing sentence length, using more active verbs, and re‑phrasing subheadings as questions will bring the text into the typical PLS range and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows overall good conformity but highlights five features deviating from typical PLS patterns: words per sentence (25.5, P90), nominalisation (21, P90), nouns (182, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (266, P90) and long words (189, P90). These indicate the draft is wordy, noun‑heavy and uses many complex terms, which aligns with the clarity and style issues identified."
