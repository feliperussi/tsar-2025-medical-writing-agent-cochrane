  "draft": "Does letting preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) smell and taste milk during tube feeding (feeding through a tube) help them reach full sucking feeds sooner?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding does not make them reach full sucking feeds any faster, and no harmful effects were reported; the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.\n- The same approach also had little or no impact on how quickly infants achieved full enteral feeds (feeding through the gut), the length of time they needed intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition), or the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to find out whether this low‑cost intervention can help any group of preterm infants, to work out the best way to deliver the smell and taste, and to assess longer‑term safety and growth.\n\nWhy is feeding a challenge for babies born early?\nBabies born before 37 weeks are called preterm infants. Because their nervous system is still immature, they often cannot coordinate the three actions needed to eat by mouth – sucking, swallowing and breathing. Therefore we usually give them nutrition through a tube that goes into the stomach – either through the mouth (orogastric) or through the nose (nasogastric). Tube feeding provides calories but bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not get to smell or taste the milk. This lack of sensory exposure may delay the baby’s readiness to move from tube feeds to full oral (sucking) feeds, keep them in hospital longer and increase the risk of feeding problems or infections.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving preterm infants the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the time of tube feeding helps them reach full sucking feeds faster and does so safely. In other words, we asked if this simple, low‑cost sensory exposure can speed up the move from tube feeding to normal oral feeding without causing harm.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Epistemonikos) up to 26 April 2023, plus trial registers and conference abstracts. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results in meta‑analyses and rated our confidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found eight randomised or quasi‑randomised studies. Together they included 1,277 preterm infants (born before 37 weeks) who were receiving tube feeds. All studies compared giving the smell and/or taste of breast milk or formula with giving no such exposure. The study reports did not say how long each trial lasted, where they were carried out, or who funded them, so we cannot judge how these factors might have influenced the results.\n\nMain results: time to full sucking feeds\nThe evidence shows that giving the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds makes little or no difference to the speed at which babies reach full sucking feeds. No clear safety problems were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence for three reasons: (1) participants might have known which treatment they received, (2) the studies were very small, and (3) the infants and the way the smell or taste was given varied between studies. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the April 2023 search.",

      "feedback": "Critical checks failed: several required sections are missing or not formatted correctly. The draft lacks a dedicated \"How current is the evidence?\" section, and many subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Why is feeding a challenge for babies born early?\", \"Main results: time to full sucking feeds\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide. Additionally, the high noun count (161, P90) and excessive complex Dale‑Chall words (229, P90) indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words, which reduces readability for patients.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Subheading format – Quote: \"Key messages\". Problem: not a question; readers may not see it as a guiding query. Rewrite: \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. Missing currency section – Quote: (no section). Problem: required \"How current is the evidence?\" heading is absent, leaving readers unsure of the review’s timeliness. Add a heading and statement: \"How current is the evidence?\\nThe evidence is up to date to the April 2023 search.\"\n3. Noun‑heavy sentence – Quote: \"The evidence shows that giving the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds makes little or no difference to the speed at which babies reach full sucking feeds.\" Problem: long, noun‑dense, hard for lay readers. Rewrite: \"We found that letting babies smell and taste milk during tube feeding does not speed up the time they reach full sucking feeds.\"\n4. Long, technical sentence with statistics – Quote: \"The evidence suggests that exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds has little to no effect on time taken to reach full sucking feeds (MD −1.07 days, 95% CI −2.63 to 0.50; 3 studies, 662 infants; very low‑certainty evidence).\" Problem: >30 words, includes jargon and statistics that overwhelm a patient. Rewrite: \"The studies showed almost no change in the time to full sucking feeds – on average about one day less, but the evidence is very uncertain.\"\n5. Passive voice – Quote: \"The study reports did not say how long each trial lasted, where they were carried out, or who funded them, so we cannot judge how these factors might have influenced the results.\" Problem: passive construction obscures who is missing information. Rewrite: \"The study reports did not tell us how long each trial lasted, where they were carried out, or who funded them, so we cannot judge how these factors might have influenced the results.\"\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide, reduce noun and complex‑word density (addressing the P90 deviations), and improve clarity for a lay audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (77.8% best‑quartile features). However, two metrics deviate markedly: noun count (161, P90) and complex Dale‑Chall words (229, P90), indicating the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words. Adjusting phrasing to use more verbs and simpler vocabulary will bring these metrics closer to the median range."
