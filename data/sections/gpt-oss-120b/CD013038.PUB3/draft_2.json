  "draft": "Does letting preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) smell and taste milk during tube feeding (feeding through a tube) help them reach full sucking feeds sooner?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding does not speed up the time they reach full sucking feeds, and no harmful effects were reported; the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.\n- The same approach also had little or no effect on how quickly infants achieved full enteral feeds (feeding through the gut), on the length of time they needed intravenous nutrition, or on the risk of serious complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a severe gut infection) and late infections.\n- We need larger, well‑designed studies to find out whether this low‑cost intervention can help any group of preterm infants, to work out the best way to deliver the smell and taste, and to assess longer‑term safety and growth.\n\nWhy is feeding a challenge for babies born early?\nBabies born before 37 weeks are called preterm infants. Because their nervous system is immature, they often cannot coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing. Therefore we usually give them nutrition through an orogastric or nasogastric tube that goes into the stomach. Tube feeding provides calories but bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not smell or taste the milk. This lack of sensory exposure may delay the transition to full oral (sucking) feeds, keep the baby in hospital longer, and increase the risk of feeding problems or infections.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving preterm infants the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the time of tube feeding helps them reach full sucking feeds faster and does so safely. In other words, we asked if this simple, low‑cost sensory exposure can speed up the move from tube feeding to normal oral feeding without causing harm.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Epistemonikos) up to 26 April 2023. We also looked at clinical trial registers and conference abstracts. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined results in meta‑analyses and rated our confidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight randomised or quasi‑randomised studies that enrolled 1,277 preterm infants receiving tube feeds. All studies compared giving the smell and/or taste of breast milk or formula with giving no such exposure. The abstracts omitted details about study duration, location, and funding. Very early‑gestation infants who needed nutritional support took part in the studies.\n\nWhat did the main results show about time to full sucking feeds?\nThe evidence suggests that adding smell and taste to tube feeds probably makes little or no difference to how quickly babies reach full sucking feeds. No clear safety problems were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and they used different groups of infants and different ways of delivering the intervention. Moreover, not all studies reported all the outcomes we needed.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the April 2023 search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several passages that would likely confuse a lay reader. Key problems are: (1) use of technical terms without clear, everyday explanations (e.g., “orogastric or nasogastric tube”, “parenteral nutrition”); (2) a long, dense sentence that packs many details about the included studies; (3) a statement about missing abstract details that leaves the reader wondering why this matters; (4) a complex sentence describing the main finding that could be expressed more directly; and (5) a lengthy limitation sentence that mixes several ideas. These issues are reflected in the metric report – the ‘complex_words_dc’ score (223) is far above the typical range, indicating an excess of unfamiliar words. Reducing jargon and breaking up long sentences will bring the text into line with typical PLS readability.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Quote:** \"Therefore we usually give them nutrition through an orogastric or nasogastric tube that goes into the stomach.\"\n   **Problem:** The terms “orogastric” and “nasogastric” are medical jargon not explained for a non‑expert audience.\n   **Rewrite:** \"Therefore we usually give them nutrition through a tube that goes into the stomach – either through the mouth (orogastric) or through the nose (nasogastric).\"\n\n2. **Quote:** \"We identified eight randomised or quasi‑randomised studies that together enrolled 1,277 preterm infants (born before 37 weeks’ gestation) who were receiving tube feeding.\"\n   **Problem:** The sentence is long and contains several pieces of information that can be split for easier reading.\n   **Rewrite:** \"We found eight randomised or quasi‑randomised studies. Together they included 1,277 preterm infants (born before 37 weeks) who were receiving tube feeds.\"\n\n3. **Quote:** \"The abstracts omitted details about study duration, location, and funding.\"\n   **Problem:** It is unclear why the missing details matter for the reader.\n   **Rewrite:** \"The study reports did not say how long each trial lasted, where they were carried out, or who funded them, so we cannot judge how these factors might have influenced the results.\"\n\n4. **Quote:** \"The evidence suggests that adding smell and taste to tube feeds probably makes little or no difference to how quickly babies reach full sucking feeds.\"\n   **Problem:** The wording is indirect and contains unnecessary qualifiers.\n   **Rewrite:** \"The evidence shows that giving the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds makes little or no difference to the speed at which babies reach full sucking feeds.\"\n\n5. **Quote:** \"We are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and they used different groups of infants and different ways of delivering the intervention.\"\n   **Problem:** This long sentence mixes three separate reasons, making it hard to follow.\n   **Rewrite:** \"We are not confident in the evidence for three reasons: (1) participants might have known which treatment they got, (2) the studies were very small, and (3) the infants and the way the smell or taste was given varied between studies.\"\n\nThese revisions will lower the ‘complex_words_dc’ score, shorten sentences, and replace jargon with plain language, bringing the summary into line with Cochrane’s plain‑language standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to most typical patterns (94% of features in the best quartile). The only notable deviation is a very high complex_words_dc score (223, beyond the typical PLS range), indicating many unfamiliar words. This supports the need to simplify terminology and reduce jargon as highlighted in the feedback."
