  "draft": "Are antibiotic ear drops more effective than antiseptic ear drops for treating long‑lasting ear infections (chronic suppurative otitis media)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Antibiotic ear drops (drops that contain medicines such as quinolones, a type of antibiotic) probably clear ear discharge (fluid leaking from the ear) better than the antiseptic ear drop containing boric acid (a germ‑killing substance) within the first two weeks; however, the evidence comparing antibiotics with other antiseptics such as acetic acid or povidone‑iodine is uncertain, and the studies did not provide clear information on side‑effects.\n- The review gave little data on other outcomes like ear pain, changes in hearing, or serious complications, and the limited studies that examined these did not show obvious differences between antibiotic and antiseptic treatments.\n- Because the existing research is limited in number, size, and quality, future well‑designed studies with longer follow‑up are needed to clarify the true benefits and possible harms of antibiotic versus antiseptic ear drops for chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM, a long‑lasting middle‑ear infection).\n\n**Introduction**\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media and why does it matter?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long‑lasting infection of the middle ear. It usually occurs when a hole forms in the thin skin covering the eardrum (the tympanic membrane), allowing fluid to leak out of the ear – this leaking fluid is called ear discharge or otorrhoea. People with CSOM often have persistent ear discharge and may lose some hearing. The condition can be uncomfortable, affect daily activities, and, if not treated well, can lead to more serious ear problems. To treat CSOM doctors try to eliminate the germs that cause the infection. Two main kinds of medicines are used: antibiotics – drugs that kill or stop the growth of bacteria, which can be applied as ear drops (topical) or taken by mouth or injection (systemic); and antiseptics – chemicals that also kill germs but are always applied directly to the ear as drops, powders, or washes. Both treatments aim to stop the discharge, improve hearing and avoid complications such as ear pain, irritation, or damage to the inner ear (ototoxicity).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review set out to compare the benefits and possible harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics when they are used to treat people with chronic suppurative otitis media. Specifically, the authors wanted to know which type of treatment is more likely to make the ear stop leaking, improve hearing, reduce pain or irritation, and whether either treatment causes serious side‑effects or damage to the ear.\n\n**Methods**\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched major biomedical databases for studies comparing systemic antibiotics with topical antiseptics in people with chronic suppurative otitis media.\n\nStudy Selection\nWe included randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatment groups) that met the population and intervention criteria.\n\nData Synthesis and Certainty\nResults on ear discharge resolution, pain, hearing and other outcomes were combined, and the confidence in the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 15 randomised controlled trials that together included 2,371 people with chronic suppurative otitis media – a condition where the ear keeps draining fluid for more than two weeks and often longer. Both adults and children were part of the studies, although the exact ages and gender breakdown were not given. The trials compared different ear‑drop treatments: topical antibiotics (mainly quinolones and aminoglycosides) against various topical antiseptics such as acetic acid, boric acid, povidone‑iodine and aluminium acetate, and in a few cases against systemic antibiotics. Follow‑up periods ranged from one‑to‑two weeks, two‑to‑four weeks and longer than four weeks, indicating that the treatments were used for at least several weeks. The abstract did not mention where the studies were carried out or who funded them.\n\nMain results: Stopping ear discharge\nQuinolone antibiotic ear drops probably help the ear stop draining more often than boric‑acid ear drops within two weeks – roughly 30 out of 100 people treated with quinolones have a dry ear compared with about 15 out of 100 with boric acid. Acetic‑acid ear drops may give a small increase in the chance of stopping discharge compared with aminoglycoside antibiotic drops, but the evidence is uncertain. There is no clear difference between acetic‑type drops and quinolone drops for stopping discharge, and we do not know whether acetic‑acid drops affect ear pain compared with antibiotics. Hearing does not seem to change much with either quinolone or boric‑acid drops. Compared with povidone‑iodine drops, quinolone drops probably make little or no difference to ear discharge. Overall, quinolone antibiotic ear drops are the only option with reasonably certain evidence of benefit for stopping ear discharge.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we are interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails several critical checks: (1) the word count is 858 words, exceeding the 850‑word limit. (2) many section subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Methods\", \"Search Strategy\", \"Study Selection\", \"Data Synthesis and Certainty\", \"Results\", \"Main results: Stopping ear discharge\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"), which breaches the Master Style Guide. (3) the draft presents specific absolute percentages (\"roughly 30 out of 100\" vs \"about 15 out of 100\") that are not reported in the source abstract or the source of truth, constituting a factual inaccuracy. (4) the text contains excessive passive constructions (24 instances, beyond the typical PLS range) and a high level of nominalisation and noun density, making sentences heavy and harder to read. (5) complex and long words are far above typical PLS levels (e.g., 191 complex words, 254 long words), contributing to a high SMOG index (15.6) and reduced readability. To bring the summary up to standard, the authors should: rewrite subheadings as questions, trim the text to ≤850 words, remove invented absolute numbers and stick to the relative effects reported, convert passive sentences (to active voice), replace nominalised nouns with verbs, and substitute long/complex words with simpler alternatives.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the typical range for words per sentence (24.5, P75) and active voice (87, P75), but deviates strongly on several metrics: passive voice (24, BEYOND_P90), nominalisation (31, BEYOND_P90), noun count (256, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15.65, BEYOND_P90), complex words (191, BEYOND_P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (365, BEYOND_P90) and long words (254, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is unusually dense and difficult compared with typical Cochrane plain language summaries."
