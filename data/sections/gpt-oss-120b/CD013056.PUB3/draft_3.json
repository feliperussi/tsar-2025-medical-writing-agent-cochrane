  "draft": "Are antibiotic ear drops more effective than antiseptic ear drops for treating long‑lasting ear infections (chronic suppurative otitis media)?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n– Antibiotic ear drops that contain quinolones probably increase the chance of a dry ear compared with boric‑acid antiseptic drops within the first two weeks (moderate‑certainty evidence, risk ratio ≈ 1.9).\n– Evidence for other antiseptics such as acetic acid or povidone‑iodine is uncertain, and the studies did not report clear differences in ear pain, hearing changes or serious side‑effects.\n– The available trials are few, small and of limited quality, so we need larger, longer‑term studies to confirm benefits and harms.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media and why does it matter?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long‑lasting infection of the middle ear. It usually occurs when a hole forms in the thin skin of the eardrum (tympanic membrane), allowing fluid to leak out of the ear – this fluid is called ear discharge (otorrhoea). People with CSOM often have persistent discharge and may lose some hearing. The condition can be uncomfortable, interfere with daily activities, and, if not treated well, lead to more serious ear problems.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe aimed to compare the benefits and possible harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics when they are used as ear drops for CSOM. Specifically, we wanted to know which treatment is more likely to stop the ear leaking, improve hearing, reduce pain or irritation, and whether either treatment causes serious side‑effects or damage to the inner ear (ototoxicity).\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe searched major biomedical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared topical antibiotics with topical antiseptics in people with CSOM. We included trials that randomly assigned participants to one of the two treatments and followed them for at least one week.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 15 randomised controlled trials involving 2,371 participants. The trials compared topical antibiotics (mainly quinolones and aminoglycosides) with several antiseptics, including boric acid, acetic acid, povidone‑iodine and aluminium acetate. Follow‑up periods ranged from one‑to‑two weeks, two‑to‑four weeks, and longer than four weeks.\n\nHow does treatment affect ear discharge?\nQuinolone antibiotic ear drops probably increase the chance of a dry ear compared with boric‑acid drops within two weeks (moderate‑certainty evidence, risk ratio ≈ 1.9). Evidence for acetic‑acid antiseptic drops is uncertain: they may give a small increase in discharge resolution compared with aminoglycoside antibiotics, but we cannot tell whether they differ from quinolone antibiotics. Very low‑certainty evidence suggests little or no difference between quinolone drops and povidone‑iodine drops.\n\nWhat about other outcomes?\nThe trials reported little data on ear pain, changes in hearing, or serious complications. Where pain or irritation was measured, the results did not show clear differences between antibiotic and antiseptic drops. No study reported health‑related quality of life or serious adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were small, and participants often knew which treatment they received, which can bias results. The trials did not report many outcomes that matter to patients, such as quality of life or long‑term hearing changes. Because of these limitations, our confidence in the findings is low to moderate.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nThis review includes all eligible studies published up to June 2022.",

Suggested rewrites: • \"The antibiotic drops were about twice as likely to stop ear discharge as the boric‑acid drops (the chance was roughly 1.9 times higher).\" • \"The studies gave little information about ear pain, hearing changes, or serious side‑effects.\" • \"Acetic‑acid drops might help a little more than some antibiotic drops, but we aren’t sure because the evidence is weak.\" These changes also address metric deviations: the draft has a high noun count (163, P90), many complex words (139, P90) and long words (165, P90), and a smog index of 13.6 (P90). Reducing noun‑heavy constructions and simplifying vocabulary will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall (61% of features in best quartile) but deviates on five metrics: nouns (163, above typical <116), smog_index (13.6, above typical <12.1), complex_words_dc (254, above typical <160), complex_words (139, above typical <84), and long_words (165, above typical <122). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long, complex words, which aligns with the identified clarity issues."
