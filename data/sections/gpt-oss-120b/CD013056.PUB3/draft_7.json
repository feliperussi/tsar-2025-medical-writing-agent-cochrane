  "draft": "Are antibiotic ear drops more effective than antiseptic ear drops for treating long‑lasting ear infections (chronic suppurative otitis media)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Antibiotic ear drops (quinolones) probably clear ear discharge (fluid leaking from the ear) better than boric‑acid antiseptic drops within two weeks – about 30 out of 100 people become dry compared with about 15 out of 100.\n- Evidence for other antiseptics such as acetic acid or povidone‑iodine is uncertain, and the studies did not show clear differences in ear pain, hearing changes or serious side‑effects.\n- The trials were small and of low quality, so larger, longer‑term studies are needed.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media and why does it matter?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long‑lasting infection of the middle ear. It usually occurs when a hole forms in the thin skin covering the eardrum, allowing fluid to leak out of the ear. This fluid is called ear discharge (otorrhoea). People with CSOM often have persistent discharge and may lose some hearing. The condition can be uncomfortable, affect daily activities, and, if untreated, lead to more serious ear problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and possible harms of antibiotic ear drops versus antiseptic ear drops for people with CSOM. Specifically, we asked which treatment is more likely to stop the ear leaking, improve hearing, reduce pain or irritation, and whether either treatment causes serious side‑effects or damage to the inner ear (ototoxicity).\n\nHow did we look for studies?\nWe searched major biomedical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared topical antibiotics with topical antiseptics in people with CSOM. We included trials that randomly assigned participants to a treatment group and followed them for at least one week.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 15 trials that together included 2,371 participants with chronic ear infection. The trials compared topical antibiotics (mainly quinolones or aminoglycosides) with several antiseptic drops such as boric acid, acetic acid, povidone‑iodine and aluminium acetate. Follow‑up periods ranged from one‑to‑two weeks, two‑to‑four weeks, and longer than four weeks.\n\nHow does treatment affect ear discharge?\nQuinolone antibiotic ear drops probably help the ear stop draining more often than boric‑acid drops within two weeks – about 30 out of 100 people become dry compared with about 15 out of 100. Acetic‑acid antiseptic drops may give a small increase in the chance of stopping discharge compared with aminoglycoside antibiotic drops, but the evidence is uncertain. We do not have clear evidence that acetic‑acid drops differ from quinolone drops, and we cannot tell whether they affect ear pain. Compared with povidone‑iodine drops, quinolone drops probably make little or no difference to ear discharge.\n\nWhat about other outcomes?\nVery few trials reported ear pain, hearing changes or serious side‑effects. Where pain or irritation was measured, the results did not show obvious differences between antibiotic and antiseptic drops. No study reported health‑related quality of life or serious complications.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were small, and participants often knew which treatment they received, which can bias results. The trials did not report many outcomes that matter to patients, such as quality of life or long‑term hearing changes. Because of these limitations, our confidence in the findings ranges from low to moderate.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects research published until then.",

All other sections are present and factually accurate, and the word count is within limits. However, the text is noun‑heavy (162 nouns, well above the typical <116) and contains many complex words (129 complex words, 243 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words), which makes sentences harder to read for patients. Suggested improvements:\n1. Change the heading to a question: \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. Reduce noun‑heavy phrasing – e.g., rewrite \"The trials compared topical antibiotics (mainly quinolones and aminoglycosides) with several antiseptic drops such as boric acid, acetic acid, povidone‑iodine and aluminium acetate\" to \"We compared quinolone or aminoglycoside ear drops with boric‑acid, acetic‑acid, povidone‑iodine or aluminium‑acetate ear drops\".\n3. Replace complex words with simpler alternatives: change \"antiseptic\" to \"germ‑killing\" and \"ototoxicity\" to \"inner‑ear damage\" where possible.\n4. Shorten the longest sentence in the results section (currently 34 words) to under 30 words for better readability. These changes will bring the noun count and complex‑word count closer to typical PLS ranges and improve patient comprehension.",

However, three metrics deviate: nouns (162, P90), complex_words_dc (243, P90) and complex_words (129, P90) exceed typical ranges, indicating the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many complex words. Other readability indices are within expected ranges."
