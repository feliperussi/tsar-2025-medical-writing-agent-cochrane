  "draft": "Are antibiotic ear drops more effective than antiseptic ear drops for treating long‑lasting ear infections (chronic suppurative otitis media)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Antibiotic ear drops that contain quinolones probably clear ear discharge (fluid leaking from the ear, also called otorrhoea) in about 30 out of 100 people within two weeks, roughly twice the 15 out of 100 who use boric‑acid antiseptic drops.\n- Evidence comparing antibiotics with other antiseptics such as acetic acid or povidone‑iodine is uncertain, and the studies did not show clear differences in ear pain, hearing changes or serious side‑effects.\n- The research is based on small, low‑quality studies, so larger, longer‑term trials are needed to confirm the benefits and harms.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media and why does it matter?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long‑lasting infection of the middle ear. It usually occurs when a hole forms in the thin skin covering the eardrum, allowing fluid to leak out of the ear – this fluid is called ear discharge (also known as otorrhoea). People with CSOM often have persistent discharge and may lose some hearing. The condition can cause discomfort, interfere with daily activities, and, if left untreated, lead to more serious ear problems.\n\nWe use two types of medicines. Antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria; they can be given as ear drops or taken by mouth or injection. Antiseptics are chemicals that also kill germs, but they are always applied directly to the ear as drops, powders, or washes.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and possible harms of antibiotic ear drops versus antiseptic ear drops for people with CSOM. Specifically, we asked which treatment is more likely to stop the ear leaking, improve hearing, reduce pain or irritation, and whether either treatment causes serious side‑effects or damage to the inner ear (ototoxicity).\n\nHow did we look for studies?\nWe searched major biomedical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared topical antibiotics with topical antiseptics in people with CSOM. We included trials that randomly assigned participants to a treatment group and followed them for at least one week.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 15 trials that together included 2,371 participants with chronic ear infection. The trials compared topical antibiotics (mainly quinolones or aminoglycosides) with several antiseptic drops such as boric acid, acetic acid, povidone‑iodine and aluminium acetate. Follow‑up periods ranged from one‑to‑two weeks, two‑to‑four weeks, and longer than four weeks.\n\nHow does treatment affect ear discharge?\nQuinolone antibiotic ear drops probably help the ear stop draining more often than boric‑acid drops within two weeks – about 30 out of 100 people using quinolones have a dry ear compared with about 15 out of 100 using boric acid. Acetic‑acid antiseptic drops may give a small increase in the chance of stopping discharge compared with aminoglycoside antibiotic drops, but the evidence is uncertain. We do not have clear evidence that acetic‑acid drops differ from quinolone drops, and we cannot tell whether they affect ear pain. Compared with povidone‑iodine drops, quinolone drops probably make little or no difference to ear discharge.\n\nWhat about other outcomes?\nWe found little information on ear pain, changes in hearing, or serious side‑effects. Where pain or irritation was measured, the results did not show obvious differences between antibiotic and antiseptic drops. No study reported health‑related quality of life or serious complications.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were small, and participants often knew which treatment they received, which can bias results. The trials did not report many outcomes that matter to patients, such as quality of life or long‑term hearing changes. Because of these limitations, our confidence in the findings ranges from low to moderate.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects research published until then.",

This factual inaccuracy must be corrected. Additionally, several clarity issues would confuse readers: (1) a very long sentence in the key messages (40 words) makes the main finding hard to follow; (2) the term “otorrhoea” is introduced without a simple definition for lay readers; (3) the draft contains a high density of nouns and complex words (189 nouns, 139 complex words, SMOG 13.8) which pushes the readability beyond typical plain‑language standards. Suggested rewrites are provided below. These issues, together with the metric deviations (high noun count, complex‑word and long‑word counts), mean the PLS does not yet meet Cochrane plain‑language standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (FK grade 9.6, Flesch‑Reading Ease 57.6) are within the best quartile, but it deviates on noun count (189, P90), SMOG index (13.8, P90), complex words (139, P90) and long words (175, P90). These suggest the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long/complex words, which can hinder understanding for patients."
