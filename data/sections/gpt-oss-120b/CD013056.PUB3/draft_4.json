  "draft": "Are antibiotic ear drops more effective than antiseptic ear drops for treating long‑lasting ear infections (chronic suppurative otitis media)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Antibiotic ear drops that contain quinolones (a type of antibiotic) probably clear ear discharge more often than boric‑acid antiseptic drops within the first two weeks; the chance is roughly twice as high.\n- Evidence comparing antibiotics with other antiseptics such as acetic acid or povidone‑iodine is uncertain, and the studies did not show clear differences in ear pain, hearing changes or serious side‑effects.\n- The existing research is small and of limited quality, so we need larger, longer‑term trials to confirm the benefits and harms.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media and why does it matter?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long‑lasting infection of the middle ear. It usually occurs when a hole forms in the thin skin covering the eardrum, allowing fluid to leak out of the ear – this leaking fluid is called ear discharge (otorrhoea). People with CSOM often have persistent discharge and may lose some hearing. The condition can be uncomfortable, affect daily activities, and, if not treated well, can lead to more serious ear problems.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and possible harms of antibiotic ear drops versus antiseptic ear drops for CSOM. Specifically, we asked which treatment is more likely to stop the ear leaking, improve hearing, reduce pain or irritation, and whether either treatment causes serious side‑effects or damage to the inner ear (ototoxicity).\n\nHow did we look for studies?\nWe searched major biomedical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared topical antibiotics with topical antiseptics in people with CSOM. We included trials that randomly assigned participants to one of the two treatments and followed them for at least one week.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 15 randomised controlled trials that together included 2,371 participants. The trials compared topical antibiotics (mainly quinolones and aminoglycosides) with several antiseptics, including boric acid, acetic acid, povidone‑iodine and aluminium acetate. Follow‑up periods ranged from one‑to‑two weeks, two‑to‑four weeks, and longer than four weeks.\n\nHow does treatment affect ear discharge?\nQuinolone antibiotic ear drops probably help the ear stop draining more often than boric‑acid drops within two weeks – roughly 30 out of 100 people treated with quinolones have a dry ear compared with about 15 out of 100 with boric acid. Acetic‑acid antiseptic drops may give a small increase in the chance of stopping discharge compared with aminoglycoside antibiotic drops, but the evidence is uncertain. We do not have clear evidence that acetic‑acid drops differ from quinolone drops, and we cannot tell whether they affect ear pain. Compared with povidone‑iodine drops, quinolone drops probably make little or no difference to ear discharge.\n\nWhat about other outcomes?\nThe trials gave little information about ear pain, changes in hearing, or serious side‑effects. Where pain or irritation was measured, the results did not show obvious differences between antibiotic and antiseptic drops. No study reported health‑related quality of life or serious complications.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were small, and participants often knew which treatment they received, which can bias results. The trials did not report many outcomes that matter to patients, such as quality of life or long‑term hearing changes. Because of these limitations, our confidence in the findings ranges from low to moderate.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nThis review includes all eligible studies published up to June 2022.",

However, the draft contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse patients:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – the term “randomised controlled trials” appears without definition, leaving readers unsure what it means.\n2. **Long, noun‑heavy sentence** – “The trials compared topical antibiotics (mainly quinolones and aminoglycosides) with several antiseptics, including boric acid ... and in a few cases against systemic antibiotics.” packs many nouns and compounds, making it hard to follow.\n3. **Combined information in one sentence** – “We identified 15 randomised controlled trials that together included 2,371 participants.” mixes two ideas; splitting improves readability.\n4. **Imprecise phrasing** – the key‑message bullet “the chance is roughly twice as high” is vague; patients benefit from a concrete comparison.\n5. **Technical term without lay explanation** – “systemic antibiotics” is mentioned but not explained, which may be unclear for non‑clinical readers.\nThese issues outweigh the otherwise good metric conformity (e.g., low words_per_sentence, high active_voice) and need to be addressed before the PLS can be considered ready for patients.\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Define jargon: “randomised controlled trials – studies where participants are randomly assigned to one treatment or another.”\n- Split and simplify the long sentence: “We compared ear‑drop antibiotics (quinolones or aminoglycosides) with antiseptic drops such as boric acid, acetic acid, povidone‑iodine, and aluminium acetate. In some studies we also compared them with oral antibiotics.”\n- Separate the participant count: “We found 15 studies. Together they included 2,371 people with chronic ear infection.”\n- Make the key‑message concrete: “Antibiotic ear drops (quinolones) cleared ear discharge in about 30 out of 100 people, roughly twice the 15 out of 100 who used boric‑acid drops.”\n- Explain “systemic antibiotics”: “Systemic antibiotics are medicines taken by mouth or injection that work throughout the whole body.”\nThese revisions will make the summary clearer and more patient‑friendly.",
