  "draft": "Are antibiotic ear drops more effective than antiseptic ear drops for treating long‑lasting ear infections (chronic suppurative otitis media)?\n\nKey messages\n- Antibiotic ear drops (such as quinolones) probably clear ear discharge better than boric‑acid antiseptic drops within the first two weeks, but evidence for other antiseptics (acetic acid, povidone‑iodine) remains uncertain and side‑effects were not well reported.\n- The review found little data on ear pain, hearing changes, or serious complications, and the studies that did look at these outcomes showed no clear differences between antibiotic and antiseptic treatments.\n- Because the existing research is small, of limited quality, and short‑term, we need well‑designed, longer‑follow‑up studies to clarify the true benefits and harms of antibiotic versus antiseptic ear drops for chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media and why does it matter?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long‑lasting infection of the middle ear. It usually occurs when a hole forms in the thin skin covering the eardrum (the tympanic membrane), allowing fluid to leak out of the ear – this leaking fluid is called ear discharge (otorrhoea). People with CSOM often have persistent ear discharge and may lose some hearing. The condition can be uncomfortable, affect daily activities, and, if not treated well, can lead to more serious ear problems. Doctors try to eliminate the germs that cause the infection. Two main kinds of medicines are used: antibiotics – drugs that kill or stop the growth of bacteria, which can be applied as ear drops (topical) or taken by mouth or injection (systemic); and antiseptics – chemicals that also kill germs but are always applied directly to the ear as drops, powders, or washes. Both treatments aim to stop the discharge, improve hearing and avoid complications such as ear pain, irritation, or damage to the inner ear (ototoxicity).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe set out to compare the benefits and possible harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics when they are used to treat people with CSOM. Specifically, we wanted to know which treatment is more likely to make the ear stop leaking, improve hearing, reduce pain or irritation, and whether either treatment causes serious side‑effects or damage to the ear.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe searched major biomedical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared systemic antibiotics with topical antiseptics in people with CSOM.\n\nWhich studies did we include?\nWe included trials that randomly assigned participants to either an antibiotic or an antiseptic ear‑drop regimen and that followed participants for at least one week. All included studies met our population and intervention criteria.\n\nHow did we combine the results and assess certainty?\nWe combined results for ear discharge resolution, pain, hearing and other outcomes. We judged the confidence in each result using the GRADE approach, which rates the certainty of evidence from high to very low.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 15 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 2,371 participants with CSOM. The trials compared topical antibiotics (mainly quinolones and aminoglycosides) with several antiseptics, including acetic acid, boric acid, povidone‑iodine and aluminium acetate. Follow‑up periods ranged from one‑to‑two weeks, two‑to‑four weeks and longer than four weeks.\n\nWhat did we find about stopping ear discharge?\nQuinolone antibiotic ear drops probably increase the chance of a dry ear compared with boric‑acid ear drops within two weeks (moderate‑certainty evidence). Evidence for acetic‑acid antiseptic drops is uncertain: they may give a small increase in discharge resolution compared with aminoglycoside antibiotics, but we cannot tell whether they differ from quinolone antibiotics. We found very low‑certainty evidence that quinolone drops make little or no difference compared with povidone‑iodine drops. Overall, quinolone ear drops are the only option with reasonably certain evidence of benefit for stopping ear discharge.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small, participants often knew which treatment they received, and the trials did not report many outcomes we care about, such as quality of life, serious complications or detailed hearing changes.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes all studies identified up to June 2022.\n",

These errors must be corrected for the PLS to be accurate. 3) Minor clarity issues: a) Long, dense sentence in the \"What did we find about stopping ear discharge?\" paragraph could be split for readability; b) The bullet‑point list under \"Key messages\" uses a dash but the heading itself is not a question, creating inconsistency with the required structure. Suggested improvements: • Rewrite the methods heading to a question and correct the comparison wording (e.g., \"How did we search for studies?\" and \"We searched major biomedical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared topical antibiotics with topical antiseptics in people with CSOM.\"). • Remove the unsupported absolute percentages and instead report the relative risk (e.g., \"Quinolone ear drops probably increase the chance of a dry ear compared with boric‑acid drops within two weeks (moderate‑certainty evidence, risk ratio ≈ 1.9).\"). • Change the \"Key messages\" heading to a question such as \"What are the main findings?\" and keep the bullet list. • Split the long sentence about discharge outcomes into two shorter sentences for easier reading. These changes will bring the draft into compliance with the master style guide and ensure factual accuracy.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (710 words) and shows good overall conformity (55.6% of features in the best quartile). However, it deviates markedly on several complexity metrics: nominalizations (25, beyond P90), noun count (207, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.2, beyond P90), and counts of complex and long words, indicating a noun‑heavy, overly complex style. These metric alerts support the need to reduce nominalizations, simplify vocabulary, and use more active verbs, as reflected in the suggested rewrites."
