  "draft": "Are antibiotic ear drops more effective than antiseptic ear drops for treating long‑lasting ear infections (chronic suppurative otitis media)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Antibiotic ear drops that contain quinolones (a type of antibiotic) cleared ear discharge in about 30 out of 100 people, roughly twice the 15 out of 100 who used boric‑acid antiseptic drops.\n- Evidence comparing antibiotics with other antiseptics such as acetic acid or povidone‑iodine is uncertain, and the studies did not show clear differences in ear pain, hearing changes or serious side‑effects.\n- The research is based on small studies of limited quality, so larger, longer‑term trials are needed to confirm the benefits and harms.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media and why does it matter?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long‑lasting infection of the middle ear. It usually occurs when a hole forms in the thin skin covering the eardrum, allowing fluid to leak out of the ear – this leaking fluid is called ear discharge (otorrhoea). People with CSOM often have persistent discharge and may lose some hearing. The condition can be uncomfortable, affect daily activities, and, if not treated well, can lead to more serious ear problems. Doctors treat CSOM by trying to eliminate the germs that cause the infection. Two main kinds of medicines are used: antibiotics – drugs that kill or stop the growth of bacteria, which can be applied as ear drops (topical) or taken by mouth or injection (systemic); and antiseptics – chemicals that also kill germs but are always applied directly to the ear as drops, powders, or washes.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the benefits and possible harms of antibiotic ear drops versus antiseptic ear drops for people with CSOM. Specifically, we asked which treatment is more likely to stop the ear leaking, improve hearing, reduce pain or irritation, and whether either treatment causes serious side‑effects or damage to the inner ear (ototoxicity).\n\nHow did we look for studies?\nWe searched major biomedical databases for studies that compared topical antibiotics with topical antiseptics in people with CSOM. We included randomised controlled trials – studies where participants are randomly assigned to one treatment or another – that followed participants for at least one week.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 15 randomised controlled trials. Together they included 2,371 people with chronic ear infection. The trials compared ear‑drop antibiotics (mainly quinolones or aminoglycosides) with several antiseptic drops such as boric acid, acetic acid, povidone‑iodine and aluminium acetate. In a few studies the antibiotics were compared with systemic antibiotics – medicines taken by mouth or injection that work throughout the whole body. Follow‑up periods ranged from one‑to‑two weeks, two‑to‑four weeks, and longer than four weeks.\n\nHow does treatment affect ear discharge?\nQuinolone antibiotic ear drops probably help the ear stop draining more often than boric‑acid drops within two weeks – about 30 out of 100 people using quinolones have a dry ear compared with about 15 out of 100 using boric acid. Acetic‑acid antiseptic drops may give a small increase in the chance of stopping discharge compared with aminoglycoside antibiotic drops, but the evidence is uncertain. We do not have clear evidence that acetic‑acid drops differ from quinolone drops, and we cannot tell whether they affect ear pain. Compared with povidone‑iodine drops, quinolone drops probably make little or no difference to ear discharge.\n\nWhat about other outcomes?\nThe trials gave little information about ear pain, changes in hearing, or serious side‑effects. Where pain or irritation was measured, the results did not show obvious differences between antibiotic and antiseptic drops. No study reported health‑related quality of life or serious complications.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were small, and participants often knew which treatment they received, which can bias results. The trials did not report many outcomes that matter to patients, such as quality of life or long‑term hearing changes. Because of these limitations, our confidence in the findings ranges from low to moderate.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nThis review includes all eligible studies published up to June 2022.",
