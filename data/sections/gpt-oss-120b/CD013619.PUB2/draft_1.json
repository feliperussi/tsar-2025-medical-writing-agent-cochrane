  "draft": "Is having a family member present during emergency life‑saving treatment (CPR) better or worse for the family’s mental health?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Offering relatives the chance to be present while CPR (emergency life‑saving treatment) is performed may lower the chance of post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, a condition causing distress after a traumatic event) symptoms and reduce anxiety, depression and complicated grief (prolonged intense mourning) in the months after the event; no increase in psychological harm was reported, but the evidence is very uncertain because the available studies were small and had methodological problems.\n- The limited data also suggest that having a family member present does not appear to lengthen the time spent on resuscitation (the emergency treatment) or increase stress among healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, paramedics), but these findings come from only one small study.\n- Because the current research is sparse and of low quality, larger, well‑designed randomised trials (studies that assign participants to groups by chance) are needed to determine whether family presence truly benefits relatives’ mental health and to explore any possible harms or effects on patient care.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy might families want to be present when a loved one is being resuscitated?\nWhen a person’s heart stops or they become the focus of emergency medical care, doctors and nurses try to revive them – a process called resuscitation (often using CPR, a technique that pushes on the chest to keep blood flowing). Many patients and their relatives feel that being together during this critical moment is important for emotional support and shared decision‑making. Allowing a family member to stay in the room creates a three‑way relationship: it can affect the patient’s care, the relative’s emotional experience, and the healthcare professionals who are delivering treatment. Balancing the needs and well‑being of all three groups is the core challenge of family presence during resuscitation (FPDR).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe review set out to answer several questions:\n\n1. Primary question: Does offering relatives the option to watch resuscitation reduce or increase symptoms of post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – a condition where people feel intense fear, flashbacks, or anxiety after a stressful event?\n2. Secondary questions:\n   - How does FPDR influence other mental‑health outcomes for relatives, such as anxiety, depression, or complicated grief (a prolonged, intense sorrow that interferes with daily life)?\n   - Does having a family member present affect the patient’s health outcomes, including morbidity (illness or complications) and mortality (death)?\n   - What impact does FPDR have on the way medical staff deliver care during resuscitation?\n   - Does FPDR cause personal stress for healthcare professionals, and what are their attitudes toward allowing families to be present?\n\nIn short, the authors wanted to know whether letting families stay during life‑saving attempts helps or harms the relatives, the patients, and the medical team.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies comparing offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation with usual practice, summarised findings on relatives’ psychological outcomes, patient outcomes and staff stress, and rated confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two randomised trials that together included 595 adult relatives of patients who were undergoing emergency resuscitation. One larger study was a cluster‑randomised trial carried out in 2013 with French pre‑hospital emergency services and followed participants for one year; the smaller pilot trial was done in 1998 in a UK emergency department with a shorter, unspecified follow‑up. Participants were aged 19–78 years, about 56‑64 % were women, and they were relatives of patients who had cardiac arrest or other life‑threatening emergencies. In both trials the intervention was a systematic offer for relatives to be present during resuscitation, compared with the usual practice of not offering this option. The studies measured psychological outcomes in the relatives, and the French trial also looked at the length of resuscitation and staff stress. The evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether allowing relatives to be present reduces or increases symptoms such as post‑traumatic stress, anxiety, depression or complicated grief, nor whether it changes how long resuscitation lasts or how much stress staff experience.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical style requirement: all subheadings must be phrased as questions. Sections such as \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are presented as statements, not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide (5.3 Structure). Additionally, the text contains several clarity and readability problems that would confuse a lay reader:\n1. Long, dense sentences – e.g., \"We identified two randomised trials that together included 595 adult relatives of patients who were undergoing emergency res resuscitation...\" (31 words). Such sentences exceed the recommended 15‑20 word length and contribute to the high words‑per‑sentence metric (28.85, BEYOND_P90).\n2. Heavy use of nominalisations and noun clusters – e.g., \"the limited data also suggest that having a family member present does not appear to lengthen the time spent on resuscitation (the emergency treatment) or increase stress among healthcare professionals\" (34 words, many nouns). This drives the excessive noun count (228, BEYOND_P90) and nominalisation count (32, BEYOND_P90).\n3. Passive constructions that obscure the actor – e.g., \"The evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether allowing relatives to be present reduces or increases symptoms...\" (passive not extreme here, but overall passive voice count is 13, contributing to lower active‑voice score). Converting to active voice improves readability.\n4. Jargon without plain‑language definition – terms such as \"cluster‑randomised trial\", \"morbidity\", \"mortality\" appear without simple explanations, which can alienate patients.\n5. Bullet‑point formatting – the \"Key messages\" section is a paragraph rather than a bulleted list, making key take‑aways harder to scan.\n\nSuggested concrete rewrites:\n- Change subheadings to questions, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\", \"Why did we conduct this review?\", \"How did we find the studies?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n- Break long sentences into shorter ones, aiming for ≤20 words each.\n- Replace nominalisations with verbs: \"The limited data also suggest that families …\" → \"The limited data also show that families …\".\n- Define technical terms in plain language: \"morbidity (illness or complications)\" and \"mortality (death)\".\n- Present key messages as a bulleted list using dashes.\n\nMetrics support these edits: the draft’s readability scores are far above typical PLS ranges (FKGL 15.15, GFI 19.91, SMOG 15.04) and the words‑per‑sentence, nominalisation, noun, complex‑word, and long‑word counts all fall in the BEYOND_P90 zone, confirming the need to simplify sentence structure, reduce noun density, and lower lexical complexity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets the word‑count limit but deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns. Readability indices (FKGL 15.15, GFI 19.91, SMOG 15.04) are in the top 10% of difficulty, words per sentence (28.85) and nominalisations (32) are beyond the 90th percentile, and noun, complex‑word, and long‑word counts are also far above typical ranges. These metric outliers align with the identified clarity issues and indicate the text needs substantial simplification and restructuring."
