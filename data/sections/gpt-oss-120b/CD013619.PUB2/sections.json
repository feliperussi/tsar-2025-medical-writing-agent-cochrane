  "key_messages": [
    "Offering relatives the chance to be present while CPR (emergency life‑saving treatment) is performed may lower the chance of post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, a condition causing distress after a traumatic event) symptoms and reduce anxiety, depression and complicated grief (prolonged intense mourning) in the months after the event; no increase in psychological harm was reported, but the evidence is very uncertain because the available studies were small and had methodological problems.",
    "The limited data also suggest that having a family member present does not appear to lengthen the time spent on resuscitation (the emergency treatment) or increase stress among healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, paramedics), but these findings come from only one small study.",
    "Because the current research is sparse and of low quality, larger, well‑designed randomised trials (studies that assign participants to groups by chance) are needed to determine whether family presence truly benefits relatives’ mental health and to explore any possible harms or effects on patient care."

      "content": "When a person’s heart stops or they become the focus of emergency medical care, doctors and nurses try to revive them – a process called **resuscitation** (often using CPR, a technique that pushes on the chest to keep blood flowing). Many patients and their relatives feel that being together during this critical moment is important for emotional support and shared decision‑making. Allowing a family member to stay in the room creates a three‑way relationship: it can affect the patient’s care, the relative’s emotional experience, and the healthcare professionals who are delivering treatment. Balancing the needs and well‑being of all three groups is the core challenge of **family presence during resuscitation (FPDR)**."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to answer several questions:\n\n1. **Primary question:** Does offering relatives the option to watch resuscitation reduce or increase symptoms of **post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)** – a condition where people feel intense fear, flashbacks, or anxiety after a stressful event?\n2. **Secondary questions:**\n   - How does FPDR influence other mental‑health outcomes for relatives, such as anxiety, depression, or **complicated grief** (a prolonged, intense sorrow that interferes with daily life)?\n   - Does having a family member present affect the patient’s health outcomes, including **morbidity** (illness or complications) and **mortality** (death)?\n   - What impact does FPDR have on the way medical staff deliver care during resuscitation?\n   - Does FPDR cause personal stress for healthcare professionals, and what are their attitudes toward allowing families to be present?\n\nIn short, the authors wanted to know whether letting families stay during life‑saving attempts helps or harms the relatives, the patients, and the medical team."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified two randomised trials that together included 595 adult relatives of patients who were undergoing emergency res resuscitation. One larger study was a cluster‑randomised trial carried out in 2013 with French pre‑hospital emergency services and followed participants for one year; the smaller pilot trial was done in 1998 in a UK emergency department with a shorter, unspecified follow‑up. Participants were aged 19–78 years, about 56‑64 % were women, and they were relatives of patients who had cardiac arrest or other life‑threatening emergencies. In both trials the intervention was a systematic offer for relatives to be present during resuscitation, compared with the usual practice of not offering this option. The studies measured psychological outcomes in the relatives, and the French trial also looked at the length of resuscitation and staff stress. The evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether allowing relatives to be present reduces or increases symptoms such as post‑traumatic stress, anxiety, depression or complicated grief, nor whether it changes how long resuscitation lasts or how much stress staff experience."
