  "draft": "Is having a family member present during emergency life‑saving treatment (CPR) better or worse for the family’s mental health?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Offering relatives the chance to watch CPR may lower the risk of post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, a condition causing distress after a traumatic event) and may also reduce anxiety, depression and complicated grief (prolonged intense mourning) in the months after the event. No increase in psychological harm was reported, but the evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological problems.\n- The limited data also show that family presence does not lengthen the time spent on resuscitation (the emergency treatment) and does not increase stress among healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, paramedics). These findings come from only one small study.\n- Because the current research is sparse and of low quality, larger, well‑designed randomised trials (studies that assign participants to groups by chance) are needed to confirm any benefits or harms for relatives and to explore effects on patient care.\n\nWhy might families want to be present when a loved one is being resuscitated?\nWhen a person’s heart stops or they need emergency medical care, doctors and nurses try to revive them – a process called resuscitation (often using CPR, a technique that pushes on the chest to keep blood flowing). Many patients and relatives feel that being together at this critical moment provides emotional support and helps shared decision‑making. Allowing a family member to stay creates a three‑way relationship that can affect the patient’s care, the relative’s experience, and the healthcare team.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether offering relatives the option to watch resuscitation changes the likelihood of PTSD symptoms. We also asked whether family presence influences other mental‑health outcomes for relatives (anxiety, depression, complicated grief), patient outcomes such as morbidity (illness or complications) and mortality (death), the way medical staff deliver care, and the stress levels of healthcare professionals.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL) and trial registries up to 22 March 2022. We looked for randomised trials that compared offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation with usual practice where the option is not offered.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two randomised trials that together included 595 adult relatives of patients who experienced emergency resuscitation. One larger trial (2013, France) involved pre‑hospital emergency services and followed participants for one year. The smaller pilot trial (1998, UK) was conducted in an emergency department with a shorter follow‑up. Relatives were aged 19–78 years, and 56‑64 % were women. Both trials offered a systematic invitation for relatives to be present, compared with not offering the option. The French trial also measured how long resuscitation lasted and staff stress. The evidence is very uncertain: we cannot say whether family presence reduces or increases PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression or complicated grief, nor whether it changes resuscitation duration or staff stress.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants knew which group they were in and the studies were very small, leading to high risk of bias.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to the March 2022 search.\n",
