  "draft": "How accurate are blood tests (such as serum retinol (vitamin A level in blood) and retinol‑binding protein) for detecting vitamin A deficiency in people at risk?\n\nKey messages\n- Blood tests that measure serum retinol (the vitamin A level in the blood) or retinol‑binding protein (the protein that carries vitamin A) are not very good at finding people who actually have vitamin A deficiency (they have low sensitivity), but they are fairly good at confirming people who do not have the deficiency (they have high specificity). No harmful effects of the tests were reported.\n- Other approaches such as the relative dose response test (a method that assesses how the body handles a dose of vitamin A) have very limited data, and the overall evidence comes from studies that were not designed specifically to evaluate test accuracy, making the results uncertain.\n- Because the existing studies are few, not designed as diagnostic accuracy studies, and provide uncertain evidence, more well‑designed research is needed that directly compares these blood tests with reliable reference standards (the best available methods for determining true vitamin A status) and reports both how well they detect deficiency and any potential harms.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhy is vitamin A deficiency a serious health problem?\nVitamin A is a nutrient that helps the body grow, keep the immune system strong, and maintain healthy eyes. When people do not get enough vitamin A, they can experience poor growth, weaker immunity, more infections, eye problems that can lead to blindness, and higher risk of death for mothers and children. Because these effects are severe, health workers need reliable ways to find out who is lacking vitamin A so they can give treatment, usually in the form of vitamin A supplements.\n\nWhat tests are used to check vitamin A status and why might they be imperfect?\nSeveral laboratory tests are used to estimate how much vitamin A a person has:\n- Serum or plasma retinol (SR) measures the amount of vitamin A circulating in the blood.\n- Retinol‑binding protein (RBP) is a protein that carries vitamin A in the blood; its level can give an indirect clue about vitamin A status.\n- Relative dose response (RDR) looks at how the body’s vitamin A stores change after a small dose of the vitamin.\n- Retinol isotope dilution (RID) and liver vitamin A measurement are considered reference standards because they more directly assess the body’s vitamin A stores, but they are more complex and not always available.\nThese \"index tests\" (SR, RBP, RDR) are easier to perform, yet they may not correctly identify people who truly have low vitamin A (low sensitivity) or may incorrectly label people as deficient when they are not (low specificity). Understanding how well these tests work is essential for making accurate diagnoses.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors set out to determine how accurate the commonly used laboratory tests (serum/plasma retinol, retinol‑binding protein, and relative dose response) are at detecting subclinical vitamin A deficiency in people who are at risk. They also wanted to explore whether factors such as the type of reference standard used or the cut‑off values applied might explain differences in test performance across studies.\n\nMethods\nMethods\nWe searched databases for studies that measured vitamin A status with both a reference standard and an index test, combined their accuracy results, and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 40 distinct studies (reported as 65 records) that looked at laboratory‑based biomarkers for vitamin A deficiency in people considered at risk. Sample sizes varied widely, from a few dozen participants to more than a thousand. For example, 385 participants across 23 studies were examined for serum or plasma retinol compared with the retinol isotope dilution reference standard, and 1,110 participants provided data for the same comparison’s specificity. The abstract did not give details about how long the studies lasted, who funded them, or the participants’ age, gender, severity of deficiency, or the countries where the research was done. The index tests evaluated were serum or plasma retinol, retinol‑binding protein, relative dose response, and breast‑milk vitamin A. These were compared with reference standards of retinol isotope dilution or liver vitamin A concentrations. No studies examined modified relative dose response methods. Most of the included investigations were not designed as diagnostic‑test‑accuracy studies, and the risk of bias was generally judged as unclear.\n\nMain results: Diagnostic accuracy of vitamin A deficiency tests\nSerum or plasma retinol testing probably makes little to no difference in correctly identifying people who truly have vitamin A deficiency, and we are very uncertain about this result. The same test may lead to a large increase in correctly identifying people who do not have the deficiency, but the certainty of this finding is low. Testing retinol‑binding protein may greatly improve the ability to rule out deficiency (moderate certainty), although it appears to detect only about half of the people who actually have the deficiency, and we are uncertain about that detection rate. Relative dose response testing probably also leads to a large increase in correctly ruling out deficiency (low certainty), but there is not enough information to know how well it detects true deficiency.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft does not meet the mandatory style requirements: (1) subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Methods\", \"Results\"), which violates the Master Style Guide; (2) the total word count is 983, exceeding the 850‑word limit for a Plain Language Summary. These critical failures mean the summary cannot be approved. Additionally, the text contains several clarity and readability problems that should be addressed:\n\n\n1. **Long, dense sentences** – many sentences exceed 30 words, making them hard to follow (e.g., \"The review included 40 distinct studies (reported as 65 records) that looked at laboratory‑based biomarkers for vitamin A deficiency in people considered at risk.\").\n   *Rewrite:* \"The review looked at 40 studies (65 records) that examined laboratory tests for vitamin A deficiency in people at risk.\"\n\n2. **Excessive passive voice** – the draft uses passive constructions that hide who did what (e.g., \"The abstract did not give details about how long the studies lasted, who funded them, or the participants’ age…\").\n   *Rewrite:* \"The abstract does not tell us how long the studies lasted, who funded them, or the participants’ age, gender, and other details.\"\n\n3. **Jargon without plain‑language definitions** – terms such as \"specificity\" and \"sensitivity\" appear without simple explanations, which can confuse patients.\n   *Rewrite:* \"Sensitivity (how well the test finds people who really have the deficiency) is low, while specificity (how well the test shows people who do not have the deficiency) is not needed) is high.\"\n\n4. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – the current headings do not guide the reader and breach the style guide.\n   *Rewrite examples:*\n   - Change \"Key messages\" to \"What are the main findings?\"\n   - Change \"Methods\" to \"How did we find the evidence?\"\n   - Change \"Results\" to \"What did we discover?\"\n   - Change \"Limitations\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n   - Change \"Currency\" to \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"\n\n5. **Word count excess** – the summary is 983 words, 133 words over the limit. Cutting redundant phrases, merging bullet points, and removing repeated explanations will bring it under 850 words.\n\n**Metrics support:** The PLS evaluation shows a very high words_per_sentence score (30.7, beyond the 90th percentile) and a high passive_voice count (23, also beyond the 90th percentile). These metrics confirm the readability issues noted above. The draft also exceeds typical ranges for complex_words, long_words, and noun density, contributing to the high reading grade levels (F. 15.3, Gunning 20.6). Reducing sentence length, passive constructions, and noun‑heavy phrasing will improve the readability scores toward typical PLS ranges.\n\nAddressing the subheading format, trimming the word count, and simplifying language as outlined will bring the summary into compliance with the Master Style Guide and Cochrane Plain Language standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns: word count 983 (>850 limit); words_per_sentence 30.7 (BEYOND P90); passive_voice 23 (P90); nominalization 26 (P90); nouns 305 (BEYOND P90); readability indices (FK 15.3, GFI 20.6, ARI 16.2) are all beyond the 90th percentile. These metrics indicate overly long, passive, noun‑heavy sentences and excessive complexity, confirming the need for shorter, active, verb‑focused wording and reduced jargon."
