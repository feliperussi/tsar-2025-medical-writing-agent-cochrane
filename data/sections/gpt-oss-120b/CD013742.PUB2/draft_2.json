  "draft": "How accurate are blood tests for detecting vitamin A deficiency in people at risk?\n\nKey messages\n- Blood tests that measure serum retinol (the vitamin A level in blood) or retinol‑binding protein (the protein that carries vitamin A) have low sensitivity (they miss many people who truly have deficiency) but high specificity (they correctly identify most people who do not have deficiency). No harmful effects of the tests were reported.\n- The relative dose response test, which looks at how the body handles a small dose of vitamin A, has very limited data and the existing studies were not designed to evaluate test accuracy, so the results are uncertain.\n- Because the current evidence is sparse and of low certainty, we need well‑designed studies that compare these blood tests directly with reliable reference standards and report both how well they detect deficiency and any potential harms.\n\nWhy is vitamin A deficiency a serious health problem?\nVitamin A helps the body grow, keeps the immune system strong, and maintains healthy eyes. When people lack vitamin A they may experience poor growth, weaker immunity, more infections, eye problems that can lead to blindness, and higher risk of death for mothers and children. Health workers therefore need reliable ways to identify deficiency so they can provide vitamin A supplements.\n\nWhat tests are used to check vitamin A status and why might they be imperfect?\nWe use several laboratory tests:\n- Serum or plasma retinol (SR) measures the amount of vitamin A circulating in the blood.\n- Retinol‑binding protein (RBP) measures a protein that carries vitamin A in the blood‑stream.\n- Relative dose response (RDR) assesses how the body’s vitamin A stores change after a small dose of the vitamin.\n- Retinol isotope dilution (RID) and liver vitamin A measurement are considered reference standards because they more directly assess body stores, but they are complex and not always available.\nThe easier “index tests” (SR, RBP, RDR) may miss people who truly have low vitamin A (low sensitivity) or incorrectly label people as deficient when they are not (low specificity).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to determine how accurate the common index tests (SR, RBP, RDR) are at detecting subclinical vitamin A deficiency in at‑risk individuals. We also explored whether the type of reference standard or the cut‑off values used might explain differences in test performance.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and six other databases up to 18 August 2022 without language or age restrictions. We included studies that measured vitamin A status with both an index test and a reference standard. Two reviewers screened records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS‑2 tool, and we used GRADE to judge certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we discover?\nWe identified 40 studies (reported as 65 records). Most were not designed as diagnostic‑test‑accuracy studies, and risk of bias was generally unclear.\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- Serum or plasma retinol showed very low sensitivity (about 10‑13 % against RID and 53‑54 % against liver vitamin A) but high specificity (92‑94 % against RID and 79‑83 % against liver vitamin A). Certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to low.\n- Retinol‑binding protein had moderate sensitivity (around 45‑50 % against RID) and moderate to high specificity (76‑98 %). Certainty was low to moderate.\n- Relative dose response provided only specificity data (around 89‑91 % against RID) and no sensitivity data. Certainty was low.\nOverall, the index tests tend to miss many true cases of deficiency (low sensitivity) while correctly ruling out most people who are not deficient (high specificity). The evidence is uncertain because the studies were small, not designed for accuracy assessment, and often lacked complete data.\n\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the results because the studies were not randomised, participants and investigators were often aware of the test being used, many studies were small, and several did not report all outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence search was current to August 2022.\n",
