  "key_messages": [
    "Blood tests that measure serum retinol (the vitamin A level in the blood) or retinol‑binding protein (the protein that carries vitamin A) are not very good at finding people who actually have vitamin A deficiency (they have low sensitivity), but they are fairly good at confirming people who do not have the deficiency (they have high specificity). No harmful effects of the tests were reported.",
    "Other approaches such as the relative dose response test (a method that assesses how the body handles a dose of vitamin A) have very limited data, and the overall evidence comes from studies that were not designed specifically to evaluate test accuracy, making the results uncertain.",
    "Because the existing studies are few, not designed as diagnostic accuracy studies, and provide uncertain evidence, more well‑designed research is needed that directly compares these blood tests with reliable reference standards (the best available methods for determining true vitamin A status) and reports both how well they detect deficiency and any potential harms."

      "subheading": "Why is vitamin A deficiency a serious health problem?",
      "content": "Vitamin A is a nutrient that helps the body grow, keep the immune system strong, and maintain healthy eyes. When people do not get enough vitamin A, they can experience poor growth, weaker immunity, more infections, eye problems that can lead to blindness, and higher risk of death for mothers and children. Because these effects are severe, health workers need reliable ways to find out who is lacking vitamin A so they can give treatment, usually in the form of vitamin A supplements."

      "subheading": "What tests are used to check vitamin A status and why might they be imperfect?",
      "content": "Several laboratory tests are used to estimate how much vitamin A a person has:\n- Serum or plasma retinol (SR) measures the amount of vitamin A circulating in the blood.\n- Retinol‑binding protein (RBP) is a protein that carries vitamin A in the blood; its level can give an indirect clue about vitamin A status.\n- Relative dose response (RDR) looks at how the body’s vitamin A stores change after a small dose of the vitamin.\n- Retinol isotope dilution (RID) and liver vitamin A measurement are considered reference standards because they more directly assess the body’s vitamin A stores, but they are more complex and not always available.\nThese \"index tests\" (SR, RBP, RDR) are easier to perform, yet they may not correctly identify people who truly have low vitamin A (low sensitivity) or may incorrectly label people as deficient when they are not (low specificity). Understanding how well these tests work is essential for making accurate diagnoses."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to determine how accurate the commonly used laboratory tests (serum/plasma retinol, retinol‑binding protein, and relative dose response) are at detecting subclinical vitamin A deficiency in people who are at risk. They also wanted to explore whether factors such as the type of reference standard used or the cut‑off values applied might explain differences in test performance across studies."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 40 distinct studies (reported as 65 records) that looked at laboratory‑based biomarkers for vitamin A deficiency in people considered at risk. Sample sizes varied widely, from a few dozen participants to more than a thousand. For example, 385 participants across 23 studies were examined for serum or plasma retinol compared with the retinol isotope dilution reference standard, and 1,110 participants provided data for the same comparison’s specificity. The abstract did not give details about how long the studies lasted, who funded them, or the participants’ age, gender, severity of deficiency, or the countries where the research was done. The index tests evaluated were serum or plasma retinol, retinol‑binding protein, relative dose response, and breast‑milk vitamin A. These were compared with reference standards of retinol isotope dilution or liver vitamin A concentrations. No studies examined modified relative dose response methods. Most of the included investigations were not designed as diagnostic‑test‑accuracy studies, and the risk of bias was generally judged as unclear."

      "subheading": "Main results: Diagnostic accuracy of vitamin A deficiency tests",
      "content": "Serum or plasma retinol testing probably makes little to no difference in correctly identifying people who truly have vitamin A deficiency, and we are very uncertain about this result. The same test may lead to a large increase in correctly identifying people who do not have the deficiency, but the certainty of this finding is low. Testing retinol‑binding protein may greatly improve the ability to rule out deficiency (moderate certainty), although it appears to detect only about half of the people who actually have the deficiency, and we are uncertain about that detection rate. Relative dose response testing probably also leads to a large increase in correctly ruling out deficiency (low certainty), but there is not enough information to know how well it detects true deficiency."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search."
