  "draft": "Do digital health tools (like apps, wearables, text messages, video‑game exercise, or telehealth) help children and teenagers lose weight compared with usual care?\n\n- Digital health tools (such as apps, wearables, text messages, video‑game exercise, or telehealth) used together with usual care (standard treatment without digital components) may lead to a small reduction in body fat (the amount of fat in the body) in children and teenagers, with no reported harmful effects, but the evidence is limited and only reflects short‑term outcomes (lasting a few months).\n- When digital health tools are used alone, without the addition of usual care, the current studies do not show a clear benefit for weight‑related outcomes, and no information on possible side effects (unwanted or harmful effects) was provided.\n- More high‑quality research is needed, especially larger and longer‑lasting studies that report any side effects, examine different age groups, genders and ethnic backgrounds, and compare digital tools with and without other diet or physical‑activity programmes.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\n\nWhy is childhood obesity a public health problem?\nBeing overweight or obese as a child or teenager is a growing worldwide issue. In 2016 more than 340 million young people aged 5‑19 had excess weight. Carrying extra body fat at a young age raises the chance of developing long‑term illnesses such as type‑2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers later in life. It can also affect a child’s physical comfort, mental well‑being, and quality of life.\n\nWhat are the usual ways to help children lose weight?\nTraditional (or \"conventional\") care usually involves advice on healthier eating, structured diet plans, and programmes that encourage more physical activity. These may be delivered through face‑to‑face counselling, school‑based lessons, or printed materials, and they do not use any digital technology.\n\nWhat are digital health interventions?\nDigital health interventions are tools that use technology to support health goals. In the context of obesity they can include:\n- Wearable or implantable devices that track activity or heart rate\n- Web‑based programmes or mobile apps that give diet and exercise guidance\n- Text‑message reminders or coaching\n- \"Exergaming\" (active video games that require movement)\n- Telehealth sessions where clinicians meet patients online.\nThese tools are meant to be used either together with conventional care or on their own.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether using digital health tools helps children and adolescents manage obesity. Specifically, they compared:\n1. Digital tools **plus** conventional care versus conventional care alone, and\n2. Digital tools **alone** versus conventional care alone.\nThey looked at outcomes such as changes in body fat, weight, physical activity, well‑being, and any possible side effects.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that tested digital health interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents, compared them with conventional care (alone or combined), combined the findings, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 15 randomised controlled trials that included a total of 911 young people with obesity. All participants were aged 10 to 19 years; ten trials enrolled only this age group while five also included younger children (0‑9 years). Obesity was defined using WHO growth references, but the studies did not report participants' gender or ethnicity. The trials were carried out in ten countries – five in the United States, three in Sweden, and one each in Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland and Thailand. Nine studies lasted less than six months and six lasted six months or longer. The digital health interventions tested included wearables, web‑based platforms, text messaging, mobile apps, exergaming and telehealth. In eight trials the digital tool was added to usual care and compared with usual care alone; in seven trials the digital tool was used by itself and compared with usual care alone. No adverse‑event data were reported and the abstract did not give information about funding sources.\n\nMain results: Body‑fat reduction\nDigital interventions used together with usual care probably reduce body fat slightly in children and adolescents with obesity. It is unclear whether digital interventions, whether used alone or together with usual care, have any effect on other health outcomes or cause adverse events.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we are interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025 of search.",

Additionally, the draft contains excessive passive constructions (27 instances, far beyond the typical PLS range) and a very high noun count (234, well above the median), contributing to dense, noun‑heavy sentences that reduce readability. Key improvements: 1) Re‑write the subheadings for Methods, Limitations, and Currency as questions (e.g., \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"). 2) Convert passive sentences to active voice (e.g., change \"No adverse‑event data were reported\" to \"We found no adverse‑event data\"). 3) Reduce noun‑heavy phrasing by using more verbs (e.g., replace \"The digital interventions used together with usual care probably reduce body fat slightly\" with \"Digital tools added to usual care probably lower body fat a little\"). 4) Shorten long sentences and replace complex words where possible to lower the SMOG index and complex‑word counts. These changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability.",

These indicate the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many passive constructions, which hampers plain‑language clarity."
