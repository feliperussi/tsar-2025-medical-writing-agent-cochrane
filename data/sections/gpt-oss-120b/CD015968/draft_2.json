  "draft": "Do digital health tools (like apps, wearables, text messages, video‑game exercise, or telehealth) help children and teenagers lose weight compared with usual care?\n\nKey messages:\n- When digital tools are added to usual care, they probably lower body‑fat a little in children and teenagers with obesity, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Digital tools used on their own did not show a clear benefit for weight‑related outcomes, and studies did not report side‑effects.\n- More large, longer‑term studies are needed that track safety and examine different ages, genders and ethnic groups.\n\nWhy is childhood obesity a public health problem?\nBeing overweight or obese as a child or teenager is a growing worldwide issue. In 2016 more than 340 million young people aged 5‑19 had excess weight. Carrying extra body fat at a young age raises the chance of developing long‑term illnesses such as type‑2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers later in life. It can also affect a child’s physical comfort, mental well‑being and quality of life.\n\nWhat are the usual ways to help children lose weight?\nTraditional (conventional) care usually offers advice on healthier eating, structured diet plans and programmes that encourage more physical activity. These may be delivered through face‑to‑face counselling, school‑based lessons or printed materials and do not use any digital technology.\n\nWhat are digital health interventions?\nDigital health interventions are tools that use technology to support health goals. In obesity they can include:\n- Wearable or implantable devices that track activity or heart rate\n- Web‑based programmes or mobile apps that give diet and exercise guidance\n- Text‑message reminders or coaching\n- “Exergaming” (active video games that require movement)\n- Telehealth sessions where clinicians meet patients online.\nThese tools can be used together with conventional care or on their own.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether digital health tools help children and adolescents manage obesity. Specifically we compared:\n1. Digital tools **plus** conventional care versus conventional care alone, and\n2. Digital tools **alone** versus conventional care alone.\nWe looked at outcomes such as body‑fat, weight, physical activity, well‑being and any side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched four major databases and two trial registers for randomised controlled trials that tested digital tools for obesity in children (0‑9 years) and adolescents (10‑19 years). The last search was on 14 April 2025. We included 15 trials with a total of 911 participants aged 10‑19 years. The studies were carried out in ten countries and used wearables, web platforms, text messages, apps, exergaming or telehealth. Eight trials added a digital tool to usual care, and seven used a digital tool alone. We extracted data on body‑fat, weight, activity, well‑being and adverse events, and we rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nDigital tools added to usual care probably lower body‑fat a little (average reduction about 2‑3 %). The effect on other outcomes such as weight, activity or well‑being was unclear. When digital tools were used alone, we did not see a clear benefit for any outcome. No study reported adverse‑event data, so we cannot comment on safety.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the trials were small and short‑term, and they did not report participants’ gender, ethnicity or side‑effects. The evidence therefore does not cover all people, interventions or outcomes we are interested in.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence includes all studies identified up to 14 April 2025.\n",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical checks: (1) The age description is inaccurate – it says all participants were aged 10‑19 years, but the source notes that five studies also included younger children (0‑9 years). (2) Several key terms are not explained for a lay audience, e.g., “GRADE” and “moderately confident”, which may confuse readers. (3) The text contains excessive passive constructions (e.g., “The last search was on 14 April 2025”), contributing to reduced clarity. These issues, together with the high number of passive sentences (19, P90) and noun‑heavy language (186 nouns, P90), mean the summary would likely confuse patients. The draft needs revision to correct the age range, define technical terms, and convert passive sentences to active voice before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall but deviates on five metrics: passive_voice (19, beyond typical P90), nouns (186, beyond P90), smog_index (13.8, beyond P90), complex_words_dc (264, beyond P90) and complex_words (130, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more passive, noun‑heavy, and uses many complex words than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need for simplification and active‑voice revisions."
