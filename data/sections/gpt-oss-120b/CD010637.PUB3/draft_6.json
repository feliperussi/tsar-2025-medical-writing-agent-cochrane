  "draft": "Does regular exercise improve symptoms and quality of life for people with chronic vein problems (poor blood flow in the legs) that have not yet caused leg ulcers?\n\nKey messages?\n- Current evidence does not show a clear benefit of regular exercise programmes for people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) on symptoms or overall wellbeing, and no harms were reported.\n- Small studies hinted at possible improvements in symptoms, blood‑flow measures and muscle strength, but the evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and of low quality.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials with standardised exercise protocols and longer follow‑up are needed.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency and why does it matter?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a long‑lasting problem where the veins in the legs do not return blood to the heart efficiently (poor blood flow in the legs). This can cause swelling, aching, skin changes and may progress to painful leg ulcers (open sores). Even before ulcers appear, CVI can lower quality of life, limit daily activities and raise the risk of future complications. Typical treatments aim to improve blood flow, for example by wearing compression stockings, taking medicines, or, in severe cases, having surgery.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover whether structured physical‑exercise programmes are safe and effective for people who have CVI but no leg ulcers. Specifically, we examined whether exercise can reduce the severity of signs and symptoms, improve blood‑flow measures (such as how quickly blood refills the veins), prevent ulcers, and enhance quality of life, muscle strength and overall mobility, while also checking for any harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to exercise or no exercise) that included people with non‑ulcerated CVI. We extracted the results and compared them, and we used the GRADE approach (a system that rates how confident we can be in the evidence) to assess our certainty in each outcome.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five small randomised trials that together enrolled 146 participants with non‑ulcerated CVI. All trials compared a structured exercise programme with no structured exercise, and follow‑up lasted from about two to six months. The review does not provide details about participants’ ages, gender, disease severity, study locations or funding sources, and none of the trials reported new venous leg ulcers. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether exercise improves disease signs or symptoms, leg‑vein blood flow, vein‑refill time, quality of life, exercise capacity, muscle strength or ankle movement. In short, we lack reliable evidence to say that exercise helps or harms people with this condition.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which group they were in, the studies were very small, and not all outcomes were reported.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to March 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural and factual requirements, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader. Key issues are: (1) technical jargon such as “GRADE approach”, “randomised controlled trials”, and “non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency” is not fully explained in plain language; (2) a very long sentence lists many outcomes, making it hard to follow; (3) the sentence about missing participant details is dense and contains several unfamiliar terms; (4) overall the text contains many Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (complex_words_dc = 223, far above the typical <160), indicating the language is too technical. The following concrete rewrites address these problems.\n\n1. Problematic sentence: “We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to exercise or no exercise) that included people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). We extracted the results and compared them, and we used the GRADE approach (a system that rates how confident we can be in the evidence) to assess our certainty in each outcome.”\n   Why it’s problematic: “randomised controlled trials”, “non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency”, and “GRADE approach” are technical terms that many patients will not understand.\n   Suggested rewrite: “We looked for studies that randomly placed people with chronic vein problems (but no leg ulcers) into either an exercise group or a no‑exercise group. We then compared the results and used a simple rating system (called GRADE) to show how sure we can be about each finding.”\n\n2. Problematic sentence: “Overall, the evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether exercise improves disease signs or symptoms, leg‑vein blood flow, vein‑refill time, quality of life, ability to exercise, muscle strength or ankle movement.”\n   Why it’s problematic: The sentence is long (>30 words) and packs many outcomes together, which can overwhelm the reader.\n   Suggested rewrite: “Overall, the evidence is very uncertain. We cannot say whether exercise helps with any of the following: the severity of symptoms, blood flow in the leg veins, how quickly the veins refill, quality of life, ability to exercise, muscle strength, or ankle movement.”\n\n3. Problematic sentence: “The review does not provide details about participants’ ages, gender, disease severity, study locations or funding sources, and none of the trials reported new venous leg ulcers.”\n   Why it’s problematic: The sentence is dense and uses several unfamiliar words (e.g., “disease severity”, “venous”).\n   Suggested rewrite: “The studies did not tell us the ages or gender of the participants, how severe their vein problems were, where the research was done, or who funded it. None of the trials reported any new leg ulcers.”\n\n4. General issue: Frequent use of unfamiliar words (e.g., “non‑ulcerated”, “vascular”, “refill”, “randomised”, “GRADE”).\n   Why it’s problematic: The high complex_words_dc score (223) shows the text is harder than typical plain‑language summaries.\n   Suggested rewrite: Replace technical terms with everyday language throughout the summary (e.g., use “leg vein problems that have not yet caused sores” instead of “non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency”, “how quickly blood returns to the veins” instead of “vein‑refill time”, and “how sure we are about the results” instead of the “GRADE” system). These changes will bring the draft’s language closer to the typical PLS range (complex_words_dc < 160) and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most PLS metrics (e.g., Flesch Reading Ease 52.8, words per sentence 22.2, active voice 56%). The only notable deviation is a high complex_words_dc score (223, P90), indicating many unfamiliar words. Addressing jargon and simplifying wording, as suggested above, will align the text with typical PLS patterns."
