  "draft": "Does regular exercise improve symptoms and quality of life for people with chronic vein problems (poor blood flow in the legs) that have not yet caused leg ulcers?\n\nKey messages –\n- Current evidence does not show a clear benefit of regular exercise programmes for people with leg vein problems that have not yet caused sores, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Small studies hinted at possible improvements in symptoms, blood‑flow measures and muscle strength, but the evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and of low quality.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials with standardised exercise protocols and longer follow‑up are needed.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency and why does it matter?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a long‑lasting problem where the veins in the legs do not move blood back to the heart as well as they should. This can cause swelling, aching, skin changes and, in some people, can progress to painful leg ulcers (open sores). Even before ulcers appear, CVI can lower quality of life, limit daily activities and increase the risk of future complications. Typical treatments aim to improve blood flow, for example by wearing compression stockings, taking medicines, or, in severe cases, having surgery. Researchers have wondered whether regular physical exercise might also help.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether structured exercise programmes are safe and effective for people who have CVI but no leg ulcers. Specifically, we looked at whether exercise can reduce the severity of signs and symptoms, improve blood‑flow measures (such as how quickly blood returns to the veins), prevent ulcers, and enhance quality of life, muscle strength and overall mobility, while also checking for any harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe looked for studies that randomly placed people with leg vein problems (but no ulcers) into either an exercise group or a no‑exercise group. We then compared the results and used a simple rating system (called GRADE) to show how sure we can be about each finding.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five small randomised trials that together enrolled 146 people with CVI that had not yet caused ulcers. All studies compared a structured exercise programme with no structured exercise, and follow‑up lasted from about two to six months. The studies did not tell us the ages or gender of the participants, how severe their vein problems were, where the research was done, or who funded it. None of the trials reported any new leg ulcers. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain. We cannot say whether exercise helps with any of the following: severity of symptoms, blood flow in the leg veins, how quickly the veins refill, quality of life, ability to exercise, muscle strength or ankle movement. In short, we lack reliable evidence to say that exercise helps or harms people with this condition.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which group they were in, the studies were very small, and not all outcomes were reported.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to March 2022.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft passes the checklist (all required sections, question‑style headings, factual accuracy and word‑count), but several clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – the term “GRADE” is introduced only as “a simple rating system (called GRADE)”. Readers are unlikely to know what this means. *Rewrite*: “We used a system called GRADE, which tells us how confident we are in each finding.”\n2. **Awkward phrasing** – “randomly placed people” is not natural for a non‑technical audience. *Rewrite*: “We randomly assigned people …”.\n3. **Overly dense sentence** – “The studies did not tell us the ages or gender of the participants, how severe their vein problems were, where the research was done, or who funded it.” This 28‑word sentence packs many ideas and can overwhelm readers. *Rewrite*: “The studies did not report the participants’ ages or gender, how severe their vein problems were, the countries where the research was carried out, or the sources of funding.”\n4. **Missing bullet list for outcomes** – the long list after “We cannot say whether exercise helps with any of the following:” is hard to scan. *Rewrite*: turn the list into a bullet list (e.g., “‑ severity of symptoms\n‑ blood‑flow in the leg veins\n‑ how quickly the veins refill\n‑ quality of life\n‑ ability to exercise\n‑ muscle strength\n‑ ankle movement”).\n5. **High number of unfamiliar words** – the metric shows 220 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (P90). Words such as “non‑ulcerated”, “structured”, “randomised”, “GRADE”, “vascular” can be replaced with simpler alternatives (“without ulcers”, “planned”, “randomized”, “confidence rating”, “vein”). Reducing these will bring the text closer to typical PLS readability.\nThese issues together constitute more than three significant clarity problems, so the draft cannot be approved as‑is as‑is.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most PLS metrics (e.g., readability scores in the 75th percentile, active voice 55, pronouns 31). The only notable deviation is the high Dale‑Chall unfamiliar word count (220, P90), indicating many words that are not on the familiar‑word list. Addressing this by simplifying terminology will improve lay‑readability."
