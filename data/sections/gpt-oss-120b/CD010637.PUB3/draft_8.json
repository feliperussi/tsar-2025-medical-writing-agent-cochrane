  "draft": "Does regular exercise improve symptoms and quality of life for people with chronic vein problems (poor blood flow in the legs) that have not yet caused leg ulcers?\n\nKey messages –\n- Current evidence does not show a clear benefit of regular exercise programmes (planned physical activity) for people with chronic vein problems without ulcers, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Small studies hinted at possible improvements in symptoms, blood‑flow measures and muscle strength, but the evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and of low quality.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials with standardised exercise protocols and longer follow‑up are needed.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency and why does it matter?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a long‑lasting problem where the veins in the legs do not move blood back to the heart as well as they should. This can cause swelling, aching, skin changes and, in some people, can progress to painful leg ulcers (open sores). Even before ulcers appear, CVI can lower quality of life, limit daily activities and increase the risk of future complications.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether planned exercise programmes are safe and effective for people who have CVI but no leg ulcers. Specifically, we looked at whether exercise can reduce the severity of signs and symptoms, improve blood‑flow measures (such as how quickly blood returns to the veins), prevent ulcers, and enhance quality of life, muscle strength and overall mobility, while also checking for any harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to an exercise group or a no‑exercise group) that included people with CVI without ulcers. We compared the results of the exercise groups with the control groups and used a system called GRADE, which tells us how confident we are in each finding.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five small randomised trials that together enrolled 146 people with CVI without ulcers. All studies compared a planned exercise programme with no structured exercise, and follow‑up lasted from about two to six months. The studies did not report the participants’ ages or gender, how severe their vein problems were, the countries where the research was carried out, or the sources of funding. None of the trials reported any new leg ulcers.\nWe cannot say whether exercise helps with any of the following:\n- severity of symptoms\n- blood‑flow in the leg veins\n- how quickly the veins refill\n- quality of life\n- ability to exercise\n- muscle strength\n- ankle movement\nOverall, the evidence is very uncertain, so we cannot confirm any benefit or harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which group they were in, the studies were very small, and not all outcomes were reported.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to March 2022.",
