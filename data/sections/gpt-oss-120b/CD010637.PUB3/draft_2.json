  "draft": "Does regular exercise improve symptoms and quality of life for people with chronic vein problems (poor blood flow in the legs) that have not yet caused leg ulcers?\n\nKey messages\n- Current evidence does not show a clear benefit of regular exercise programmes (planned physical activity) for people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) on symptoms or quality of life, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Small studies hinted at possible improvements in symptoms, blood flow measures, and muscle strength, but the evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and of low quality.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials with standardised exercise protocols and longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether exercise helps this condition.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency and why does it matter?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a long‑lasting problem where the veins in the legs do not return blood to the heart efficiently. This can cause swelling, aching, skin changes and may progress to painful leg ulcers (open sores). Even before ulcers appear, CVI can lower quality of life, limit daily activities and increase the risk of future complications. Typical treatments aim to improve blood flow, for example by using compression stockings, medicines or surgery. Researchers have wondered whether regular physical exercise might also help reduce symptoms and improve leg function.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover whether structured physical‑exercise programmes are safe and effective for people who have CVI but no leg ulcers. Specifically, we looked at whether exercise can reduce the severity of signs and symptoms, improve blood flow measures (such as how quickly veins refill), prevent ulcers, and enhance quality of life, muscle strength and overall mobility, while also checking for any possible harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared exercise with no exercise in people with non‑ulcerated CVI. We then we extracted the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach (a system for rating the certainty of evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five small randomised trials that together enrolled 146 participants with non‑ulcerated CVI. All trials compared a structured exercise programme with no structured exercise, and follow‑up lasted from about two to six months. The review does not give details about participants’ ages, gender, disease severity, study locations or funding, and none of the trials reported new venous leg ulcers. The overall evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether exercise improves symptoms, blood flow, vein refill time, quality of life, exercise ability, muscle strength or ankle movement. In short, there is insufficient reliable evidence to say that exercise helps or harms people with this condition.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which group they were in, the studies were very small, and not all outcomes were reported.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence searched up to March 2022.",

These issues exceed the acceptable threshold for a plain-language summary, so the draft is not approved as‑is.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (most metrics in P50‑P75 range). Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease ≈ 50, FK‑grade ≈ 12). However, the metric complex_words_dc is in the P90 range (226 vs typical ≤160), indicating many unfamiliar words. This aligns with the identified jargon issues and supports the recommendation to simplify terminology."
