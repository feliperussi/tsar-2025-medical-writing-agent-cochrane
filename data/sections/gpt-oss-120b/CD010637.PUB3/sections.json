  "plain_title": "Does regular exercise improve symptoms and quality of life for people with chronic vein problems (poor blood flow in the legs) that have not yet caused leg ulcers?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Current evidence does not show a clear benefit of regular exercise programmes (planned physical activity) for people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency (poor blood flow in the legs) on symptoms or quality of life (overall wellbeing), and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "Some small studies hinted at possible improvements in symptoms, blood flow measures, and muscle strength, but the evidence is very uncertain and comes from low‑quality research.",
    "More robust research is needed, including larger trials with standardized exercise protocols, longer follow‑up, and systematic reporting of any adverse effects, to determine whether exercise can be helpful for this condition."

      "subheading": "What is chronic venous insufficiency and why does it matter?",
      "content": "Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a long‑lasting problem where the veins in the legs do not move blood back to the heart as well as they should. This can cause swelling, aching, skin changes and, in some people, can progress to painful leg ulcers (open sores). Even before ulcers develop – the \"non‑ulcerated\" stage – CVI can lower a person’s quality of life, limit daily activities and increase the risk of future complications. Typical treatments aim to improve blood flow, such as wearing compression stockings, taking medicines, or, in severe cases, surgery. Researchers have wondered whether regular physical exercise might also help reduce symptoms and improve leg function."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to discover whether structured physical‑exercise programmes are safe and effective for people who have chronic venous insufficiency but no leg ulcers. Specifically, they looked at whether exercise can lessen the severity of signs and symptoms, improve blood flow measures (like how quickly blood refills the veins), prevent ulcers, and enhance quality of life, muscle strength and overall mobility, while also checking for any possible harms."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to exercise or no exercise) involving people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency, extracted and compared their results, and assessed confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified five small randomised trials that together enrolled 146 people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency. All of the studies compared a structured physical‑exercise programme with no structured exercise, and the follow‑up periods ranged from about two months to six months. The review does not give details about the participants’ ages, gender, severity of disease, the countries where the studies were done, or who funded the research, and none of the trials reported whether any participants developed a venous leg ulcer. The overall evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether exercise improves disease signs or symptoms, blood flow in the leg veins, vein refill time, quality of life, ability to exercise, muscle strength or ankle movement. In short, there is insufficient reliable evidence to say that exercise helps or harms people with this condition."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search."
