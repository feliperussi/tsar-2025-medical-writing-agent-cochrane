  "draft": "Does regular exercise improve symptoms and quality of life for people with chronic vein problems (poor blood flow in the legs) that have not yet caused leg ulcers?\n\nKey messages\n- Current evidence does not show a clear benefit of regular exercise programmes (planned physical activity) for people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency (poor blood flow in the legs) on symptoms or overall wellbeing, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Small studies hinted at possible improvements in symptoms, blood‑flow measures and muscle strength, but the evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and of low quality.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials with standardised exercise protocols and longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether exercise helps this condition.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency and why does it matter?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a long‑lasting problem where the veins in the legs do not move blood back to the heart as well as they should (poor blood flow in the legs). This can cause swelling, aching, skin changes and, in some people, can progress to painful leg ulcers (open sores). Even before ulcers develop – the “non‑ulcerated” stage – CVI can lower a person’s quality of life, limit daily activities and increase the risk of future complications. Typical treatments aim to improve blood flow, for example by wearing compression stockings, taking medicines, or, in severe cases, having surgery. Researchers have wondered whether regular physical exercise might also help reduce symptoms and improve leg function.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover whether structured physical‑exercise programmes are safe and effective for people who have CVI but no leg ulcers. Specifically, we looked at whether exercise can lessen the severity of signs and symptoms, improve blood‑flow measures (such as how quickly blood refills the veins after a gentle squeeze), prevent ulcers, and enhance quality of life, muscle strength and overall mobility, while also checking for any possible harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to exercise or no exercise) involving people with non‑ulcerated CVI. We extracted the results and assessed how confident we are in the evidence using the GRADE system, which rates the quality of research from high to very low.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five small randomised trials that together enrolled 146 people with non‑ulcerated CVI. All trials compared a structured exercise programme with no structured exercise, and follow‑up lasted from about two to six months. The studies did not tell us the participants’ ages, gender, how severe their disease was, where the research was done, or who funded it. Also, none of the trials reported any new venous leg ulcers.\nThe overall evidence is very uncertain. We do not know whether exercise improves disease signs or symptoms, blood flow in the leg veins, or vein refill time (the time it takes for blood to return to the veins after they are gently squeezed). We also lack reliable evidence on its effects on quality of life, ability to exercise, muscle strength or ankle movement. In short, we have insufficient reliable evidence to say that exercise helps or harms people with this condition.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which group they were in, the studies were very small, and not all outcomes were reported.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence searched up to March 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical style requirement: the subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, whereas the Master Style Guide mandates all subheadings be questions. Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers:\n1. Long, jargon‑heavy sentence in the key messages bullet – it packs multiple ideas and technical terms, making it hard to follow.\n2. Unexplained technical term “GRADE system” in the methods section.\n3. Noun‑heavy, passive‑voice sentence in the results (“The overall evidence is very uncertain”) reduces readability and contributes to the high noun count (169, P90) and passive voice count (14, P75).\n4. Missing paragraph break after the \"Key messages\" list, creating a wall of text.\n5. Bullet points use hyphens but the introductory heading is not a question, breaking the required structure.\nThese issues, together with the subheading format problem, prevent approval. The suggested rewrites address the most impactful clarity and style concerns while aligning with the style guide and improving the metrics (reducing noun density, passive constructions, and sentence length).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well overall (72% of features in best quartile). However, three metrics deviate: nouns (169, P90), complex_words_dc (255, P90) and long_words (166, P90), indicating a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style. Passive voice count is 14 (P75) and words per sentence 22.19 (P75), suggesting room for more active, shorter sentences. Addressing these will improve readability without sacrificing content."
