  "draft": "Does regular exercise improve symptoms and quality of life for people with chronic vein problems (poor blood flow in the legs) that have not yet caused leg ulcers?\n\nKey messages\n- Current evidence does not show a clear benefit of regular exercise programmes for people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency on symptoms or quality of life, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Small studies hinted at possible improvements in symptoms, blood‑flow measures and muscle strength, but the evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and of low quality.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials with standardised exercise protocols and longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether exercise helps this condition.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency and why does it matter?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition where the veins in the legs do not move blood back to the heart as well as they should (poor blood flow in the legs). This can cause swelling, aching, skin changes and, in some people, painful leg ulcers (open sores). Even before ulcers appear – the “non‑ulcerated” stage – CVI can lower quality of life, limit daily activities and increase the risk of future complications. Typical treatments aim to improve blood flow, for example by wearing compression stockings, taking medicines, or, in severe cases, having surgery. Researchers have wondered whether regular physical exercise might also help reduce symptoms and improve leg function.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover whether structured physical‑exercise programmes are safe and effective for people who have CVI but no leg ulcers. Specifically, we looked at whether exercise can lessen the severity of signs and symptoms, improve blood‑flow measures (such as how quickly blood refills the veins), prevent ulcers, and enhance quality of life, muscle strength and overall mobility, while also checking for any possible harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared an exercise programme with no structured exercise in people with non‑ulcerated CVI, extracted the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five small randomised trials that together enrolled 146 people with non‑ulcerated CVI. All trials compared a structured exercise programme with no structured exercise, and follow‑up lasted from about two to six months. The review does not give details about participants’ ages, gender, disease severity, study locations or funding, and none of the trials reported new venous leg ulcers.\nThe overall evidence is very uncertain. We do not know whether exercise improves disease signs or symptoms, blood flow in the leg veins, or vein refill time. We also lack evidence on its effects on quality of life, exercise ability, muscle strength and ankle movement.\nIn short, we have insufficient reliable evidence to say that exercise helps or harms people with this condition.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which group they were in, the studies were very small, and not all outcomes were reported.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence searched up to March 2022.",

Also, none of the trials reported any new leg ulcers.\"\nThese changes address the most confusing elements and also reduce the high noun count and unfamiliar‑word density flagged by the metrics. \n\n**Metrics support**: The evaluation shows the draft has a very high noun count (164, P90) and a high number of Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (231, P90), confirming the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many technical terms. Reducing nouns and clarifying jargon will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns.",
