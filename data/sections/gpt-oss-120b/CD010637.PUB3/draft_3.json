  "draft": "Does regular exercise improve symptoms and quality of life for people with chronic vein problems (poor blood flow in the legs) that have not yet caused leg ulcers?\n\nKey messages\n- Current evidence does not show a clear benefit of regular exercise programmes (planned physical activity) for people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency (poor blood flow in the legs) on symptoms or quality of life, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Small studies hinted at possible improvements in symptoms, blood‑flow measures, and muscle strength, but the evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and of low quality.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials with standardised exercise protocols and longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether exercise helps this condition.\n\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency and why does it matter?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a long‑lasting problem where the veins in the legs do not move blood back to the heart as well as they should. This can cause swelling, aching, skin changes and, in some people, can progress to painful leg ulcers (open sores). Even before ulcers appear – the “non‑ulcerated” stage – CVI can lower quality of life, limit daily activities and increase the risk of future complications. Typical treatments aim to improve blood flow, for example by wearing compression stockings, taking medicines, or, in severe cases, having surgery. Researchers have wondered whether regular physical exercise might also help reduce symptoms and improve leg function.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover whether structured physical‑exercise programmes are safe and effective for people who have CVI but no leg ulcers. Specifically, we looked at whether exercise can lessen the severity of signs and symptoms, improve blood‑flow measures (such as how quickly blood refills the veins), prevent ulcers, and enhance quality of life, muscle strength and overall mobility, while also checking for any possible harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to exercise or no exercise) involving people with non‑to‑ulcerated CVI. We extracted the results, compared the groups, and assessed our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach (a system for rating how certain we are about the findings).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five small randomised trials that together enrolled 146 people with non‑ulcerated CVI. All trials compared a structured exercise programme with no structured exercise, and follow‑up lasted from about two to six months. The review does not give details about participants’ ages, gender, disease severity, study locations or funding, and none of the trials reported new venous leg ulcers. The overall evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether exercise improves disease signs or symptoms, blood‑flow in the leg veins, vein refill time, quality of life, ability to exercise, muscle strength or ankle movement. In short, we have insufficient reliable evidence to say that exercise helps or harms people with this condition.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which group they were in, the studies were very small, and not all outcomes were reported.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence searched up to March 2022.",

This typo may mislead readers about the condition studied. *Rewrite*: \"non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency\".\n2. **Redundant parenthetical definitions** – The phrase \"non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency (poor blood flow in the legs)\" appears multiple times, repeating the same explanation and breaking flow. *Rewrite*: Define the term once (e.g., \"Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition where blood flow in the legs is poor\") and then use the abbreviation thereafter.\n3. **Overly long, noun‑heavy sentence** – \"The overall evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether exercise improves disease signs or symptoms, blood‑flow in the leg veins, vein refill time, quality of life, ability to exercise, muscle strength or ankle movement.\" This dense list overwhelms the reader. *Rewrite*: \"The overall evidence is very uncertain. We do not know whether exercise improves disease signs or symptoms, blood flow in the leg veins, or vein refill time. We also lack evidence on its effects on quality of life, exercise ability, muscle strength, and ankle movement.\"\n4. **First bullet point in Key messages repeats the parenthetical definition and uses a long phrase** – \"non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency (poor blood flow in the legs)\". *Rewrite*: \"Current evidence does not show a clear benefit of regular exercise programmes for people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency on symptoms or quality of life, and no harmful effects were reported.\"\nThese three (plus an additional) issues are significant enough to impede patient understanding. The PLS evaluation shows high noun count (165, P90) and a high number of complex Dale‑Chall words (243, P90), confirming the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words, which aligns with the identified clarity problems. The draft therefore does not meet the required standard.",
