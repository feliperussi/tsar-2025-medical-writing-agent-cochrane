  "draft": "Is intermittent phototherapy (on‑and‑off light treatment) as effective as continuous phototherapy (always‑on light treatment) for newborn jaundice (yellow skin in babies)?\n\nKey messages\n- Intermittent phototherapy (on‑and‑off light treatment) lowers bilirubin (the yellow pigment that causes jaundice) about as well as continuous phototherapy (always‑on light treatment). We found no clear evidence of differences in serious outcomes such as brain damage (kernicterus) or infant death. The review did not identify reliable data on harms.\n- In very early (preterm) babies, continuous phototherapy may lower bilirubin a little more than intermittent phototherapy. We do not know whether this small difference matters or changes the risk of other problems.\n- We need larger, well‑designed studies in both preterm and term infants. These studies should assess long‑term safety and confirm whether intermittent phototherapy truly provides the same benefits as continuous treatment.\n\nWhy is newborn jaundice a concern and how is it usually treated?\nMany babies develop a yellow colour of the skin and eyes in the first weeks of life. This happens because bilirubin builds up in their blood. This condition is called neonatal jaundice. Most cases are harmless. Very high bilirubin levels can damage the brain, causing kernicterus (a type of brain injury). The usual first‑line treatment is phototherapy. We shine a blue‑green light on the baby's skin to break down bilirubin so the body can remove it. Traditionally we keep the light on continuously (continuous phototherapy). Some clinicians have suggested turning the light on and off at set intervals (intermittent phototherapy). This approach might allow more feeding time, improve mother‑baby bonding, and reduce total light exposure.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy. We wanted to see whether the on‑and‑off approach is as safe and effective at lowering bilirubin. We also examined whether it prevents brain damage (including kernicterus or bilirubin‑induced brain dysfunction, BIND) and avoids other bad outcomes such as treatment failure or infant death.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched databases for randomised controlled trials that compared intermittent and continuous phototherapy in infants up to 30 days old. We combined the results and assessed the certainty of the evidence using standard criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 12 trials involving about 1,600 newborns (both term and preterm). The combined analysis shows that intermittent phototherapy makes little or no difference to the rate at which bilirubin falls. This is compared with continuous phototherapy. We cannot tell whether intermittent phototherapy changes the chance of treatment failure. It also makes little or no difference to infant mortality. The evidence is uncertain about any effect on brain damage (BIND). In preterm infants, continuous phototherapy may lower bilirubin slightly more, but we do not know if this matters.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. The studies involved different types of babies, used different light schedules, and were generally small.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe searches were last run in January 2022, so the evidence reflects studies up to that date.",

The studies involved different types of babies…”. Patients may not understand that this means the results are uncertain. *Rewrite*: “We are not very sure about these results because the studies were small and used different methods, so the evidence is uncertain.”\n3. **Redundant/awkward sentence about rate of bilirubin decline** – The result paragraph repeats the comparison: “The combined analysis shows that intermittent phototherapy makes little or no difference to the rate at which bilirubin falls. This is compared with continuous phototherapy.” This can be confusing and wordy. *Rewrite*: “The combined analysis shows that intermittent phototherapy makes little or no difference to how quickly bilirubin levels fall compared with continuous phototherapy.”\n\nThese issues affect patient understanding. The PLS evaluation also flags high nominalisation (23, above typical) and many complex/long words (complex_words_dc 228, complex_words 117, long_words 166), supporting the need to simplify language further.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most PLS patterns (words per sentence, active voice, readability scores are in the best quartile). However, nominalisations, complex words, and long words are markedly higher than typical (P90), indicating the draft is more noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words. This aligns with the identified clarity issues and suggests further simplification would improve readability."
