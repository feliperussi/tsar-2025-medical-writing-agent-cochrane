  "draft": "Is intermittent phototherapy (on‑and‑off light treatment) as effective as continuous phototherapy (always‑on light treatment) for newborn jaundice (yellow skin in babies)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Intermittent phototherapy lowers bilirubin (the yellow pigment that causes jaundice) about as well as continuous phototherapy, and we found no clear evidence that it changes the risk of serious brain damage (kernicterus) or infant death; we could not find reliable data on other harms.\n- In very early (preterm) babies, continuous phototherapy may lower bilirubin a little more, but we do not know whether this small difference improves health outcomes.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed in both preterm and term infants to confirm long‑term safety and whether intermittent phototherapy truly matches continuous treatment.\n\nWhy is newborn jaundice a concern and how is it usually treated?\nMany babies develop a yellow colour of the skin and eyes in the first weeks of life because bilirubin builds up in their blood. Most cases are harmless, but very high bilirubin can damage the brain, causing kernicterus (a type of brain injury). The usual first‑line treatment is phototherapy – we shine a blue‑green light on the baby’s skin to break down bilirubin so the body can remove it. Traditionally the light stays on continuously (continuous phototherapy). Some clinicians suggest turning the light on and off at set intervals (intermittent phototherapy) to allow more feeding time, improve mother‑baby bonding, and reduce total light exposure.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy to see whether the on‑and‑off approach is as safe and effective at lowering bilirubin, preventing brain damage (including kernicterus or bilirubin‑induced brain dysfunction, BIND), avoiding treatment failure, and reducing infant death.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched databases for randomised trials that compared the two light treatments in babies up to 30 days old. Three reviewers independently selected studies, assessed their quality, and extracted the data. We combined the results and used the GRADE system to judge how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 12 trials that included about 1,600 newborns (both term and preterm). The combined results suggest that intermittent phototherapy makes little or no difference to how quickly bilirubin levels fall compared with continuous phototherapy. We could not determine whether intermittent phototherapy changes the chance of treatment failure. It also makes little or no difference to infant mortality, and the evidence about BIND remains very uncertain. In preterm infants, continuous phototherapy may lower bilirubin slightly more, but we do not know if this matters for health outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in these results because the studies were small, used different ways of delivering the light, and involved different types of babies.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe searches were last run in January 2022, so the review includes studies published up to that date.",
