  "plain_title": "Is intermittent phototherapy (on‑and‑off light treatment) as effective as continuous phototherapy (always‑on light treatment) for newborn jaundice (yellow skin in babies)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Intermittent phototherapy (on‑and‑off light treatment) seems to lower bilirubin (the yellow pigment that causes jaundice) about as effectively as continuous phototherapy (always‑on light treatment) in newborns, and there is no clear evidence of differences in serious outcomes such as brain damage (kernicterus) or infant death; the review did not find reliable information on any harmful effects.",
    "In very early (preterm) babies, continuous phototherapy may reduce bilirubin slightly more than intermittent phototherapy, but the importance of this difference and any additional risks remain uncertain.",
    "More large, well‑designed studies are needed, especially in both preterm and term infants, to evaluate long‑term safety and confirm whether intermittent phototherapy truly provides the same benefits as continuous treatment."

      "subheading": "Why is newborn jaundice a concern and how is it usually treated?",
      "content": "Many babies develop a yellow colour of the skin and eyes in the first weeks of life because a substance called bilirubin builds up in their blood. This condition is called neonatal jaundice. While most cases are harmless, very high levels of bilirubin can damage the brain, leading to serious problems such as kernicterus (a type of brain injury). The most common first‑line treatment is phototherapy – shining a special blue‑green light on the baby’s skin, which helps break down bilirubin so it can be removed from the body. Traditionally, this light is left on continuously (continuous phototherapy). Some clinicians have suggested turning the light on and off at set intervals (intermittent phototherapy) because it might allow more time for feeding and mother‑baby bonding, and could reduce the total hours the baby is under the light."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors set out to compare intermittent phototherapy with the usual continuous phototherapy. Their goal was to see whether the on‑and‑off approach is just as safe and effective at lowering bilirubin levels, preventing brain damage (including kernicterus or bilirubin‑induced brain dysfunction, BIND), and avoiding other bad outcomes such as treatment failure or infant death."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 12 randomized controlled trials with a total of about 1,600 newborn infants (both term and preterm) who had jaundice up to 30 days old. All trials compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy, regardless of the exact light dose or schedule used. The abstract did not give details about how long the interventions or follow‑up periods lasted, where the studies were carried out, who funded them, or specific characteristics such as gender distribution or severity of jaundice.\n\nThe combined results suggest that intermittent phototherapy probably makes little to no difference to how quickly bilirubin levels fall compared with continuous phototherapy. It is unclear whether intermittent phototherapy changes the chance that treatment fails. Intermittent phototherapy may also make little to no difference to infant mortality, and it is uncertain whether it reduces the risk of bilirubin‑induced brain damage."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of babies or used different ways of delivering the light treatment, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2022 of search."
