  "draft": "Is intermittent phototherapy (on‑and‑off light treatment) as effective as continuous phototherapy (always‑on light treatment) for newborn jaundice (yellow skin in babies)?\n\nKey messages\n- Intermittent phototherapy (on‑and‑off light) lowers bilirubin (the yellow pigment that causes jaundice) about as well as continuous phototherapy (always‑on light). We found no clear evidence of differences in serious outcomes such as brain damage (kernicterus) or infant death, and the review did not locate reliable data on harms.\n- In very early (preterm) babies, continuous phototherapy may lower bilirubin a little more than intermittent phototherapy. We do not know whether this small difference matters for the baby’s health.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed in both preterm and term infants to check long‑term safety and confirm whether intermittent phototherapy truly provides the same benefits as continuous treatment.\n\nWhy is newborn jaundice a concern and how is it usually treated?\nMany babies develop a yellow colour of the skin and eyes in the first weeks of life because a substance called bilirubin builds up in their blood. This condition is called neonatal jaundice. Most cases are harmless, but very high bilirubin levels can damage the brain, causing kernicterus (a type of brain injury). The usual first‑line treatment is phototherapy – shining a blue‑green light on the baby’s skin to break down bilirubin so the body can remove it. Traditionally the light is left on continuously (continuous phototherapy). Some clinicians have suggested turning the light on and off at set intervals (intermittent phototherapy) because it might allow more feeding time, improve mother‑baby bonding, and reduce total light exposure.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy to see whether the on‑and‑off approach is as safe and effective at lowering bilirubin. We also examined whether it prevents brain damage (including kernicterus or bilirubin‑induced brain dysfunction, BIND) and whether it avoids other bad outcomes such as treatment failure (the light treatment does not lower bilirubin enough, requiring a change in therapy) or infant death.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared intermittent and continuous phototherapy in infants up to 30 days old. Three reviewers independently selected studies, assessed their quality, and extracted the data. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 12 trials involving about 1,600 newborns (both term and preterm). The combined analysis shows that intermittent phototherapy makes little or no difference to how quickly bilirubin levels fall compared with continuous phototherapy. We cannot tell whether intermittent phototherapy changes the chance that the light treatment fails. It also makes little or no difference to infant mortality. The evidence about brain damage (BIND) is very uncertain. In preterm infants, continuous phototherapy may lower bilirubin slightly more, but we do not know if this matters for health outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not very sure about these results because the studies were small, used different ways of delivering the light, and involved different types of babies. This makes the overall evidence uncertain.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe searches were last run in January 2022, so the review includes studies published up to that date.",

We found no clear evidence of differences in serious outcomes such as brain damage (kernicterus) or infant death, and the review did not locate reliable data on harms.\" This packs three ideas into one sentence, making it hard to follow.\n   *Rewrite:* \"Intermittent phototherapy lowers bilirubin about as well as continuous phototherapy. We did not find clear evidence that the two methods differ in serious outcomes such as brain damage (kernicterus) or infant death. The review also did not find reliable information about any harms.\"\n3. **Unclear wording about treatment failure** – \"We cannot tell whether intermittent phototherapy changes the chance that the light treatment fails.\" The phrase \"changes the chance\" is vague.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We do not know whether intermittent phototherapy leads to more or fewer treatment failures (situations where the light does not lower bilirubin enough and another treatment is needed).\"\n4. **High use of nominalisations and complex words** – The evaluation shows 22 nominalisations (P90), a smog index of 13.8 (P90), 126 complex words (P90) and 176 long words (P90). This makes the text harder for lay readers. Examples include \"combined analysis shows\" and \"the evidence about brain damage (BIND) is very uncertain.\"\n   *Rewrite:* Replace nominalisations with active verbs (e.g., \"We found\" instead of \"combined analysis shows\") and swap long words for simpler alternatives (e.g., \"uncertain\" → \"not clear\").\nOverall, while the draft includes all required sections and is factually accurate, the identified clarity issues would likely confuse a non‑expert audience. Reducing jargon, shortening long sentences, clarifying ambiguous statements, and simplifying language will bring the summary in line with Cochrane plain‑language standards.\n\n**PLS evaluation summary:** Word count (556) is within the 850‑word limit. Most readability metrics are in the best quartile (e.g., words per sentence 17.4, Flesch‑Kincaid grade 11.4). However, five metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisation (22, P90), smog index (13.8, P90), complex words (126, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (245, P90) and long words (176, P90). These indicate the text is more complex than usual and support the need to simplify language as recommended above.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms to word‑count and most readability metrics (words per sentence, grade level, active voice). Significant deviations are seen in nominalisations, smog index, complex words, Dale‑Chall complex words and long words (all at the P90 level), suggesting the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many long or unfamiliar words. Reducing these will improve plain‑language clarity."
