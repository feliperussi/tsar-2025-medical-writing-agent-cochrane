  "draft": "Is going through the skin to remove kidney stones (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) better than using a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery) for adults with kidney stones?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) may increase the chance of being completely stone‑free and may reduce the need for a second procedure; major complications appear similar to those with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).\n- PCNL may lead to a slightly longer hospital stay, and we found little information on quality of life or unplanned medical visits.\n- The evidence is limited because many trials were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and the techniques varied.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they usually treated?\nKidney stones – also called renal stones – are hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause severe pain, block urine flow, and trigger infections. Small stones may pass on their own, but larger or troublesome stones often need an active procedure. Common procedures include:\n- Shock‑wave lithotripsy – sound waves break the stone into tiny pieces that can be passed in the urine.\n- Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) – a thin tube (ureteroscope) is passed up through the urethra and bladder into the kidney, where a laser breaks the stone.\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a small incision is made in the back and a tube is inserted directly into the kidney to remove or break the stone. Larger tubes (≥24 Fr) are called standard PCNL; smaller tubes (15–23 Fr or <15 Fr) are mini‑, ultra‑mini‑, or micro‑PCNL.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare PCNL and RIRS in adults with kidney stones to see which method:\n- Achieves a higher stone‑free rate (more patients left without any stone fragments).\n- Leads to fewer major complications (serious side‑effects such as significant bleeding or organ injury).\n- Reduces the need for secondary interventions (additional procedures after the first treatment).\n- Affects other outcomes such as length of hospital stay, ureteral injury, unplanned medical visits, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared PCNL with RIRS in adults. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and combined the results. We rated our confidence in each result using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 42 trials that enrolled 4,571 adults. Stone sizes ranged from about 10 mm to 39 mm. Most trials did not report participants’ age, gender, country, funding, or conflicts of interest, and none reported unplanned medical visits or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\n- Stone‑free rate: For every 100 patients, about 10 more may be stone‑free after PCNL than after RIRS.\n- Major complications: PCNL probably makes little or no difference to serious complications; the difference is only a few fewer per 1,000 patients.\n- Need for secondary interventions: Roughly 15 fewer per 100 patients may require a second procedure after PCNL.\n- Length of hospital stay: PCNL may extend the stay by about one day compared with RIRS.\n- Ureteral stricture or injury: PCNL probably makes little or no difference to this risk.\n- Unplanned medical visits and quality of life: No trial reported these outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many trials were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and the studies used different techniques. These shortcomings reduce the certainty of the findings.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nThe evidence suggests that PCNL can give a higher chance of being stone‑free and may reduce the need for another procedure, but it may keep you in hospital a little longer. Serious complications appear similar between the two methods. Because we lack data on quality of life and unplanned medical visits, we cannot say how the procedures affect daily living.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe searches covered studies published up to March 2023, so the evidence reflects the literature available at that time.",

      "feedback": "Critical issue: the draft is missing a clearly labelled “Key messages” section, which is required by the style guide. All other required sections are present and the factual information matches the source, but the absence of the Key messages heading prevents approval. Additionally, the draft contains several clarity and style problems that could confuse readers:\n1. **Long, dense bullet point** – \"PCNL may increase the chance of being completely stone‑free and may reduce the need for a second procedure; major complications appear similar to those with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).\" This combines two separate ideas and uses a semicolon, making it hard to follow. *Rewrite:* \"PCNL may increase the chance of being completely stone‑free. It may also reduce the need for a second procedure. Major complications appear similar to those with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).\"\n2. **Jargon without immediate definition** – the terms “mini‑PCNL”, “ultra‑mini‑PCNL”, and “micro‑PCNL” appear in the background paragraph without a simple explanation. *Rewrite:* \"Smaller tubes (15–23 Fr) are called mini‑PCNL, and tubes smaller than 15 Fr are called ultra‑mini‑ or micro‑PCNL. These are just smaller versions of the standard procedure.\"\n3. **Passive‑voice sentence** – \"The evidence suggests that PCNL can give a higher chance of being stone‑free…\" *Rewrite:* \"We found that PCNL gives a higher chance of being stone‑free…\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy sentence** – \"Most trials did not report participants’ age, gender, country, funding, or conflicts of interest, and none reported unplanned medical visits or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\" *Rewrite:* \"Most trials left out details such as participants’ age, gender, country, funding, and conflicts of interest. They also did not report unplanned medical visits or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\"\n5. **Bullet formatting** – the draft uses hyphens correctly, but the “Key messages” (missing) should be introduced with a clear heading and bullet list.\n\nMetrics support these observations: the draft has 182 nouns (P90, far above the typical range), 130 complex words (P90), and a SMOG index of 14.2 (P90), indicating high lexical density and complexity. The passive‑voice count is 15 (P75), showing many passive constructions that can obscure who performed actions. Reducing noun density and simplifying language will improve readability and align the draft‑style with typical PLS patterns.\n\nTo achieve approval, add a “Key messages” heading with concise bullet points, split long sentences, replace remaining passive constructions with active voice, simplify technical terms, and reduce noun‑heavy phrasing.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (61% of features in best quartile) but deviates on five metrics: nouns (182, P90), SMOG index (14.2, P90), complex words (130, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (272, P90), and long words (173, P90). These indicate higher lexical complexity than usual for PLS texts."
