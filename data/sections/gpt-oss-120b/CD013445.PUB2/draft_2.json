  "draft": "Is going through the skin to remove kidney stones (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) better than using a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery) for adults with kidney stones?\n\nKey messages –\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) may increase the chance of being completely stone‑free and may reduce the need for a second procedure, while serious complications are similar to retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). –\n- PCNL may lead to a slightly longer hospital stay and we have limited evidence about quality of life or unplanned medical visits. –\n- Better‑quality trials are needed because most existing studies are small and have methodological shortcomings.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they usually treated?\nKidney stones – also called renal stones – are hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause severe pain, block urine flow, and trigger infections. Small stones may pass on their own, but larger or more troublesome stones often need an active procedure. Common procedures include:\n- Shock‑wave lithotripsy – sound waves break the stone into tiny pieces that can be passed in the urine.\n- Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) – a thin tube (ureteroscope) is passed up through the urethra and bladder into the kidney, where a laser breaks the stone. This is a “through‑the‑urethra” approach.\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a small incision is made in the back and a tube is inserted directly into the kidney to remove or break the stone. The tube size is measured in French gauge (Fr); larger tubes (≥24 Fr) are called standard PCNL, while smaller tubes (15–23 Fr or <15 Fr) are mini‑, ultra‑mini‑, or micro‑PCNL.\nAll these options aim to make the patient “stone‑free,” meaning no detectable stone fragments remain after treatment.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared PCNL and RIRS in adults with kidney stones to see which method:\n- Achieves a higher stone‑free rate.\n- Leads to fewer major complications (serious side‑effects such as significant bleeding or organ injury).\n- Reduces the need for secondary interventions (additional procedures after the first treatment).\n- Affects other outcomes such as length of hospital stay, ureteral injury, unplanned medical visits, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared PCNL with RIRS in adults. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and combined the results. We rated our confidence in each result using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 42 trials that enrolled 4,571 adults. Stone sizes ranged from about 10 mm to 39 mm. Most trials did not report participants’ age, gender, country, funding, or conflicts of interest, and none reported unplanned medical visits or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\n- Stone‑free rate: PCNL may increase the chance of being stone‑free. For every 100 patients treated, about 10 more may become stone‑free with PCNL than with RIRS.\n- Major complications: PCNL probably makes little or no difference to serious complications. The difference is very small – only a few fewer complications per 1,000 patients.\n- Need for secondary interventions: PCNL may reduce the need for additional procedures. Roughly 15 fewer out of every 100 patients may require a second intervention after PCNL.\n- Length of hospital stay: PCNL may extend the stay by about one day compared with RIRS.\n- Ureteral stricture or injury: PCNL probably makes little or no difference to the risk of a ureteral stricture.\n- Unplanned medical visits and quality of life: No trial reported these outcomes.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nWe have limited confidence in these findings because many trials were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and the studies used different techniques. The evidence suggests that PCNL can give a higher chance of being stone‑free and may reduce the need for another procedure, but it may keep you in hospital a little longer. Serious complications appear similar between the two methods. Because we lack data on quality of life and unplanned medical visits, we cannot say how the procedures affect daily living.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe searches covered studies published up to March 2023, so the evidence reflects the literature available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft is missing a dedicated sub‑heading that clearly presents the limitations of the evidence – the style guide requires a separate section (phrased as a question) for Limitations. This omission means the required sections are not complete. In addition, several clarity issues could confuse readers:\n\n1. **Long, dense bullet sentence** – \"Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) may increase the chance of being completely stone‑free and may reduce the need for a second procedure, while serious complications are similar to retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).\" This packs three ideas into one sentence, making it hard to follow. *Rewrite:* \"Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) may increase the chance of being completely stone‑free. It may also reduce the need for a second procedure. Serious complications appear similar to those with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).\"\n\n2. **Unexplained jargon** – the term \"major complications\" is used without clarification. Readers may not know what this means. *Rewrite:* \"major complications (serious side‑effects such as significant bleeding or organ injury)\".\n\n3. **Complex, noun‑heavy sentence in the ‘What does this is a mistake?** – \"We have limited confidence in these findings because many trials were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and the studies used different techniques.\" This sentence is long and noun‑heavy. *Rewrite:* \"We have limited confidence because many trials were small, some participants were aware of their treatment, and the techniques varied across studies.\"\n\n4. **Missing explicit limitation heading** – add a sub‑heading phrased as a question, e.g., \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and move the confidence‑statement paragraph under it.\n\n5. **Bullet formatting consistency** – the key‑messages list uses a mix of dashes and hyphens. Ensure each bullet starts with a plain dash (‑) and keep spacing consistent.\n\nThese changes will bring the draft into full compliance with the Master Style Guide and improve readability for patients.\n\n**Metrics support**: The evaluation shows a high noun count (187, beyond the typical P90 range) and elevated complex‑word counts (complex_words 138, long_words 181, complex_words_dc 289) indicating the text is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words. Reducing noun density and simplifying vocabulary, as suggested above, will improve alignment with typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms to most PLS metrics (overall high conformity), but deviates on several lexical measures: nouns (187, P90), SMOG index (14.4, P90), complex words (138, P90), long words (181, P90) and Dale‑Chall complex words (289, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than typical PLS, supporting the need for simplification and noun reduction."
