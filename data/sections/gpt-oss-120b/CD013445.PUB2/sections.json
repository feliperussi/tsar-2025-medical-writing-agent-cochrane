  "key_messages": [
    "Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a stone‑removal procedure done through a small incision in the back – may increase the chance of being completely stone‑free compared with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) – a stone‑removal procedure that uses a thin tube passed through the urinary tract – and may reduce the need for additional procedures, while serious (major) complications appear similar between the two methods; PCNL may be associated with a slightly longer hospital stay. The overall evidence is limited.",
    "The review found little information on patients’ quality of life, unplanned medical visits, or long‑term outcomes after either procedure.",
    "Because many of the included studies had methodological shortcomings and reported limited follow‑up, higher‑quality randomised trials that assess long‑term benefits, harms, quality of life and costs are needed to inform decision‑making."

      "content": "Kidney stones – also called renal stones – are hard mineral deposits that can form inside the kidneys. They can cause severe pain, block the flow of urine, and lead to infections. The size, location, and composition of a stone, as well as a person’s overall health, determine how doctors manage them. Small stones may be watched and allowed to pass on their own, while larger or more troublesome stones often need an active procedure. Common procedures include:\n\n* Shock‑wave lithotripsy – using sound waves to break the stone into tiny pieces that can be passed in the urine.\n* Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) – a thin tube (ureteroscope) is passed up through the urethra and bladder into the kidney, where a laser can break the stone. This is a “through‑the‑urethra” approach.\n* Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a small incision is made in the back, and a tube is inserted directly into the kidney to remove or break the stone. The size of the tube is measured in French gauge (Fr); larger tubes (≥24 Fr) are called standard PCNL, while smaller tubes (15–23 Fr or <15 Fr) are referred to as mini‑, ultra‑mini‑, or micro‑PCNL.\n\nThese options aim to make the patient “stone‑free,” meaning no detectable stone fragments remain after treatment. However, each method carries its own risks (such as bleeding or injury) and may require additional procedures if the stone is not completely cleared."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to compare two of the main surgical options – percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and the less invasive retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) – in adults with kidney stones. Specifically, the authors wanted to know which approach:\n\n* Achieves a higher stone‑free rate (more patients left without any stone fragments).\n* Leads to fewer major complications (serious side‑effects such as significant bleeding or organ injury).\n* Reduces the need for secondary interventions (additional procedures required after the first treatment).\n* Affects other outcomes such as length of hospital stay, ureteral injury, unplanned medical visits, and quality of life.\n\nBy answering these questions, the review aimed to provide clear information to help patients and clinicians decide which treatment might be best for a given situation."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review looked at 42 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 4,571 adults with kidney stones. The trials compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – performed with different access sizes (standard ≥ 24 Fr, mini‑PCNL 15–23 Fr, ultra‑mini/minimally invasive < 15 Fr) – with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). Stone sizes in the studies ranged from about 10 mm to 39 mm. The abstract did not give details about participants’ ages, gender distribution, countries, settings, study duration, funding sources or conflicts of interest, and none of the trials reported outcomes such as unplanned medical visits or quality‑of‑life measures."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Stone‑free outcome",
      "content": "PCNL may increase the chance of being stone‑free compared with RIRS. For roughly every 100 patients treated, about 10 more may become stone‑free. PCNL probably makes little to no difference to the risk of serious complications – the difference is very small, only a few fewer complications per 1,000 patients. PCNL may reduce the need for additional procedures after the initial treatment; about 15 fewer out of every 100 patients may require a second intervention. PCNL may increase the length of hospital stay by about one day compared with RIRS. PCNL may make little to no difference to the chance of developing a ureteral stricture. No studies reported on unplanned medical visits or quality of life."
