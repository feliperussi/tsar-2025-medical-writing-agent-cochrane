  "draft": "Is going through the skin to remove kidney stones (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) better than using a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery) for adults with kidney stones?\n\nKey messages –\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) may increase the chance of being completely stone‑free and may reduce the need for a second procedure. Serious (major) complications appear similar to those with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). –\n- PCNL may lead to a slightly longer hospital stay, and the review found little information on quality of life or unplanned medical visits. –\n- The evidence is limited because many trials were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and the techniques varied.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they usually treated?\nKidney stones – also called renal stones – are hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause severe pain, block urine flow, and trigger infections. Small stones may pass on their own, but larger or more troublesome stones often need an active procedure. Common procedures include:\n– Shock‑wave lithotripsy – sound waves break the stone into tiny pieces that can be passed in the urine.\n– Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) – a thin tube (ureteroscope) is passed up through the urethra and bladder into the kidney, where a laser breaks the stone. This is a “through‑the‑urethra” approach.\n– Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a small incision is made in the back and a tube is inserted directly into the kidney to remove or break the stone. The tube size is measured in French gauge (Fr); larger tubes (≥24 Fr) are called standard PCNL, while smaller tubes (15–23 Fr or <15 Fr) are mini‑, ultra‑mini‑, or micro‑PCNL.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare PCNL and RIRS in adults with kidney stones to see which method:\n– Achieves a higher stone‑free rate (more patients left without any stone fragments).\n– Leads to fewer major complications (serious side‑effects such as significant bleeding or organ injury).\n– Reduces the need for secondary interventions (additional procedures after the first treatment).\n– Affects other outcomes such as length of hospital stay, ureteral injury, unplanned medical visits, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared PCNL with RIRS in adults. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and combined the results. We rated our confidence in each result using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 42 trials that enrolled 4,571 adults. Stone sizes ranged from about 10 mm to 39 mm. Most trials did not report participants’ age, gender, country, funding, or conflicts of interest, and none reported unplanned medical visits or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\n– Stone‑free rate: PCNL may increase the chance of being stone‑free. For every 100 patients treated, about 10 more may become stone‑free with PCNL than with RIRS.\n– Major complications: PCNL probably makes little or no difference to serious complications. The difference is very small – only a few fewer complications per 1,000 patients.\n– Need for secondary interventions: PCNL may reduce the need for additional procedures. Roughly 15 fewer out of every 100 patients may require a second intervention after PCNL.\n– Length of hospital stay: PCNL may extend the stay by about one day compared with RIRS.\n– Ureteral stricture or injury: PCNL probably makes little or no difference to the risk of a ureteral stricture.\n– Unplanned medical visits and quality of life: No trial reported these outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many trials were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and the studies used different techniques. These methodological shortcomings reduce the certainty of the findings.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nThe evidence suggests that PCNL can give a higher chance of being stone‑free and may reduce the need for another procedure, but it may keep you in hospital a little longer. Serious complications appear similar between the two methods. Because we lack data on quality of life and unplanned medical visits, we cannot say how the procedures affect daily living.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe searches covered studies published up to March 2023, so the evidence reflects the literature available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the required sub‑heading format: the section titled \"Key messages –\" is not phrased as a question, which breaches the Master Style Guide (5.3 Structure). Additionally, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Sub‑heading not a question** – \"Key messages –\" should be re‑worded as a question (e.g., \"What are the main findings?\").\n2. **Inconsistent bullet formatting** – each bullet ends with an extra dash and mixes punctuation, making the list look unfinished. Rewrite bullets without trailing dashes and keep a single sentence per bullet.\n3. **Passive voice** – \"the review found little information on quality of life\" hides the actor. Use active voice: \"We found little information on quality of life.\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy sentence** – \"The evidence is limited because many trials were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and the techniques varied.\" can be split and simplified for readability.\n5. **Long, packed sentence** – the trio of sentences about trial numbers and reporting could be broken into clearer, shorter statements.\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Change heading: **\"What are the main findings?\"**\n- Bullet 1: \"Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) may increase the chance of being completely stone‑free and may reduce the need for a second procedure; major complications appear similar to those with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).\"\n- Bullet 2: \"PCNL may lead to a slightly longer hospital stay, and we found little information on quality of life or unplanned medical visits.\"\n- Bullet 3: \"The evidence is limited because many trials were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and the techniques varied.\"\n- Active voice example: \"We found little information on quality of life.\"\n- Split trial description: \"We identified 42 trials that enrolled 4,571 adults. The stones measured about 10 mm to 39 mm. Most trials did not report participants’ age, gender, country, funding, or conflicts of interest, and none reported unplanned medical visits or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\"\n\nMetrics support: The evaluation shows a high noun count (192, beyond the P90 typical range) and excessive complex/long words (complex_words_dc 305, complex_words 141, long_words 184), indicating noun‑heavy, jargon‑rich prose. The passive voice count (15) is within the typical range but can still be reduced for clarity. These metric signals align with the identified style and clarity issues.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability metrics (FKG 10.8, FRE 53.7) are within the best quartile. However, it deviates markedly on noun count (192 > P90), SMOG index (14.6 > P90), complex words (141 > P90), long words (184 > P90) and especially complex_words_dc (305 >> P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long, complex words, which can hinder patient understanding. Passive voice is within typical range, but the sub‑heading format requirement is not met. Overall, the draft needs the sub‑heading correction and the above refinements before it can be approved."
