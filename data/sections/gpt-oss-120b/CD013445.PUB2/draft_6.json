  "draft": "Is going through the skin to remove kidney stones (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) better than using a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery) for adults with kidney stones?\n\nKey messages\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a procedure that removes stones through a small incision in the back – may increase the chance of being completely stone‑free compared with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), which uses a thin tube passed through the urinary tract. It may also reduce the need for a second procedure. Serious (major) complications – such as heavy bleeding or injury to nearby organs – appear similar for both methods, although PCNL can lead to a slightly longer hospital stay.\n- We found little information on patients’ quality of life, unplanned medical visits, or long‑term outcomes after either procedure.\n- Because many of the included studies were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and follow‑up was limited, we need higher‑quality trials that assess long‑term benefits, harms, quality of life and costs.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they usually treated?\nKidney stones – also called renal stones – are hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause severe pain, block urine flow, and lead to infection. Small stones may pass on their own, but larger or troublesome stones often need an active procedure. Common procedures include:\n- Shock‑wave lithotripsy – sound waves break the stone into tiny pieces that can be passed in the urine.\n- Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) – a thin tube (ureteroscope) is passed up through the urethra and bladder into the kidney, where a laser breaks the stone. This is a “through‑the‑urethra” approach.\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a small incision is made in the back and a tube is inserted directly into the kidney to remove or break the stone. The tube size is measured in French gauge (Fr); larger tubes (≥24 Fr) are called standard PCNL, while smaller tubes (15–23 Fr or <15 Fr) are mini‑, ultra‑mini‑, or micro‑PCNL.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared PCNL and RIRS in adults with kidney stones to see which method:\n- Achieves a higher stone‑free rate (more patients left without any stone fragments).\n- Leads to fewer major complications (serious side‑effects such as significant bleeding or organ injury).\n- Reduces the need for secondary interventions (additional procedures after the first treatment).\n- Affects other outcomes such as length of hospital stay, ureteral injury, unplanned medical visits, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared PCNL with RIRS in adults. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and combined the results. We rated our confidence in each result using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- Stone‑free rate: About 10 more patients out of every 100 are stone‑free after PCNL than after RIRS.\n- Major complications: The number of serious complications is almost the same for both procedures – only a few fewer per 1,000 patients with PCNL.\n- Need for secondary procedures: Roughly 15 fewer patients out of every 100 need another procedure after PCNL.\n- Length of hospital stay: PCNL may add about one extra day in the hospital compared with RIRS.\n- Ureteral stricture or injury: PCNL probably makes little or no difference to this risk.\n- Unplanned medical visits and quality of life: No trial reported these outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many trials were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and the studies used different techniques. These shortcomings reduce the certainty of the findings.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nWe found that PCNL gives a higher chance of being stone‑free and may reduce the need for another procedure, but it may keep you in hospital a little longer. Serious complications appear similar between the two methods. Because we lack data on quality of life and unplanned medical visits, we cannot say how the procedures affect daily living.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe searches covered studies published up to March 2023, so the evidence reflects the literature available at that time.",
