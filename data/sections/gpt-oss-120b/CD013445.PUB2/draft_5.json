  "draft": "Is going through the skin to remove kidney stones (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) better than using a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery) for adults with kidney stones?\n\nKey messages\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a stone‑removal procedure done through a small incision in the back – may increase the chance of being completely stone‑free and may reduce the need for a second procedure, while serious (major) complications appear similar to those with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). PCNL may be associated with a slightly longer hospital stay.\n- The review found little information on patients’ quality of life, unplanned medical visits, or long‑term outcomes after either procedure.\n- Because many of the included studies were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and follow‑up was limited, higher‑quality trials that assess long‑term benefits, harms, quality of life and costs are needed.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they usually treated?\nKidney stones – also called renal stones – are hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause severe pain, block urine flow, and lead to infection. Small stones may pass on their own, but larger or troublesome stones often need an active procedure. Common procedures include:\n- Shock‑wave lithotripsy – sound waves break the stone into tiny pieces that can be passed in the urine.\n- Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) – a thin tube (ureteroscope) is passed up through the urethra and bladder into the kidney, where a laser breaks the stone. This is a “through‑the‑urethra” approach.\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a small incision is made in the back and a tube is inserted directly into the kidney to remove or break the stone. The tube size is measured in French gauge (Fr). Larger tubes (≥24 Fr) are called standard PCNL; smaller tubes (15–23 Fr) are mini‑PCNL; tubes <15 Fr are ultra‑mini‑ or micro‑PCNL. These are simply smaller versions of the standard procedure.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared PCNL and RIRS in adults with kidney stones to see which method:\n- Achieves a higher stone‑free rate (more patients left without any stone fragments).\n- Leads to fewer major complications (serious side‑effects such as significant bleeding or organ injury).\n- Reduces the need for secondary interventions (additional procedures after the first treatment).\n- Affects other outcomes such as length of hospital stay, ureteral injury, unplanned medical visits, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared PCNL with RIRS in adults. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and combined the results. We rated our confidence in each result using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 42 trials that enrolled 4,571 adults. Stone sizes ranged from about 10 mm to 39 mm. Most trials did not report participants’ age, gender, country, funding, or conflicts of interest, and none reported unplanned medical visits or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\n- Stone‑free rate: For every 100 patients, about 10 more may be stone‑free after PCNL than after RIRS.\n- Major complications: PCNL probably makes little or no difference to serious complications; the difference is only a few fewer per 1,000 patients.\n- Need for secondary interventions: Roughly 15 fewer per 100 patients may require a second procedure after PCNL.\n- Length of hospital stay: PCNL may extend the stay by about one day compared with RIRS.\n- Ureteral stricture or injury: PCNL probably makes little or no difference to this risk.\n- Unplanned medical visits and quality of life: No trial reported these outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many trials were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and the studies used different techniques. These shortcomings reduce the certainty of the findings.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nWe found that PCNL gives a higher chance of being stone‑free and may reduce the need for another procedure, but it may keep you in hospital a little longer. Serious complications appear similar between the two methods. Because we lack data on quality of life and unplanned medical visits, we cannot say how the procedures affect daily living.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe searches covered studies published up to March 2023, so the evidence reflects the literature available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several passages that will likely confuse or frustrate a lay reader. 1) The first key‑message bullet is a single, very long sentence that packs three separate ideas together, making it hard to follow. 2) The term “major complications” is used without a brief explanation of what it means for patients. 3) The “What did we find?” paragraph bundles several numerical results into one long sentence, which obscures the absolute differences that are most meaningful to readers. 4) The draft contains a high number of passive‑voice constructions (20 instances, far above the typical PLS range) and noun‑heavy sentences, which reduce readability. 5) Some sentences exceed 30 words, further decreasing comprehension.
