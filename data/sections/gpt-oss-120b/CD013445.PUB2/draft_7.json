  "draft": "Is going through the skin to remove kidney stones (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) better than using a scope through the urinary tract (retrograde intrarenal surgery) for adults with kidney stones?\n\nKey messages\n- PCNL (a small incision in the back) may increase the chance of being completely stone‑free compared with RIRS (a thin tube through the urinary tract).\n- PCNL may also reduce the need for a second procedure.\n- Major complications such as heavy bleeding or injury are similar for both methods, although PCNL can lead to a slightly longer hospital stay.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and how are they usually treated?\nKidney stones – also called renal stones – are hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause severe pain, block urine flow, and lead to infection. Small stones may pass on their own, but larger or troublesome stones often need an active procedure. Common options include:\n- Shock‑wave lithotripsy – sound waves break the stone into tiny pieces that can be passed in the urine.\n- Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) – a thin tube (ureteroscope) is passed up through the urethra and bladder into the kidney, where a laser breaks the stone. This is a “through‑the‑urethra” approach.\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a small incision is made in the back and a tube is inserted directly into the kidney to remove or break the stone.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared PCNL and RIRS in adults with kidney stones to see which method:\n- Achieves a higher stone‑free rate (more patients left without any stone fragments).\n- Leads to fewer major complications (serious side‑effects such as significant bleeding or organ injury).\n- Reduces the need for secondary interventions (additional procedures after the first treatment).\n- Affects other outcomes such as length of hospital stay, ureteral injury, unplanned medical visits, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched databases for randomised controlled trials that compared PCNL with RIRS in adults. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and combined the results. We rated our confidence in each result using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- Stone‑free rate: About 10 more patients per 100 are stone‑free after PCNL than after RIRS.\n- Major complications: Serious complications are almost the same for both procedures – only a few fewer per 1,000 patients with PCNL.\n- Need for secondary procedures: Roughly 15 fewer patients per 100 need another procedure after PCNL.\n- Length of hospital stay: PCNL may add about one extra day in the hospital compared with RIRS.\n- Ureteral stricture or injury: PCNL probably makes little or no difference to this risk.\n- Unplanned medical visits and quality of life: No trial reported these outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany of the studies were small, some participants knew the treatment they received, and follow‑up was limited. Therefore, we need higher‑quality trials that assess long‑term benefits, harms, quality of life, and costs.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nPCNL gives a higher chance of being stone‑free and may reduce the need for another procedure, but it may keep you in hospital a little longer. Serious complications appear similar between the two methods. Because we lack data on quality of life and unplanned medical visits, we cannot say how the procedures affect daily living.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched databases for studies published up to March 2023, so the evidence reflects the literature available at that time.",

Patients may not understand what the procedures actually involve.\n   *Rewrite:* “Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – a procedure where a small cut is made in the back and a tube is used to reach the kidney and remove the stone.” and “Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) – a less invasive method that uses a thin tube passed up through the urethra and bladder to the kidney, where a laser breaks the stone.”\n2. **Vague quantification of harms** – the sentence “only a few fewer per 1,000 patients with PCNL” does not tell readers the actual size of the difference.\n   *Rewrite:* “Serious complications are almost the same for both procedures – PCNL results in about 6 fewer major complications per 1,000 patients compared with RIRS.”\n3. **Awkward, passive phrasing** – the statement “The evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search.” is confusing and passive.\n   *Rewrite:* “We searched the literature up to March 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.”\nThese three issues are enough to impede patient understanding, so the PLS cannot be approved in its current form.\n\n**Metric support:** The evaluation shows a high count of complex Dale‑Chall words (complex_words_dc = 230, P90) indicating many unfamiliar terms, confirming the need to simplify jargon. Passive voice count (14, P75) also reflects the awkward sentence noted above. All other readability metrics are within typical ranges, so the main problems are lexical and phrasing rather than overall readability.",

The only notable deviation is a high number of Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (complex_words_dc = 230, P90), suggesting the text uses more technical vocabulary than usual and should be simplified."
