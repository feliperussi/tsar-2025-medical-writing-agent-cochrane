  "draft": "Which nerve block (regional pain relief) technique provides the most pain relief after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages:\n- All four nerve‑block techniques – paravertebral block (PVB, an injection near the spinal nerves), erector spinae plane block (ESPB, an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine), pectoral nerve block (PEC, an injection near the chest‑muscle nerves), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB, an injection near the side‑chest muscle) – give similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery; PEC may be a little better than PVB, but the difference is small and not clearly important.\n- The evidence for pain relief on the first day after surgery is fairly reliable, but data for later days are uncertain because the studies were small and varied.\n- No major complications were reported. Future research should compare the blocks in larger, well‑designed trials and look at longer‑term recovery.\n\nWhy is pain after breast cancer surgery a concern?\nWomen who have surgery, we know, often feel pain afterwards. This pain can make it hard to move, disturb sleep, and slow recovery, lowering quality of life. Doctors usually give opioids or anti‑inflammatory drugs, but these medicines can cause nausea, constipation, or dependence. To reduce the need for these medicines, we sometimes use regional analgesia – a technique that numbs a specific area by injecting a local anaesthetic near the nerves that supply the breast. The common regional techniques are:\n- Paravertebral block (PVB) – an injection near the spinal nerves.\n- Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) – an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine.\n- Pectoral nerve block (PEC) – an injection near the nerves that run through the chest muscles.\n- Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) – an injection near the nerves on the side of the chest.\nThese methods can lessen pain and carry only small risks such as bleeding or nerve injury.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe set out to compare the four regional analgesia techniques used after breast cancer surgery. Specifically, we asked:\n- How well does each technique reduce postoperative pain, measured on a 0‑to‑10 scale (visual analogue or numeric rating scale)?\n- Does any technique cause more complications or side‑effects?\n- How do the techniques affect other recovery outcomes such as the need for extra pain medicines, nausea, and overall quality of recovery?\nWe gathered all relevant randomised trials and used a statistical method called network meta‑analysis – a way of comparing several treatments even when some have not been directly compared in the same study.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science) from their start dates to 6 June 2023, without language or date limits. We included randomised controlled trials that compared two or more of the four blocks in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. Two reviewers checked each study for risk of bias, and we rated the certainty of the evidence using the CINeMA approach (a systematic tool for assessing confidence in network meta‑analysis results). We considered a one‑point difference on the 0‑to‑10 pain scale as the minimal clinically important difference (the smallest change that matters to patients).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 39 trials involving 2,348 women, most of whom had a modified radical mastectomy. The trials were conducted in seven countries and all surgeries used general anaesthesia.\n- Two hours after surgery, pain at rest was similar for all blocks compared with the paravertebral block. PEC reduced pain by about 0.5 points on the 0‑to‑10 scale, which is less than the minimal clinically important difference.\n- For pain during movement at two hours, PEC may reduce pain a little more than PVB, while ESPB and SAPB showed similar effects.\n- At 24 hours, PEC again showed a small advantage over PVB; the other blocks remained comparable.\n- Few studies reported pain at 48 hours, and the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Three studies recorded complications and reported no major events such as block failure, toxicity, nerve damage, or pneumothorax.\nOverall, the four techniques provide comparable pain relief and have similar safety profiles.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these results because most studies were small and varied in patient types and how the blocks were performed. This variability reduces the precision of our estimates and makes the evidence for later time points less certain.\n\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence includes all studies published up to June 2023, so it reflects the most recent research available.",

Key issues include unexplained technical jargon, overly long sentences, noun‑heavy phrasing, and excessive nominalisation. These stem from metric deviations (high SMOG index, many complex/long words, many nouns and nominalisations). The following revisions are needed:\n1. **Jargon without plain‑language definition** – \"network meta‑analysis\" and \"CINeMA\" are not explained.\n2. **Sentence length >30 words** – the sentence describing the statistical method is 33 words and hard to follow.\n3. **Nominalisation and noun‑heavy phrasing** – many sentences use abstract nouns (e.g., \"the evidence includes…\") making the text dense.\n4. **Complex words and long words** – terms like \"heterogeneity\", \"imprecision\", \"moderately\" increase reading difficulty.\nAddressing these will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns (lower SMOG, fewer complex/long words, fewer nouns and nominalisations).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit (770 words) and has good readability scores (Flesch Reading Ease 52.8, active voice 62). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in several areas: SMOG index (15.3, beyond the 90th percentile), complex words (162, beyond 90th), complex Dale‑Chall words (310, beyond 90th), long words (198, beyond 90th), nominalisations (25, beyond 90th) and total nouns (238, beyond 90th). These metrics indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than usual for plain‑language summaries, supporting the need for the suggested simplifications."
