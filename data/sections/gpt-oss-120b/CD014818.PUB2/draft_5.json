  "draft": "Which nerve block (regional pain relief) technique provides the most pain relief after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages:\n- All four nerve‑block techniques – paravertebral block (PVB, an injection near the spinal nerves), erector spinae plane block (ESPB, an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine), pectoral nerve block (PEC, an injection near the chest‑muscle nerves), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB, an injection near the side‑chest muscle) – give similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery; PEC may be a little better than PVB, but the difference is small and not clearly important.\n- The evidence for pain relief on the first day after surgery is fairly reliable, but data for later days are uncertain because the studies were small and varied.\n- No major complications were reported. Future research should compare the blocks in larger, well‑designed trials and look at longer‑term recovery.\n\nWhy is pain after breast cancer surgery a concern?\nWomen who have surgery to remove breast cancer often feel pain afterwards. This pain can make it hard to move, disturb sleep, and slow recovery, lowering quality of life. Doctors usually give opioids or anti‑inflammatory drugs, but these medicines can cause nausea, constipation, or dependence. To reduce the need for these medicines, we sometimes use regional analgesia – a technique that numbs a specific area by injecting a local anaesthetic near the nerves that supply the breast. The common regional techniques are:\n- Paravertebral block (PVB) – an injection near the spinal nerves.\n- Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) – an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine.\n- Pectoral nerve block (PEC) – an injection near the nerves that run through the chest muscles.\n- Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) – an injection near the nerves on the side of the chest.\nThese methods can lessen pain and carry only small risks such as bleeding or nerve injury.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the four regional analgesia techniques used after breast cancer surgery. Specifically we asked:\n- How well does each technique reduce postoperative pain, measured on a simple 0‑to‑10 scale?\n- Does any technique cause more complications or side‑effects?\n- How do the techniques affect other recovery outcomes such as the need for extra pain medicines, nausea, and overall quality of recovery?\nTo answer these questions we gathered all relevant randomised trials and used a statistical method called a network meta‑analysis – a way of comparing several treatments even when some have not been directly compared in the same study. We also used CINeMA (Confidence In Network Meta‑Analysis) to judge how confident we can be in the results.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science) from their start dates to 6 June 2023, without language or date limits. We included randomised controlled trials that compared two or more of the four blocks in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. Two reviewers checked each study for risk of bias, and we rated the certainty of the evidence with CINeMA. We considered a one‑point difference on the 0‑to‑10 pain scale as the minimal clinically important difference – the smallest change that matters to patients.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 39 trials involving 2,348 women, most of whom had a modified radical mastectomy. The trials were done in seven countries and all surgeries used general anaesthesia.\n- Two hours after surgery, pain at rest was similar for all blocks compared with the paravertebral block. PEC reduced pain by about 0.5 points on the 0‑to‑10 scale, which is less than the minimal clinically important difference.\n- For pain during movement at two hours, PEC may reduce pain a little more than PVB, while ESPB and SAPB showed similar effects.\n- At 24 hours, PEC again showed a small advantage over PVB; the other blocks remained comparable.\n- Few studies reported pain at 48 hours, and the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Three studies recorded complications and reported no major events such as block failure, toxicity, nerve damage, or pneumothorax.\nOverall, the four techniques provide comparable pain relief and have similar safety profiles.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these results because most studies were small and varied in patient types and how the blocks were performed. This variability reduces the precision of our estimates and makes the evidence for later time points less certain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence includes all studies published up to June 2023, so it reflects the most recent research available.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required structural checks, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader. 1) A very long sentence packs many facts together, making it hard to follow (e.g., \"We looked at 39 randomised trials that together involved 2,348 women having breast cancer surgery, most often a modified radical mastectomy. The studies were carried out in seven countries – Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the United States and Thailand, and all surgeries were done under general anaesthesia in hospitals.\"). 2) The term CINeMA is introduced without a plain‑language explanation, leaving readers unsure what it does. 3) The phrase \"moderately confident\" is vague and could be replaced with \"moderate confidence\" for clearer meaning. 4) \"first day after surgery\" is ambiguous; specifying \"first 24 hours\" aligns with the data. 5) The key‑message sentence about early‑day evidence is dense and could be split for readability. These issues, combined with metric flags (high nominalisation, many nouns, high SMOG, many complex and long words), indicate the draft needs revision before it can be approved.\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Split the long trial description into two sentences: \"We looked at 39 randomised trials involving 2,348 women who had breast cancer surgery, most often a modified radical mastectomy. The studies were conducted in seven countries (Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the United States, and Thailand) and all surgeries used general anaesthesia in hospitals.\"\n- Explain CINeMA: \"We also used a tool called CINeMA (Confidence In Network Meta‑Analysis) that is a method to judge how reliable the results are.\"\n- Replace confidence wording: \"We have moderate confidence in these results because most studies were small and varied in patient types and how the blocks were performed.\"\n- Clarify timing: \"The evidence for pain relief during the first 24 hours after surgery is fairly reliable, but data for later days are uncertain because the studies were small and varied.\"\n- Break the key‑message sentence: \"The evidence for pain relief on the first day after surgery is fairly reliable. However, data for later days are uncertain because the studies were small and varied.\"\n\nAddressing these points will improve readability, reduce jargon, and bring the draft’s linguistic profile closer to typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but shows several metric deviations: nominalisation (25, beyond P90), noun count (234, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.2, beyond P90), complex words (157, beyond P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (300, beyond P90) and long words (194, beyond P90). These indicate a higher than typical lexical complexity, supporting the need to simplify wording and reduce noun‑ and jargon‑heavy constructions."
