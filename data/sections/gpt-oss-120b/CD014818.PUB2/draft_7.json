  "draft": "Which nerve block (regional pain relief) technique provides the most pain relief after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages:\n- All four nerve‑block techniques – paravertebral block (PVB, an injection near the spinal nerves), erector spinae plane block (ESPB, an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine), pectoral nerve block (PEC, an injection near the chest‑muscle nerves), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB, an injection near the side‑chest muscle) – give similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery; any small advantage of PEC over PVB is not large enough to matter to patients.\n- The evidence for pain relief in the first 24 hours after surgery is fairly reliable, but data for later days are uncertain because the studies were small and varied.\n- No major complications were reported. Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to confirm these findings and to explore longer‑term recovery.\n\nWhy is pain after breast cancer surgery a concern?\nWomen who have surgery to remove breast cancer often feel pain afterwards. This pain can make it hard to move, disturb sleep, and slow recovery, lowering quality of life. Doctors usually give opioids or anti‑inflammatory drugs, but these can cause nausea, constipation, or dependence. To reduce the need for these medicines, we sometimes use regional analgesia – a technique that numbs a specific area by injecting a local anaesthetic near the nerves that supply the breast. The common regional techniques are:\n- Paravertebral block (PVB) – an injection near the spinal nerves.\n- Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) – an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine.\n- Pectoral nerve block (PEC) – an injection near the nerves that run through the chest muscles.\n- Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) – an injection near the nerves on the side of the chest.\nThese methods can lessen pain and carry only small risks such as bleeding or nerve injury.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the four regional analgesia techniques used after breast cancer surgery. Specifically we asked:\n- How well does each technique reduce postoperative pain, measured on a simple 0‑to‑10 scale?\n- Does any technique cause more complications or side‑effects?\n- How do the techniques affect other recovery outcomes such as the need for extra pain medicines, nausea, and overall quality of recovery?\nTo answer these questions we gathered all relevant randomised trials and used a statistical method that lets us compare several treatments at once, even when some have not been directly compared in the same study. We also used a tool called CINeMA, which tells us how much confidence we can have in the results.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science) from their start dates to 6 June 2023, without language or date limits. We included randomised controlled trials that compared two or more of the four blocks in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. Two reviewers checked each study for risk of bias, and we rated the certainty of the evidence with CINeMA. We considered a one‑point difference on the 0‑to‑10 pain scale as the minimal clinically important difference – the smallest change that matters to patients.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 39 randomised trials that included 2,348 women. Most of these women underwent a modified radical mastectomy. Researchers carried out the studies in seven countries – Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the United States, and Thailand – and all surgeries used general anaesthesia in hospitals.\nTwo hours after surgery, pain at rest was similar across all four blocks; none proved clearly better than the others. PEC reduced pain by about 0.5 points compared with PVB, which is less than the minimal clinically important difference. During movement at two hours, PEC may reduce pain a little more than PVB, while ESPB and SAPB showed similar effects.\nAt 24 hours, PEC again showed a small advantage over PVB, but the difference remained below the threshold that patients notice. The other blocks remained comparable. Only a few studies reported pain at 48 hours, and the evidence for this time point is very uncertain.\nThree studies (170 participants) recorded complications and reported no major events such as block failure, toxicity, nerve damage, or pneumothorax.\nOverall, the four techniques provide comparable pain relief and have similar safety profiles.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have moderate confidence in these results because most studies were small and varied in patient types and how the blocks were performed. This variability reduces the precision of our estimates and makes the evidence for later time points less certain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence includes all studies published up to June 2023, so it reflects the most recent research available.",

We searched from the earliest records up to 6 June 2023 and did not limit the search by language or date.”\n3. **Unclear confidence wording** – the phrase “We are moderately confident in these results” is vague for patients.\n   *Rewrite:* “We have a moderate level of confidence in these findings, meaning the evidence is useful but still has some uncertainty because the studies were small and varied.”\nThese issues directly affect reader understanding and are supported by the metric analysis, which shows high levels of nominalisation, long words, and complex vocabulary (e.g., SMOG 15.3, complex_words 158, long_words 202). Reducing jargon, shortening sentences, and using clearer expressions will bring the draft in line with Cochrane plain‑language standards.",

These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many long, complex terms than usual, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce jargon."
