  "draft": "Which nerve block (regional pain relief) technique provides the most pain relief after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages:\n- All four regional analgesia techniques – paravertebral block (PVB, an injection near the spine), erector spinae plane block (ESPB, an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine), pectoral nerve block (PEC, an injection near the chest muscles), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB, an injection near the side chest muscle) – give similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery; PEC may be slightly better than PVB, but the difference is small and not clearly important, and no major complications were reported.\n- The evidence for pain relief on the first day after surgery is fairly reliable for some comparisons, but for later time points and for several blocks the data are less certain because the studies were small and varied.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that directly compare these blocks, examine longer‑term pain and recovery outcomes, and monitor any rare side effects.\n\nWhy is pain after breast cancer surgery a concern?\nWomen who have surgery to remove breast cancer often feel pain afterwards. This pain can limit movement, disturb sleep, and slow recovery, which lowers quality of life. Doctors usually give opioids or anti‑inflammatory drugs, but these medicines can cause nausea, constipation, or dependence. To reduce the need for these drugs, we sometimes use regional analgesia – a technique that numbs a specific area by injecting a local anaesthetic near the nerves that supply the breast. The common techniques are:\n- Paravertebral block (PVB) – an injection near the spinal nerves.\n- Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) – an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine.\n- Pectoral nerve block (PEC) – an injection near the chest‑muscle nerves.\n- Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) – an injection near the side‑chest muscle nerves.\nThese methods can lessen pain, but they carry small risks such as bleeding or nerve injury. Knowing which technique works best and is safest helps women recover more comfortably.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe aimed to compare the four regional analgesia techniques used after breast cancer surgery. Specifically, we wanted to know:\n- How well each technique reduces postoperative pain, measured on a 0‑to‑10 visual analogue or numeric rating scale.\n- Whether any technique leads to more complications or side‑effects.\n- How the techniques affect other recovery outcomes such as additional pain‑medicine use, nausea, and overall quality of recovery.\nWe gathered all relevant randomised trials and used a network meta‑analysis – a statistical method that allows us to compare several treatments even when some have not been directly compared in the same study.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science) from their start dates to 6 June 2023 without language or date limits. We included randomised controlled trials that compared two or more of the four blocks in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. Two reviewers assessed risk of bias and we rated the certainty of the evidence with the CINeMA approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 39 trials involving 2,348 women, most of whom had a modified radical mastectomy. The trials were conducted in seven countries and all surgeries used general anaesthesia. The main findings were:\n- At two hours after surgery, pain at rest was similar for all blocks compared with PVB. PEC reduced pain slightly more than PVB (mean difference ‑0.47 on the 0‑10 scale), but this change is smaller than the minimal clinically important difference.\n- For pain during movement at two hours, PEC may reduce pain more than PVB, while ESPB and SAPB show similar effects.\n- At 24 hours, PEC again shows a small advantage over PVB for pain at rest; ESPB and SAPB remain comparable to PVB.\n- For pain during movement at 24 hours, ESPB, PEC, and SAPB all appear similarly effective to PVB.\n- Few studies reported pain at 48 hours, and the evidence is very uncertain.\n- No major complications (such as block failure, toxicity, nerve damage, or pneumothorax) were reported in the three studies that recorded them.\nOverall, the four techniques provide comparable pain relief and have similar safety profiles.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these results because most studies were small and varied in participants and how the blocks were performed. This heterogeneity reduces the precision of the estimates.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.\n",
