  "draft": "Which nerve block (regional pain relief) technique provides the most pain relief after breast cancer surgery?\n\n- All of the regional analgesia techniques studied – paravertebral block (PVB, an injection near the spine), erector spinae plane block (ESPB, an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine), pectoral nerve block (PEC, an injection near the chest muscles), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB, an injection near the side chest muscle) – provide similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery; PEC may be slightly better than PVB, but the difference is small and not clearly important, and no major complications were reported.\n- The evidence for pain relief in the first day after surgery is fairly reliable for some comparisons, but for later time points and for several blocks the data are less certain because the studies were small and varied.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that directly compare these blocks, examine longer‑term pain and recovery outcomes, and monitor any rare side effects.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\n\nWhy is pain after breast cancer surgery a concern?\nWomen who have surgery to remove breast cancer often experience pain after the operation. This pain can make it hard to move, affect sleep, and slow recovery, which can lower quality of life. While doctors give medicines called opioids or anti‑inflammatory drugs to control pain, these can cause side‑effects such as nausea, constipation, or dependence. To reduce the need for these medicines, doctors sometimes use \"regional analgesia\" – a technique that numbs a specific area of the body by injecting a local anaesthetic near the nerves that supply the breast. Common regional techniques include:\n- Paravertebral block (PVB) – an injection near the spinal nerves.\n- Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) – an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine.\n- Pectoral nerve block (PEC) – an injection near the nerves that run through the chest muscles.\n- Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) – an injection near the nerves on the side of the chest.\nThese methods can lessen pain, but they also carry small risks such as bleeding or nerve injury. Understanding which technique works best and is safest is important for helping women recover comfortably after breast cancer surgery.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review authors set out to compare the different regional analgesia techniques used after breast cancer surgery. Specifically, they wanted to know:\n- How well each technique reduces postoperative pain (measured on a simple 0‑to‑10 scale called the visual analogue or numeric rating scale).\n- Whether any of the techniques lead to more complications or side‑effects.\n- Their impact on other recovery outcomes such as the need for additional pain medicines, nausea, and overall quality of recovery.\nTo do this, they gathered all relevant randomised trials and used a statistical method called a \"network meta‑analysis\" – a way of comparing several treatments even when some have not been directly compared in the same study. The goal was to identify which regional block provides the best balance of pain relief and safety for women undergoing breast cancer surgery.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies comparing regional analgesia techniques for breast cancer surgery, combined their results using network meta‑analysis, and rated our confidence in the evidence with a systematic certainty assessment.\n\n**Results**\nWe looked at 39 randomised trials that together involved 2,348 women having breast cancer surgery, most often a modified radical mastectomy. The studies were carried out in seven countries – Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the United States and Thailand – and all surgeries were done under general anaesthesia in hospitals. The trials compared four types of regional anaesthesia that are given around the chest area: paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC) and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB).\n\nOverall, the different blocks performed about the same. Two hours after surgery, there was little or no difference in pain at rest between any of the blocks and the standard paravertebral block, and \n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because studies were very small, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search.",

These issues would confuse readers and breach the style guide. Suggested improvements: 1) Rewrite all subheadings as questions; 2) Complete the Results paragraph with the missing pain‑outcome data; 3) Reduce long, noun‑heavy sentences and passive constructions to improve readability. Metrics support these edits: the draft has 15 passive voice instances (high), 23 nominalizations, 25.5 words per sentence (above median), and very high counts of complex and long words, indicating the need for simpler, more active phrasing.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate overall conformity but several metrics deviate beyond the typical range: words per sentence (25.5, P90), nominalizations (23, P90), nouns (235, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.1, beyond P90), complex words (152, beyond P90), complex words (Dale‑Chall) (288, beyond P90), and long words (193, beyond P90). These indicate the draft is overly complex and noun‑heavy, reinforcing the need to shorten sentences, use more active voice, and replace technical jargon with plain language."
