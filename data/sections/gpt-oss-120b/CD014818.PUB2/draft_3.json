  "draft": "Which nerve block technique provides the most pain relief after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages:\n- All four nerve‑block techniques – paravertebral block (an injection near the spinal nerves), erector spinae plane block (an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine), pectoral nerve block (an injection near the chest‑muscle nerves), and serratus anterior plane block (an injection near the side‑chest muscle) – give similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery; the pectoral block may be a little better than the paravertebral block, but the difference is small and not clearly important.\n- The evidence for pain relief on the first day after surgery is fairly reliable, but data for later days are uncertain because the studies were small and varied.\n- No major complications were reported, and future research should compare the blocks in larger, well‑designed trials and look at longer‑term recovery.\n\nWhy is pain after breast cancer surgery a concern?\nWomen who have surgery to remove breast cancer often feel pain afterwards. This pain can make it hard to move, disturb sleep, and slow recovery, which lowers quality of life. Doctors usually give opioids or anti‑inflammatory drugs, but these can cause nausea, constipation, or dependence. To reduce the need for these medicines, we sometimes use regional analgesia – a technique that numbs a specific area by injecting a local anaesthetic near the nerves that supply the breast. The common techniques are:\n- Paravertebral block – an injection near the spinal nerves.\n- Erector spinae plane block – an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine.\n- Pectoral nerve block – an injection near the chest‑muscle nerves.\n- Serratus anterior plane block – an injection near the side‑chest muscle nerves.\nThese methods can lessen pain, and they carry only small risks such as bleeding or nerve injury.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the four regional analgesia techniques used after breast cancer surgery. Specifically, we asked:\n- How well does each technique reduce postoperative pain, measured on a simple 0‑to‑10 scale (the visual analogue or numeric rating scale)?\n- Does any technique cause more complications or side‑effects?\n- How do the techniques affect other recovery outcomes such as the need for extra pain medicines, nausea, and overall quality of recovery?\nWe gathered all relevant randomised trials and used a statistical method called network meta‑analysis – a way of comparing several treatments even when some have not been directly compared in the same study.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science) from their start dates to 6 June 2023, without language or date limits. We included randomised controlled trials that compared two or more of the four blocks in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. Two reviewers checked each study for risk of bias, and we rated the certainty of the evidence using the CINeMA approach. We considered a one‑point difference on the 0‑to‑10 pain scale as the minimal clinically important difference (the smallest change that matters to patients).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 39 trials involving 2,348 women, most of whom had a modified radical mastectomy. The trials were conducted in seven countries and all surgeries used general anaesthesia.\n- Two hours after surgery, pain at rest was similar for all blocks compared with the paravertebral block. The pectoral block reduced pain slightly more (about 0.5 points on the 0‑to‑10 scale), but this is less than the minimal clinically important difference.\n- For pain during movement at two hours, the pectoral block may reduce pain a little more than the paravertebral block, while the erector spinae plane and serratus anterior plane blocks show similar effects.\n- At 24 hours, the pectoral block again shows a small advantage over the paravertebral block; the other blocks remain comparable.\n- Few studies reported pain at 48 hours, and the evidence is very uncertain.\n- No major complications such as block failure, toxicity, nerve damage, or pneumothorax were reported in the three studies that recorded them.\nOverall, the four techniques provide comparable pain relief and have similar safety profiles.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these results because most studies were small and varied in the types of patients and how the blocks were performed. This variability reduces the precision of our estimates and makes the evidence for later time points less certain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence includes all studies published up to June 2023, so it reflects the most recent research available.\n",

Three major issues will likely confuse patients: (1) The first key‑message sentence is overly long and packed with multiple clauses, making it hard to follow; (2) The methods section mentions the CINeMA approach without any explanation, leaving readers unclear about what it is a systematic tool for assessing confidence in network meta‑analysis results; (3) Several sentences use passive voice and noun‑heavy constructions (e.g., “The trials were conducted…”, “No major complications … were reported”), which reduces readability and contributes to the high nominalisation (24) and noun count (237) seen in the metrics. These issues need to be rewritten into shorter, active sentences and jargon should be defined or removed.",

These indicate excessive noun‑heavy, complex language that aligns with the identified clarity problems."
