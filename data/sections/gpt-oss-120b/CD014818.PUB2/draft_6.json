  "draft": "Which nerve block (regional pain relief) technique provides the most pain relief after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages:\n- All four nerve‑block techniques – paravertebral block (PVB, an injection near the spinal nerves), erector spinae plane block (ESPB, an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine), pectoral nerve block (PEC, an injection near the chest‑muscle nerves), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB, an injection near the side‑chest muscle) – give similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery; PEC may be slightly better than PVB, but the difference is small and not clearly important.\n- The evidence for pain relief during the first 24 hours after surgery is fairly reliable. Data for later days are uncertain because the studies were small and varied.\n- No major complications were reported. Future research should compare the blocks in larger, well‑designed trials and look at longer‑term recovery.\n\nWhy is pain after breast cancer surgery a concern?\nWomen who have surgery to remove breast cancer often feel pain afterwards. This pain can make it hard to move, disturb sleep, and slow recovery, lowering quality of life. Doctors usually give opioids or anti‑inflammatory drugs, but these can cause nausea, constipation, or dependence. To reduce the need for these medicines, we sometimes use regional analgesia – a technique that numbs a specific area by injecting a local anaesthetic near the nerves that supply the breast. The common regional techniques are:\n- Paravertebral block (PVB) – an injection near the spinal nerves.\n- Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) – an injection into a muscle layer beside the spine.\n- Pectoral nerve block (PEC) – an injection near the nerves that run through the chest muscles.\n- Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) – an injection near the nerves on the side of the chest.\nThese methods can lessen pain and carry only small risks such as bleeding or nerve injury.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the four regional analgesia techniques used after breast cancer surgery. Specifically we asked:\n- How well does each technique reduce postoperative pain, measured on a simple 0‑to‑10 scale?\n- Does any technique cause more complications or side‑effects?\n- How do the techniques affect other recovery outcomes such as the need for extra pain medicines, nausea, and overall quality of recovery?\nTo answer these questions we gathered all relevant randomised trials and used a statistical method called a network meta‑analysis – a way of comparing several treatments even when some have not been directly compared in the same study. We also used a tool called CINeMA (Confidence In Network Meta‑Analysis) that helps us judge how reliable the results are.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science) from their start dates to 6 June 2023, without language or date limits. We included randomised controlled trials that compared two or more of the four blocks in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. Two reviewers checked each study for risk of bias, and we rated the certainty of the evidence with CINeMA. We considered a one‑point difference on the 0‑to‑10 pain scale as the minimal clinically important difference – the smallest change that matters to patients.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 39 randomised trials involving 2,348 women who had breast cancer surgery, most often a modified radical mastectomy. The studies were conducted in seven countries (Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the United States, and Thailand) and all surgeries used general anaesthesia in hospitals.\nTwo hours after surgery, pain at rest was similar for all blocks compared with the standard paravertebral block. PEC reduced pain by about 0.5 points on the 0‑to‑10 scale, which is less than the minimal clinically important difference. For pain during movement at two hours, PEC may reduce pain a little more than PVB, while ESPB and SAPB showed similar effects.\nAt 24 hours, PEC again showed a small advantage over PVB; the other blocks remained comparable. Few studies reported pain at 48 hours, and the evidence is very uncertain.\nThree studies (170 participants) recorded complications and reported no major events such as block failure, toxicity, nerve damage, or pneumothorax.\nOverall, the four techniques provide comparable pain relief and have similar safety profiles.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have moderate confidence in these results because most studies were small and varied in patient types and how the blocks were performed. This variability reduces the precision of our estimates and makes the evidence for later time points less certain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence includes all studies published up to June 2023, so it reflects the most recent research available.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required structural checks, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a patient reader:\n1. **Unclear comparator wording** – \"standard paravertebral block\" is confusing because PVB is one of the four blocks being compared. Rewrite to state that no block showed a clear advantage over the others.\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"We looked at 39 randomised trials involving 2,348 women who had breast cancer surgery, most often a modified radical mastectomy.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words and packs two ideas together. Split and simplify.\n3. **Technical jargon still present** – terms like \"network meta‑analysis\" and \"CINeMA\" are only briefly explained and may still be opaque. Replace with plain‑language equivalents (e.g., \"a statistical method that lets us compare several treatments at once\").\n4. **Passive constructions that hide the actor** – \"The studies were conducted in seven countries…\" can be made active to keep the reader oriented.\n5. **Heavy nominalisation** – many noun‑heavy phrases (e.g., \"assessment of certainty\") reduce readability; converting them to verbs improves flow.\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Original: \"Two hours after surgery, pain at rest was similar for all blocks compared with the standard paravertebral block.\" → Rewrite: \"Two hours after surgery, pain at rest was similar across all four blocks; none proved clearly better than the others.\"\n- Original: \"We looked at 39 randomised trials involving 2,348 women who had breast cancer surgery, most often a modified radical mastectomy.\" → Rewrite: \"We examined 39 randomised trials that included 2,348 women. Most of these women underwent a modified radical mastectomy.\"\n- Original: \"We also used a tool called CINeMA (Confidence In Network Meta‑Analysis) that helps us judge how reliable the results are.\" → Rewrite: \"We used a tool called CINeMA, which tells us how much confidence we can have in the results.\"\n- Original: \"The studies were conducted in seven countries…\" → Rewrite: \"Researchers carried out the studies in seven countries…\"\n- Original: \"We rated the certainty of the evidence with CINeMA.\" → Rewrite: \"We used CINeMA to rate how certain we are about the evidence.\"\nThese changes address the most important readability barriers while preserving all factual content.\n\nMetrics support: The draft shows a high nominalisation count (26, beyond the P90 benchmark) and unusually many complex words (160, beyond P90) and long words (201, beyond P90). Reducing noun‑heavy phrasing and simplifying vocabulary will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits and has good active‑voice (65) and pronoun use (32). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in nominalisation (26, beyond P90), noun count (240, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.3, beyond P90), complex words (160, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall complex words (311, beyond P90) and long words (201, beyond P90). These metrics indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many long/complex words than usual, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
