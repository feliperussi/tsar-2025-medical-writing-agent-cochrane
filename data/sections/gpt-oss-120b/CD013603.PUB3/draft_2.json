  "draft": "What are health workers' views and experiences of combining (integrating) primary health care services?\n\nWhat are the main messages?\n- Health workers' views and experiences of integrating primary health care (PHC) services vary widely. They see possible advantages such as more coordinated care, but also challenges like higher workload and unclear roles. The review did not find consistent evidence of specific benefits or harms across settings.\n- Evidence comes from many countries and covers many service areas (e.g., mental health, HIV/TB, maternal health, non‑communicable diseases) and integration strategies (horizontal integration, service expansion, service linkage). Most studies are cross‑sectional interviews; gaps remain in some regions and in the use of rigorous longitudinal designs.\n- Because the literature is heterogeneous and often shallow, future research should use longer‑term, in‑depth qualitative methods and clear conceptual frameworks to understand how different integration designs affect health workers' experiences and overall impact.\n\nWhy is integrating primary health care services important?\nPrimary health care (PHC) is the first point of contact for most people when they need medical help. In many low‑resource countries, services have been delivered as separate \"vertical\" programmes – for example, one programme for HIV, another for tuberculosis, and another for maternal health. Integrating these services means delivering them together as a coordinated package. This approach is promoted worldwide because it can make health systems more efficient, improve the quality of care, and help achieve universal health coverage (UHC) – the goal that everyone should have access to the health services they need without suffering financial hardship.\n\nWhat do we know about healthcare workers' views on this integration?\nHealthcare workers – doctors, nurses, community health workers, managers and policy makers – are the people who actually put integration plans into practice. Their attitudes, experiences and the challenges they face can strongly influence whether integration works well or not. Studies that explore these perspectives are very diverse: they come from many countries, use different research methods, and focus on a wide range of health service streams (such as mental health, HIV/TB, maternal health, non‑communicable diseases, and general PHC). This diversity makes it hard to see the overall picture of how healthcare workers shape the success of integration.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to map all qualitative research that looks at healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. By describing the types of studies, the countries involved, the health service areas examined and the integration strategies used, we wanted to create a clear overview of the evidence base. This overview can help researchers and decision‑makers understand how the variety in study designs, settings and contexts might affect the way healthcare workers influence the implementation and impact of integrated primary health care.\n\nHow did we find and analyse the evidence?\nWe searched for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that reported health‑care workers' perceptions and experiences of primary health‑care integration. We extracted key information, counted studies per indicator and converted these counts into proportions. We also added descriptive details about study methods, country settings, intervention types, integration strategies, participating workers and client groups. Finally, we assessed our confidence in the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 184 primary studies (reported in 191 papers) that looked at how health‑care workers perceive and experience integrated primary health services. The studies included policymakers, senior managers, frontline clinicians, allied health professionals, lay workers and support staff. They were conducted in 37 countries, about half in high‑income and half in low‑ and middle‑income settings; the United States, South Africa and Uganda were the most common. Integration efforts covered many service streams, such as mental health, HIV, tuberculosis, sexual and reproductive health, maternal and child health, non‑communicable diseases, general primary care and specialised services. Researchers described integration as either full or partial and used strategies like horizontal integration, service expansion or service linkage. The abstract omitted the total number of participants, the length of interventions and funding details. Because the evidence is diverse and comes from many contexts, we cannot say whether integration improves outcomes. This heterogeneity limits our ability to draw firm conclusions about the impact of primary‑health‑care integration.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. The studies involved different types of workers and used varied delivery methods. They do not cover all people or outcomes we need, and most studies were small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020.",

Re‑phrasing these as active verbs will improve flow.\n5. **Missing brief definitions for key concepts** – the importance of “primary health care (PHC)”, “universal health coverage (UHC)”, and “qualitative research” should be clarified for a lay audience.\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Replace jargon with plain language: \"cross‑sectional (a one‑time snapshot) interviews\", \"horizontal integration (bringing different services together at the same level)\", \"service expansion (adding new services)\", \"service linkage (connecting existing services)\".\n- Split the long sentence: \"We looked at 184 studies (reported in 191 papers). These studies examined how health‑care workers see and experience integrated primary health services.\"\n- Re‑state the limitation directly: \"We do not know how many people took part in each study, how long the integration lasted, or how the projects were funded, which limits our confidence in the findings.\"\n- Convert nouns to verbs: change \"the diversity of the evidence\" to \"the evidence varies a lot\", \"the variety in study designs\" to \"studies used many different designs\".\n- Add brief definitions: after first mention of PHC, add \"(the first point of contact for most people’s health needs)\"; after UHC, add \"(everyone can get the health services they need without financial hardship)\"; after qualitative research, add \"(studies that explore people’s experiences and views)\".\n\nThese changes address the most critical clarity issues and also help reduce the high noun and nominalisation counts flagged by the PLS evaluation (nouns = 256, nominalisations = 33, complex words > 150).",
