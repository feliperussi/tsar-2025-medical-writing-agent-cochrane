  "draft": "What are health workers' views and experiences of combining (integrating) primary health care services?\n\nKey messages\n- Health workers' views and experiences of integrating primary health care (PHC) services are highly varied; they note possible advantages such as more coordinated care, but also challenges like increased workload and unclear roles, and the review did not find consistent evidence of specific benefits or harmful effects across settings.\n- The evidence comes from many countries and covers a wide range of service areas (e.g., mental health, HIV/TB, maternal health, non‑communicable diseases) and integration strategies (horizontal integration, service expansion, service linkage), but most studies are cross‑sectional interviews and there are gaps in some regions and in the use of more rigorous, longitudinal designs.\n- Because the existing literature is heterogeneous and often limited in depth, future research should employ longer‑term, in‑depth qualitative methods and clear conceptual frameworks (theoretical models guiding study design) to better understand how different integration designs influence health workers' experiences and the overall impact of integration.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhy is integrating primary health care services important?\nPrimary health care (PHC) is the first point of contact for most people when they need medical help. In many countries, especially those with limited resources, health services have been delivered as separate \"vertical\" programmes – for example, one programme for HIV, another for tuberculosis, and another for maternal health. Integrating these services means delivering them together as a coordinated package. This approach is promoted worldwide because it can make health systems more efficient, improve the quality of care, and help achieve universal health coverage (UHC) – the goal that everyone should have access to the health services they need without suffering financial hardship.\n\nWhat do we know about healthcare workers' views on this integration?\nHealthcare workers – doctors, nurses, community health workers, managers and policy makers – are the people who actually put integration plans into practice. Their attitudes, experiences and the challenges they face can strongly influence whether integration works well or not. However, studies that explore these perspectives are very diverse: they come from many countries, use different research methods, and focus on a wide range of health service streams (such as mental health, HIV/TB, maternal health, non‑communicable diseases, and general PHC). This makes it hard to see the overall picture of how healthcare workers shape the success of integration.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors set out to map all the qualitative research that looks at healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. By describing the types of studies, the countries involved, the health service areas examined, and the integration strategies used, they wanted to create a clear overview of the evidence base. This overview can help researchers and decision‑makers understand how the variety in study designs, settings and contexts might affect the way healthcare workers influence the implementation and impact of integrated primary health care.\n\nMethods\nMethods\nWe searched for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies reporting healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of primary healthcare integration, extracted and counted key information to describe the evidence base, and assessed our confidence in the findings.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nThe review looked at 184 primary studies (from 191 papers) that explored how health‑care workers perceive and experience the integration of primary health services. The studies covered a wide range of worker groups – from policymakers and senior managers to frontline clinicians, allied health professionals, lay workers and support staff – and were carried out in 37 countries, roughly half in high‑income settings and half in low‑ and middle‑income settings, with the United States, South Africa and Uganda most frequently represented. Integration efforts involved many health‑service streams (mental health, HIV, tuberculosis, sexual and reproductive health, maternal and child health, non‑communicable diseases, general primary care and specialised services) and were described as either full or partial, using strategies such as horizontal integration, service expansion or service linkage. The abstract did not give the total number of participants, the length of any interventions, or details about funding sources. Because the evidence comes from many different countries, health‑service areas and types of workers, we do not know whether integrating primary health care actually improves outcomes. The diversity of the evidence makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the impact of primary‑health‑care integration.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention, because the evidence does not cover all of the people and outcomes we are interested in, and because the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020 of search.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failed: not all subheadings are phrased as questions. The sections \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are headings, not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide requirement. Additionally, the draft contains several clarity issues that would confuse readers: long sentences (>30 words), heavy noun‑heavy/nominalised phrasing, and excessive passive voice. These issues are reflected in the PLS evaluation (words per sentence 29.5 → BEYOND_P90; nominalisation 34 → BEYOND_P90; nouns 261 → BEYOND_P90; passive voice 11 → P50). To meet approval, rewrite subheadings as questions and simplify the prose as suggested below.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Current: \"Key messages\". Problem: not a question. Rewrite: \"What are the main messages?\".\n2. **Subheading format** – Current: \"Introduction/Aims\". Problem: not a question. Rewrite: \"Why is integrating primary health care important?\" (or similar question).\n3. **Subheading format** – Current: \"Methods\". Problem: not a question. Rewrite: \"How did we find and analyse the evidence?\".\n4. **Long sentence** – Quote: \"The review looked at 184 primary studies (from 191 papers) that explored how health‑care workers perceive and experience the integration of primary health services.\" Problem: 31 words, dense. Rewrite: \"We examined 184 primary studies (from 191 papers) that looked at how health‑care workers perceive and experience integrated primary health services.\".\n5. **Nominalisation / noun‑heavy** – Quote: \"The abstract did not give the total number of participants, the length of any interventions, or details about funding sources.\" Problem: noun‑heavy, passive feel. Rewrite: \"The abstract omitted the total participant count, intervention length, and funding details.\".\n\nSupporting evidence: The draft’s readability metrics are far outside typical PLS ranges (e.g., Flesch‑Kincaid grade 15.96, Gunning Fog 21.34, LIX 65.8). Reducing sentence length, using active voice, and cutting nominalisations will lower these scores toward the typical PLS range and improve reader comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft deviates from typical patterns on 14 metrics. Notably, words per‑sentence (29.5) and nominalisations (34) are well beyond the P90 range, indicating overly long sentences and noun‑heavy phrasing. Readability indices (FKGL 15.96, Gunning Fog 21.34, SMOG 16.42) are also beyond typical PLS levels, reflecting high complexity. Active voice usage is good (77, P75), but the subheading format requirement is not met, leading to a NOT_APPROVED judgment."
