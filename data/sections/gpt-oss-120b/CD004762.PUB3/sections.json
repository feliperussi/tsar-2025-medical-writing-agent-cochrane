  "key_messages": [
    "Medicines such as mexiletine can reduce myotonia (muscle stiffness) in people with non‑dystrophic myotonia and may improve some hand‑grip measures, but they do not clearly improve how patients feel their stiffness; in myotonic dystrophy the drug may speed muscle relaxation time (how quickly a muscle returns to normal after a contraction) without clear symptom benefit. Common side effects include stomach upset, tiredness and headache. Evidence comes from several well‑designed trials, giving a moderate level of confidence.",
    "Lamotrigine may improve muscle relaxation time and quality of life (overall wellbeing) in non‑dystrophic myotonia, but it also causes side effects like headache, fatigue and rash; other drugs tested (e.g., phenytoin, imipramine, etc.) have little or uncertain benefit because the studies were small and of lower quality.",
    "More large, high‑quality studies are needed, especially in myotonic dystrophy and for drugs that did not show clear benefit, to determine long‑term effects, identify who responds best, and explore additional treatment options."

      "subheading": "What is myotonia and why does it matter?",
      "content": "Myotonia is a condition where muscles take longer than normal to relax after they have been used. This can cause stiffness, painful cramps, sudden \"locking\" of the muscles, fatigue and reduced ability to move around. The problem is most common in two groups of inherited muscle disorders:\n\n* **Non‑dystrophic myotonia** – a genetic problem that mainly affects the muscle’s ion channels (the tiny gates that control the flow of electricity in muscle cells) and leads mainly to myotonia.\n* **Myotonic dystrophy** – a broader disease that not only causes myotonia but also progressive muscle weakness, heart rhythm problems, cataracts and other systemic issues.\n\nBecause the symptoms can be severe and disabling, people with these conditions often need treatment to improve muscle relaxation and quality of life."

    {
      "subheading": "What medicines are currently used to treat myotonia?",
      "content": "Doctors have tried several types of drugs to reduce the delayed muscle relaxation, including:\n\n* **Sodium channel blockers** (e.g., mexiletine) – medicines that calm the over‑active electrical signals in muscle cells.\n* **Tricyclic antidepressants**, **benzodiazepines**, **calcium antagonists**, **taurine**, and **prednisone** – other drug classes that have shown some benefit in small studies.\n\nThese treatments aim to lessen stiffness and improve daily functioning, but the evidence for how well they work and how safe they are has been uncertain."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the researchers aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors set out‑of‑the‑box two main questions:\n\n1. **How effective are drug treatments at reducing the symptoms of myotonia** (as reported by the people taking the medicines)?\n2. **How well are these drugs tolerated**, meaning what side‑effects they cause and how they affect overall quality of life?\n\nTo answer these, they searched for randomised controlled trials – the most reliable type of study – that compared any drug for myotonia with a placebo, no treatment, or another active drug."

      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched databases, trial registers, grey literature and experts for studies that compared drug treatments with placebo or other drugs in people with myotonia, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review identified 17 double‑blind or single‑blind randomized controlled trials that together enrolled 392 participants (219 with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 with non‑dystrophic myotonia). All trials compared a pharmacologic agent with either placebo or another active drug. The most frequently studied drugs were the sodium‑channel blocker mexiletine and the antiepileptic lamotrigine; other agents such as phenytoin, imipramine, procainamide and several others were evaluated in smaller trials. The abstract does not provide details on follow‑up length, participant age, gender distribution, severity of myotonia, study locations or funding sources."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness in non‑dystrophic myotonia",
      "content": "In people with non‑dystrophic myotonia, taking mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness, probably shortens the time it takes for muscles to relax, probably improves hand‑grip strength slightly, and probably lessens abnormal electrical activity in the muscles. The evidence for these effectiveness outcomes is of moderate certainty. In people with myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine probably shortens hand‑grip relaxation time, but it is unclear whether it improves overall clinical myotonia scores."

  ],
  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search."
