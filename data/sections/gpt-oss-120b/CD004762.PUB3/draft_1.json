Common side effects include stomach upset, tiredness and headache. Evidence comes from several well‑designed trials, giving a moderate level of confidence.\n- Lamotrigine may improve muscle relaxation time and quality of life (overall wellbeing) in non‑dystrophic myotonia, but it also causes side effects like headache, fatigue and rash; other drugs tested (e.g., phenytoin, imipramine, etc.) have little or uncertain benefit because the studies were small and of lower quality.\n- More large, high‑of‑quality studies are needed, especially in myotonic dystrophy and for drugs that did not show clear benefit, to determine long‑term effects, identify who responds best, and explore additional treatment options.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is myotonia and why does it matter?\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles take longer than normal to relax after they have been used. This can cause stiffness, painful cramps, sudden \"locking\" of the muscles, fatigue and reduced ability to move around. The problem is most common in two groups of inherited muscle disorders:\n* Non‑dystrophic myotonia – a genetic problem that mainly affects the muscle’s ion channels (the tiny gates that control the flow of electricity in muscle cells) and leads mainly to myotonia.\n* Myotonic dystrophy – a broader disease that not only causes myotonia but also progressive muscle weakness, heart rhythm problems, cataracts and other systemic issues.\nBecause the symptoms can be severe and disabling, people with these conditions often need treatment to improve muscle relaxation and quality of life.\n\nWhat medicines are currently used to treat myotonia?\nDoctors have tried several types of drugs to reduce the delayed muscle relaxation, including:\n* Sodium channel blockers (e.g., mexiletine) – medicines that calm the over‑active electrical signals in muscle cells.\n* Tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, calcium antagonists, taurine, and prednisone – other drug classes that have shown some benefit in small studies.\nThese treatments aim to lessen stiffness and improve daily functioning, but the evidence for how well they work and how safe they are has been uncertain.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to find out?\nThe review authors set out‑of‑the‑box two main questions:\n1. How effective are drug treatments at reducing the symptoms of myotonia (as reported by the people taking the medicines)?\n2. How well are these drugs tolerated, meaning what side‑effects they cause and how they affect overall quality of life?\nTo answer these, they searched for randomised controlled trials – the most reliable type of study – that compared any drug for myotonia with a placebo, no treatment, or another active drug.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched databases, trial registers, grey literature and experts for studies that compared drug treatments with placebo or other drugs in people with myotonia, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review identified 17 double‑blind or single‑blind randomized controlled trials that together enrolled 392 participants (219 with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 with non‑dystrophic myotonia). All trials compared a pharmacologic agent with either placebo or another active drug. The most frequently studied drugs were the sodium‑channel blocker mexiletine and the antiepileptic lamotrigine; other agents such as phenytoin, imipramine, procainamide and several others were evaluated in smaller trials. The abstract does not provide details on follow‑up length, participant age, gender distribution, severity of myotonia, study locations or funding sources.\n\nMain results: Mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness in non‑dystrophic myotonia\nIn people with non‑dystrophic myotonia, taking mexiletine probably reduces muscle stiffness, probably shortens the time it takes for muscles to relax, probably improves hand‑grip strength slightly, and probably lessens abnormal electrical activity in the muscles. The evidence for these effectiveness outcomes is of moderate certainty. In people with myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine probably shortens hand‑grip relaxation time, but it is unclear whether it improves overall clinical myotonia scores.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search.",

This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement. Additionally, the draft contains several clarity problems that would confuse readers:\n1. **Jargon without explanation** – terms such as “double‑blind”, “cross‑over”, and “hand‑grip relaxation time” are used without lay definitions. \n   *Rewrite*: \"double‑blind (where neither the participant nor the researcher knows which treatment is given)\"; \"hand‑grip relaxation time (how quickly the hand can relax after squeezing)\".\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"The review identified 17 double‑blind or single‑blind randomized controlled trials that together enrolled 392 participants (219 with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 with non‑dystrophic myotonia).\" This exceeds 30 words and packs several facts together.\n   *Rewrite*: \"We found 17 trials that tested drugs for myotonia. In total, 392 people took part – 219 had myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 had non‑dystrophic myotonia.\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy bullet points** – the first key‑message bullet reads like a paragraph, making it hard to scan.\n   *Rewrite*: break into shorter bullet items, e.g., \"- Mexiletine can reduce muscle stiffness in non‑dystrophic myotonia.\\n- It may improve hand‑grip strength, but does not clearly change how patients feel their stiffness.\\n- Common side‑effects are stomach upset, tiredness and headache.\"\n4. **Passive constructions** – the draft contains 21 passive‑voice instances (well above the typical PLS range of 9‑23). Converting them to active voice clarifies who did what.\n   *Example*: change \"The abstract does not provide details on follow‑up length\" to \"We do not have details on follow‑up length in the abstract\".\n5. **High noun density** – 243 nouns (beyond typical PLS range) and high complexity scores (SMOG 16, Dale‑Chall 8.6) indicate the text is too noun‑heavy and uses many long words. Reducing nominalisations (currently 21, above the typical 8‑27) and replacing long words with simpler alternatives will lower these metrics and improve readability.\n\nThese issues, together with the subheading format problem, mean the PLS does not meet the required standards.",

These indicate excessive noun‑heavy, complex language and many passive constructions, supporting the need for the clarity and style improvements outlined above."
