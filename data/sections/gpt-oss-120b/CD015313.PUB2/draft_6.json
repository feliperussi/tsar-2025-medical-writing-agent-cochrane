  "draft": "Do mucus‑thinning medicines (mucolytics) reduce flare‑ups and improve breathing in children with chronic wet‑cough lung disease (such as bronchiectasis)?\n\nKey messages –\n- One small study suggests that inhaling a salty mist (3 % hypertonic saline) before chest physiotherapy may lower the number of flare‑ups and improve lung function in children with non‑cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, but the evidence is very uncertain because the study was tiny, unblinded and had missing data. No harmful effects were reported.\n- The review found no data on quality of life and did not identify any other mucus‑thinning medicines.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to confirm whether mucolytics are effective and safe for children with chronic wet‑cough lung disease.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative lung disease in children and why is it a problem?\nSome children have long‑lasting lung conditions that cause a wet, noisy cough that keeps coming back. This group of conditions is called chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD). It includes:\n- Bronchiectasis – the airways become widened and scarred, making it hard to clear mucus.\n- Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) – a persistent bacterial infection that also leads to a wet cough.\nThick mucus traps germs, triggers repeated infections and inflammation, and can cause frequent flare‑ups (exacerbations), missed school, tiredness and reduced lung function. Current care usually involves chest physiotherapy (special breathing techniques to move mucus out) and antibiotics during flare‑ups. Families and clinicians are looking for additional ways to clear mucus.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe asked two questions:\n1. Does a mucolytic medicine reduce the number of flare‑ups, improve breathing tests (such as FEV1 – the amount of air a child can force out in one second, and FVC – the total amount of air exhaled), or enhance quality of life for children with CSLD?\n2. Is the treatment safe, or does it cause unwanted side effects?\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised trials that compared a mucolytic with no treatment or placebo in children (≤18 years) with CSLD. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts and full‑text articles, extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk‑of‑bias tool and GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified one randomised trial that enrolled 52 school‑age children (average age 9½ years, 40 % boys) with non‑cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The study used a cross‑over design – each child tried both treatments at different times – comparing nebulised 3 % hypertonic saline given before routine chest physiotherapy with physiotherapy alone for eight weeks. Children who received the salty mist had fewer flare‑ups (mean 2.5 per child‑year vs 7.8) and larger improvements in lung function. The improvement was measured as a change in % predicted FEV1 and FVC; “% predicted” means the value we would expect for a healthy child of the same age, sex and height. No data on quality of life were reported, and no participants stopped because of adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe study was small and unblinded, so participants likely knew which treatment they received. Missing data and the short follow‑up also reduce our confidence in the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur searches covered literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat next?\nWe need larger, multi‑centre randomised trials that test different mucolytic medicines, follow children for longer periods and include outcomes such as quality of life and safety. Only then can we decide whether mucus‑thinning medicines should become a routine part of care for children with chronic wet‑cough lung disease.",
