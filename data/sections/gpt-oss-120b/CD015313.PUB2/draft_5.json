  "draft": "Do mucus‑thinning medicines (mucolytics) reduce flare‑ups and improve breathing in children with chronic wet‑cough lung disease (such as bronchiectasis)?\n\nKey messages –\n- One small study found that inhaling a salty water mist (3 % hypertonic saline – a solution with more salt than normal seawater) before chest physiotherapy reduced flare‑ups and improved lung function in children with non‑cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The study was very small, not blinded, and had missing data, so the evidence is uncertain. No harmful effects were reported.\n- The review did not find any data on quality of life and did not include other mucus‑thinning medicines.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to confirm whether mucolytics are effective and safe for children with chronic wet‑cough lung disease.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative lung disease in children and why is it a problem?\nSome children have long‑lasting lung conditions that cause a wet, noisy cough that keeps coming back. This group of conditions is called chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD). It includes:\n- Bronchiectasis – airways become widened and scarred, making it hard to clear mucus.\n- Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) – a persistent bacterial infection that also leads to a wet cough.\nThick mucus traps germs, triggers repeated infections and inflammation, and can cause frequent flare‑ups (exacerbations), missed school, tiredness and reduced lung function. Current care usually involves chest physiotherapy (special breathing techniques to move mucus out) and antibiotics during flare‑ups. Families and clinicians are looking for additional ways to clear mucus.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe asked two questions:\n1. Does a mucolytic medicine reduce the number of flare‑ups, improve breathing tests (such as FEV1 – the amount of air a child can force out in one second, and FVC – the total amount of air exhaled), or enhance quality of life for children with CSLD?\n2. Is the treatment safe, or does it cause unwanted side effects?\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched for randomised trials that compared a mucolytic with no treatment or placebo in children (≤18 years) with CSLD. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, then full‑text articles. They extracted the data and evaluated study quality using the Cochrane risk‑of‑bias tool and GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified one randomised trial that included 52 school‑age children (average age 9½ years, 40 % boys) with non‑cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The trial used a design where each child received both treatments, one after the other, so we could compare the same child’s response to each. The study compared nebulised 3 % hypertonic saline given before routine chest physiotherapy with physiotherapy alone for eight weeks. Children who received the salty mist had fewer flare‑ups (mean 2.5 per child‑year vs 7.8) and larger improvements in predicted FEV1 (14 % vs 5 %) and predicted FVC (14 % vs 8 %). No data on quality of life were reported, and no participants stopped because of adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are a small, unblinded study with missing data, so we are not confident in the results. Participants likely knew which treatment they received, which can bias outcomes.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur searches covered literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat next?\nWe need larger, multi‑centre randomised trials that test different mucolytic medicines, follow children for longer periods and include outcomes such as quality of life and safety. Only then can we decide whether mucus‑thinning medicines should become a routine part of care for children with chronic wet‑cough lung disease.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical clarity checks: (1) It uses the technical term “cross‑over study” without a lay explanation, which can confuse readers. (2) It incorrectly uses the first‑person plural pronoun in the limitations section – “We are a small, unblinded study…”, implying the authors are the study rather than describing the study. (3) It mentions “predicted FEV1” and “predicted FVC” without explaining what “predicted” means, leaving readers uncertain about the outcome measure. These three issues are significant enough to impede patient understanding. Additionally, the PLS metrics show unusually high counts of nouns (181, P90), complex words (268, P90), and long words (173, P90), indicating the text is noun‑heavy and uses many technical terms that could be simplified. Reducing noun density and replacing complex/long words with simpler alternatives would improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to most typical patterns (overall high conformity), but four metrics deviate: nouns, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words are all in the P90 range, indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and contains more complex/long words than typical PLS. Readability scores are good (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 62.68, Grade 8.9), but the high noun and complex word counts suggest further simplification would benefit lay readers."
