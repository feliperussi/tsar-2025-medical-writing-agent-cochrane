  "draft": "Do mucus‑thinning medicines (mucolytics) reduce flare‑ups and improve breathing in children with chronic wet‑cough lung disease (such as bronchiectasis)?\n\nKey messages\n- A single small study suggests that inhaling a salty mist (3 % hypertonic saline) before chest physiotherapy may lower the number of flare‑ups and improve lung function in children with non‑cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, but the evidence is very uncertain because the study was tiny and had several design problems; no harmful effects were reported.\n- The review found no data on quality of life and did not include other mucus‑thinning medicines.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to confirm whether mucolytics are effective and safe for children with chronic wet‑cough lung disease.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative lung disease in children and why is it a problem?\nSome children have long‑lasting lung conditions that cause a wet, noisy cough that keeps returning. This group of conditions is called chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD). It includes bronchiectasis – where the airways become widened and scarred, making it hard to clear mucus – and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) – a persistent bacterial infection that also leads to a wet cough. Thick mucus traps germs, triggers repeated infections and inflammation, and can cause frequent flare‑ups (exacerbations), missed school, tiredness and reduced lung function. Current care usually involves chest physiotherapy (special breathing techniques to move mucus out) and antibiotics during flare‑ups, but families and clinicians are looking for additional ways to clear mucus.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe asked two questions: (1) Does a mucolytic medicine reduce the number of flare‑ups, improve breathing tests (such as forced expiratory volume in one second – FEV1 – and forced vital capacity – FVC), or enhance quality of life for children with CSLD? (2) Is the treatment safe, or does it cause unwanted side effects?\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched several databases and journal collections for randomised controlled trials that compared a mucolytic with no treatment or placebo in children (≤18 years) with CSLD. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk‑of‑bias tool and GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified one randomised cross‑over trial that enrolled 52 school‑age children (average age 9½ years, 40 % male) with non‑cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The trial compared nebulised 3 % hypertonic saline given before routine chest physiotherapy with physiotherapy alone for eight weeks. The children who received the salty mist had fewer flare‑ups (mean 2.5 vs 7.8 per child‑year) and larger improvements in predicted FEV1 (14.2 % vs 5.0 %) and FVC (13.8 % vs 7.5 %). No data were reported on quality of life, and no adverse events led to drop‑out. Because the study was small, unblinded and had missing data, we rate the certainty of the evidence as very low.\n\nAre the results reliable?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. Participants likely knew which treatment they received, the sample size was tiny, and the study had several risk‑of‑bias issues. These factors make the findings uncertain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe searches covered literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat next?\nWe need larger, multi‑centre randomised trials that test different mucolytic medicines, follow children for longer periods and include outcomes such as quality of life and safety. Only then can we determine whether mucus‑thinning medicines should become a routine part of care for children with chronic wet‑cough lung disease.",

In addition, several clarity issues could confuse readers: (1) the term \"cross‑over trial\" is used without explanation; (2) the first key‑message bullet is a long, dense sentence that mixes several ideas; (3) some sentences are noun‑heavy and hard to follow, e.g., \"The trial compared nebulised 3 % hypertonic saline given before routine chest physiotherapy with physiotherapy alone for eight weeks\"; (4) the bullet list uses a colon‑style introduction rather than a clear question‑style heading; (5) the draft could benefit from more active voice and shorter sentences. These issues, combined with metric deviations (nouns = 180 → – well above the median, complex_words = 125, complex_words_dc = 275, long_words = 176, and dale_chall_readability = 8.3) indicate the text is more noun‑ and jargon‑dense than typical PLSs, reducing readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (50% of features in best quartile) but notable deviations: noun count (180, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.3, P90), complex words (125, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (275, P90) and long words (176, P90) are all higher than typical PLS ranges, suggesting the draft is more noun‑heavy and uses more difficult vocabulary than usual. Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading Ease 56.6, FKGL 10.7), but the high noun and complex‑word counts support the need for simplification."
