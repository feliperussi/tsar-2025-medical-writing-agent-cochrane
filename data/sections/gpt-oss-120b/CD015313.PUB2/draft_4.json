  "draft": "Do mucus‑thinning medicines (mucolytics) reduce flare‑ups and improve breathing in children with chronic wet‑cough lung disease (such as bronchiectasis)?\n\nKey messages –\n- A single small study suggests that inhaling a salty mist (3 % hypertonic saline) before chest physiotherapy may lower the number of flare‑ups and improve lung function in children with non‑cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, but the evidence is very uncertain because the study was tiny, unblinded and had missing data; no harmful effects were reported.\n- The review found no data on quality of life and did not include other mucus‑thinning medicines.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to confirm whether mucolytics are effective and safe for children with chronic wet‑cough lung disease.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative lung disease in children and why is it a problem?\nSome children have long‑lasting lung conditions that cause a wet, noisy cough that keeps returning. This group of conditions is called chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD). It includes bronchiectasis – where the airways become widened and scarred, making it hard to clear mucus – and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) – a persistent bacterial infection that also leads to a wet cough. Thick mucus traps germs, triggers repeated infections and inflammation, and can cause frequent flare‑ups (exacerbations), missed school, tiredness and reduced lung function. Current care usually involves chest physiotherapy (special breathing techniques to move mucus out) and antibiotics during flare‑ups, but families and clinicians are looking for additional ways to clear mucus.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe asked two questions:\n1. Does a mucolytic medicine reduce the number of flare‑ups, improve breathing tests (such as forced expiratory volume in one second – FEV1 – the amount of air a child can force out in one second, and forced vital capacity – FVC – the total amount of air exhaled), or enhance quality of life for children with CSLD?\n2. Is the treatment safe, or does it cause unwanted side effects?\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched several databases and journal collections for randomised controlled trials that compared a mucolytic with no treatment or placebo in children (≤18 years) with CSLD. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk‑of‑bias tool and GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one randomised trial that included 52 school‑age children with non‑cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The children were on average 9½ years old, and 40 % were boys. The trial used a cross‑over design, meaning each child tried both treatments at different times. It compared nebulised 3 % hypertonic saline (a salty water mist) given before routine chest physiotherapy with physiotherapy alone for eight weeks. Children who received the salty mist had fewer flare‑ups (mean 2.5 vs 7.8 per child‑year) and larger improvements in predicted FEV1 (14.2 % vs 5.0 %) and predicted FVC (13.8 % vs 7.5 %). We did not find any data on quality of life, and no participants stopped the study because of adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence. Participants likely knew which treatment they received, the sample size was tiny, and the study had several risk‑of‑bias issues such as missing data and unblinded assessment. These factors make the findings uncertain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur searches covered literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat next?\nWe need larger, multi‑centre randomised trials that test different mucolytic medicines, follow children for longer periods and include outcomes such as quality of life and safety. Only then can we determine whether mucus‑thinning medicines should become a routine part of care for children with chronic wet‑cough lung disease.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, title format, factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse patients. The most pressing issues are:\n1. **Overly long and jargon‑heavy key‑message bullet** – the first bullet packs multiple ideas, technical terms and a semicolon‑separated clause into one sentence, making it hard to follow.\n   *Problematic sentence*: \"A single small study suggests that inhaling a salty mist (3 % hypertonic saline) before chest physiotherapy may lower the number of flare‑ups and improve lung function in children with non‑cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, but the evidence was very uncertain because the study was tiny, unblinded and had missing data; no harmful effects were reported.\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"One small study found that inhaling a salty water mist (3 % hypertonic saline) before chest physiotherapy reduced flare‑ups and improved lung function in children with non‑cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. However, the study was very small, not blinded, and had missing data, so the evidence is uncertain. No harmful effects were reported.\"\n2. **Unexplained technical term “hypertonic saline”** – the term appears without a plain‑language definition, which may be unfamiliar to readers.\n   *Problematic phrase*: \"inhaling a salty mist (3 % hypertonic saline)\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"inhaling a salty water mist (3 % hypertonic saline – a solution with more salt than normal seawater)\"\n3. **Passive, noun‑heavy description of participant characteristics** – the sentence uses passive voice and many nouns, reducing readability.\n   *Problematic sentence*: \"The children were on average 9½ years old, and 40 % were boys.\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"We measured the children’s average age as 9½ years, and 40% of them were boys.\"\n4. **Dense methods paragraph** – two long sentences cram several actions together, making it hard to track what was done.\n   *Problematic paragraph*: \"We searched several databases and journal collections for randomised controlled trials that compared a mucolytic with no treatment or placebo in children (≤18 years) with CSLD. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk‑of‑bias tool and GRADE.\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"We searched multiple databases and journal collections for randomised trials that compared a mucolytic with no treatment or placebo in children (≤18 years) with CSLD.

By simplifying language and breaking up long sentences, the readability scores will move closer to typical PLS ranges. Overall, the draft fails the clarity threshold required for approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns but shows significant deviations in noun count, complex words, long words, and especially Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (all beyond the 90th percentile). Readability indices are acceptable (Flesch Reading Ease 58, Grade 10), yet the high noun and complex‑word density indicates the text is still noun‑heavy and may be harder for lay readers. Addressing these lexical issues will improve clarity."
