  "draft": "Do special glues (sealants) help stop bleeding faster and more reliably at the site where blood vessels are joined during vascular surgery compared with standard methods?\n\nKey messages\n- Sealants (special surgical glues) may help stop bleeding (hemostasis) at the vessel connection (anastomosis) more quickly and may lower the chance that bleeding control fails, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies had several limitations and no serious harms were reported.\n- The trials did not show clear differences between sealants and standard care for the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total operation time, or bleeding after surgery, and no deaths or quality‑of‑life outcomes were reported.\n- Because the current evidence is limited and of low quality, we need more well‑designed randomised trials to confirm any benefits, assess possible side effects and costs, and provide more reliable information for patients and clinicians.\n\nWhy is stopping bleeding after blood‑vessel connections important?\nWhen surgeons repair or bypass arteries and veins, they join the ends of the vessels – a step called an anastomosis. The tiny needle holes made during this joining can leak blood. If bleeding is not quickly controlled (hemostasis), the patient can lose more blood, may need a longer operation, and could face complications after surgery. Traditional ways to stop the bleeding include pressing on the site, using gauze‑like materials, or adjusting medicines that affect clotting.\n\nWhat are sealants and how might they help with bleeding in vascular surgery?\nA sealant is a special liquid or gel that a surgeon can apply directly to the bleeding spot. It hardens or sticks to the tissue, forming a barrier that blocks the leak. Sealants are used as an extra tool when usual methods do not stop the bleeding well enough. Types include fibrin‑based sealants (made from proteins that help blood clot) and synthetic sealants.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether using sealants during vascular surgery helps achieve faster and more reliable bleeding control and whether they cause any harms. We looked at time to stop bleeding, the chance that bleeding control fails, the amount of blood lost during surgery, overall operation time, postoperative bleeding, the need to return to the operating room, and any adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared fibrin or synthetic sealants with standard techniques such as manual compression or oxidised cellulose. We combined the findings and used the GRADE approach to judge our confidence in each result.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 24 trials that together enrolled 2,376 participants. All trials compared sealants applied to anastomotic sites with standard‑care controls such as oxidised cellulose, gelatin sponge, or manual compression. No trial reported deaths from bleeding or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\n\nWhat were the main results for time to stop bleeding?\nSealants may reduce the time needed to stop bleeding, cutting the waiting period by about four minutes. It is very uncertain whether they lower the chance that bleeding control fails. For other outcomes, sealants may make little or no difference to intra‑operative blood loss, total operation time, postoperative bleeding, or the need to return to the operating room.\n\nLimitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. In many studies participants and clinicians knew which treatment was used, data were missing, the trials were small and varied, and the results may over‑estimate benefits.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several sentences that are too long, use unexplained jargon, and are noun‑heavy, which can confuse a lay reader. Specific problems:\n1. **Key messages – first bullet**: \"Sealants (special surgical glues) may help stop bleeding (hemostasis) at the vessel connection (anastomosis) more quickly and may lower the chance that the bleeding control fails, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies had several limitations and no serious harms were reported.\" – This 40‑word sentence packs many ideas and several technical terms. Rewrite as two shorter sentences: \"Sealants (special surgical glues) may help stop bleeding (hemostasis) at the vessel connection (anastomosis) more quickly. They may also reduce the chance that bleeding control fails, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies had several limitations and no serious harms were reported.\"\n2. **Key messages – first bullet (jargon)**: The term “hemostasis” appears without a clear definition in this section. Readers may not know it means “stop bleeding”. Add a brief definition: \"hemostasis (the process of stopping bleeding)\".\n3. **Results – \"What were the main results for time to stop bleeding?\"**: \"Sealants may reduce the time needed to stop bleeding, cutting the waiting period by about four minutes.\" – The phrase “cutting the waiting period” is vague. Rewrite: \"Sealants may reduce the time needed to achieve hemostasis, shortening it by about four minutes (≈230 seconds).\"\n4. **Limitations – long sentence**: \"We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies gave all the data we needed, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be sure about the results, and the available studies may exaggerate the benefits because they represent only a small set of all possible studies.\" – This 66‑word sentence is overwhelming. Split and simplify: \"We have little confidence in the evidence. In many studies participants and clinicians knew which treatment was used, some data were missing, the participants varied, and the trials were small. These problems may exaggerate the benefits.\"\n5. **Currency statement**: \"The evidence is up to date to March 2023.\" – Awkward phrasing. Rewrite: \"The evidence is current up to March 2023.\"\nThese changes address the most confusing parts and reduce noun‑heavy, long‑word constructions. The PLS evaluation also shows unusually high counts of nouns (170, above the typical median of ≤116), complex Dale‑Chall words (255, above the median of ≤160) and long words (184, above the median of ≤122), confirming the need to simplify language and shorten sentences.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns but deviates in three key metrics: nouns (170, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (255, P90) and long words (184, P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long or unfamiliar words, which aligns with the identified clarity issues."
