  "draft": "Do special glues (sealants) help stop bleeding faster and more reliably at the site where blood vessels are joined during vascular surgery compared with standard methods?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Sealants (special surgical glues) may help achieve hemostasis (stop bleeding) at the anastomosis (the surgical connection of vessels) more quickly and may lower the chance that the bleeding control fails, compared with standard methods such as manual pressure or other materials; however, the evidence is uncertain because the studies had several limitations and no serious harms were reported.\n- The available trials did not show clear differences between sealants and standard care for the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total time of the operation, or the amount of bleeding that occurs after surgery, and no deaths or quality‑of‑life outcomes were reported.\n- Because the current evidence is limited and of low quality, further well‑designed randomised trials are needed to confirm any benefits, to assess possible side effects and costs, and to provide more reliable information for patients and clinicians.\n\n**Introduction**\nWhy is stopping bleeding after blood‑vessel connections important?\nWhen surgeons repair or bypass arteries and veins, they have to join the ends of the vessels together – a step called an anastomosis. The tiny needle holes made during this joining can leak blood. If the bleeding is not quickly controlled (a process called hemostasis), the patient can lose more blood during the operation, may need a longer surgery, and could face complications after the operation. Traditional ways to stop the bleeding include pressing on the site, using gauze‑like materials, or adjusting medicines that affect clotting.\n\nWhat are sealants and how might they help with bleeding in vascular surgery?\nA sealant is a special liquid or gel that a surgeon can apply directly to the bleeding spot. It hardens or sticks to the tissue, forming a barrier that blocks the leak. Sealants are meant to be used as an extra tool when the usual methods do not stop the bleeding well enough. Different types exist, such as fibrin‑based (made from proteins that help blood clot) and synthetic sealants. Although many sealants are available, it is not clear how well they work compared with standard methods in patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to determine whether using sealants during vascular surgery helps achieve faster and more reliable bleeding control and whether they cause any harms. Specifically, they looked at how sealants affect the time needed to stop bleeding, the chance that the bleeding‑control method fails, the amount of blood lost during surgery, and other outcomes such as overall operation time, postoperative bleeding, the need to return to the operating room, and any adverse events.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies comparing sealants with usual techniques for achieving anastomotic hemostasis in vascular surgery, combined the findings, and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 24 randomized controlled trials that together enrolled 2,376 participants. All trials compared fibrin or synthetic vascular sealants applied to anastomotic sites with standard‑care controls such as oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge or manual compression. The abstract does not give information about how long participants were followed, the funding sources of the trials, the ages, genders, severity of disease of the participants, or the countries where the studies were carried out. No trial reported deaths from bleeding or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\n\nMain results: Time to stop bleeding\nThe sealants probably reduce the time needed to stop bleeding during vascular surgery, shortening the waiting period by a few minutes. It is unclear whether sealants reduce the chance that bleeding control fails. For other outcomes, sealants may make little or no difference to the amount of blood lost during the operation, the total length of the operation, bleeding after surgery, or the need to return to the operating room for bleeding problems.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies gave all the data we needed, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be sure about the results, and the available studies may exaggerate the benefits because they represent only a small set of all possible studies.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

Additionally, the text contains excessive passive voice (28 instances, beyond the P90 threshold) and a high density of complex, long, and unfamiliar words (complex_words_dc 319, long_words 247, nouns 204), making it harder for patients to understand. Key clarity issues include jargon without definition, overly long sentences, and dense noun‑heavy phrasing. Recommended improvements: 1) Re‑write all section headings as questions (e.g., \"Why is stopping bleeding after vessel connections important?\"). 2) Convert passive sentences to active voice (e.g., change \"The sealants probably reduce the time needed\" to \"We found that sealants probably reduce the time needed\"). 3) Simplify jargon and replace complex words with everyday language (e.g., replace \"anastomotic hemostasis\" with \"stopping bleeding where vessels are joined\"). 4) Break long sentences into shorter ones (aim for ≤20 words). 5) Reduce noun‑heavy constructions by using more verbs (e.g., change \"The sealants may make little or no difference\" to \"Sealants may not change\"). These changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients.",
