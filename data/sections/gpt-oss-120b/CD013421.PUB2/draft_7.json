  "draft": "Do special glues (sealants) help stop bleeding faster and more reliably at the site where blood vessels are joined during vascular surgery compared with standard methods?\n\nKey messages\n- Sealants (special surgical glues) may help achieve hemostasis (stop bleeding) at the anastomosis (the surgical connection of vessels) more quickly and may lower the chance that bleeding control fails, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies had several limitations and no serious harms were reported.\n- The trials did not show clear differences between sealants and standard care for the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total operation time, or bleeding after surgery, and no deaths or quality‑of‑life outcomes were reported.\n- Because the current evidence is limited and of low quality, we need more well‑designed randomised trials to confirm any benefits, assess possible side effects and costs, and provide more reliable information for patients and clinicians.\n\nWhy is stopping bleeding after blood‑vessel connections important?\nWhen surgeons repair or bypass arteries and veins, they have to join the ends of the vessels together – a step called an anastomosis. The tiny needle holes made during this joining can leak blood. If bleeding is not quickly controlled (a process called hemostasis), the patient may lose more blood, the operation may take longer, and complications can arise after surgery. Traditional ways to stop bleeding include pressing on the site, using gauze‑like materials, or adjusting medicines that affect clotting.\n\nWhat are sealants and how might they help with bleeding in vascular surgery?\nA sealant is a special liquid or gel that a surgeon applies directly to the bleeding spot. It hardens or sticks to the tissue, forming a barrier that blocks the leak. Sealants are used as an extra tool when usual methods do not stop bleeding well enough. Types include fibrin‑based sealants (made from proteins that help blood clot) and synthetic sealants (man‑made materials).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether using sealants during vascular surgery helps achieve faster and more reliable bleeding control and whether they cause any harms. We looked at time to stop bleeding, the chance that bleeding control fails, the amount of blood lost during surgery, overall operation time, postoperative bleeding, the need to return to the operating room, and any adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared fibrin or synthetic sealants with standard techniques such as manual compression or oxidized cellulose (a type of absorbable material that helps stop bleeding). We combined the findings and used the GRADE approach to judge our confidence in each result.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 24 trials that together enrolled 2,376 participants. All trials compared sealants applied to anastomotic sites with standard‑care controls such as oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, or manual compression. No trial reported deaths from bleeding or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\n\nMain results: time to stop bleeding\nSealants probably reduce the time needed to achieve hemostasis, shortening it by about four minutes (≈230 seconds). It is very uncertain whether sealants also reduce the chance that bleeding control fails. For other outcomes, sealants may make little or no difference to intra‑operative blood loss, total operation time, postoperative bleeding, or the need to return to the operating room.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies did not blind participants or clinicians, some data were missing, the participants and methods varied, the trials were small, and the limited number of studies may over‑estimate benefits.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the style check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions – several headings (e.g., \"Main results: time to stop bleeding\", \"Limitations of the evidence\") are statements, not questions. This breaks the Master Style Guide and can make navigation harder for readers. In addition, the draft contains a high amount of passive constructions (19 instances, well above the typical PLS range) and several long, noun‑heavy sentences that reduce readability. Key problem areas and concrete rewrites:\n1. Subheading not a question – \"Main results: time to stop bleeding\".\n   Problem: Not phrased as a question, contrary to style guide.\n   Rewrite: \"What are the main results for time to stop bleeding?\"\n2. Subheading not a question – \"Limitations of the evidence\".\n   Problem: Not a question.\n   Rewrite: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n3. Passive voice – \"The tiny needle holes made during this joining can leak blood.\"\n   Problem: Passive verb \"made\" obscures who performed the action.\n   Rewrite: \"The tiny needle holes created during the joining can leak blood.\"\n4. Long, noun‑heavy sentence – \"The abstract does not give information about how long participants were followed, the funding sources of the trials, the ages, genders, severity of disease of the participants, or the countries where the studies were carried out.\"\n   Problem: Over 30 words, many nouns, hard to follow.\n   Rewrite: \"The abstract does not report how long participants were followed, the trials' funding sources, participants' ages, genders, disease severity, or the countries where the studies took place.\"\n5. Another long sentence – \"Sealants probably reduce the time needed to stop bleeding during vascular surgery, shortening the waiting period by a few minutes.\"\n   Problem: Slightly long and uses abstract noun \"waiting period\".\n   Rewrite: \"Sealants probably reduce the time needed to stop bleeding, cutting the waiting period by about four minutes (≈230 seconds).\"\nAddressing these issues will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide, lower the passive‑voice count, and improve readability for patients.\n\nOverall, the draft meets factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but the subheading format and several clarity/style problems prevent approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (55.6% best‑quartile features). However, five metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: passive_voice (19, above the median), nouns (178, high), dale_chall_readability (8.17, high), complex_words_dc (276, high) and long_words (200, high). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy phrasing, and many complex/long words, supporting the editorial suggestions above."
