  "draft": "Do special glues (sealants) help stop bleeding faster and more reliably at the site where blood vessels are joined during vascular surgery compared with standard methods?\n\nKey messages\n- Sealants (special surgical glues) may help stop bleeding (hemostasis, the process of stopping bleeding) at the vessel connection (anastomosis) more quickly. They may also reduce the chance that bleeding control fails, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies had several limitations and no serious harms were reported.\n- The trials did not show clear differences between sealants and standard care for the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total operation time, or bleeding after surgery. No deaths or quality‑of‑life outcomes were reported.\n- Because the current evidence is limited and of low quality, we need more well‑designed randomised trials to confirm any benefits, assess possible side effects and costs, and provide more reliable information for patients and clinicians.\n\nWhy is stopping bleeding after blood‑vessel connections important?\nWhen surgeons repair or bypass arteries and veins, they join the ends of the vessels – a step called an anastomosis. The tiny needle holes made during this joining can leak blood. If bleeding is not quickly controlled (hemostasis), the patient can lose more blood, may need a longer operation, and could face complications after surgery. Traditional ways to stop the bleeding include pressing on the site, using gauze‑like materials, or adjusting medicines that affect clotting.\n\nWhat are sealants and how might they help with bleeding in vascular surgery?\nA sealant is a special liquid or gel that a surgeon applies directly to the bleeding spot. It hardens or sticks to the tissue, forming a barrier that blocks the leak. Sealants are used as an extra tool when usual methods do not stop the bleeding well enough. Types include fibrin‑based sealants (made from proteins that help blood clot) and synthetic sealants.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether using sealants during vascular surgery helps achieve faster and more reliable bleeding control and whether they cause any harms. We looked at time to stop bleeding, the chance that bleeding control fails, the amount of blood lost during surgery, overall operation time, postoperative bleeding, the need to return to the operating room, and any adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared fibrin or synthetic sealants with standard techniques such as manual compression or oxidised cellulose. We combined the findings and used the GRADE approach to judge our confidence in each result.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 24 trials that together enrolled 2,376 participants. All trials compared sealants applied to anastomotic sites with standard‑care controls such as oxidised cellulose, gelatin sponge, or manual compression. No trial reported deaths from bleeding or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\n\nMain results: Time to stop bleeding\nSealants probably reduce the time needed to achieve hemostasis, shortening it by about four minutes (≈230 seconds). It is very uncertain whether sealants reduce the chance that bleeding control fails. For other outcomes, sealants may make little or no difference to intra‑operative blood loss, total operation time, postoperative bleeding, or the need to return to the operating room.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. In many studies participants and clinicians knew which treatment was used, some data were missing, the participants varied, and the trials were small. These problems may exaggerate the benefits.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current up to March 2023.",

The sections \"Main results: Time to stop bleeding\" and \"Limitations of the evidence\" need to be rewritten as questions to comply with the Master Style Guide. Additionally, three key clarity improvements are needed: (1) simplify the long bullet‑point in the Key messages to avoid dense, noun‑heavy phrasing; (2) replace remaining passive constructions and reduce noun‑heavy sentences (the draft contains 173 nouns, 264 Dale‑Chall complex words and 194 long words, far above typical PLS ranges); (3) ensure all technical terms are briefly defined at first use (e.g., \"fibrin‑based sealants\" and \"synthetic sealants\"). Suggested rewrites are provided below.\n\nTop improvements:\n1. Problematic subheading: \"Main results: Time to stop bleeding\" – not a question. Rewrite as: \"What are the main results for time to stop bleeding?\"\n2. Problematic subheading: \"Limitations of the evidence\" – not a question. Rewrite as: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n3.

Rewrite as: \"The trials did not report any deaths from bleeding or quality‑of‑life‑outcome data.\"\n5. Undefined term: \"fibrin‑based sealants\" appears in the methods section without definition. Add brief definition: \"Fibrin‑based sealants are made from proteins that help blood clot.\"\n\nThese changes will bring the draft into full compliance with the style guide, improve readability (current metrics show high noun count, complex words and long words), and ensure clear, patient‑friendly communication.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms to most typical PLS patterns (66.7% of features in best quartile). However, three metrics deviate significantly: nouns (173 vs typical <116), Dale‑Chall complex words (264 vs typical <160) and long words (194 vs typical <122). These indicate a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style that can be simplified. Other readability scores are within expected ranges."
