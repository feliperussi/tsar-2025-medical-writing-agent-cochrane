  "draft": "Do special glues (sealants) help stop bleeding faster and more reliably at the site where blood vessels are joined during vascular surgery compared with standard methods?\n\nKey messages\n- Sealants (special surgical glues) may help stop bleeding (hemostasis) at the vessel connection (anastomosis) more quickly and may lower the chance that bleeding control fails. However, the evidence is uncertain because the studies had several limitations and no serious harms were reported.\n- The trials did not show clear differences between sealants and standard care for the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total operation time, or bleeding after surgery, and no deaths or quality‑of‑life outcomes were reported.\n- Because the current evidence is limited and of low quality, we need more well‑designed randomised trials to confirm any benefits, assess possible side effects and costs, and provide more reliable information for patients and clinicians.\n\nWhy is stopping bleeding after blood‑vessel connections important?\nWhen surgeons repair or bypass arteries and veins, they join the ends of the vessels – a step called an anastomosis. The tiny needle holes made during this joining can leak blood. If bleeding is not quickly controlled (hemostasis), the patient can lose more blood, may need a longer operation, and could face complications after surgery. Traditional ways to stop the bleeding include pressing on the site, using gauze‑like materials, or adjusting medicines that affect clotting.\n\nWhat are sealants and how might they help with bleeding in vascular surgery?\nA sealant is a special liquid or gel that a surgeon can apply directly to the bleeding spot. It hardens or sticks to the tissue, forming a barrier that blocks the leak. Sealants are used as an extra tool when usual methods do not stop the bleeding well enough. Types include fibrin‑based sealants (made from proteins that help blood clot) and synthetic sealants.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether using sealants during vascular surgery helps achieve faster and more reliable bleeding control and whether they cause any harms. We looked at time to stop bleeding, the chance that bleeding control fails, the amount of blood lost during surgery, overall operation time, postoperative bleeding, the need to return to the operating room, and any adverse events.\n\nMethods\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared fibrin or synthetic sealants with standard techniques such as manual compression or oxidised cellulose. We combined the findings and used the GRADE approach to judge our confidence in each result.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 24 trials that together enrolled 2,376 participants. All trials compared sealants applied to anastomotic sites with standard‑care controls such as oxidised cellulose, gelatin sponge, or manual compression. No trial reported deaths from bleeding or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\n\nMain results: Time to stop bleeding\nSealants may reduce the time needed to achieve hemostasis, shortening the waiting period by about four minutes (≈230 seconds). It is very uncertain whether sealants lower the chance that bleeding control fails. For other outcomes, sealants may make little or no difference to intra‑operative blood loss, total operation time, postoperative bleeding, or the need to return to the operating room.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants and clinicians often knew which treatment was used, data were missing from many studies, the trials were small and varied in design, and the available studies may exaggerate the benefits.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

Sections such as \"Methods\" and \"Main results: Time to stop bleeding\" are headings, not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, three clarity‑style issues should be addressed to improve readability:\n1. Subheading format – \"Methods\" and \"Main results: Time to stop bleeding\" are not questions.\n   - Rewrite: Change to \"How did we find the evidence?\" and \"What were the main results for time to stop bleeding?\".\n2. Long, complex sentence in Limitations – \"We have little confidence in the evidence because participants and clinicians often knew which treatment was used, data were missing from many studies, the trials were small and varied in design, and the available studies may exaggerate the benefits.\"\n   - Problem: >30 words, multiple clauses, hard to follow.\n   - Rewrite: \"We have little confidence in the evidence. In many studies participants and clinicians knew which treatment was used, data were missing, the trials were small and varied, and the results may over‑estimate benefits.\"\n3. Noun‑heavy wording – The draft contains many noun‑dense phrases (e.g., \"the waiting period\", \"the chance that bleeding control fails\"). This contributes to the high noun count and makes sentences feel heavy.\n   - Rewrite: Use more verbs: \"Sealants may reduce the time needed to stop bleeding, cutting the waiting period by about four minutes. It is very uncertain whether they lower the chance of failure.\"\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve patient‑friendly clarity. The PLS evaluation shows the draft already scores well on readability (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 50.8, Grade 11.5) and active voice, but the noun count, complex‑word‑DC count and long‑word count are higher than typical PLS texts, supporting the need to simplify noun‑heavy sentences. Overall, the draft needs the subheading revisions and the three clarity improvements above before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity: readability scores are within the typical range (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 50.8, Grade 11.5, Fog 15.6). However, three metrics deviate: nouns (174, P90), complex words (Dale‑Chall) 260 (P90) and long words 191 (P90), indicating the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex/long words. Adjusting sentence structure and reducing noun density will bring these metrics closer to the median."
