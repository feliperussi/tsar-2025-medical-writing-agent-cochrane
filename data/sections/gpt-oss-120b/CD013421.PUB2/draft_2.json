  "draft": "Do special glues (sealants) help stop bleeding faster and more reliably at the site where blood vessels are joined during vascular surgery compared with standard methods?\n\nKey messages\n- Sealants (special surgical glues) may help us stop bleeding (hemostasis) at the vessel connection (anastomosis) more quickly and may lower the chance that bleeding control fails, compared with standard methods such as manual pressure or other materials; however, the evidence is uncertain because the studies had several limitations and no serious harms were reported.\n- The trials did not show clear differences between sealants and standard care for the amount of blood lost during surgery, the total operation time, or bleeding after surgery, and no deaths or quality‑of‑life outcomes were reported.\n- Because the current evidence is limited and of low quality, we need more well‑designed randomised trials to confirm any benefits, assess possible side effects and costs, and provide more reliable information for patients and clinicians.\n\nWhy is stopping bleeding after vessel connections important?\nWhen surgeons join arteries or veins, they create a surgical connection called an anastomosis. The tiny needle holes can leak blood. If we do not quickly stop the bleeding (hemostasis), patients may lose more blood, need longer surgery, and face complications after the operation.\n\nWhat are sealants and how might they help with bleeding in vascular surgery?\nA sealant is a special liquid or gel that we apply directly to the bleeding spot. It hardens or sticks to the tissue, forming a barrier that blocks the leak. Sealants are used as an extra tool when usual methods do not stop the bleeding well enough. Types include fibrin‑based sealants (made from proteins that help blood clot) and synthetic sealants.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether using sealants during vascular surgery helps us achieve faster and more reliable bleeding control and whether they cause any harms. We looked at time to stop bleeding, the chance that bleeding control fails, the amount of blood lost during surgery, overall operation time, postoperative bleeding, the need to return to the operating room, and any adverse events.\n\nHow did we gather and assess the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared fibrin or synthetic sealants with standard techniques such as manual compression or oxidised cellulose. We combined the findings and used the GRADE approach to judge our confidence in each result.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 24 trials that enrolled a total of 2,376 participants. All trials compared sealants applied to anastomotic sites with standard‑care controls. No trial reported deaths from bleeding or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\n\nWhat were the main results for stopping bleeding?\nWe found that sealants probably reduce the time needed to achieve hemostasis, shortening the waiting period by a few minutes. The evidence on whether sealants lower the chance of bleeding‑control failure is very uncertain. For other outcomes, sealants may make little or no difference to intra‑operative blood loss, total operation time, postoperative bleeding, or the need to return to the operating room.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants and clinicians often knew which treatment was used, data were missing from many studies, and the trials were small and varied in design. These factors may exaggerate the benefits we observed.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

However, the evidence is uncertain because the studies had several limitations and no serious harms were reported.\" • \"We found that sealants probably reduce the output...\" – The word \"probably\" overstates the certainty; the source says the evidence is low‑certainty and the effect is described as \"may reduce\". Rewrite to match the source: \"We found that sealants may reduce the time needed to achieve hemostasis, shortening the waiting period by about four minutes (≈230 seconds).\" • High noun density and long words (metrics show 162 nouns, 249 Dale‑Chall complex words, 182 long words) make the text noun‑heavy. Simplify noun‑heavy sentences such as \"The evidence on whether sealants lower the chance of bleeding‑control failure is very uncertain\" to \"It is very uncertain whether sealants lower the chance of bleeding‑control failure.\" These changes will improve readability and align the certainty language with the source.",
