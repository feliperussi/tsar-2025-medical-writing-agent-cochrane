  "draft": "Does adding breast ultrasound (ultrasonography) to mammogram screening detect more breast cancers than mammogram alone in women with average risk?\n\nKey messages\n- Adding breast ultrasound (sound waves that create pictures of the breast) to mammogram screening (an X‑ray picture of the breast) finds about two extra cancers per 1,000 women screened, but it also increases false‑positive results and biopsies.\n- The extra cancers appear most often in women with dense breast tissue (tissue that looks white on a mammogram and can hide cancer); evidence for women with less dense breasts is less clear.\n- More high‑quality, long‑term research is needed to show whether finding these extra cancers reduces death from breast cancer and to better balance benefits and harms.\n\nWhy is a question?\nWhy is breast cancer screening important and what are the current methods?\nWe screen for breast cancer because early‑stage tumours are easier to treat and give a better chance of cure. The most common test is mammography, an X‑ray image that can show lumps or other changes. Some women have dense breast tissue, which appears white on an X‑ray and can hide cancers, making mammograms less sensitive. To improve detection, doctors sometimes add breast ultrasonography, a painless scan that uses sound waves to create pictures of the breast. Ultrasound can find cancers that mammography might miss, but it also produces more false‑positive results (tests that suggest cancer when none is present) and can lead to extra biopsies (small tissue samples taken to check for cancer).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare two screening strategies for women at average risk of breast cancer: (1) mammography alone and (2) mammography combined with breast ultrasonography. We asked whether adding ultrasound increases the number of cancers detected, changes the type or stage of cancers found, reduces interval cancers (cancers that develop between scheduled screens), and how it affects harms such as false‑positive results and biopsies. We also looked for any evidence that the combined approach influences breast‑cancer‑related or overall death rates.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for studies that compared mammography alone with mammography plus ultrasound in women aged 40‑75 who were at average risk. We combined the results using a random‑effects meta‑analysis and assessed our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight studies. They included one randomised trial, two prospective cohort studies and five retrospective cohort studies, enrolling a total of 209,207 women aged 40‑75. Follow‑up ranged from one to three years. No study reported breast‑cancer‑specific or all‑cause mortality outcomes.\nAdding ultrasound to mammography detected about two extra cancers for every 1,000 women screened. It also lowered the proportion of cancers with positive lymph nodes (a sign that cancer may have spread) from roughly one in three to one in six, and it halved interval cancers (from ten to five per 10,000 screened). False‑negative results (missed cancers) fell from about 23 % with mammography alone to about 9 % with ultrasound added. However, false‑positive results increased by about 37 per 1,000 women without cancer, and biopsies rose by roughly 27 per 1,000 screened.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies did not randomly assign women to the screening methods. This means differences between groups could be due to other factors. Some studies had small numbers or limited data, and none examined whether the extra cancers found lead to lower mortality.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur search was last updated in May 2021, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",
