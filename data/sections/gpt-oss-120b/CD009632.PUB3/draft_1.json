  "draft": "Does adding breast ultrasound (ultrasonography) to mammogram screening detect more breast cancers than mammogram alone in women with average risk?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Adding breast ultrasound (sound waves used to create images of the breast) to mammogram screening (X‑ray image of the breast) detects more breast cancers than mammogram alone, but it also results in more false‑positive results (test suggests cancer when there is none) and more biopsies (procedure to take a small tissue sample to check for cancer); the studies did not show that this approach reduces death from breast cancer.\n- The benefit of detecting additional cancers was most evident in women with dense breast tissue (breast tissue that appears white on a mammogram, making cancer harder to see), while evidence for women with non‑dense breasts was less clear.\n- More high‑quality, long‑term research is needed to find out whether the extra cancers found lead to lower mortality and to better understand the overall balance of benefits and harms.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is breast cancer screening important and what are the current methods?\nBreast cancer is a common... (content as provided)\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to compare two screening strategies for women at average risk of breast cancer: (1) mammography alone, and (2) mammography combined with breast ultrasonography. Specifically, they set out to determine whether adding ultrasound improves the number of cancers detected, changes the type or stage of cancers found, reduces the number of cancers that appear between scheduled screens (called interval carcinomas), and what impact it has on harms such as false‑positive results and the need for biopsies. They also looked for any evidence that the combined approach might affect breast‑cancer‑related or overall death rates.\n\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched databases for studies comparing mammography alone with mammography plus ultrasonography in average‑risk women aged 40‑75, combined the findings in a random‑effects meta‑analysis, and assessed our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight studies (one randomised controlled trial, two prospective cohort studies and five retrospective cohort studies) that together enrolled 209,207 women aged 40 to 75 years who were at average risk for breast cancer. Follow‑up ranged from one to three years; the large Japanese J‑START trial contributed two‑year data. The studies compared mammography alone with mammography plus breast ultrasonography (including automated, handheld and, in one case, tomosynthesis). Five studies used digital mammography, one used tomosynthesis and two incorporated automated breast ultrasonography. No study reported breast‑cancer‑specific or all‑cause mortality outcomes.\n\nMain results: Adding ultrasound improves cancer detection and reduces missed cancers\nAdding ultrasound to mammography detected about two extra cancers for every 1,000 women screened. It also markedly lowered the proportion of cancers with positive lymph nodes—from roughly one in three to one in six—and halved the number of interval cancers (from ten to five per 10,000 screened). Importantly, the rate of false‑negative results fell from about 23 % with mammography alone to about 9 % when ultrasound was added. These benefits came with trade‑offs: false‑positive results increased by about 37 per 1,000 women without cancer, and biopsies rose by roughly 27 per 1,000 screened.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups. This means that... (full limitations text as provided)\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021 of search.",

This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement (5.3 Structure). In addition, several clarity problems would confuse a patient reader:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – the sentence \"It also markedly lowered the proportion of cancers with positive lymph nodes…\" uses the term \"positive lymph nodes\" without definition. Readers may not understand why this matters.\n   *Rewrite:* \"It also reduced the number of cancers that had spread to the lymph nodes (a sign that the cancer is more advanced) – from about one in three to one in six.\"\n2. **Long, complex sentence** – \"It also markedly lowered the proportion of cancers with positive lymph nodes—from roughly one in three to one in six—and halved the number of interval cancers (from ten to five per 10,000 screened).\" This exceeds 30 words and packs three ideas together.\n   *Rewrite:* \"It also reduced cancers that had spread to the lymph nodes, from about one in three to one in six. In addition, the number of interval cancers (cancers that appear between scheduled screens) fell from ten to five per 10,000 screened.\"\n3. **High passive voice** – many statements are passive, e.g., \"No study reported breast‑cancer-specific or all‑cause mortality outcomes.\" Passive constructions make it harder to see who did what.\n   *Rewrite:* \"The studies did not report breast‑cancer‑specific or overall death rates.\"\n4. **Long introductory sentence** – \"We identified eight studies (one randomised controlled trial, two prospective cohort studies and five retrospective cohort studies) that together enrolled 209,207 women aged 40 to 75 years who were at average risk for breast cancer.\" This sentence is over 30 words and can be split for readability.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We identified eight studies – one randomised trial, two prospective cohorts and five retrospective cohorts. Together they enrolled 209,207 women aged 40‑75 who were at average risk of breast cancer.\"\n5. **Missing definitions for \"interval cancers\"** – the term appears without explanation, which may leave readers unsure of its meaning.\n   *Add definition:* \"Interval cancers are cancers that develop between scheduled screening appointments.\"\nThese issues, combined with the metric analysis (22 passive constructions – P90, 185 nouns – P90, 263 Dale‑Chall complex words – P90, 120 complex words – P90, 169 long words – P90), indicate the draft is considerably more complex than typical Cochrane PLS texts and would hinder patient understanding. Overall, the draft does not meet the required subheading format and contains several critical clarity problems, so it cannot be approved in its current form.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit (589 words) but deviates from typical PLS patterns on six metrics: passive_voice (22, P90), nouns (185, P90), dale_chall_readability (8.22, P90), complex_words_dc (263, P90), complex_words (120, P90), and long_words (169, P90). These high values reflect excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy sentences, and many difficult words, supporting the need for the suggested simplifications."
