  "draft": "Does adding breast ultrasound (ultrasonography) to mammogram screening detect more breast cancers than mammogram alone in women with average risk?\n\nKey messages\n- Adding breast ultrasound (sound waves that create images of the breast) to mammogram screening (an X‑ray picture of the breast) finds about two extra cancers per 1,000 women screened, but it also leads to more false‑positive results (tests that suggest cancer when none is present) and more biopsies (small tissue samples taken to check for cancer).\n- The extra cancers are most often found in women with dense breast tissue (breast tissue that looks white on a mammogram and can hide cancer). Evidence for women with less dense breasts is less clear.\n- More high‑quality, long‑term research is needed to see whether finding these extra cancers reduces death from breast cancer and to better balance the benefits and harms.\n\nWhy is breast cancer screening important and what are the current methods?\nWe screen for breast cancer because early‑stage tumours are easier to treat and give a better chance of cure. The most common screening test is mammography, an X‑ray image that can show lumps or other changes. Some women have dense breast tissue, which appears white on an X‑ray and can hide cancers, making mammograms less sensitive. To improve detection, doctors sometimes add breast ultrasonography, a painless scan that uses sound waves to create pictures of the breast. Ultrasound can find cancers that mammography might miss, but it also produces more false‑positive results and can lead to extra biopsies.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare two screening strategies for women at average risk of breast cancer: (1) mammography alone and (2) mammography combined with breast ultrasonography. Specifically, we asked whether adding ultrasound increases the number of cancers detected, changes the type or stage of cancers found, reduces interval cancers (cancers that develop between scheduled screens), and how it affects harms such as false‑positive results and biopsies. We also looked for any evidence that the combined approach influences breast‑cancer‑related or overall death rates.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for studies that compared mammography alone with mammography plus ultrasonography in women aged 40‑75 who were at average risk. We combined the results using a random‑effects meta‑analysis and assessed our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight studies – one randomised trial, two prospective cohorts and five retrospective cohorts. Together they enrolled 209,207 women aged 40‑75. Follow‑up ranged from one to three years. The studies compared mammography alone with mammography plus breast ultrasonography (including automated, handheld and, in one case, tomosynthesis). No study reported breast‑cancer‑specific or overall death rates.\n\nAdding ultrasound to mammography detected about two extra cancers for every 1,000 women screened. It also reduced the number of cancers that had spread to the lymph nodes (a sign that the cancer is more advanced) from roughly one in three to one in six. In addition, interval cancers fell from ten to five per 10,000 screened. False‑negative results (missed cancers) dropped from about 23% with mammography alone to about 9% when ultrasound was added. However, false‑positive results increased by about 37 per 1,000 women without cancer, and biopsies rose by roughly 27 per 1,000 screened.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies did not randomly assign women to the screening methods. This means differences between groups could be due to other factors. Some studies had small numbers or limited data, and none examined whether the extra cancers found lead to lower mortality.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2021.\n",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required completeness, title/subheading format, factual accuracy, and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader. The most important issues are:\n1. Unexplained technical jargon (e.g., “random‑effects meta‑analysis”, “GRADE approach”, “prospective cohort”, “interval cancers”).\n2. Excessive passive constructions that hide who is doing what (e.g., “The extra cancers are most often found…”, “The evidence is up to date to May 2021 of search”).\n3. Awkward, word‑heavy sentences that are hard to follow (3+ issues).\n4. Over‑use of long, noun‑heavy phrasing, reflected in the metric spikes for passive_voice (19 → P90), nouns (187 → P90), complex_words_dc (262 → P90) and long_words (172 → P90). These reduce readability for patients. Because more than three significant clarity issues are present, the PLS cannot be approved in its current form.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Technical terms** – Quote: “We searched several databases for studies that compared mammography alone with mammography plus ultrasonography in women aged 40‑75 … We combined the results using a random‑effects meta‑analysis and assessed our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.”\n   Why problematic: Readers are unlikely to know what a “random‑effects meta‑analysis” or “GRADE approach” means.\n   Suggested rewrite: “We searched several databases for studies that compared mammography alone with mammography plus ultrasound in women aged 40‑75. We pooled the results using a statistical method that accounts for differences between studies, and we judged how confident we are in the evidence with a standard rating system.”\n\n2. **Passive voice** – Quote: “The extra cancers are most often found in women with dense breast tissue.”\n   Why problematic: Passive phrasing hides the actor and feels abstract.\n   Suggested rewrite: “We most often find the extra cancers in women with dense breast tissue.”\n\n3. **Awkward phrasing** – Quote: “The evidence is up to date to May 2021 of search.”\n   Why problematic: The sentence is grammatically odd and unclear.\n   Suggested rewrite: “Our search was last updated in May 2021, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.”\n\n4. **Long, noun‑heavy sentence** – Quote: “We identified eight studies – one randomised trial, two prospective cohorts and five retrospective cohort studies, together enrolling 209,207 women aged 40‑75.”\n   Why problematic: The sentence packs many details, making it hard to digest.\n   Suggested rewrite: “We found eight studies – one randomised trial, two prospective cohort studies and five retrospective cohort studies. In total, they enrolled 209,207 women aged 40‑75.”\n\n5. **Unexplained jargon** – Quote: “interval cancers”.\n   Why problematic: Patients may not know what “interval cancers” are.\n   Suggested rewrite: “cancers that develop between scheduled screening appointments (called interval cancers).”\n\nThese rewrites address the most confusing elements and also reduce the number of passive constructions, long words, and complex vocabulary, bringing the draft closer to the typical PLS metric ranges.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (e.g., Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 58, FKGL 9.9) are within the best quartile.
