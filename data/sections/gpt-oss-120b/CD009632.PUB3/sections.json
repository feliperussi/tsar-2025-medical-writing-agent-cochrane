  "key_messages": [
    "Adding breast ultrasound (sound waves used to create images of the breast) to mammogram screening (X‑ray image of the breast) detects more breast cancers than mammogram alone, but it also results in more false‑positive results (test suggests cancer when there is none) and more biopsies (procedure to take a small tissue sample to check for cancer); the studies did not show that this approach reduces death from breast cancer.",
    "The benefit of detecting additional cancers was most evident in women with dense breast tissue (breast tissue that appears white on a mammogram, making cancer harder to see), while evidence for women with non‑dense breasts was less clear.",
    "More high‑quality, long‑term research is needed to find out whether the extra cancers found lead to lower mortality and to better understand the overall balance of benefits and harms."

      "subheading": "Why is breast cancer screening important and what are the current methods?",
      "content": "Breast cancer is a common disease that can be life‑threatening if it is not found early. Screening programs aim to spot cancers before they cause symptoms, because early‑stage tumours are usually easier to treat and have a better chance of cure. The most widely used screening test is mammography, an X‑ray picture of the breast that can show lumps or other changes. Some women have very dense breast tissue, which appears white on an X‑ray and can hide cancers, making mammograms less sensitive. To try to improve detection, doctors sometimes add breast ultrasonography—a painless scan that uses sound waves to create a picture of the breast. While ultrasound can find cancers that mammography might miss, it can also produce more false‑positive results (findings that look like cancer but are not) and lead to extra biopsies (small tissue samples taken to check for cancer)."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to compare two screening strategies for women at average risk of breast cancer: (1) mammography alone, and (2) mammography combined with breast ultrasonography. Specifically, they set out to determine whether adding ultrasound improves the number of cancers detected, changes the type or stage of cancers found, reduces the number of cancers that appear between scheduled screens (called interval carcinomas), and what impact it has on harms such as false‑positive results and the need for biopsies. They also looked for any evidence that the combined approach might affect breast‑cancer‑related or overall death rates."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified eight studies (one randomised controlled trial, two prospective cohort studies and five retrospective cohort studies) that together enrolled 209,207 women aged 40 to 75 years who were at average risk for breast cancer. Follow‑up ranged from one to three years; the large Japanese J‑START trial contributed two‑year data. The studies compared mammography alone with mammography plus breast ultrasonography (including automated, handheld and, in one case, tomosynthesis). Five studies used digital mammography, one used tomosynthesis and two incorporated automated breast ultrasonography. No study reported breast‑cancer‑specific or all‑cause mortality outcomes."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Adding ultrasound improves cancer detection and reduces missed cancers",
      "content": "Adding ultrasound to mammography detected about two extra cancers for every 1,000 women screened. It also markedly lowered the proportion of cancers with positive lymph nodes—from roughly one in three to one in six—and halved the number of interval cancers (from ten to five per 10,000 screened). Importantly, the rate of false‑negative results fell from about 23 % with mammography alone to about 9 % when ultrasound was added. These benefits came with trade‑offs: false‑positive results increased by about 37 per 1,000 women without cancer, and biopsies rose by roughly 27 per 1,000 screened."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the treatments, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and studies were very small or based on few cases, so there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2021 of search."
