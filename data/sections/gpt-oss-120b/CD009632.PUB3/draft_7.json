  "draft": "Does adding breast ultrasound (ultrasonography) to mammogram screening detect more breast cancers than mammogram alone in women with average risk?\n\nKey messages\n- Adding breast ultrasound (sound‑wave scan that creates pictures of the breast) to mammogram screening (X‑ray picture of the breast) detects about two extra cancers per 1,000 women screened, but it also increases false‑positive results (tests that suggest cancer when there is none) and the number of biopsies (small tissue samples taken to check for cancer).\n- The extra cancers are most clearly seen in women with dense breast tissue (tissue that looks white on a mammogram and can hide cancer); the benefit for women with non‑dense breasts is less certain.\n- More high‑quality, long‑term research is needed to show whether finding these extra cancers actually reduces death from breast cancer and to better balance benefits and harms.\n\nWhy is breast cancer screening important and what are the current methods?\nWe screen for breast cancer because early‑stage tumours are easier to treat and have a better chance of cure. The most common test is mammography, an X‑ray picture that can show lumps. Some women have dense breast tissue, which appears white on the X‑ray and can hide cancers, making mammograms less sensitive.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare two strategies for women at average risk: (1) mammography alone and (2) mammography plus breast ultrasonography. We asked whether adding ultrasound increases the number of cancers detected, changes the type or stage of cancers found, reduces interval cancers (cancers that appear between scheduled screens), and how it affects harms such as false‑positive results and biopsies. We also looked for any effect on breast‑cancer‑related or overall death.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for studies that compared the two strategies in women aged 40‑75 at average risk. We combined the results using a random‑effects meta‑analysis and assessed our confidence in the findings with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight studies that together enrolled 209,207 women. One study was a randomised trial; the other seven were cohort studies that followed groups over time. Adding ultrasound to mammography detected about two extra cancers for every 1,000 women screened. It also lowered the proportion of cancers with positive lymph nodes (signs that cancer may have spread) from roughly one in three to one in six, and it halved interval cancers (from ten to five per 10,000 screened). The rate of false‑negative results (missed cancers) fell from about 23 % with mammography alone to about 9 % with ultrasound added. However, false‑positive results increased by about 37 per 1,000 women without cancer, and biopsies rose by roughly 27 per 1,000 screened. The benefit of detecting extra cancers was strongest in women with dense breast tissue; evidence for women with non‑dense breasts was less clear.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies did not randomly assign women to the screening methods. This means differences between groups could be due to other factors. Some studies were small, provided limited data, and none examined whether the extra cancers found lead to lower mortality.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur search was last updated in May 2021, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because several statements are likely to confuse a lay reader. Key problems: (1) The first bullet in the Key messages packs three separate ideas into one long sentence, making it hard to follow. (2) The term “positive lymph nodes” is used without any explanation of what it means for patients. (3) A sentence in the Results section combines three findings with commas, exceeding the recommended length and reducing readability. (4) The sentence about dense‑breast benefit is noun‑heavy and could be expressed more directly. (5) The currency statement uses passive wording (“The evidence is up to date to May 2021 of search”) instead of an active, clear sentence. Suggested rewrites: • Split the long bullet into two bullets – one for extra cancers detected and one for increased false‑positives/biopsies. • Add a brief definition: “positive lymph nodes (cancers that have spread to nearby lymph nodes)”. • Break the long Results sentence into two: “Adding ultrasound to mammography detected about two extra cancers for every 1,000 women screened. It also lowered the proportion of cancers with positive lymph nodes—from roughly one in three to one in six—and halved interval cancers (from ten to five per 10,000 screened).” • Rewrite the dense‑breast sentence as: “The benefit is strongest for women with dense breast tissue; we are less sure whether women with non‑dense breasts gain the same advantage.” • Rephrase the currency line to: “We last updated our search in May 2021, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.” These changes will bring the summary in line with the Master Style Guide and improve patient‑friendly readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to typical patterns overall, but two metrics deviate: nouns (168, P90) and complex_words_dc (234, P90). Reducing noun density and simplifying complex words, as suggested above, will bring these metrics closer to the median range."
