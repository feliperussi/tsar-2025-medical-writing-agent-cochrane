  "draft": "Does adding breast ultrasound (ultrasonography) to mammogram screening detect more breast cancers than mammogram alone in women with average risk?\n\nKey messages\n- Adding breast ultrasound (sound‑wave scan that creates pictures of the breast) to mammogram screening (X‑ray picture of the breast) finds about two extra cancers per 1,000 women screened, but it also raises the number of false‑positive results (tests that suggest cancer when there is none) and the number of biopsies (small tissue samples taken to check for cancer).\n- The extra cancers are most clearly seen in women with dense breast tissue (tissue that looks white on a mammogram and can hide cancer); the benefit for women with non‑dense breasts is less certain.\n- We need more high‑quality, long‑term studies to show whether finding these extra cancers actually reduces death from breast cancer and to better balance benefits and harms.\n\nWhy did we conduct this review?\nWe know that early‑stage breast cancer is easier to treat and has a better chance of cure. The most common screening test is mammography, an X‑ray picture that can show lumps. Some women have dense breast tissue, which appears white on the X‑ray and can hide cancers, making mammograms less sensitive. To try to improve detection, doctors sometimes add breast ultrasonography, a painless scan that uses sound waves to create pictures of the breast. While ultrasound can find cancers that mammography might miss, it can also produce more false‑positive results and lead to extra biopsies.\n\nWhat was the aim of the review?\nWe wanted to compare two screening strategies for women at average risk of breast cancer: (1) mammography alone and (2) mammography combined with breast ultrasonography. Specifically, we asked whether adding ultrasound increases the number of cancers detected, changes the type or stage of cancers found, reduces interval cancers (cancers that appear between scheduled screens), and how it affects harms such as false‑positive results and biopsies. We also looked for any evidence that the combined approach influences breast‑cancer‑related or overall death rates.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for studies that compared mammography alone with mammography plus ultrasound in women aged 40‑75 who were at average risk. We pooled the results from the studies and judged how confident we are in the findings using standard methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found eight studies that together enrolled 209,207 women aged 40 to 75 years. One study was a randomised trial where participants were randomly assigned to a screening method; the other seven followed groups of women over time. Adding ultrasound to mammography detected about two extra cancers for every 1,000 women screened. It also reduced the proportion of cancers with positive lymph nodes (a sign that cancer may have spread) from roughly one in three to one in six, and it halved interval cancers (from ten to five per 10,000 screened). False‑negative results (missed cancers) fell from about 23 % with mammography alone to about 9 % with ultrasound added. However, false‑positive results increased by about 37 per 1,000 women without cancer, and biopsies rose by roughly 27 per 1,000 screened. The benefit of detecting extra cancers was most evident in women with dense breast tissue; evidence for women with non‑dense breasts was less clear.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies did not randomly assign women to the screening methods, so differences between groups could be due to other factors. Some studies were small, provided limited data, and none examined whether the extra cancers found lead to lower mortality.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur search was last updated in May 2021, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "Critical checks failed: the draft is missing required sections for Limitations of the evidence and Currency of the evidence, which must be presented as question‑style subheadings (e.g., \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and \"How current is the evidence?\"). Without these sections the summary is incomplete and does not meet the Master Style Guide. Additionally, several clarity and style issues need fixing:\n1. **Passive voice overload** – many sentences use passive constructions, e.g., \"The extra cancers are most clearly seen in women with dense breast tissue…\" This obscures who is doing the action and reduces readability. Rewrite in active voice: \"We see the extra cancers most clearly in women with dense breast tissue…\".\n2. **Noun‑heavy, long sentences** – e.g., \"Adding ultrasound to mammography detected about two extra cancers for every 1,000 women screened, it also reduced the proportion of cancers with positive lymph nodes…\" This sentence is long and packed with nouns, making it hard to follow. Split into two shorter sentences: \"Adding ultrasound to mammography detected about two extra cancers for every 1,000 women screened. It also reduced the proportion of cancers with positive lymph nodes…\".\n3. **Technical jargon without definition** – terms like \"interval cancers\" and \"positive lymph nodes\" appear without plain‑language explanation. Provide brief definitions: \"interval cancers (cancers that appear between scheduled screens)\" and \"positive lymph nodes (signs that cancer may have spread)\".\n4. **Missing paragraph breaks and bullet formatting** – the draft presents large blocks of text; insert blank lines between each subheading and its paragraph, and ensure bullet points start with a dash (‑). This improves white‑space and readability.\n5. **Complex and long words** – words such as \"automated\", \"retrospective\", \"methodological\" increase reading difficulty. Replace with simpler alternatives where possible (e.g., \"automated\" → \"computer‑assisted\", \"retrospective\" → \"looking back at past data\").\nMetrics support these observations: passive_voice count is 20 (P90, higher than typical), nouns 186 (P90), complex_words_dc 258 (P90), and long_words 168 (P90), indicating the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many complex words. Reducing these will align the text with typical PLS patterns and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall but deviates in four metrics: passive_voice (20, P90), nouns (186, P90), complex_words_dc (258, P90), and long_words (168, P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun density, unfamiliar complex words, and long words, which should be reduced to improve clarity."
