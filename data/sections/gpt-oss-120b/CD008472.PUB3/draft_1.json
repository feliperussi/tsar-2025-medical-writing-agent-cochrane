  "draft": "Does remote ischaemic preconditioning (temporarily blocking blood flow to a part of the body away from the surgery) improve outcomes compared with no preconditioning in major blood‑vessel (vascular) surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning (temporarily blocking blood flow to a part of the body away from the surgery) probably makes little or no difference to the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, loss of a limb, length of hospital stay, or the time needed for the operation compared with not using this technique, and no specific harmful effects were reported.\n- The available evidence comes from a moderate number of studies that are generally of moderate quality, but there is still some uncertainty because the results are not precise and the studies vary somewhat in their methods.\n- More large, well‑designed randomised trials are needed that focus on important clinical outcomes and patient‑centred measures to determine whether remote ischaemic preconditioning could provide any real benefit in major vascular surgery.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nWhy are major vascular and endovascular surgeries a health concern?\nElective major vascular surgery (operations on large blood vessels such as the aorta, arteries in the legs, or the carotid arteries) and endovascular procedures (minimally‑invasive techniques that use catheters inside the vessels) are performed to treat serious conditions like aneurysms, blockages, or peripheral artery disease. Even with modern peri‑operative care, these operations carry a high risk of serious complications and death. Patients can experience heart attacks (myocardial infarction), kidney problems (renal impairment), strokes, loss of a limb, or prolonged hospital stays after the surgery.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) and how might it help?\nRemote is a simple technique that briefly blocks blood flow to a part of the body that is not being operated on, usually by inflating a blood pressure cuff on an arm or leg for a few minutes and then releasing it. This short, repeated interruption of blood supply is thought to trigger protective mechanisms that make the heart, kidneys, brain and other organs more resistant to the longer periods of reduced blood flow (ischaemia) that can occur during major surgery. Researchers hope that RIPC could lower the chance of complications such as heart attacks, kidney injury, or stroke after vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did the review set out to discover?\nThe authors wanted to find out whether giving patients RIPC before elective major vascular or endovascular surgery improves outcomes compared with not giving RIPC. Specifically, they examined whether RIPC reduces peri‑operative mortality (death around the time of surgery) and serious complications such as myocardial infarction, renal impairment, stroke, limb loss, length of hospital stay, and the time needed for the operation or anaesthesia. They also assessed any potential harms associated with the technique.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared remote ischaemic preconditioning with no preconditioning in elective major vascular or endovascular surgery, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 14 randomised controlled trials that enrolled a total of 1,295 older adults (aged about 64.5 to 76 years) undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery; about 84 % of participants were male. All trials compared remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) applied before surgery with a control condition of no RIPC. The evidence suggests that using RIPC probably makes little or no difference to the chance of dying around the time of surgery, to having a heart attack, to developing kidney problems, to experiencing a stroke, to the length of hospital stay, and to how long the operation or anaesthetic takes. It may also make little or no difference to the risk of losing a limb. The certainty of the evidence is moderate for most outcomes and low for limb loss.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies that provide results for our review are likely to exaggerate the benefits because they represent only a small set of all studies.\n\nCURRENCY\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022 of search.",

Specifically, the headings \"Methods\", \"LIMITATIONS\", and \"CURRENCY\" are noun phrases rather than questions. This violates the subheading format rule and prevents approval. Additionally, the draft contains a number of clarity and readability issues that would confuse readers: 1) Long, dense sentences (e.g., the 27‑word sentence in the Results section) make the text hard to follow. 2) Excessive passive voice and nominalisations obscure who is doing what (e.g., \"The evidence suggests that using RIPC probably makes little or no difference…\"). 3) Heavy noun‑laden phrasing and many complex words inflate the reading level (metrics show 213 nouns, 179 complex words, and a Flesch‑Kincaid grade of 15.4, all far beyond typical PLS ranges). Suggested rewrites are provided below. Metrics support these observations: words_per_sentence = 27.58 (P90), passive_voice = 21 (P90), nominalization = 22 (P90), nouns = 213 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words = 179 (BEYOND_P90), indicating the draft is substantially more complex than typical Cochrane PLS texts.",

Key deviations include high sentence length (27.6 words, P90), many passive constructions (21, P90), high nominalisation (22, P90), excessive noun count (213, beyond P90), and very high readability scores (FK grade 15.4, SMOG 16.1, both P90). These indicate the text is more complex and less reader‑friendly than usual PLSs."
