  "draft": "Does remote ischaemic preconditioning (temporarily blocking blood flow to a part of the body away from the surgery) improve outcomes compared with no preconditioning in major blood‑vessel (vascular) surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) probably makes little or no difference to the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attacks (myocardial infarction), kidney problems (renal impairment), strokes, loss of a limb, length of hospital stay, or the time needed for the operation, and no specific harmful effects were reported.\n- The evidence comes from 14 randomised trials that together enrolled 1,295 adults aged about 64.5 to 76 years, 84 % of whom were male. The trials were of moderate quality but were small and varied in how the technique was applied, so the results are imprecise.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials that focus on important clinical outcomes and patient‑centred measures are needed to determine whether RIPC could provide any real benefit in major vascular surgery.\n\nWhy are major vascular and endovascular surgeries a health concern?\nWe perform elective major vascular surgery (operations on large blood vessels such as the aorta, leg arteries, or carotid arteries) and endovascular procedures (minimally‑invasive techniques that use catheters inside the vessels) to treat serious conditions like aneurysms, blockages, or peripheral artery disease. Even with modern peri‑operative (around the time of surgery) care, these operations carry a high risk of serious complications and death. Patients can experience heart attacks (myocardial infarction), kidney problems (renal impairment), strokes, loss of a limb, or long hospital stays after surgery.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) and how might it help?\nRIPC is a simple technique that briefly blocks blood flow to a part of the body that is not being operated on. We usually inflate a blood pressure cuff on an arm or leg for a few minutes and then release it. This short, repeated interruption of blood supply is thought to trigger protective mechanisms that make the heart, kidneys, brain and other organs more resistant to longer periods of reduced blood flow (ischaemia) that can occur during major surgery. Researchers hope that RIPC could lower the chance of complications such as heart attacks, kidney injury, or stroke after vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did the review set out to discover?\nWe wanted to find out whether giving patients RIPC before elective major vascular or endovascular surgery improves outcomes compared with not giving RIPC. Specifically, we examined whether RIPC reduces peri‑operative mortality (death around the time of surgery) and serious complications such as myocardial infarction, renal impairment, stroke, limb loss, length of hospital stay, and the time needed for the operation or anaesthesia. We also looked for any potential harms associated with the technique.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registries for randomised controlled trials that compared RIPC with no preconditioning in elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 14 randomised trials that enrolled a total of 1,295 participants (age range 64.5 to 76 years; 84 % male). All trials compared RIPC with a control condition of no RIPC. The evidence suggests that RIPC probably makes little or no difference to the chance of dying around the time of surgery, having a heart attack, developing kidney problems, experiencing a stroke, length of hospital stay, or how long the operation or anaesthetic takes. It may also make little or no difference to the risk of losing a limb. The certainty of the evidence is moderate for most outcomes and low for limb loss.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence, but the studies were small and varied in the types of patients and how the intervention was delivered. Because only a limited number of trials are available, the results may over‑estimate any benefit.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review and includes studies up to April 2022.",

These three issues are enough to confuse a lay audience. Minor style issues (passive voice, high nominalisation count) reinforce the problem. The draft meets the structural and factual requirements, but the readability barriers must be addressed before approval.",

Nominalisation (25) and noun count (203) are also far above typical PLS levels, contributing to the dense, hard‑to‑read prose identified in the feedback."
