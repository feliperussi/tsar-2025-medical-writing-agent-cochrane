  "draft": "Does remote ischaemic preconditioning (temporarily blocking blood flow to a part of the body away from the surgery) improve outcomes compared with no preconditioning in major blood‑vessel (vascular) surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) probably makes little or no difference to the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, loss of a limb, length of hospital stay, or the time needed for the operation, and no specific harmful effects were reported.\n- The evidence comes from 14 moderate‑size trials that are generally of moderate quality, but the results are not precise and the studies vary in how they delivered the intervention.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials that focus on important clinical outcomes and patient‑centred measures are needed to determine whether RIPC could provide any real benefit in major vascular surgery.\n\nWhy are major vascular and endovascular surgeries a health concern?\nWe perform elective major vascular surgery (operations on large blood vessels such as the aorta, leg arteries, or carotid arteries) and endovascular procedures (minimally‑invasive techniques that use catheters inside the vessels) to treat serious conditions like aneurysms, blockages, or peripheral artery disease. Even with modern peri‑operative care, these operations carry a high risk of serious complications and death. Patients can experience heart attacks (myocardial infarction), kidney problems (renal impairment), strokes, loss of a limb, or long hospital stays after surgery.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) and how might it help?\nRIPC is a simple technique that briefly blocks blood flow to a part of the body that is not being operated on, usually by inflating a blood pressure cuff on an arm or leg for a few minutes and then releasing it. This short, repeated interruption of blood supply is thought to trigger protective mechanisms that make the heart, kidneys, brain and other organs more resistant to the longer periods of reduced blood flow (ischaemia) that can occur during major surgery. Researchers hope that RIPC could lower the chance of complications such as heart attacks, kidney injury, or stroke after vascular surgery.\n\nWhat did the review set out to discover?\nWe wanted to find out whether giving patients RIPC before elective major vascular or endovascular surgery improves outcomes compared with not giving RIPC. Specifically, we examined whether RIPC reduces peri‑operative mortality (death around the time of surgery) and serious complications such as myocardial infarction, renal impairment, stroke, limb loss, length of hospital stay, and the time needed for the operation or anaesthesia. We also looked for any potential harms associated with the technique.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registries for randomised controlled trials that compared RIPC with no preconditioning in elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 14 trials that enrolled a total of 1,295 participants (average age 64.5–76 years; 84 % male). All trials compared RIPC applied before surgery with a control condition of no RIPC. The evidence shows that RIPC probably makes little or no difference to the chance of dying around the time of surgery, having a heart attack, developing kidney problems, experiencing a stroke, length of hospital stay, or how long the operation or anaesthetic takes. It may also make little or no difference to the risk of losing a limb. The certainty of the evidence is moderate for most outcomes and low for limb loss.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence, but the studies were small and varied in the types of patients and how the intervention was delivered. Because only a limited number of trials are available, the results may over‑estimate any benefit.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review and includes studies up to April 2022.\n",

No specific harmful effects were reported.\"\n\n2. **Unexplained medical jargon**\n   - *Quote*: \"...myocardial infarction, renal impairment, stroke, limb loss...\"\n   - *Problem*: Terms such as \"myocardial infarction\" and \"renal impairment\" are technical and are not defined for a non‑expert audience, which can leave readers unsure what complications are being discussed.\n   - *Rewrite*: \"...heart attacks (myocardial infarction), kidney problems (renal impairment), strokes, loss of a limb...\"\n   - Apply the same pattern wherever the terms first appear, e.g., in the \"What did the review set out to discover?\" paragraph.\n\n3. **Heavy use of nominalisations and noun‑heavy phrasing**\n   - *Quote*: \"The evidence shows that RIPC probably makes little or no difference to the chance of dying around the time of surgery, to having a heart attack, to developing kidney problems, to experiencing a stroke, to the length of hospital stay, and to how long the operation or anaesthetic takes.\"\n   - *Problem*: The sentence relies on many noun phrases (\"the evidence shows\", \"the chance of dying\", \"the length of hospital stay\"), which reduces readability and contributes to the high nominalisation count (24, P90) and noun count (198, P90) reported by the metrics.\n   - *Rewrite*: \"We found that RIPC probably does not change the risk of death around surgery, heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, length of hospital stay, or the time the operation takes.\"\n   - Also change passive‑style sentences such as \"The evidence comes from 14 moderate‑size trials...\" to active: \"We identified 14 moderate‑size trials...\"\n\nThese three issues together exceed the allowed number of major clarity problems, so the PLS cannot be approved in its current form.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but shows several metric deviations: nominalisation (24, P90), noun count (198, P90), complex words (164, BEYOND_P90), long words (203, BEYOND_P90) and SMOG index (15.4, BEYOND_P90). These indicate a noun‑heavy, complex style that aligns with the identified clarity issues. Passive voice (17, P75) is also higher than typical. Reducing nominalisations, simplifying vocabulary, and shortening sentences will improve the metrics and, more importantly, patient comprehension."
