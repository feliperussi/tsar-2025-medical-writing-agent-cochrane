  "key_messages": [
    "For women with urinary incontinence, doing direct pelvic floor muscle training (repeated, isolated contractions of the pelvic floor muscles) appears to give a small improvement in how the condition affects daily life compared with indirect training (exercises that do not target the pelvic floor muscles); training that combines body movements with pelvic floor contractions (coordinated training) may add a slight benefit, and exercising more days each week may lead to a larger benefit, while supervision—whether individual or group—makes little difference; unwanted effects are uncommon and are mainly linked to the use of intravaginal or intrarectal devices.",
    "Many of the studies were small, had methodological limitations, and showed inconsistent results, so overall confidence in these findings is limited.",
    "Future research should include well‑designed, larger trials that directly compare different types, doses, and delivery methods of pelvic floor muscle training, and that report longer‑term outcomes and any side effects."

      "subheading": "What is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem for women?",
      "content": "Urinary incontinence means losing control over the bladder so that urine leaks unintentionally. In women it often shows up as:\n- Stress incontinence – leakage when coughing, sneezing, or exercising;\n- Urgency incontinence – a sudden, strong need to urinate that can’t be delayed;\n- Mixed incontinence – a combination of both.\nThese leaks can be embarrassing, limit daily activities, affect work and social life, and reduce quality of life.\nA common first‑line treatment is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) – exercises that strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and urethra. PFMT usually involves repeated, voluntary squeezes of these muscles (called “direct” PFMT). However, PFMT can be delivered in many ways: the exercises may be done alone or together with other body movements (\"indirect\" or \"co‑ordinated\" training), the amount of effort or frequency can vary, and the training can be supervised in a clinic, at home, or via digital tools (e‑health). Understanding which of these variations works best is important for helping women regain control and improve their quality of life."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to compare different ways of doing PFMT to see which ones give the biggest benefit for women with stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. Specifically, they looked at three groups of differences:\n1. Exercise type – comparing direct pelvic‑floor squeezes with exercises that combine pelvic‑floor contractions with other body movements (co‑ordinated training) or with exercises that do not involve pelvic‑floor squeezes (indirect training).\n2. Exercise dose – looking at factors such as using resistance devices, how hard the contractions are (maximal vs. sub‑maximal), how many days per week the exercises are done, and the body position during training.\n3. Intervention delivery – comparing supervised clinic sessions, home‑based programmes, group versus individual supervision, and digital (e‑health) support.\nThe goal was to determine which of these approaches, if any, improve women’s incontinence‑related quality of life and to assess any associated side effects."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 63 randomised trials that together involved 4,920 women with urinary incontinence. The participants were generally middle‑aged (about 45–65 years), had previously given birth, and most experienced stress‑type or stress‑predominant mixed incontinence. None had received prior incontinence treatment or pelvic surgery, and they did not have major pelvic‑floor problems. The trials were conducted worldwide, with 53 carried out in middle‑ or high‑income countries. All studies compared at least one arm of direct pelvic‑floor muscle training (repeated, isolated voluntary contractions) with other approaches, examining different exercise types, doses, and delivery methods. Details on the length of each intervention, follow‑up periods, and funding sources were not reported in the abstract."

      "subheading": "Main results: Training more often each week",
      "content": "Doing pelvic‑floor muscle training on more days each week probably leads to a large improvement in quality of life for women with urinary incontinence, although the certainty of this evidence is low."

  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023 of search."
