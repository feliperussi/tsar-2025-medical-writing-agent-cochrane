  "draft": "What type, amount, or delivery of pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen bladder‑control muscles) works best for women with urinary incontinence (bladder leakage)?\n\nKey messages –\n- Direct pelvic floor muscle training (repeated, isolated squeezes) gives a small to moderate improvement in daily life compared with exercises that do not target these muscles; coordinated training may add a slight extra benefit, and doing the exercises on more days each week probably leads to a larger benefit.\n- Supervision in a clinic may give a small benefit but the evidence is uncertain; individual versus group supervision shows little or no difference, and e‑health delivery may provide a slight benefit.\n- Unwanted effects are uncommon (about 6 % of women) and are mainly linked to intravaginal or intrarectal devices.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why does it matter?\nUrinary incontinence means losing control over the bladder so that urine leaks unintentionally. In women it often appears as:\n- Stress incontinence – leakage when coughing, sneezing, or exercising;\n- Urgency incontinence – a sudden, strong need to urinate that cannot be delayed;\n- Mixed incontinence – a combination of both.\nThese leaks can be embarrassing, limit daily activities, affect work and social life, and reduce quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe compared different ways of doing pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) to see which approaches improve incontinence‑related quality of life the most. We looked at three groups of differences:\n1. Exercise type – direct squeezes, coordinated training (body movements with pelvic‑floor squeezes), or indirect training (exercises that do not involve the pelvic floor);\n2. Exercise dose – use of resistance devices, strength of contractions, number of training days per week, and body position;\n3. Intervention delivery – clinic supervision, home programmes, group versus individual supervision, and digital (e‑health) support.\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) up to 27 September 2023. We also hand‑searched journals, conference papers and reference lists. Two reviewers independently screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.\n\nWhich type of training works best?\nDirect PFMT gave a moderate improvement in quality of life (the statistical measure called standardised mean difference – SMD – was 0.70, meaning the average benefit was about 0.7 standard units). Coordinated training may add a slight extra benefit (SMD –0.22). Indirect training alone gave a smaller benefit than direct training.\n\nHow does the amount of training affect outcomes?\nTraining on more days each week probably leads to a large improvement in quality of life (SMD –1.60). Evidence for resistance devices or for maximal versus sub‑maximal contractions is very uncertain.\n\nDoes supervision make a difference?\nClinic supervision may give a small benefit, but the evidence is very uncertain. Individual versus group supervision shows little or no difference (SMD –0.18). Delivery via e‑health may provide a slight benefit (SMD –0.21).\n\nAre there any side effects?\nAbout 6 % of women reported unwanted effects, mainly vaginal discharge, spotting or discomfort linked to intravaginal or intrarectal training devices.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMost trials were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies varied in participants and delivery methods. These factors reduce our confidence in the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe updated our previous review and included evidence searched up to September 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft passes the required completeness, title/subheading format, factual accuracy and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Statistical jargon without plain explanation** – \"Direct PFMT gave a moderate improvement in quality of life (the statistical measure called standardised mean difference – SMD – was 0.70, meaning the average benefit was about 0.7 standard units).\" This sentence is dense, uses the term SMD and a numeric value that patients cannot interpret. Rewrite to plain language, e.g.: \"Direct PFMT moderately improved quality of life – women felt noticeably better compared with other exercises.\"\n2. **Negative sign in SMD creates ambiguity** – \"Co‑ordinated training may add a slight extra benefit (SMD –0.22).\" A negative value suggests a worse outcome, which contradicts the wording “extra benefit”. Rewrite to clarify direction, e.g.: \"Co‑ordinated training may add a small extra benefit, giving a slight improvement in quality of life.\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy, nominalised phrasing** – many sentences rely on nouns rather than verbs, e.g., \"Direct PFMT gave a moderate improvement in quality of life (the statistical measure called standardised mean difference – SMD – was 0.70, meaning the average benefit was about 0.7 standard units).\" This contributes to the high nominalisation (30) and long‑word counts (188) flagged by the metrics. Rewrite with active verbs: \"Direct PFMT moderately improved quality of life.\"\n4. **Over‑use of technical terms without definition** – terms such as “standardised mean difference”, “confidence interval”, and “low‑certainty evidence” appear without lay explanations. Provide brief definitions or replace with everyday language, e.g., \"the evidence is uncertain – we are not sure how strong the result is.\"\n5. **Heavy use of parentheses** – the title and several sentences embed multiple parenthetical explanations, which can interrupt reading flow. Simplify by integrating the information into the main clause, e.g., change \"pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen bladder‑control muscles)\" to \"pelvic floor muscle training – exercises that strengthen the muscles that control the bladder\".\nThese issues are supported by the metric analysis: the draft shows unusually high nominalisation, noun count, complex‑word and long‑word counts (well beyond the typical PLS ranges), indicating a noun‑heavy, jargon‑laden style that hampers readability. To meet Cochrane plain‑language standards, the draft should be revised to reduce technical jargon, clarify statistical directions, and replace noun‑heavy constructions with active, everyday language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (words per sentence 18.3, active voice 52, pronouns 25, Flesch reading ease 48.8) but notable deviations: nominalisation (30, beyond P90), nouns (177, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.4, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.4, beyond P90), complex words (125) and long words (188) all exceed typical PLS ranges. These metrics confirm the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many complex/long words, supporting the recommended edits."
