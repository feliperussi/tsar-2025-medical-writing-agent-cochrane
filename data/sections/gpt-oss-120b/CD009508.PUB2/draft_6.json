  "draft": "What type, amount, or delivery of pelvic floor muscle training – exercises that strengthen bladder‑control muscles – works best for women with urinary incontinence (bladder leakage)?\n\nKey messages –\n- Direct pelvic floor muscle training (repeated, isolated squeezes) gives a small to moderate improvement in how incontinence affects daily life; coordinated training that adds body movements may add a slight extra benefit, and exercising on more days each week probably leads to a larger benefit.\n- Supervision in a clinic or at home makes little difference; whether the training is delivered individually, in a group, or through a digital app (e‑health) shows only a small possible advantage.\n- Unwanted effects are uncommon (about 6 % of women) and are mainly linked to the use of intravaginal or intrarectal devices.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why does it matter?\nUrinary incontinence means losing control over the bladder so that urine leaks unintentionally. In women it often appears as:\n- Stress incontinence – leakage when coughing, sneezing, or exercising;\n- Urgency incontinence – a sudden, strong need to urinate that cannot be delayed;\n- Mixed incontinence – a combination of both.\nThese leaks can be embarrassing, limit daily activities, affect work and social life, and reduce quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe compared different ways of doing pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) to see which approaches improve incontinence‑related quality of life the most. We looked at three groups of differences:\n1. Exercise type – direct squeezes, coordinated training (body movements combined with squeezes), or indirect training (exercises that do not involve the pelvic floor);\n2. Exercise dose – use of resistance devices, strength of contractions, number of training days per week, and body position;\n3. Intervention delivery – clinic supervision, home programmes, group versus individual supervision, and digital (e‑health) support.\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) up to 27 September 2023. We also hand‑searched journals, conference papers and reference lists. Two reviewers independently screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.\n\nWhich type of training works best?\nDirect PFMT gave a moderate improvement in quality of life – women felt noticeably better compared with indirect training. Coordinated training may add a small extra benefit, giving a slight further improvement. Indirect training alone gave a smaller benefit than direct training.\n\nHow does the amount of training affect outcomes?\nDoing PFMT on more days each week probably leads to a large improvement in quality of life. Evidence for using resistance devices or for doing maximal versus sub‑maximal contractions is very uncertain.\n\nDoes supervision make a difference?\nClinic supervision may give a small benefit, but the evidence is uncertain. Individual versus group supervision shows little or no difference. Delivery via e‑health (a mobile app that lets clinicians communicate with you) may provide a slight benefit.\n\nAre there any side effects?\nAbout 6 % of women reported unwanted effects. Most were vaginal discharge, spotting or discomfort linked to intravaginal or intrarectal training devices.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMost trials were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies varied in participants and delivery methods. These factors reduce our confidence in the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe updated our previous review and included evidence searched up to September 2023.",

Adding coordinated body movements may give a slight extra benefit. Doing the exercises on more days each week probably leads to a larger benefit.\"\n2. **Passive voice in side‑effects description** – \"Unwanted effects are uncommon (about 6 % of women) and are mainly linked to the use of intravaginal or intrarectal devices.\" Passive wording hides who experiences the effects. *Rewrite*: \"About 6 % of women experienced unwanted effects, mainly vaginal discharge, spotting or discomfort from intravaginal or intrarectal devices.\"\n3. **Unexplained jargon – “direct PFMT”** – The term appears in several sections without a plain‑language definition, leaving readers unsure what it means. *Rewrite*: first mention should read \"direct pelvic floor muscle training (repeated, isolated squeezes)\" and thereafter use the short phrase \"direct training\" with a reminder of the meaning.\n4. **Noun‑heavy sentence about the search** – \"We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) up to 27 September 2023.\" The many nouns make it dense. *Rewrite*: \"We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Register – which contains CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP – up to 27 September 2023.\"\n5. **Bullet‑point formatting** – The \"Key messages –\" heading is not a question and the bullet list uses a dash but the heading itself should follow the question style used elsewhere. Change to a question such as \"What are the key messages?\".\n\nThese issues affect readability and patient understanding. The PLS evaluation also shows structural problems: nominalizations (30, beyond P90) and noun count (176, beyond P90) are unusually high, and the SMOG index (14.4) and Dale‑Chall score (8.3) are above typical PLS ranges, confirming the draft is more complex than needed. Addressing the points above will bring the text back into the normal PLS pattern.",

Active voice is good (58, P75) and pronoun use is strong (27, P75), but the high nominalization and noun counts explain the clarity issues identified."
