  "draft": "What type, amount, or delivery of pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen bladder‑control muscles) works best for women with urinary incontinence (bladder leakage)?\n\n- For women with urinary incontinence, doing direct pelvic floor muscle training (repeated, isolated contractions of the pelvic floor muscles) appears to give a small improvement in how the condition affects daily life compared with indirect training (exercises that do not target the pelvic floor muscles); training that combines body movements with pelvic floor contractions (coordinated training) may add a slight benefit, and exercising more days each week may lead to a larger benefit, while supervision—whether individual or group—makes little difference; unwanted effects are uncommon and are mainly linked to the use of intravaginal or intrarectal devices.\n- Many of the studies were small, had methodological limitations, and showed inconsistent results, so overall confidence in these findings is limited.\n- Future research should include well‑designed, larger trials that directly compare different types, doses, and delivery methods of pelvic floor muscle training, and that report longer‑term outcomes and any side effects.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem for women?\nUrinary incontinence means losing control over the bladder so that urine leaks unintentionally. In women it often shows up as:\n- Stress incontinence – leakage when coughing, sneezing, or exercising;\n- Urgency incontinence – a sudden, strong need to urinate that can’t be delayed;\n- Mixed incontinence – a combination of both.\nThese leaks can be embarrassing, limit daily activities, affect work and social life, and reduce quality of life.\nA common first‑line treatment is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) – exercises that strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and urethra. PFMT usually involves repeated, voluntary squeezes of these muscles (called “direct” PFMT). However, PFMT can be delivered in many ways: the exercises may be done alone or together with other body movements (\"indirect\" or \"co‑ordinated\" training), the amount of effort or frequency can vary, and the training can be supervised in a clinic, at home, or via digital tools (e‑health). Understanding which of these variations works best is important for helping women regain control and improve their quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to compare different ways of doing PFMT to see which ones give the biggest benefit for women with stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. Specifically, they looked at three groups of differences:\n1. Exercise type – comparing direct pelvic‑floor squeezes with exercises that combine pelvic‑floor contractions with other body movements (co‑ordinated training) or with exercises that do not involve pelvic‑floor squeezes (indirect training).\n2. Exercise dose – looking at factors such as using resistance devices, how hard the contractions are (maximal vs. sub‑maximal), how many days per week the exercises are done, and the body position during training.\n3. Intervention delivery – comparing supervised clinic sessions, home‑based programmes, group versus individual supervision, and digital (e‑health) support.\nThe goal was to determine which of these approaches, if any, improve women’s incontinence‑related quality of life and to assess any associated side effects.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared different pelvic‑floor muscle training approaches (exercise type, dose, or delivery) for women with urinary incontinence, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 63 randomised trials that together involved 4,920 women with urinary incontinence. The participants were generally middle‑aged (about 45–65 years), had previously given birth, and most experienced stress‑type or stress‑predominant mixed incontinence. None had received prior incontinence treatment or pelvic surgery, and they did not have major pelvic‑floor problems. The trials were conducted worldwide, with 53 carried out in middle‑ or high‑income countries. All studies compared at least one arm of direct pelvic‑floor muscle training (repeated, isolated voluntary contractions) with other approaches, examining different exercise types, doses, and delivery methods. Details on the length of each intervention, follow‑up periods, and funding sources were not reported in the abstract.\n\nMain results: Training more often each week\nDoing pelvic‑floor muscle training on more days each week probably leads to a large improvement in quality of life for women with urinary incontinence, although the certainty of this evidence is low.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the section subheadings are not phrased as questions, as required by the Master Style Guide (e.g., \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\" are statements, not questions). Additionally, the key-message section is not labelled with a clear heading, which reduces navigability for readers.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Introduction/Aims\". Problem: Not a question, so readers cannot quickly see the purpose of the section. Rewrite as: \"What is urinary incontinence and why does it matter?\" and similarly change the other headings to questions (e.g., \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up-to-date is this review?\").\n2. **Passive voice** – Quote: \"The participants were generally middle‑aged (about 45–65 years), had previously given birth…\" Problem: Passive construction hides who is being described and adds to the high passive‑voice count (31, well beyond the typical P90). Rewrite actively: \"We enrolled women who were generally middle‑aged (about 45–65 years) and who had previously given birth…\".\n3. **Long, noun‑heavy sentences** – Quote: \"All studies compared at least one arm of direct pelvic‑floor muscle training (repeated, isolated voluntary contractions) with other approaches, examining different exercise types, doses, and delivery methods.\" Problem: 30+ words, many nouns (245 total, beyond P90) making it hard to follow. Rewrite: \"All studies compared direct pelvic‑floor training (repeated, isolated squeezes) with other approaches. They looked at different exercise types, how often the exercises were done, and how the training was delivered.\".\n4. **Complex vocabulary** – Quote: \"unwanted effects are uncommon and are mainly linked to the use of intravaginal or intrarectal devices.\" Problem: Terms like \"intrarectal\" may be unfamiliar; the draft also has high scores for complex words (182) and long words (256). Simplify: \"Side effects were rare and usually came from using devices placed inside the vagina or rectum.\".\n5. **Missing explicit Key Messages heading** – Quote: the three bullet points at the start are not introduced. Problem: Readers may not recognise these as the main take‑aways. Add a heading formatted as a question, e.g., \"What are the main findings?\" before the bullet list.\n\nMetrics support these edits: passive_voice = 31 (BEYOND_P90), nominalization = 35 (BEYOND_P90), nouns = 245 (BEYOND_P90), smog_index = 15.8 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words = 182 (BEYOND_P90), long_words = 256 (BEYOND_P90). Reducing passive constructions, nominalizations, and complex/long words will bring the draft into the median range and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits and has average sentence length (20.8 words) and reading‑grade scores (FKGL 12.2) around the median (P50). However, several metrics are far outside typical PLS patterns: passive voice (31, BEYOND_P90), nominalizations (35, BEYOND_P90), noun count (245, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15.8, BEYOND_P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.4, P90), complex words (182, BEYOND_P90) and long words (256, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is overly noun‑heavy, uses many complex words, and relies heavily on passive constructions, which reduces clarity for a lay audience."
