  "draft": "What type, amount, or delivery of pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen bladder‑control muscles) works best for women with urinary incontinence (bladder leakage)?\n\nKey messages\n- Doing the pelvic‑floor squeeze exercises (called “direct” training) improves daily life a little compared with exercises that do not involve these muscles (called “indirect” training). Training that combines body movements with pelvic‑floor squeezes (called “co‑ordinated” training) may add a small extra benefit, and exercising on more days each week probably leads to a much larger improvement. Supervision – whether one‑to‑one or in a group – makes little or no difference, and side effects are rare, mainly coming from intravaginal or intrarectal devices.\n- The findings are based on 63 small randomised trials that included 4,920 women, most of whom were aged 45–65, had given birth, and mainly experienced stress‑type incontinence. Because many trials were small and some participants knew which treatment they received, we have limited confidence in the results.\n- Future research should involve larger, well‑designed trials that directly compare different types, doses, and delivery methods of pelvic‑floor training and that report longer‑term outcomes and any side effects.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why does it matter?\nUrinary incontinence means losing control over the bladder so that urine leaks unintentionally. In women it often appears as:\n- Stress incontinence – leakage when coughing, sneezing, or exercising;\n- Urgency incontinence – a sudden, strong need to urinate that cannot be delayed;\n- Mixed incontinence – a combination of both.\nThese leaks can be embarrassing, limit daily activities, affect work and social life, and reduce quality of life.\nA common first‑line treatment is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT). PFMT involves exercises that strengthen the muscles supporting the bladder and urethra. The most typical form is repeated, voluntary squeezes of these muscles (called “direct” training). PFMT can also be delivered in other ways: exercises done alone (indirect training), exercises combined with other body movements (co‑ordinated training), different frequencies, or with supervision in a clinic, at home, or via digital tools (e‑health). Knowing which variation works best helps women regain control.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare different ways of doing PFMT to see which give the biggest benefit for women with stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. Specifically we looked at three groups of differences:\n1. Exercise type – direct squeezes versus coordinated training versus indirect training.\n2. Exercise dose – use of resistance devices, strength of contractions, number of days per week, and body position.\n3. Intervention delivery – clinic supervision, home programmes, group versus individual supervision, and e‑health support.\nOur goal was to determine which approaches improve incontinence‑related quality of life and to note any side effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) up to 27 September 2023. We also hand‑searched journals, conference papers and reference lists. Two reviewers independently screened studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 63 randomised trials that together involved 4,920 women with urinary incontinence. Most participants were middle‑aged (about 45–65 years), had given birth, and mainly experienced stress‑type or stress‑predominant mixed incontinence. None had received prior incontinence treatment or pelvic surgery.\nThe most important findings were:\n- Direct PFMT gave a small improvement in daily life compared with indirect training.\n- Co‑ordinated training may add a slight extra benefit.\n- Exercising on more days each week probably leads to a large improvement in quality of life, although the certainty of this evidence is low.\n- Supervision, whether individual or group, made little or no difference.\n- Unwanted effects were uncommon (about 6 % of participants) and were mainly linked to intravaginal or intrarectal devices.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies were small and some participants may have known which treatment they received. The trials also varied in the types of women enrolled and how the interventions were delivered. Because of these issues we have limited confidence in the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to September 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical checks: (1) Not all subheadings are phrased as questions – the \"Key messages\" heading is a noun phrase rather than a question. (2) The description of the effect size for direct pelvic‑floor muscle training is inaccurate – the source reports a moderate improvement (SMD 0.70) but the draft calls it a \"small\" improvement, which understates the evidence. Additionally, the text contains several clarity and style problems that would confuse readers: excessive passive voice, heavy noun‑laden sentences, and long, complex sentences. These issues are reflected in the metrics (30 passive constructions, 35 nominalisations, 205 nouns, SMOG 15.1, 151 complex words, 219 long words), all far beyond typical PLS ranges. The most important improvements are: (a) rewrite the \"Key messages\" heading as a question; (b) correct the magnitude of the direct PFMT benefit; (c) replace passive constructions with active voice; (d) reduce nominalisations and noun‑heavy phrasing; (e) break long sentences and simplify vocabulary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (55.6% of features in best quartile) but several metrics deviate strongly: passive_voice (30, BEYOND_P90), nominalization (35, BEYOND_P90), nouns (205, BEYOND_P90), smog_index (15.1, BEYOND_P90), complex_words_dc (325, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (151, BEYOND_P90), long_words (219, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the draft is overly complex, uses many passive and noun‑heavy constructions, and exceeds typical readability levels for plain‑language summaries."
