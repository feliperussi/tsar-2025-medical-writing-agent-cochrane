  "draft": "What type, amount, or delivery of pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen bladder‑control muscles) works best for women with urinary incontinence (bladder leakage)?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- Direct pelvic floor muscle training (repeated, isolated squeezes of the pelvic floor muscles) gives a small improvement in how urinary incontinence affects daily life compared with indirect training (exercises that do not target the pelvic floor muscles).\n- Coordinated training (body movements combined with pelvic floor squeezes) may add a slight benefit, and doing the exercises on more days each week probably leads to a larger benefit.\n- Supervision, whether individual or group, makes little or no difference, and side effects are rare, mainly coming from devices placed inside the vagina or rectum.\n- The studies were small and had methodological limitations, so our confidence in these findings is limited.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why does it matter?\nUrinary incontinence means losing control over the bladder so that urine leaks unintentionally. In women it often appears as:\n- Stress incontinence – leakage when coughing, sneezing, or exercising;\n- Urgency incontinence – a sudden, strong need to urinate that cannot be delayed;\n- Mixed incontinence – a combination of both.\nThese leaks can be embarrassing, limit daily activities, affect work and social life, and reduce quality of life.\nA common first‑line treatment is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) – exercises that strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and urethra. PFMT usually involves repeated, voluntary squeezes of these muscles (called “direct” PFMT). PFMT can also be delivered in other ways: exercises done alone (indirect), exercises combined with other body movements (co‑ordinated), different frequencies, or with supervision in a clinic, at home, or via digital tools (e‑health). Knowing which variation works best helps women regain control.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare different ways of doing PFMT to see which give the biggest benefit for women with stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. We looked at three types of differences:\n1. Exercise type – direct squeezes versus coordinated training versus indirect training.\n2. Exercise dose – use of resistance devices, strength of contractions, number of days per week, and body position.\n3. Intervention delivery – clinic supervision, home programmes, group versus individual supervision, and e‑health support.\nOur goal was to determine which approaches improve incontinence‑related quality of life and to note any side effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP) up to 27 September 2023, hand‑searched journals and conference proceedings, and checked reference lists of relevant articles. Two reviewers independently screened studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 63 randomised trials involving 4,920 women, mostly aged 45–65 years, who had given birth and mainly experienced stress‑type or stress‑predominant mixed incontinence. Most participants had not received prior incontinence treatment or pelvic surgery.\nAll trials compared direct PFMT with other approaches. The most notable result was that training on more days each week probably leads to a large improvement in quality of life, although the certainty of this evidence is low. Direct PFMT gave a small benefit over indirect training, and coordinated training may add a slight extra benefit. Supervision (individual or group) made little or no difference. Side effects were uncommon and were usually linked to intravaginal or intrarectal devices.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many trials were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies varied in the types of people enrolled and how the interventions were delivered.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to September 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required checks (all sections are present, phrased as questions, factually accurate and under 850 words), but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a patient reader. \n1. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as “direct”, “indirect”, and “co‑ordinated” training are used without a simple definition in the findings section, leaving readers unsure what the interventions actually involve. \n2. **Combined findings in a single bullet** – the second bullet mixes two separate results (co‑ordinated training benefit and frequency benefit), making the message hard to follow. \n3. **Passive constructions** – sentences like “The most notable result was that training on more days each week probably leads to a large improvement…” hide who found the result and add unnecessary complexity. \n4. **Long, dense sentence in Methods** – the sentence describing the search strategy is over‑long and contains many commas, reducing readability. \n5. **Vague phrase “methodological limitations”** – this phrase does not explain why confidence is limited, which may leave readers uncertain.\nThese issues are supported by the metric analysis (22 passive voice instances – P90, 33 nominalisations – beyond P90, 191 nouns – P90, high counts of complex and long words), indicating the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many passive forms. The suggested rewrites below address the most impactful problems.\n\n**Suggested rewrites:**\n- *Original:* “Direct pelvic floor muscle training (repeated, isolated squeezes of the pelvic floor muscles) gives a small improvement … compared with indirect training (exercises that do not target the pelvic floor muscles).”\n  *Rewrite:* “Doing the pelvic floor muscles‑squeeze exercises (called ‘direct’ training) improves daily life a little compared with exercises that do not involve these muscles (called ‘indirect’ training).”\n- *Original:* “Coordinated training (body movements combined with pelvic floor squeezes) may add a slight benefit, and doing the exercises on more days each week probably leads to a larger benefit.”\n  *Rewrite:* “Training that combines body movements with pelvic‑floor squeezes (co‑ordinated training) may give a small extra benefit. Also, exercising on more days each week is likely to produce a much larger improvement.”\n- *Original:* “The most notable result was that training on more days each week probably leads to a large improvement in quality of life for women with urinary incontinence, although the certainty of this evidence is low.”\n  *Rewrite:* “We found that exercising more days each week probably leads to a large improvement in quality of life, although the evidence is uncertain.”\n- *Original:* “We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP) up to 27 September 2023, hand‑searched journals and conference proceedings, and checked reference lists of relevant articles.”\n  *Rewrite:* “We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) up to 27 September 2023. We also hand‑searched journals, conference papers and reference lists.”\n- *Original:* “The studies were small and had methodological limitations, so our confidence in these findings is limited.”\n  *Rewrite:* “The studies were small and some participants may have known which treatment they received, so we have limited confidence in the results.”\nThese changes reduce jargon, split mixed messages, convert passive to active voice, shorten long sentences, and replace vague wording, aligning the summary with the Cochrane plain‑language style guide and improving readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits (647 words) and has good active‑voice count (60, P75) but shows high passive voice (22, P90), excessive nominalisations (33, beyond P90), many nouns (191, P90) and high complex/long‑word counts (complex_words 139, long_words 202, both P90). These metric deviations confirm the editorial observations of noun‑heavy, passive constructions and suggest the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
