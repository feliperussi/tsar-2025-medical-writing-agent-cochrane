  "draft": "What type, amount, or delivery of pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen bladder‑control muscles) works best for women with urinary incontinence (bladder leakage)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Direct pelvic floor muscle training (repeated, isolated squeezes) gives a small‑to‑moderate improvement in daily life. Adding coordinated body movements may give a slight extra benefit. Doing the exercises on more days each week probably leads to a larger benefit.\n- Supervision – whether in a clinic, at home, in a group, or via a mobile app – makes little or no difference to the benefit.\n- About 6 % of women experienced unwanted effects, mainly vaginal discharge, spotting or discomfort from intravaginal or intrarectal devices.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why does it matter?\nUrinary incontinence means losing control over the bladder so that urine leaks unintentionally. In women it often appears as:\n- Stress incontinence – leakage when coughing, sneezing or exercising;\n- Urgency incontinence – a sudden, strong need to urinate that cannot be delayed;\n- Mixed incontinence – a combination of both.\nThese leaks can be embarrassing, limit daily activities, affect work and social life, and lower quality of life.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe compared different ways of doing pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) to see which approaches improve incontinence‑related quality of life the most. We looked at three groups of differences:\n1. Exercise type – direct squeezes, coordinated training (body movements combined with squeezes), or indirect training (exercises that do not involve the pelvic floor);\n2. Exercise dose – use of resistance devices, strength of contractions, number of training days per week, and body position;\n3. Intervention delivery – clinic supervision, home programmes, group versus individual supervision, and digital (e‑health) support.\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Register – which contains CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP – up to 27 September 2023. Two reviewers independently screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.\n\nWhich type of training works best?\nDirect PFMT gave a moderate improvement in quality of life compared with indirect training. Coordinated training may add a small extra benefit. Indirect training alone gave a smaller benefit than direct training.\n\nHow does the amount of training affect outcomes?\nDoing PFMT on more days each week probably leads to a large improvement in quality of life. Evidence for using resistance devices or for doing maximal versus sub‑maximal contractions is very uncertain.\n\nDoes supervision make a difference?\nClinic supervision may give a small benefit, but the evidence is uncertain. Individual versus group supervision shows little or no difference. Delivery via e‑health (a mobile app that lets clinicians communicate with you) may provide a slight benefit.\n\nAre there any side effects?\nAbout 6 % of women reported unwanted effects. Most were vaginal discharge, spotting or discomfort linked to intravaginal or intrarectal training devices.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMost trials were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies varied in participants and delivery methods. These factors reduce our confidence in the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe updated our previous review and included evidence searched up to September 2023.",
