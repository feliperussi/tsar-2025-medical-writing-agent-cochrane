  "draft": "What type, amount, or delivery of pelvic floor muscle training (exercises to strengthen bladder‑control muscles) works best for women with urinary incontinence (bladder leakage)?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- Direct pelvic floor muscle training (repeated, isolated squeezes of the pelvic floor muscles) gives a moderate improvement in how incontinence affects daily life compared with indirect training (exercises that do not target these muscles).\n- Coordinated training (body movements combined with pelvic‑floor squeezes) may add a small extra benefit, and doing the exercises on more days each week probably leads to a large improvement.\n- Supervision – whether one‑to‑one, in a group, or via e‑health – makes little or no difference, and side effects are uncommon, mainly linked to intravaginal or intrarectal devices.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why does it matter?\nUrinary incontinence means losing control over the bladder so that urine leaks unintentionally. In women it often appears as:\n- Stress incontinence – leakage when coughing, sneezing, or exercising;\n- Urgency incontinence – a sudden, strong need to urinate that cannot be delayed;\n- Mixed incontinence – a combination of both.\nThese leaks can be embarrassing, limit daily activities, affect work and social life, and reduce quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare different ways of doing pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) to see which approaches improve incontinence‑related quality of life the most. We looked at three groups of differences:\n1. Exercise type – direct squeezes, coordinated training, or indirect training;\n2. Exercise dose – use of resistance devices, strength of contractions, number of training days per week, and body position;\n3. Intervention delivery – clinic supervision, home programmes, group versus individual supervision, and digital (e‑health) support.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) up to 27 September 2023. We also hand‑searched journals, conference papers and reference lists. Two reviewers independently screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.\n\nWhich type of training works best?\nDirect PFMT gave a moderate improvement in quality of life (standardised mean difference 0.70). Coordinated training may provide a slight extra benefit (SMD ‑0.22). Indirect training alone gave a smaller benefit than direct training.\n\nHow does the amount of training affect outcomes?\nTraining on more days each week probably leads to a large improvement in quality of life (SMD ‑1.60). Evidence for resistance devices or maximal versus sub‑maximal contractions is very uncertain.\n\nDoes supervision make a difference?\nSupervision in a clinic may give a small benefit, but the evidence is very uncertain. Individual versus group supervision shows little or no difference (SMD ‑0.18). E‑health delivery may provide a slight benefit (SMD ‑0.21).\n\nAre there any side effects?\nAbout 6 % of women reported unwanted effects, mainly vaginal discharge, spotting or discomfort linked to intravaginal or intrarectal training devices.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMost trials were small and some participants may have known which treatment they received, which reduces confidence in the results. The studies also varied in participant characteristics and how the interventions were delivered.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to September 2023.",

The source shows that clinic supervision may give a small benefit (uncertain) and e‑health delivery may give a slight benefit, but the draft says \"Supervision – whether one‑to‑one, in a group, or via e‑health – makes little or no difference,\" which over‑generalises and contradicts the source. This factual inaccuracy must be corrected. Additionally, three clarity issues need fixing: (1) unexplained jargon – the term “standardised mean difference (SMD)” appears without explanation; (2) a long, dense sentence about direct PFMT and indirect training; (3) the supervision summary oversimplifies nuanced findings. Suggested rewrites: \n- Original: \"Direct pelvic floor muscle training (repeated, isolated squeezes of the pelvic floor muscles) gives a moderate improvement in how incontinence affects daily life compared with indirect training (exercises that do not target these muscles).\"\n- Rewrite: \"Direct pelvic floor muscle training – repeated, isolated squeezes – leads to a moderate improvement in daily life compared with indirect exercises that do not target these muscles.\"\n- Original: \"Supervision – whether one‑to‑one, in a group, or via e‑health – makes little or no difference, and side effects are uncommon, mainly linked to intravaginal or intrarectal devices.\"\n- Rewrite: \"Supervision in a clinic may give a small benefit, but the evidence is uncertain; individual versus group supervision shows little or no difference, and e‑health delivery may provide a slight benefit. Side effects are uncommon and are mainly linked to intravaginal or intrarectal devices.\"\n- Original: \"Direct PFMT gave a moderate improvement in quality of life (standardised mean difference 0.70).\"\n- Rewrite: \"Direct PFMT gave a moderate improvement in quality of life (the statistical measure called standardised mean difference was 0.70, meaning the average benefit was about 0.7 standard units).\"\nThese changes improve factual accuracy, reduce jargon, and simplify sentence structure, aligning the summary with Cochrane plain‑language standards. Metrics support the need for simplification: the draft has high nominalisation (31), many nouns (171), and elevated SMOG (14) and complex‑word counts, indicating overly technical language that should be reduced.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to most typical patterns (overall high conformity). However, several metrics deviate: nominalisations (31, beyond P90), noun count (171, P90), SMOG index (14, P90), complex words (118, P90) and complex Dale‑Chall words (259, P90) and long words (180, P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex terms, supporting the recommendation to replace nominalisations with verbs, reduce long/complex words, and simplify language for patients."
