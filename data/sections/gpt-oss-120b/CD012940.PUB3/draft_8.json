  "draft": "Is giving back (re‑feeding) the suctioned stomach milk better than discarding it for helping premature babies grow?\n\nKey messages\n- The only small study we found does not show a clear advantage of re‑feeding (giving back) the suctioned stomach milk (gastric residuals) compared with discarding it for helping premature babies grow, and it does not show a clear increase in serious problems such as gut infection (necrotising enterocolitis, NEC) or death.\n- Other outcomes such as how quickly babies reach full feeds, how long they need intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition, IV nutrition), and weight gain at discharge also showed no obvious difference, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Because the findings come from a single small trial, we need larger, better‑designed studies to know whether re‑feeding is truly helpful or harmful.\n\nWhy is feeding management important for preterm babies?\nBabies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (preterm infants) often cannot feed well on their own because their stomachs and digestive systems are immature. In neonatal intensive care units, nurses check the amount of milk that returns from the baby’s stomach after a tube feed – this is called a gastric residual. Some units put the residual back into the tube (re‑feeding) while others throw it away (discarding). Re‑feeding might help digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones and growth‑promoting substances. However, it could also increase the risk of vomiting, a serious bowel infection called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), or a bloodstream infection (sepsis).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether re‑feeding gastric residuals is more effective or safer than discarding them for preterm infants. We looked at several outcomes:\n- time to regain birth weight\n- risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation\n- death before discharge\n- time to reach full tube feeds\n- number of days on IV nutrition\n- risk of being under‑weight at discharge\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Two reviewers screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined the results where possible and judged how confident we are in the evidence using a standard method called the GRADE approach (which rates the quality of evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one small randomised trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants. The staff knew which babies received re‑feeding because the trial was not blinded, but the researchers otherwise followed good methods. The trial found no clear difference for any of these outcomes:\n- time to regain birth weight\n- risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation\n- death before discharge\n- time to reach full feeds\n- number of days on IV nutrition\n- risk of being under‑weight at discharge\nThe evidence is uncertain, so we cannot be sure of any benefit or harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the trial was small and participants and staff knew which treatment was given. The study also gave limited details about the infants’ characteristics and follow‑up.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe last ran the searches in February 2022, so the evidence includes studies published up to that date.",
