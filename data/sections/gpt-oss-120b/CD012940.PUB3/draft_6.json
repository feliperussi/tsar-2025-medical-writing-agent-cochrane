  "draft": "Is giving back (re‑feeding) the suctioned stomach milk better than discarding it for helping premature babies grow?\n\nKey messages\n- The only small study we found does not show a clear benefit of re‑feeding gastric residuals (the milk that comes back up from a tube feed) compared with discarding them, and it does not show a clear increase in serious problems such as gut infection (necrotising enterocolitis, NEC) or death.\n- Other outcomes – how quickly babies reach full feeds, how long they need intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition, IV nutrition), and weight gain at discharge – also showed no obvious difference, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Because the findings come from a single small trial, we need larger, better‑designed studies to know whether re‑feeding is truly helpful or harmful.\n\nWhy is feeding management important for preterm babies?\nBabies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (preterm infants) often cannot feed well on their own because their stomachs and digestive systems are immature. In neonatal intensive care units, nurses check the amount of milk that returns from the baby’s stomach after a tube feed – this is called a gastric residual. Some units put the residual back into the tube (re‑feeding) while others throw it away (discarding). Re‑feeding might help digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones and growth‑promoting substances. However, it could also increase the risk of vomiting, a serious bowel infection called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), or a bloodstream infection (sepsis, a serious blood infection).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether re‑feeding gastric residuals is more effective or safer than discarding them for preterm infants. We looked for evidence on outcomes such as how quickly babies regain their birth weight, the risk of NEC or intestinal perforation, survival before hospital discharge, the time needed to reach full tube feeds, the number of days on IV nutrition, and whether babies are under‑weight at discharge.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Two reviewers screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one small randomised trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants. The researchers did not mask participants, but they used otherwise good methodological quality. The trial suggests that re‑feeding probably makes little or no difference to several important outcomes. These include the time it takes to regain birth weight, the risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation, death before discharge, the time needed to reach full tube feeds, the number of days infants receive IV nutrition, and whether infants are under‑weight at discharge. The evidence is uncertain, so we cannot be sure of any benefit or harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the trial was small and participants and staff knew which treatment was given. The study also gave limited details about the infants’ characteristics and follow‑up.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe last ran the searches in February 2022, so the evidence includes studies published up to that date.",

Readers may not understand that this means the trial was not blinded. *Rewrite*: \"The trial was not blinded, meaning staff knew which babies received re‑feeding.\"\n2. **Overly long, dense sentence** – \"These include the time it takes to regain birth weight, the risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation, death before discharge, the time needed to reach full tube feeds, the number of days infants receive IV nutrition, and whether infants are under‑weight at discharge.\" This 38‑word sentence lists many outcomes and can overwhelm the reader. *Rewrite*: \"The outcomes we looked at were:\\n   - time to regain birth weight,\\n   - risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation,\\n   - death before discharge,\\n   - time to reach full tube feeds,\\n   - number of days on IV nutrition,\\n   - whether the baby was under‑weight at discharge.\"\n3. **Wordy phrasing and nominalisation** – \"The trial suggests that re‑feeding probably makes little or no difference to several important outcomes.\" The phrase is vague and uses the noun‑heavy construction *makes little or no difference*. *Rewrite*: \"The trial suggests re‑feeding makes little or no difference to the outcomes we measured.\"\nThese issues are reflected in the metric analysis: the draft has a high nominalisation count (25, beyond the typical range) and many complex words (116 complex words, 227 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words), indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and difficult than typical PLSs. Reducing nominalisations and simplifying vocabulary will improve readability for patients. Overall, while the content is accurate and complete, the identified clarity problems must be addressed before the summary can be approved.",

These indicate the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
