  "draft": "Is giving back (re‑feeding) the suctioned stomach milk better than discarding it for helping premature babies grow?\n\nKey messages\n- The single small study we found does not show a clear benefit of re‑feeding gastric residuals over discarding them for growth or for preventing serious gut infection (necrotising enterocolitis, NEC) or death.\n- Other outcomes such as speed of reaching full feeds, days of intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition), and weight gain at discharge also showed no obvious difference, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Because the evidence comes from one small trial, we need larger, well‑designed studies to determine whether re‑feeding is truly helpful or harmful.\n\nWhy is feeding management important for preterm babies?\nBabies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (preterm infants) often cannot feed well on their own because their stomachs and digestive systems are immature. In neonatal intensive care units, nurses check the amount of milk that comes back up after a tube feed – this is called a gastric residual. Some units put the residual back into the tube (re‑feeding) while others throw it away (discarding). Re‑feeding might help digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones and growth‑promoting substances, but it could also increase the risk of vomiting, a serious bowel infection called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), or bloodstream infection (sepsis).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe aimed to see whether re‑feeding gastric residuals is more effective or safer than discarding them for preterm infants. We looked for evidence on outcomes such as how quickly babies regain their birth weight, the risk of NEC or intestinal perforation, survival before hospital discharge, time to reach full tube feeding, days of intravenous nutrition, and growth at discharge.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Two reviewers screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one small randomised trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants. The trial was unmasked but otherwise of good methodological quality. The infants received either re‑feeding of aspirated gastric residuals or discarding of those residuals. The authors reported that re‑feeding probably makes little or no difference to important outcomes: time to regain birth weight, risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation, death before discharge, time to reach full enteral feeds, days of intravenous nutrition, and risk of being under‑weight at discharge. The evidence is uncertain, so we cannot be sure of any benefit or harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the trial was small and participants and staff knew which treatment was given. The study also provided limited details about the infants’ characteristics and follow‑up.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe searches were last run in February 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required completeness, formatting, factual accuracy, and word‑count checks, but it contains three clarity problems that are likely to confuse a lay audience. 1) The term “unmasked” is used without explanation, leaving readers unsure what it means. 2) A very long sentence lists many outcomes, making it hard to follow. 3) The currency statement is written in passive voice, which obscures who performed the search. These issues reduce readability and should be corrected.\n\n**Suggested improvements:**\n1. **Problematic phrase:** “The trial was unmasked but otherwise of good methodological quality.”\n   **Why it’s an issue:** “Unmasked” is technical jargon for a study where participants and staff know the assigned treatment; readers may not understand this.\n   **Rewrite:** “The trial was open‑label (participants and staff knew which treatment was given) but otherwise of good methodological quality.”\n\n2. **Problematic sentence:** “The authors reported that re‑feeding probably makes little or no difference to important outcomes: time to regain birth weight, risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation, death before discharge, time to reach full enteral feeds, days of intravenous nutrition, and risk of being under‑weight at discharge.”\n   **Why it’s an issue:** The sentence is over 30 words and packs many items, making it difficult for readers to process.\n   **Rewrite:** “The authors reported that re‑feeding probably makes little or no difference to several important outcomes. These include the time it takes to regain birth weight, the risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation, death before discharge, the time needed to reach full tube feeds, the number of days on intravenous nutrition, and the risk of being under‑weight at discharge.”\n\n3. **Problematic sentence:** “The searches were last run in February 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.”\n   **Why it’s an issue:** Passive voice hides who performed the searches, reducing clarity.\n   **Rewrite:** “We last ran the searches in February 2022, so the evidence includes studies published up to that date.”\n\nThese revisions address the identified clarity issues while preserving the factual content.\n\n**Metrics support:** The evaluation shows high nominalisation (24, beyond typical PLS range) and many complex words (122) and Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (222), indicating the draft is more noun‑heavy and uses technical vocabulary than typical PLS texts. Reducing nominalisations and simplifying language, as suggested above, will bring the draft closer to the usual PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and scores well on readability indices (Flesch‑Reading Ease 50.9, Grade 11.3). However, it deviates in three key metrics: nominalisation (24, beyond typical PLS range), complex words (122) and Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (222), all higher than the median. These suggest the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more technical vocabulary than usual, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
