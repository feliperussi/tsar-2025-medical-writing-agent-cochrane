  "draft": "Is giving back (re‑feeding) the suctioned stomach milk better than discarding it for helping premature babies grow?\n\nKey messages\n- The only small study we found does not show a clear advantage of re‑feeding (giving back) the suctioned stomach milk (gastric residuals) compared with discarding it for helping premature babies grow, and it does not show a clear increase in serious problems such as gut infection (necrotising enterocolitis, NEC) or death.\n- Other outcomes – how quickly babies reach full feeds, how long they need intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition, IV nutrition), and weight gain at discharge – also showed no obvious difference, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Because the findings come from a single small trial, we need larger, better‑designed studies to know whether re‑feeding is truly helpful or harmful.\n\nWhy is feeding management important for preterm babies?\nBabies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (preterm infants) often cannot feed well on their own because their stomachs and digestive systems are immature. In neonatal intensive care units, nurses check the amount of milk that returns from the baby’s stomach after a tube feed – this is called a gastric residual. Some units put the residual back into the tube (re‑feeding) while others throw it away (discarding). Re‑feeding might help digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones and growth‑promoting substances. However, it could also increase the risk of vomiting, a serious bowel infection called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), or a bloodstream infection (sepsis).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether re‑feeding gastric residuals is more effective or safer than discarding them for preterm infants. The outcomes we looked at were:\n- time to regain birth weight,\n- risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation,\n- death before discharge,\n- time to reach full tube feeds,\n- number of days on IV nutrition,\n- whether the baby was under‑weight at discharge.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Two reviewers screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one small randomised trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants. The trial was not blinded, meaning staff knew which babies received re‑feeding, but otherwise the methods were good. The trial suggests re‑feeding makes little or no difference to the outcomes we measured. This includes time to regain birth weight, risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation, death before discharge, time to reach full tube feeds, number of days on IV nutrition, and risk of being under‑weight at discharge. The evidence is uncertain, so we cannot be sure of any benefit or harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the trial was small and participants and staff knew which treatment was given. The study also gave limited details about the infants’ characteristics and follow‑up.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe last ran the searches in February 2022, so the evidence includes studies published up to that date.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft passes the mandatory completeness, title/subheading, factual accuracy and word‑count checks, but three significant clarity problems remain that could confuse a lay reader. 1) A long, dense sentence in the Results section exceeds 30 words and bundles many outcomes together, making it hard to follow. 2) The term “GRADE approach” is introduced without any explanation, leaving readers unsure what it means. 3) The text contains a high level of nominalisation (23 instances, beyond the typical P90 range) and many complex, unfamiliar words (227 Dale‑Chall complex words, also beyond P90), which reduces readability. These issues need concrete rewrites before the summary can be approved.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Quote: \"This includes time to regain birth weight, risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation, death before discharge, time to reach full tube feeds, number of days on IV nutrition, and risk of being under‑weight at discharge.\" Why problematic: The sentence is 33 words long and the list is packed into a single clause, overwhelming the reader. Suggested rewrite: \"The trial found no clear difference for any of these outcomes: • time to regain birth weight; • risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation; • death before discharge; • time to reach full feeds; • number of days on IV nutrition; • risk of being under‑weight at discharge.\"\n2. Quote: \"We combined results where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\" Why problematic: “GRADE approach” is a technical term that is not explained, so readers do not know what it means. Suggested rewrite: \"We combined the results where possible and judged how confident we are in the evidence using a standard method called the GRADE approach (which rates the quality of evidence).\"\n3. Quote: \"The trial was not blinded, meaning staff knew which babies received re‑feeding, but otherwise the methods were good.\" Why problematic: Uses nominalised language (“blinded”, “methods”) and a passive‑style construction that can be clearer. Suggested rewrite: \"The staff knew which babies received re‑feeding because the trial was not blinded, but the researchers otherwise followed good methods.\"\n\nSupporting evidence: The PLS evaluation shows a nominalisation count of 23 (P90, well above the typical median of ≤13) and a Dale‑Chall complex‑word count of 227 (P90, far above the typical median of ≤160). These metrics confirm the draft contains more noun‑heavy and difficult vocabulary than usual, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms to most typical PLS patterns (overall high conformity), with good readability scores (Flesch‑Reading Ease 56.7, FKGL 10.8). However, two metrics deviate: nominalisations (23, P90) and Dale‑Chall complex words (227, P90), indicating excess noun‑heavy and difficult wording that should be reduced for better lay‑readability."
