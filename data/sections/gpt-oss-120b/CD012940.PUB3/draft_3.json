  "draft": "Is giving back (re‑feeding) the suctioned stomach milk better than discarding it for helping premature babies grow?\n\nKey messages\n- The single small study we found does not show a clear advantage of re‑feeding (giving back) gastric residuals over discarding them for growth, serious gut infection (necrotising enterocolitis, NEC) or death.\n- Other outcomes such as speed of reaching full feeds, length of intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition) and weight gain at discharge also showed no obvious difference, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Because the findings come from one small trial, larger and better‑designed studies are needed to determine whether re‑feeding is truly helpful or harmful.\n\nWhy is feeding management important for preterm babies?\nBabies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (preterm infants) often need help getting nutrition because their stomachs and digestive systems are immature. In neonatal intensive care units, nurses check the amount of milk that comes back up after a tube feed – this is called a gastric residual. Some units put the residual back into the tube (re‑feeding) while others throw it away (discarding). Re‑feeding might help digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones and growth‑promoting substances, but it could also increase the risk of vomiting, a serious bowel infection called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), or a bloodstream infection (sepsis).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to see whether re‑feeding gastric residuals is more effective or safer than discarding them for preterm infants. We looked for evidence on outcomes such as how quickly babies regain their birth weight, the risk of NEC or intestinal perforation, survival before hospital discharge, the time needed to reach full tube feeds, the number of days on intravenous nutrition, and growth at discharge.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Two reviewers screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one small randomised trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants. The trial was open‑label (participants and staff knew which treatment was given) but otherwise of good methodological quality. The authors reported that re‑feeding probably makes little or no difference to several important outcomes. These include the time it takes to regain birth weight, the risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation, death before discharge, the time needed to reach full tube feeds, the number of days on intravenous nutrition, and the risk of being under‑weight at discharge. The evidence is uncertain, so we cannot be sure of any benefit or harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the trial was small and participants and staff were aware of the treatment they received. The study also gave limited details about the infants’ characteristics and follow‑up.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe last ran the searches in February 2022, so the evidence includes studies published up to that date.",

  "evaluation": [
    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails to meet plain-language clarity standards despite passing structural checks. Key problems: (1) The title uses the vague phrase “suctioned stomach milk”; readers may not understand what is being re-fed. (2) Technical terms such as “parenteral nutrition” and “intravenous nutrition” are introduced together, creating confusion; a single simple term should be used. (3) The outcome “risk of being under-weight at discharge” is unclear – the common term “extrauterine growth restriction” should be explained or replaced with plain language. (4) Several sentences are long and dense (e.g., the methods sentence with 27 words and the results paragraph listing many outcomes), making them hard to follow; they should be split into shorter sentences. (5) The draft contains a high level of nominalisation and complex words (nominalisation = 25, complex_words = 116, complex_words_dc = 222), which exceeds typical PLS ranges and reduces readability. Reducing noun-heavy phrasing and replacing multi-syllable words with simpler alternatives will improve the reading ease. Suggested rewrites: - Title: “Is giving back the milk that is suctioned from a preterm baby’s stomach better for their growth?” - Replace “intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition)” and instead say “IV nutrition (also called parenteral nutrition)”. - Rephrase outcome: “risk of extrauterine growth restriction (being under-weight) at discharge”. - Split methods sentence: “We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers for randomised trials that compared re-feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants.” → “We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers. We looked for randomised trials that compared re-feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants.” - Reduce nominalisations: change “The evidence is uncertain” to “We are uncertain about the evidence”. These changes address the most confusing elements and bring the draft in line with the Master Style Guide and typical PLS readability patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS shows good overall conformity (55.6% best-quartile features). However, three metrics deviate markedly: nominalisation (25, beyond P90), complex_words_dc (222, beyond P90) and complex_words (116, beyond P90). These indicate excessive noun-heavy and multi-syllable terms, supporting the need to simplify language as outlined above."
