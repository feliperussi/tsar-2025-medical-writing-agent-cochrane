  "key_messages": [
    "The limited evidence from one small study does not show a clear advantage of re‑feeding (giving back) the suctioned stomach milk (gastric residuals) compared with discarding it for helping premature babies (preterm infants) grow, and it does not show a clear increase in serious problems such as gut infection (necrotising enterocolitis) or death.",
    "Other outcomes such as the speed of reaching full feeds, the length of intravenous nutrition, and weight gain at hospital discharge also showed no obvious difference, but the evidence is uncertain.",
    "Because the findings come from a single small trial, larger and better‑designed studies are needed to determine whether re‑feeding gastric residuals is truly beneficial or harmful for preterm infants."

      "subheading": "Why is feeding management important for preterm babies?",
      "content": "Babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (preterm infants) often need help getting nutrition because their stomachs and digestive systems are not fully developed. In neonatal intensive care units, nurses usually check the amount of milk that comes back up from the baby's stomach after a tube feed – this is called a \"gastric residual.\" The practice is meant to guide how quickly and how much milk can be given. However, there is no agreement on what to do with the milk that is aspirated: some units put it back into the tube (re‑feeding) while others throw it away (discarding). Re‑feeding might help digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones and growth‑promoting substances, but it could also increase the risk of problems such as vomiting, a serious bowel infection called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), or bloodstream infection (sepsis)."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review aimed to determine whether re‑feeding gastric residuals is more effective or safer than discarding them for preterm infants. Specifically, the authors looked for evidence on outcomes such as how quickly babies regain their birth weight, the risk of NEC or intestinal perforation, overall survival before leaving the hospital, the time needed to reach full tube feeding, the number of days on intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition), and growth at discharge."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found a single small randomised trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants. The study was unmasked and of generally good methodological quality, but the abstract gave no details about where it was done, how long the infants were followed, or who funded the research. The infants were simply described as preterm, with no further information about gestational age, birth weight, gender or illness severity. The intervention was to re‑feed aspirated gastric residuals, while the comparison group had those residuals discarded. The trial suggests that re‑feeding the residuals probably makes little or no difference to important outcomes such as the time it takes infants to regain their birth weight, the risk of severe necrotising enterocolitis or intestinal perforation, the chance of dying before discharge, the time needed to reach full enteral feeding, the number of days infants need intravenous nutrition, the risk of being under‑weight at discharge, and how often feeding is interrupted for long periods. However, the evidence is uncertain, so we cannot be sure of any benefit or harm."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
