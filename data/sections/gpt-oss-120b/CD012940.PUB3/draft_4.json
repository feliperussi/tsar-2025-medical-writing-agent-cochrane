  "draft": "Is giving back the milk that is suctioned from a preterm baby’s stomach better for their growth?\n\nKey messages\n- One small study does not show a clear benefit of re‑feeding (giving back) the suctioned stomach milk compared with discarding it for growth, serious gut infection (necrotising enterocolitis, NEC) or death.\n- Other outcomes such as how fast babies reach full feeds, the length of IV nutrition (also called parenteral nutrition) and weight gain at discharge also showed no obvious difference, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Because the findings come from a single small trial, larger and better‑designed studies are needed to determine whether re‑feeding is truly helpful or harmful.\n\nWhy is feeding management important for preterm babies?\nBabies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (preterm infants) often need help getting nutrition because their stomachs and digestive systems are not fully developed. In neonatal intensive care units, nurses check the amount of milk that comes back up from the baby’s stomach after a tube feed – this is called a gastric residual. Some units put the residual back into the tube (re‑feeding) while others throw it away (discarding). Re‑feeding might help digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones and growth‑promoting substances. However, it could also increase the risk of vomiting, a serious bowel infection called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), or a bloodstream infection (sepsis).\n\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to see whether re‑feeding gastric residuals is more effective or safer than discarding them for preterm infants. We looked for evidence on outcomes such as how quickly babies regain their birth weight, the risk of NEC or intestinal perforation, survival before hospital discharge, the time needed to reach full tube feeds, the number of days on IV nutrition (also called parenteral nutrition), and the risk of extrauterine growth restriction (being under‑weight) at discharge.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers. We looked for randomised controlled trials that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Two reviewers screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one small randomised trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants. The trial was open‑label (participants and staff knew which treatment was given) but otherwise of good methodological quality. The authors reported that re‑feeding probably makes little or no difference to several important outcomes. These outcomes include the time it takes to regain birth weight, the risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation, death before discharge, the time needed to reach full tube feeds, the number of days on IV nutrition, and the risk of extrauterine growth restriction at discharge. We are uncertain about the evidence, so we cannot be sure of any benefit or harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the trial was small and participants and staff were aware of the treatment they received. The study also gave limited details about the infants’ characteristics and follow‑up.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe last ran the searches in February 2022, so the evidence includes studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because one subheading is not phrased as a question. The heading \"Why is feeding management important for preterm babies?\" is a statement, whereas the Master Style Guide requires all subheadings to be questions. This alone prevents approval. In addition, the draft contains several clarity and style issues that would confuse readers:\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Why is feeding management important for preterm babies?\" should be re‑phrased as a question.\n2. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as “parenteral nutrition” and “extrauterine growth restriction” appear without simple definitions, which can leave lay readers puzzled.\n3. **Long, dense sentence** – \"In neonatal intensive care units, nurses check the amount of milk that comes back up from the baby’s stomach after a tube feed – this is called a gastric residual.\" (30+ words) is borderline and could be split for easier reading.\n4. **High nominalisation** – the draft uses many noun‑heavy phrases (e.g., “the number of days on IV nutrition”, “the risk of extrauterine growth restriction”) that could be expressed with more verbs to improve flow.\n5. **Passive voice** – while the overall passive count is within typical range, a few passive constructions (e.g., \"The trial was open‑label…\") could be rewritten in active voice for consistency with the style guide.\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Change subheading to: \"Why is feeding management important for preterm babies?\" (add a question mark).\n- Define jargon: \"parenteral nutrition (IV nutrition that provides nutrients through a vein)\" and \"extrauterine growth restriction (being under‑weight at hospital discharge)\".\n- Split long sentence: \"In neonatal intensive care units, nurses check the amount of milk that comes back up from the baby’s stomach after a tube feed. This is called a gastric residual.\"\n- Reduce nominalisation: replace \"the number of days on IV nutrition\" with \"how many days the baby receives IV nutrition\"; replace \"the risk of extrauterine growth restriction\" with \"whether the baby is under‑weight at discharge\".\n- Convert passive to active: \"The trial was open‑label…\" → \"The researchers conducted an open‑label trial…\".\nThese changes will bring the draft into full compliance with the Master Style Guide and improve readability for patients.\nMetrics support these observations: the evaluation shows a high nominalisation count (28, beyond the typical range) and elevated complex‑word counts (complex_words_dc = 234, complex_words = 118), indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words than typical PLSs. Reducing nominalisations and simplifying vocabulary will lower these metrics toward the median and enhance clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall (66.7% of features in best quartile), but three metrics deviate significantly: nominalisation (28, BEYOND_P90), complex_words_dc (234, P90) and complex_words (118, P90). These indicate excessive noun‑heavy language and difficult words, suggesting the need to simplify wording and use more verbs. Reducing nominalisation and complex vocabulary will improve readability and bring the draft into compliance."
