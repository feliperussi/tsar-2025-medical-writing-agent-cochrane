  "draft": "Is giving back (re‑feeding) the suctioned stomach milk better than discarding it for helping premature babies grow?\n\nKey messages\n- The limited evidence from one small study does not show a clear advantage of re‑feeding (giving back) the suctioned stomach milk (gastric residuals) compared with discarding it for helping premature babies grow, and it does not show a clear increase in serious problems such as gut infection (necrotising enterocolitis) or death.\n- Other outcomes such as the speed of reaching full feeds, the length of intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition – IV nutrition that provides nutrients through a vein), and weight gain at hospital discharge also showed no obvious difference, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- Because the findings come from a single small trial, larger and better‑designed studies are needed to determine whether re‑feeding gastric residuals is truly beneficial or harmful for preterm infants.\n\nWhy is feeding management important for preterm babies?\nBabies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (preterm infants) often need help getting nutrition because their stomachs and digestive systems are not fully developed. In neonatal intensive care units, nurses check the amount of milk that comes back up from the baby’s stomach after a tube feed. This is called a gastric residual. Some units put the residual back into the tube (re‑feeding) while others throw it away (discarding). Re‑feeding might help digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones and growth‑promoting substances. However, it could also increase the risk of vomiting, a serious bowel infection called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), or a bloodstream infection (sepsis).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to see whether re‑feeding gastric residuals is more effective or safer than discarding them for preterm infants. We looked for evidence on outcomes such as how quickly babies regain their birth weight, the risk of NEC or intestinal perforation, survival before hospital discharge, the time needed to reach full tube feeds, how many days the baby receives IV nutrition, and whether the baby is under‑weight at discharge.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Two reviewers screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one small randomised trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants. The researchers conducted an open‑label trial (participants and staff knew which treatment was given) but otherwise used good methods. The trial suggests that re‑feeding probably makes little or no difference to several important outcomes: time to regain birth weight, risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation, death before discharge, time to reach full tube feeds, how many days the baby receives IV nutrition, and whether the baby is under‑weight at discharge. The evidence is uncertain, so we cannot be sure of any benefit or harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the trial was small and participants and staff were aware of the treatment. The study also gave limited details about the infants’ characteristics and follow‑up.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe last ran the searches in February 2022, so the evidence includes studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because several statements are likely to confuse a lay reader. Key problems:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – the term “sepsis” appears without any definition. Readers may not know it means a serious blood infection. *Rewrite*: “or a bloodstream infection (sepsis, a serious blood infection).”\n2. **Overly long sentence** – “The trial suggests that re‑feeding probably makes little or no difference to several important outcomes: time to regain birth weight, risk of severe NEC or intestinal perforation, death before discharge, time to reach full tube feeds, how many days the baby receives IV nutrition, and whether the baby is under‑weight at discharge.” This sentence exceeds 30 words and packs many ideas, making it hard to follow. *Rewrite*: “The trial suggests that re‑feeding probably makes little or no difference to several important outcomes. These include the time it takes to regain birth weight, the risk of severe necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) or intestinal perforation, death before discharge, the time needed to reach full tube feeds, the number of days the baby receives IV nutrition, and whether the baby is under‑weight at discharge.”\n3. **Passive voice** – “The trial was unmasked but was otherwise of good methodological quality.” Passive constructions hide who performed the action. *Rewrite*: “The researchers did not mask participants, but they used otherwise good methodological quality.”\n4. **Nominalisations and noun‑heavy phrasing** – phrases such as “the length of intravenous nutrition” and “the speed of reaching full feeds” use abstract nouns instead of clear verbs, increasing reading difficulty. *Rewrite*: “how long IV nutrition lasted” and “how quickly full feeds were reached.”\nThese issues reduce readability despite the draft’s overall good metric scores. Addressing them will bring the summary in line with Cochrane plain‑language standards.\n\n**Metric support**: The PLS evaluation shows high counts of nominalisations (27, above the typical median of 13), nouns (159 vs median 116), complex words (126 vs median 84), and long words (175 vs median 122). These numbers explain the dense, noun‑heavy style observed. Passive voice instances (14) are also at the upper end of the typical range, matching the identified passive constructions.\n\n**Overall**: Because of the identified clarity problems, the draft cannot be approved in its current form.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on overall conformity (good overall pattern) but deviates on several key metrics: nominalisation (27, P90), nouns (159, P90), complex words (126, P90), and long words (175, P90) are all above typical PLS ranges, indicating a noun‑heavy, complex style. Passive voice (14, P75) is also relatively high. These metric deviations align with the editorial observations of excessive nominalisation, long sentences, and passive constructions. These issues collectively lower the clarity of the plain‑language summary."
