  "draft": "Do self‑management programs (teaching people to manage their vision loss) improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Self‑management programs (programs that teach people to manage their vision loss) appear to have little or no effect on overall health‑related quality of life (overall wellbeing related to health) or vision‑related quality of life (wellbeing related specifically to vision) for adults with visual impairment, and they do not seem to increase the risk of adverse events (unwanted side effects). The evidence is limited and uncertain.\n- The available studies mainly involved older adults with age‑related macular degeneration, and no research was found on people with combined hearing and vision loss (dual‑sensory impairment).\n- Future research should use more sensitive quality‑of‑life measures, include a broader range of participants and longer follow‑up periods, to clarify whether self‑management programs can provide real benefits.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is visual impairment a health concern and what help is usually offered?\nSeeing problems in everyday life – like reading, recognizing faces, or moving around safely – become harder for many adults because of eye diseases that reduce vision. This condition, called visual impairment, affects millions of people worldwide and can lead to loss of independence, lower mood, and a decline in overall well‑being. Typical support includes giving people glasses, magnifiers, or other optical aids, and providing low‑vision rehabilitation – specialised training and devices that help people continue daily activities despite reduced sight. In recent years, programmes called self‑management interventions have been developed. These are structured activities that teach people skills to manage their own condition, stay active in daily tasks, and improve their overall quality of life.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether these self‑management programmes actually make a difference for adults with visual impairment. Specifically, they compared people who took part in such programmes with those who received usual care or were placed on a waiting list, looking at two main outcomes: \n\n* Health‑related quality of life (HRQoL) – a broad measure of how a person feels about their overall health and daily functioning.\n* Vision‑related quality of life (VRQoL) – a more specific measure of how vision problems affect everyday activities and emotional well‑being.\n\nThe review set out to assess if self‑management interventions improve these quality‑of‑life scores, and whether they cause any unwanted side effects.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that evaluated self‑management programmes for adults with visual impairment compared with usual care or no treatment, combined their results (meta‑analysis or narrative summary) and rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE.\n\n**Results**\nWe identified 20 parallel‑group randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 3,151 adults with acquired visual impairment. The participants were older (average ages between 60 and 84 years) and most had age‑related macular degeneration as the cause of their low vision. The trials were conducted in 2 Asian, 2 Australian, 6 European and 10 North‑American centres, including academic medical centres, hospitals, low‑vision clinics, private practices, rehabilitation facilities and Veterans Affairs sites. One study received industry funding; the others were supported by research grants or non‑profit organisations. All trials tested multifaceted self‑management programmes of varying content, comparing them with wait‑list controls or active controls such as usual care, optical aids or low‑vision rehabilitation. Follow‑up data were reported for short‑term and longer‑term periods (approximately 6–24 months). No eligible trials enrolled adults with dual‑sensory impairment.\n\nThe evidence suggests that self‑management programmes for adults with visual impairment probably make little or no difference to overall health‑related quality of life, to vision‑related quality of life, and to the risk of adverse events.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failed: subheadings are not phrased as questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide (5.3 Structure). The draft uses generic headings such as \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", and \"Currency\" instead of question‑style headings (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\", \"What did we aim to find out?\", \"How did we conduct the review?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is the evidence?\"). This prevents the reader from quickly locating information and does not follow the required format.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Replace each heading with a question. Example rewrite: \"What are the key messages?\" instead of \"Key messages\".\n2. **Passive voice** – The draft contains 27 passive constructions (e.g., \"The evidence suggests that self‑management programmes for adults with visual impairment probably make little or no difference…\"). Rewrite actively: \"We found that self‑management programmes probably make little or no difference…\". Reducing passive voice will improve clarity (metrics show passive_voice = 27, well beyond typical range).\n3. **Nominalisation and noun‑heavy sentences** – Sentences like \"The evidence suggests that self‑management programmes for adults with visual impairment probably make little or no difference to overall health‑related quality of life, to vision‑related quality of life, and to the risk of adverse events.\" can be simplified: \"We think self‑management programmes probably do not improve overall health‑related or vision‑related quality of life and do not change the risk of side effects.\" This cuts down nominalisations (39) and noun count (215).\n4. **Long sentences** – Some sentences exceed 30 words, e.g., \"Seeing problems in everyday life – like reading, recognizing faces, or moving around safely – become harder for many adults because of eye diseases that reduce vision.\" Rewrite to two shorter sentences: \"Seeing problems in everyday life – such as reading, recognizing faces, or moving around safely – become harder for many adults. This is because eye diseases reduce vision.\"\n5. **Jargon without definition** – Terms like \"HRQoL\" and \"VRQoL\" appear without explanation. Provide plain language definitions when first used: \"health‑related quality of life (HRQoL) – how a person feels about their overall health and daily functioning\".\n\nSupporting evidence: The PLS evaluation shows high passive_voice (27, BEYOND_P90), nominalisation (39, BEYOND_P90), nouns (215, BEYOND_P90), smog_index (14.7, P90), and many complex/long words, indicating the draft is more noun‑ and jargon‑heavy than typical PLS texts. Addressing these issues will bring the summary into the typical percentile ranges and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns: passive voice (27, BEYOND_P90), nominalisation (39, BEYOND_P90), noun count (215, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (14.7, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.7, BEYOND_P90), and high‑complexity word counts (complex_words 160, long_words 205) are all well beyond the median ranges, indicating a need to simplify language, reduce passive constructions, and lower lexical complexity."
