  "key_messages": [
    "Self‑management programs (programs that teach people to manage their vision loss) appear to have little or no effect on overall health‑related quality of life (overall wellbeing related to health) or vision‑related quality of life (wellbeing related specifically to vision) for adults with visual impairment, and they do not seem to increase the risk of adverse events (unwanted side effects). The evidence is limited and uncertain.",
    "The available studies mainly involved older adults with age‑related macular degeneration, and no research was found on people with combined hearing and vision loss (dual‑sensory impairment).",
    "Future research should use more sensitive quality‑of‑life measures, include a broader range of participants and longer follow‑up periods, to clarify whether self‑management programs can provide real benefits."

      "subheading": "Why is visual impairment a health concern and what help is usually offered?",
      "content": "Seeing problems in everyday life – like reading, recognizing faces, or moving around safely – become harder for many adults because of eye diseases that reduce vision. This condition, called visual impairment, affects millions of people worldwide and can lead to loss of independence, lower mood, and a decline in overall well‑being. Typical support includes giving people glasses, magnifiers, or other optical aids, and providing low‑vision rehabilitation – specialised training and devices that help people continue daily activities despite reduced sight. In recent years, programmes called self‑management interventions have been developed. These are structured activities that teach people skills to manage their own condition, stay active in daily tasks, and improve their overall quality of life."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether these self‑management programmes actually make a difference for adults with visual impairment. Specifically, they compared people who took part in such programmes with those who received usual care or were placed on a waiting list, looking at two main outcomes: \n\n* Health‑related quality of life (HRQoL) – a broad measure of how a person feels about their overall health and daily functioning.\n* Vision‑related quality of life (VRQoL) – a more specific measure of how vision problems affect everyday activities and emotional well‑being.\n\nThe review set out to assess if self‑management interventions improve these quality‑of‑life scores, and whether they cause any unwanted side effects."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 20 parallel‑group randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 3,151 adults with acquired visual impairment. The participants were older (average ages between 60 and 84 years) and most had age‑related macular degeneration as the cause of their low vision. The trials were conducted in 2 Asian, 2 Australian, 6 European and 10 North‑American centres, including academic medical centres, hospitals, low‑vision clinics, private practices, rehabilitation facilities and Veterans Affairs sites. One study received industry funding; the others were supported by research grants or non‑profit organisations. All trials tested multifaceted self‑management programmes of varying content, comparing them with wait‑list controls or active controls such as usual care, optical aids or low‑vision rehabilitation. Follow‑up data were reported for short‑term and longer‑term periods (approximately 6–24 months). No eligible trials enrolled adults with dual‑sensory impairment.\n\nThe evidence suggests that self‑management programmes for adults with visual impairment probably make little or no difference to overall health‑related quality of life, to vision‑related quality of life, and to the risk of adverse events."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2024 of search."
