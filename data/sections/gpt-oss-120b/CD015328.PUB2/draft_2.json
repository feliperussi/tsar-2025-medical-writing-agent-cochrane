  "draft": "Do diet changes, exercise programs, or both help prevent excess weight (obesity) in children aged 5‑11?\n\nKey messages\n- Changing diet alone is unlikely to lower a child’s body‑mass index (BMI, a measure of weight relative to height) in the short, medium, or long term.\n- Programs that increase physical activity may produce a small reduction in BMI and in the age‑ and sex‑adjusted version (zBMI) over the short and medium term.\n- Combining diet and activity can give a modest short‑ and medium‑term benefit, but none of the approaches showed clear long‑term effects, and the studies did not report serious unwanted effects.\n\nWhy is preventing childhood obesity important?\nChildhood obesity means a child’s weight is higher than is healthy for their height. It is rising worldwide and can harm health now and later. Excess weight raises the risk of type‑2 diabetes, heart disease, and mental‑health problems. Stopping obesity early is therefore a public‑health priority.\n\nWhat did we want to know?\nWe wanted to find out whether programmes that change children’s eating habits, increase their physical activity, or combine both can lower BMI or zBMI, and whether these programmes cause any serious adverse events (serious side‑effects such as injuries or severe allergic reactions).\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane database up to February 2023 for randomised controlled trials that included children aged 5‑11 years. We compared diet‑only, activity‑only, and combined diet‑and‑activity programmes with usual care or no intervention. We extracted data on BMI, zBMI, and serious adverse events and assessed the certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 172 trials involving about 190,000 children, mostly from high‑income countries and delivered in schools. The interventions fell into three groups:\n- Diet‑only programmes – we found little or no effect on BMI at any follow‑up time.\n- Activity‑only programmes – we found little or no effect on BMI in the short and long term, but a slight reduction in the medium term.\n- Combined diet‑and‑activity programmes – we found a modest reduction in BMI and zBMI in the short and medium term, and little or no effect in the long term.\nEvidence on serious adverse events was very uncertain, so we cannot say whether any harms occurred.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies varied a lot in participants, settings, and how the programmes were delivered. Most were small and short‑term, and none focused on children with disabilities or on health‑inequity outcomes. Because of this variability, we have low confidence in the results.\n\nWhat should future research do?\nWe need longer‑term trials that test diet and activity programmes over several years. Future studies should include a wider range of settings such as homes and community centres, involve children with disabilities, and carefully monitor any serious adverse events.\n",

(2) The \"Key messages\" heading is not phrased as a question, which the style guide requires for all subheadings. (3) Because of the missing currency section, the draft does not fully meet the required structure (Title, Key Messages, Background/Aims, Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency). These omissions prevent the PLS from being complete and compliant.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Add a currency subheading phrased as a question and include the up-to-date statement. Example rewrite:\n   **How up to date is this review?**\n   The evidence was searched up to February 2023, so the findings reflect studies published up to that date.\n2. Re‑phrase the \"Key messages\" heading as a question, e.g., **What are the main findings?** and keep the bullet points underneath.\n3. Ensure the new currency section is placed after the limitations section (or before future research) with a blank line before and after, following the spacing rules.\n\nSupporting metrics: The PLS evaluation shows excellent conformity (e.g., passive voice 9 (P25), active voice 51 (P75), readability scores well within typical ranges). No significant metric deviations were found; the primary concerns are structural rather than linguistic, so the metrics confirm that the language itself is acceptable; the main problems are missing sections and subheading format.",
