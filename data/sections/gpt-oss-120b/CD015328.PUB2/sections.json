  "key_messages": [
    "In children aged 5‑11, changing diet alone is unlikely to reduce excess weight, while programmes that increase physical activity may lead to a small short‑ and medium‑term reduction in body‑mass‑... (BMI, a measure of weight relative to height) and its standardised version (zBMI). Combining diet and activity may also produce a modest short‑ and medium‑term benefit, but none of these approaches showed clear long‑term effects, and serious unwanted effects were not reported in the studies.",
    "Most of the research was carried out in schools in high‑income countries, so we have limited information about how these interventions work in homes, community settings, or for children with disabilities.",
    "Because the evidence is of limited quality and does not cover long‑term outcomes or diverse settings, future studies should test diet and activity programmes over longer periods, include a wider range of environments and participants, and carefully monitor any potential harms."

      "subheading": "Why is preventing childhood obesity important?",
      "content": "Childhood obesity – when a child’s body weight is higher than is healthy for their height – is a growing problem worldwide. More and more children aged 5 to 11 are affected, and excess weight can hurt their health, growth, and overall well‑being now and later in life. It raises the risk of conditions such as type‑2 diabetes, heart disease, and mental‑health issues. Because of this, stopping obesity before it starts is a top public‑health priority.\n\nTo try to keep children at a healthy weight, programmes often focus on changing behaviours. These can include:\n* **Dietary changes** – teaching kids to eat more fruits, vegetables and other nutritious foods while cutting down on sugary drinks and high‑calorie snacks.\n* **Activity changes** – encouraging more physical activity (like sports or active play), reducing time spent sitting still (screen time), and sometimes improving sleep habits.\n\nBoth approaches aim to balance the energy a child takes in (through food) with the energy they use (through movement). Researchers are still unsure which mix of diet, activity, or both works best, especially over the longer term."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to discover whether programmes that change children’s eating habits, activity levels, or a combination of the two can actually lower a child’s **body‑mass index (BMI)** – a simple measure of weight relative to height – or the **zBMI score**, which adjusts BMI for a child’s age and sex. They also looked for any serious side‑effects that might arise from these programmes. In short, the review set out to answer: *Do diet‑focused, activity‑focused, or combined interventions help children aged 5‑11 achieve a healthier weight, and are they safe?*"

      "content": "We searched for studies that evaluated diet, activity, or combined interventions aimed at preventing obesity in children aged 5–11 years, comparing them with usual care or no intervention. Relevant outcomes (BMI, zBMI, and serious adverse events) were extracted, pooled, and the certainty of the evidence was assessed."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We examined 172 randomised controlled trials that together included about 189,700 children aged roughly 5 to 11 years. Most trials were carried out in high‑income countries, with schools being the main setting (111 studies); other settings included community venues, homes, clinical sites, a telehealth programme, or multiple settings. Intervention lengths varied widely, from a single visit to up to four years, with 86 programmes lasting less than nine months. Funding was mainly non‑industry (132 studies), while 24 trials received some industry support. The interventions fell into three groups – diet‑only, activity‑only, or a combination of diet and activity – and were compared with usual care or no intervention. No trial specifically targeted children with disabilities or examined health‑inequity outcomes.\n\nThe review found that diet‑only programmes probably make little or no difference to children’s body‑mass index (BMI) in the short, medium, or long term. Activity‑only programmes probably make little or no difference to BMI in the short and long term, but may reduce BMI slightly in the medium term. Combined diet‑and‑activity programmes probably reduce BMI slightly in the short and medium term, and probably make little or no difference in the long term. Evidence about serious adverse events is very uncertain, so we do not know whether these programmes affect serious harms."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the program, the evidence does not cover all the people and settings we are interested in, and the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023 of search."
