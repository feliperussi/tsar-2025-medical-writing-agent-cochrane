  "plain_title": "Do mental‑health (psychological) and community support (social) programs improve well‑being for people living in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) affected by war, conflict, or disaster?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Current research provides limited and uncertain evidence that group‑based psychological and community support programmes delivered by non‑specialist staff may lead to small improvements in mental well‑being (overall emotional health) for adults, but they do not appear to clearly improve mental well‑being or prosocial behaviour (behaviour that benefits others) for children and adolescents; no harmful effects were reported.",
    "The studies gave little information about whether participants stayed in the programmes or experienced any unwanted effects, so we cannot say how acceptable or safe these interventions are.",
    "Because the available trials are few, involve small numbers of people, and often have methodological limitations, more high‑quality, larger studies that follow participants for longer periods are needed to determine whether these programmes truly help mental health in humanitarian settings."

      "subheading": "Why is mental health a concern for people living in humanitarian crises?",
      "content": "Around the world, wars, conflicts, persecution and other emergencies force about 84 million people to leave their homes. Most of these displaced people live in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) – nations with limited resources for health care. Living in a crisis‑affected setting means facing many stressful experiences, such as loss of shelter, safety, and community support, which can damage a person’s mental well‑being. While many health programs focus on treating diagnosed mental illnesses, there is also a need to help people build positive mental health – things like feeling hopeful, coping well, functioning in daily life, and enjoying a good quality of life."

    {
      "subheading": "What are psychosocial interventions and why might they help?",
      "content": "Psychosocial interventions are activities or programmes that aim to improve mental health by addressing both psychological (thoughts, feelings) and social (relationships, community) factors. They are often delivered in groups and can be run by paraprofessionals – people who are not formally trained mental‑health professionals but have been taught how to support others, such as community volunteers or teachers. These interventions try to boost mental‑well‑being, coping skills, resilience, and overall functioning, rather than just treating mental illness."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether psychosocial programmes that promote positive mental health actually work better than doing nothing, usual care, or waiting for help. Specifically, they compared these programmes with control conditions in randomised trials involving children, adolescents and adults living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises, looking at outcomes such as mental‑well‑being, daily functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope and prosocial behaviour."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we do?",
      "content": "We searched databases for studies that compared psychosocial interventions with no intervention or usual care in people living in low‑ and middle‑income countries affected by humanitarian crises. We combined the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We examined 13 randomised controlled trials that together included 7,917 people living in low‑ and middle‑income countries affected by humanitarian crises. Nine of the trials involved children and adolescents, and four involved adults; participants were recruited regardless of whether they had a diagnosed mental disorder. All trials tested group‑based psychosocial programmes that were mainly delivered by paraprofessionals, comparing them with control conditions such as no treatment, usual care, or a waiting‑list. The studies lasted on average 18 weeks (range 10–32 weeks) and were funded mainly by academic and non‑governmental grants. The trials were carried out in Lebanon (4), India (2), and one each in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal, and Tanzania.\n\nThe evidence suggests that these programmes may have little to no effect, or possibly a small effect, on mental well‑being in children and adolescents, may produce a small effect on prosocial behaviour in this age group, and may slightly improve mental well‑being in adults. However, the certainty of these findings is very low, meaning we are uncertain about the size and direction of any true effects."

  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the studies were very small and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search."
