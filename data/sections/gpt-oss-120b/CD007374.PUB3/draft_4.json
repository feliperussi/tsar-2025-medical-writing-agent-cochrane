  "draft": "Do education programmes (structured teaching sessions) improve health outcomes for people with chronic kidney disease (long‑term kidney problems) and diabetes?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Education programmes probably improve blood‑sugar control, shown by a lower HbA1c (a test that reflects average blood‑sugar levels over the past few months), in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. We did not find clear benefits or harms for other clinical outcomes, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The programmes may increase patients’ knowledge about diabetes and boost confidence in managing their condition (self‑efficacy), but the evidence for these effects is limited and uncertain.\n- Because the existing studies are few and small, we need larger, longer trials to see whether education programmes can improve kidney function, heart health, quality of life, and to identify any possible adverse effects.\n\nWhat is the health problem for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes?\nPeople who have both chronic kidney disease (CKD – a long‑term loss of kidney function) and diabetes need to follow very detailed daily routines. They must take medicines, monitor blood sugar, watch their diet, and often attend regular medical appointments. Sticking to these complex plans is hard, and many people do not manage it well. Poor adherence can lead to higher blood‑sugar levels, higher cholesterol, and faster loss of kidney function. While doctors can prescribe medicines and adjust dialysis, success also depends on how well patients understand and manage their condition.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether education programmes for adults with CKD and diabetes improve health outcomes. Specifically, we looked at whether the programmes lower HbA1c, improve cholesterol numbers, increase patients’ knowledge and confidence in managing diabetes, and affect important results such as kidney failure, serious low‑blood‑sugar episodes, and overall safety.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register up to July 2024 for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared an education programme with routine care in adults with CKD and diabetes. Two reviewers screened studies, assessed their quality, and extracted data. We combined results using standard statistical methods and judged the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight trials that together enrolled 840 adults with CKD and diabetes. Participants included people on dialysis, people with moderately increased albuminuria (higher than normal protein in urine), and people with type‑2 diabetes and advanced kidney disease. All trials compared an education programme – delivered by nurses, pharmacists or other educators through verbal, written, audio‑recorded or computer‑aided formats – with routine care. Follow‑up ranged from five weeks to 18 months.\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- Education programmes probably lower blood‑sugar levels by about 0.4 % (HbA1c) compared with routine care.\n- They may also lower total cholesterol and LDL (low‑density lipoprotein) cholesterol a little.\n- Participants often reported better knowledge about diabetes and greater confidence in managing it, and some showed modest changes in diet and home glucose monitoring. These benefits are uncertain and may not last.\n- We did not find clear benefits or harms for outcomes such as death, serious low‑blood‑sugar episodes, or kidney failure; the evidence for these outcomes is very uncertain.\n- Adding education to multidisciplinary coordinated care made little or no difference to blood‑sugar control, kidney outcomes, blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the results, but the studies were small and participants often knew which group they were in, which may have affected the outcomes. Many outcomes relied on self‑reported measures, which are less reliable.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the checklist (all required sections, question‑style headings, factual accuracy, and word‑count), but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse patients:\n1. **Overly long sentences** – e.g., “Education programmes probably improve blood‑sugar control, shown by a lower HbA1c (a test that reflects average blood‑sugar levels over the past few months), in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes.” (31 words). Long sentences are hard to follow for a lay audience.\n2. **Another long, complex sentence** – “Because the existing studies are few and small, we need larger, longer trials to see whether education programmes can improve kidney function, heart health, quality of life, and to identify any possible adverse effects.” (34 words). This packs many ideas together.\n3. **Vague wording** – “These benefits are uncertain and may not last.” The phrase “may not last” is ambiguous; readers need to know that the effect might not be sustained over time.\n4. **Passive‑voice heavy sections** – The metrics show 14 passive constructions, which can obscure who did what and reduce readability.\n5. **High nominalisation and complex words** – The evaluation flags 24 nominalisations, 193 nouns, and many long/complex words (e.g., “multidisciplinary coordinated care”, “behavioural counselling”). Simplifying these improves plain‑language flow.\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Split the first long sentence: “Education programmes probably improve blood‑sugar control. They do this by lowering HbA1c – a test that shows average blood‑sugar levels over the past few months.”\n- Rewrite the second long sentence: “Because the studies are few and small, we need larger, longer trials to find out whether education programmes can improve kidney function, heart health, and quality of life, and to detect any adverse effects.”\n- Clarify the vague phrase: “These benefits are uncertain and may not be sustained over time.”\n- Convert passive to active where possible, e.g., change “The evidence was assessed…” → “We assessed the evidence…”.\n- Replace nominalised terms with verbs: “multidisciplinary coordinated care” → “team‑based care”, “behavioural counselling” → “behaviour support”.\n\nThese changes address the most significant readability issues while preserving the factual content.\n\n**Metrics support**: The evaluation and readability metrics show 14 passive voice instances, 24 nominalisations, 193 nouns, and high scores for complex/long words (e.g., complex_words_dc = 291, long_words = 211). Reducing these will lower the SMOG, Dale‑Chall, and other readability indices, bringing the draft closer to typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits (637 words) and scores moderately on readability (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 48, FK‑grade 11.6). However, several metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisation (24, beyond P90), nouns (193, beyond P90), SMOG (14.3, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall (8.23, beyond P90), complex words (144, beyond P90), complex words DC (291, beyond P90), and long words (211, beyond P90). These indicate excessive noun‑heavy and complex language, supporting the need for simplification and active‑voice revisions."
