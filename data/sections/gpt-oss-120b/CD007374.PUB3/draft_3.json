  "draft": "Do education programmes (structured teaching sessions) improve health outcomes for people with chronic kidney disease (long‑term kidney problems) and diabetes?\n\nKey messages\n- Education programmes probably lower blood‑sugar levels, reducing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) by about 0.4 % compared with routine care. We did not find clear benefits or harms for outcomes such as death, serious low‑blood‑sugar episodes, or kidney failure.\n- The programmes may increase patients’ knowledge about diabetes and boost confidence in self‑care (self‑efficacy), but the evidence is limited and uncertain.\n- Because the studies were few and small, we need larger, longer trials to determine whether education programmes can improve kidney function, heart health, quality of life, and to detect any possible adverse effects.\n\nWhat is the health problem for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes?\n. People who have both chronic kidney disease (CKD – a long‑term loss of kidney function) and diabetes need to follow very detailed daily routines. They must take medicines, monitor blood sugar, watch their diet, and often attend regular medical appointments. Sticking to these complex plans is hard, and many people do not manage it well. Poor adherence can lead to higher blood‑sugar levels, higher cholesterol, and faster loss of kidney function. While doctors can prescribe medicines and adjust dialysis, success also depends on how well patients understand and manage their condition.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\n- We wanted to know whether education programmes for adults with CKD and diabetes improve health outcomes. Specifically, we looked at whether the programmes lower HbA1c, improve cholesterol numbers, increase patients’ knowledge and confidence in managing diabetes, and affect important results such as kidney failure, serious low‑blood‑sugar episodes, and overall safety.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\n- We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register up to July 2024 for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared an education programme with routine care in adults with CKD and diabetes. Two reviewers screened studies, assessed their quality, and extracted data. We combined results using standard statistical methods and judged the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- We identified eight trials that together enrolled 840 adults with CKD and diabetes. The participants were people on dialysis, people with moderately increased albuminuria (higher than normal protein in urine, indicating early kidney damage), and people with type‑2 diabetes and advanced kidney disease. All trials compared an education programme – delivered by nurses, pharmacists or other educators through verbal, written, audio‑recorded or computer‑aided formats – with routine care. Follow‑up ranged from five weeks to 18 months.\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- Education programmes probably lower blood‑sugar levels by about 0.4 % (HbA1c) compared with routine care.\n- They may also lower total cholesterol and low‑density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol a little.\n- Participants often reported better knowledge about diabetes and greater confidence in managing it, and some showed modest changes in diet and home glucose monitoring. These benefits are uncertain and may not last.\n- We did not find clear benefits or harms for outcomes such as death, serious low‑blood‑s, or kidney failure; the evidence for these outcomes is very uncertain.\n- Adding education to multidisciplinary coordinated care made little or no difference to blood‑sugar control, kidney outcomes, blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n- We are moderately confident in the results because the studies were small and participants usually knew which group they were in, which can influence outcomes. Many outcomes relied on self‑reported measures, which are less reliable.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\n- This review updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to July 2024.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check: the subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, which the Master Style Guide requires for all subheadings. Additionally, there are three clarity problems that would confuse readers: (1) a truncated phrase \"serious low‑blood‑s\" that leaves the meaning unclear; (2) the term \"self‑efficacy\" appears without a plain‑language definition; (3) a stray period before the first sentence of the \"What is the health problem...\" section creates a visual glitch. Suggested rewrites are provided below. The PLS evaluation also shows several linguistic deviations (high nominalisation, many complex and long words, and a high SMOG index) that support the need to simplify wording and reduce noun‑heavy constructions.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Key messages\". Problem: not a question. Rewrite: \"What are the key messages?\" and keep the bullet list beneath it.\n2. **Truncated phrase** – Quote: \"We did not find clear benefits or harms for outcomes such as death, serious low‑blood‑s, or kidney failure.\" Problem: \"low‑blood‑s\" is incomplete and confusing. Rewrite: \"We did not find clear benefits or harms for outcomes such as death, serious low‑blood‑sugar episodes, or kidney failure.\"\n3. **Undefined jargon** – Quote: \"self‑efficacy\" (appears in key messages and later text). Problem: readers may not know what this means. Rewrite: \"self‑efficacy (confidence in managing their own care)\" the first time it is used.\n4. **Formatting typo** – Quote: \". People who have both chronic kidney disease...\" (the leading period). Problem: visual error that disrupts reading flow. Rewrite by removing the stray period: \"People who have both chronic kidney disease...\"\n5. **Wordy sentence** – Quote: \"We are moderately confident in the results because the studies were small and participants usually knew which group they were in, which can influence outcomes.\" Problem: long, noun‑heavy sentence. Rewrite: \"We are moderately confident in the results, but the studies were small and participants often knew their group, which may have affected the outcomes.\"\n\nMetrics support: the draft has 24 nominalisations (target <13), 192 nouns (target <116), a SMOG index of 14.2 (target <12.1), and 292 Dale‑Chall complex words (target <160). These indicate the text is more noun‑ and complex‑word heavy than typical PLS, reinforcing the need for the suggested simplifications.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate overall conformity but highlights several deviations: nominalisations (24, beyond typical P90), noun count (192, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.2, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.5, beyond P90), complex words (144, beyond P90), long words (205, beyond P90), and complex words (DC) (292, beyond BEYOND_P90). These suggest the draft is more complex and noun‑heavy than usual PLS, supporting the recommended reductions in nominalisation, complex/long words, and overall sentence simplicity."
