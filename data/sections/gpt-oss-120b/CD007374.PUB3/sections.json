  "key_messages": [
    "Education programmes probably improve blood‑sugar control, as shown by lower glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (a test that reflects average blood sugar over the past few months), in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (long‑term kidney problems) and diabetes (high blood‑sugar condition); no clear benefits or harms were seen for other clinical outcomes, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "These programmes may also increase patients’ knowledge about diabetes and boost confidence in managing their condition (self‑efficacy), but the evidence for these effects is limited and uncertain.",
    "Because the existing studies are few and small, more robust, larger trials with longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether education programmes can improve kidney function, heart health, quality of life, and to identify any possible adverse effects."

      "subheading": "What is the health problem for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes?",
      "content": "People who have both chronic kidney disease (CKD) – a long‑term loss of kidney function – and diabetes need to follow very detailed daily routines. They must take medicines, monitor blood sugar, watch their diet, and often attend regular medical appointments. Keeping to these complex plans is hard, and many people do not stick to them, which can lead to worse blood‑sugar control, higher cholesterol, and faster loss of kidney function. While doctors can prescribe medicines and adjust dialysis or other treatments, success also depends on how well patients understand and manage their condition. The condition is often described using terms such as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c, a measure of average blood‑sugar levels) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, a test of kidney function). Education programmes – sessions where health professionals give information, teach skills, and provide behavioural support – are proposed as a way to help people follow their treatment plans more effectively."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether education programmes for adults with CKD and diabetes actually improve health outcomes. Specifically, they looked at whether these programmes lower HbA1c, improve cholesterol numbers, increase patients’ knowledge and confidence in managing diabetes, and affect other important results such as kidney failure, serious low‑blood‑sugar episodes, and overall safety. In short, the review set out to evaluate the benefits and possible harms of adding structured education to routine medical care for this high‑risk group."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review identified eight randomised (or quasi‑randomised) trials that together enrolled 840 adults with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. The participants included people on dialysis, those with moderately increased albuminuria, and individuals with type‑2 diabetes and advanced diabetic nephropathy, representing a range of CKD severity. All trials compared an educational programme—delivered by nurses, pharmacists or other educators through verbal, written, audio‑recorded or computer‑aided formats—with routine care; one trial also examined education combined with multidisciplinary coordinated care. Follow‑up periods ranged from five weeks to 18 months. The abstract did not report the countries, gender distribution, or funding sources."

      "subheading": "Main results: Education programmes probably reduce blood‑sugar levels",
      "content": "Education programmes probably reduce blood‑sugar levels (about a 0.4 % lower HbA1c) in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. They may also lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol a little. The programmes may improve patients’ knowledge about diabetes, their confidence in managing the same, and encourage modest changes in diet and home glucose monitoring, although these benefits are uncertain and may not last. There is very uncertain evidence about any effect on death, serious low‑blood‑sugar episodes, or kidney failure. Adding education to multidisciplinary care probably makes little or no difference to blood‑sugar control, kidney outcomes, blood pressure or cholesterol."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
