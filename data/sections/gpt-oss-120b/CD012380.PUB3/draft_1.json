  "draft": "Do blood transfusions, hydroxyurea (a medicine that reduces sickle‑cell crises), or ACE inhibitors (blood‑pressure medicines) prevent or slow chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease?\n\n- The current evidence does not allow us to say whether blood transfusions, hydroxyurea (a medication that reduces sickle‑cell crises), or ACE inhibitors (medicines that lower blood pressure) can prevent or slow chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease; small studies suggest hydroxyurea might improve the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine and ACE inhibitors might lower protein in the urine, but overall effects on kidney function remain uncertain and serious side effects were not reported.\n- No randomised controlled trials have examined blood transfusions for kidney protection, and the few trials that looked at hydroxyurea or ACE inhibitors were short‑term, involved few participants, and did not assess important outcomes such as quality of life or death.\n- Because the existing research is limited and uncertain, larger, well‑designed, longer‑term studies are needed—especially in older children and adults—to determine whether these treatments can protect kidney health in sickle cell disease and to identify any potential harms.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\n\nWhy are kidney problems a concern for people with sickle cell disease?\nSickle disease (SCD) is a genetic condition where a person inherits two abnormal copies of the gene that makes haemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. Because the red cells are misshapen, they can block tiny blood vessels, causing pain, damage to organs, lung problems and a shorter life expectancy. One of the organs that often gets hurt is the kidney.\n\nKidney damage in SCD is called sickle cell nephropathy. It can start early – even in children – and shows up as tiny amounts of protein in the urine (called microalbuminuria) or as a reduced ability of the \"filtering units\" of the kidney (the glomeruli) to work properly. Over time this can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD), which means the kidneys are not working well for at least three months. If CKD gets worse, it can progress to proteinuria (larger amounts of protein in the urine) and eventually end‑stage renal disease, where the kidneys fail completely. About 12 % of people with sickle cell nephropathy may reach this stage.\n\nDoctors have tried several ways to protect the kidneys in SCD, such as:\n* Hydroxyurea: A medicine that reduces the number of sickled red cells.\n* Angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs): drugs that lower blood pressure inside the tiny kidney vessels and can reduce protein loss in the urine.\n* Red blood cell transfusions: giving healthy blood cells to replace the sickled ones.\nThese treatments are used for other problems in SCD, but it is not clear how well they work specifically to prevent or slow kidney damage.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to discover whether any of the above interventions – hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, red blood cell transfusions, or combinations of them – can prevent or lessen kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. In other words, they set out to answer the question: Do these treatments keep the kidneys healthier in SCD, and are they safe to use for this purpose?\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatment groups) evaluating interventions to prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease. We combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nThe review identified three randomised controlled trials involving a total of 385 participants with sickle cell disease. One trial enrolled 193 children aged 9 to 18 months and compared hydroxyurea with placebo; a second trial included 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria and compared the ACE inhibitor captopril with placebo; and a third trial recruited 170 children aged 1 to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria and compared the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with vitamin C. The captopril study reported outcomes after six months, the lisinopril study after one month, and the duration of the hydroxyurea study was not specified. Funding sources and the countries where the trials were conducted were not reported. No trials examined red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions for preventing or reducing kidney complications. Hydroxyurea may slightly improve urine concentration in young children, but we are very uncertain about its effect on kidney filtration rate or serious complications such as acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospital stays. For adults, it is unclear whether captopril reduces protein in the urine or helps preserve kidney function, and for children it is also unclear whether lisinopril reduces protein in the urine.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and the studies were very small.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical completeness and style checks. It is missing a Currency section and several required subheadings (Methods, Results, Limitations) are not phrased as questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. Additionally, the text contains many long, passive‑voice sentences and noun‑heavy phrasing that reduce readability (24 passive constructions, 276 nouns, 163 complex words, 252 long words – all well beyond typical PLS ranges). The most important clarity improvements are:\n1. **Missing Currency statement** – readers need to know how up‑to‑date the evidence is. Add a brief sentence such as: \"The searches were last run in 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\"\n2. **Subheadings not in question form** – change headings to questions, e.g., replace \"Methods\" with \"How did we find and evaluate the studies?\", \"Results\" with \"What did we find?\", and \"Limitations\" with \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\".\n3. **Passive‑voice heavy sentence** – original: \"The review identified three randomised controlled trials involving a total of 385 participants with sickle cell disease.\" Rewrite actively: \"We identified three randomised controlled trials that enrolled a total of 385 participants with sickle cell disease.\"\n4. **Long, dense sentence** – original: \"Hydroxyurea may slightly improve urine concentration in young children, but we are very uncertain about its effect on kidney filtration rate or serious complications such as acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospital stays.\" Rewrite into two shorter sentences: \"Hydroxyurea may slightly improve urine concentration in young children. However, we are very uncertain whether it affects kidney filtration rate or serious complications such as acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospital stays.\"\n5. **Noun‑heavy sections** – the paragraph under \"Results\" is noun‑dense. Break it up and use more verbs: \"We found three trials (385 participants). One trial compared hydroxyurea with placebo in 193 children aged 9–18 months. Another trial compared the ACE inhibitor captopril with placebo in 22 adults. A third trial compared lisinopril with vitamin C in 170 children aged 1–18 years. The captopril study reported outcomes after six months; the lisinopril study after one month; the hydroxyurea study did not specify duration. No trial examined blood‑cell transfusions or combined interventions. Hydroxyurea may improve urine concentration, but we remain very uncertain about its impact on kidney filtration or serious complications. For adults, captopril’s effect on protein loss or kidney function is unclear, and the same uncertainty applies to lisinopril in children.\"\nThese changes address the most critical clarity and style issues while also reducing the high passive‑voice, noun, and complex‑word counts highlighted by the PLS evaluation (passive_voice = 24 > BEYOND_P90; nouns = 276 > BEYOND_P90; complex_words = 163 > BEYOND_P90; long_words = 252 > BEYOND_P90). Implementing the suggested rewrites will bring the draft into better conformity with typical Cochrane PLS patterns and meet the Master Style Guide requirements.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit but deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns: words per sentence (26.6) and passive voice (24) are beyond the P90 range; noun count (276), complex words (163), and long words (252) are far above typical values. Readability indices are near median, but the high structural and lexical complexity explains the need for shorter, more active sentences and reduced noun density."
