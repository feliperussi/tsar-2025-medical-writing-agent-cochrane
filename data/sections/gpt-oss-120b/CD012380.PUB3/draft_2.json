  "draft": "Do blood transfusions, hydroxyurea (a medicine that reduces sickle‑cell crises), or ACE inhibitors (blood‑pressure medicines) prevent or slow chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease?\n\nKey messages:\n- Current evidence does not show that blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, or ACE inhibitors reliably prevent or slow chronic kidney disease in sickle cell disease; small studies hint at possible benefits but overall effects remain uncertain.\n- No randomised trials have tested blood transfusions for kidney protection, and the few trials of hydroxyurea or ACE inhibitors were short, involved few participants, and did not assess important outcomes such as quality of life or death.\n- Larger, well‑designed, longer‑term studies are needed, especially in older children and adults, to determine whether these treatments protect kidney health and to identify any harms.\n\nWhy are kidney problems a concern for people with sickle cell disease?\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition where abnormal haemoglobin makes red blood cells misshapen. These cells can block tiny blood vessels, causing pain, organ damage, and a shorter life expectancy. The kidneys are often affected. Early kidney damage (sickle cell nephropathy) may appear as tiny amounts of protein in the urine (microalbuminuria) or reduced filtering ability (glomerular function). Over time this can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and, in about 12 % of cases, to end‑stage renal disease where the kidneys fail.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, red blood cell transfusions, or any combination of these can prevent or lessen kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD, and whether they are safe for this purpose.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared any of the listed interventions with a control (placebo or usual care). Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The searches were last run in 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three trials that together enrolled 385 participants with SCD.\n- One trial compared hydroxyurea with placebo in 193 children aged 9–18 months. Hydroxyurea may improve the ability to concentrate urine, but we are very uncertain about its effect on kidney filtration rate or serious complications such as acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospitalisation.\n- A second trial compared the ACE inhibitor captopril with placebo in 22 adults who had normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. The study lasted six months and did not show a clear reduction in protein loss or preservation of kidney function.\n- A third trial compared the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with vitamin C in 170 children aged 1–18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. After one month, both groups showed a drop in microalbuminuria, making it unclear whether lisinopril had any specific benefit.\nNo trial examined red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions for kidney protection. Across all studies, serious side effects were not reported, but the trials were small and short‑term.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low to very low confidence in the findings because:\n- Some participants may have known which treatment they received, introducing bias.\n- The studies did not report all outcomes we consider important, such as quality of life or mortality.\n- The evidence does not cover all ages, genotypes, or treatment combinations.\n- All trials were small, limiting the reliability of the results.\n\nWhat does this mean for people with sickle cell disease?\nAt present we cannot say that hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, or blood transfusions reliably protect kidney health in SCD. Clinicians and patients should be aware of the uncertainty and the need for larger, longer‑term trials before these treatments can be recommended for kidney protection.",

(2) Not all subheadings are phrased as questions – the \"Key messages:\" heading is a statement, not a question, which breaches the style rule. (3) Several clarity and style issues would confuse readers:\n- \"Key messages:\" – a heading should be a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\") and should be separated from the body with a blank line.\n- \"Current evidence does not show that blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, or ACE inhibitors reliably prevent or slow chronic kidney disease in sickle cell disease; small studies hint at possible benefits but overall effects remain uncertain.\" – this long sentence mixes several ideas and uses jargon (\"reliably\", \"overall effects\").\n- \"The studies were small and short-term, limiting the reliability of the results.\" – passive voice obscures who performed the study.\n- \"We identified three trials that together enrolled 385 participants with SCD.\" – noun-heavy; could be more active.\nSuggested rewrites are provided below. Metrics support these edits: the draft has 19 passive-voice constructions (well above the typical 9-23 range) and 218 nouns (beyond the typical ≤116), contributing to a higher SMOG index (14) and many complex words. Reducing passive voice, noun density, and sentence length will improve readability.\nTop improvements:\n1. Change \"Key messages:\" to a question heading and add a blank line.\n2. Split the long key-message sentence into two shorter, active sentences.\n3. Convert passive sentences to active voice.\n4. Replace noun-heavy phrasing with verb-focused sentences.\n5. Add a brief \"Currency\" section stating the search date (2023) and that no new trials have been published since.\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the Master Style Guide and improve patient-readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word-count limits but deviates on several metrics: passive_voice (19, beyond typical range), nouns (218, beyond P90), SMOG index (14, above median), and high counts of complex and long words. These indicate the text is more noun-heavy and complex than typical Cochrane PLS, supporting the need to reduce passive constructions, simplify vocabulary, and shorten sentences."
