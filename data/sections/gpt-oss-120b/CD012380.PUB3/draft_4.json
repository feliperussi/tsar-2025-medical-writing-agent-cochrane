  "draft": "Do blood transfusions, hydroxyurea (a medicine that reduces sickle‑cell crises), or ACE inhibitors (blood‑pressure medicines) prevent or slow chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease?\n\nKey messages\n- We cannot say with confidence that blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, or ACE inhibitors protect kidney health in sickle cell disease; small studies hint that hydroxyurea may help the kidney concentrate urine and that ACE inhibitors may lower protein in the urine, but overall effects remain uncertain.\n- No randomised trials have tested blood transfusions for kidney protection, and the few trials of hydroxyurea or ACE inhibitors were short, involved few participants, and did not measure important outcomes such as quality of life or death.\n- Larger, well‑designed, longer‑term studies – especially in older children and adults – are needed to determine whether these treatments protect kidney health and to identify any harms.\n\nWhy are kidney problems a concern for people with sickle cell disease?\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition where a person inherits two abnormal copies of the gene that makes haemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells). Misshapen red cells can block tiny blood vessels, causing pain, organ damage, lung problems and a shorter life expectancy. The kidneys are often injured. Early kidney damage, called sickle cell nephropathy, may appear as tiny amounts of protein in the urine (microalbuminuria) or as reduced filtering ability of the kidney’s tiny units (glomeruli). Over time this can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the kidneys work poorly for at least three months, and eventually to end‑stage renal disease, where the kidneys fail completely. About 12 % of people with sickle cell nephropathy reach this stage.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, red blood cell transfusions, or any combination of these can prevent or lessen kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD, and whether they are safe for this purpose.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared any of the listed interventions with a control (placebo or usual care). Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our searches were completed in 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three trials that together enrolled 385 participants with SCD.\n- One trial compared hydroxyurea with placebo in 193 children aged 9–18 months. Hydroxyurea may improve the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine, but we are very uncertain about its effect on kidney filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) or serious complications such as acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospitalisation.\n- A second trial compared the ACE inhibitor captopril with placebo in 22 adults who had normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. Over six months the study did not show a clear reduction in protein loss or preservation of kidney function.\n- A third trial compared the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with vitamin C in 170 children aged 1–18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. After one month both groups showed a drop in microalbuminuria, making it unclear whether lisinopril had any specific benefit.\nNo trial examined red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions for kidney protection. Across all studies, serious side effects were not reported, but the trials were small and short‑term.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low to very low confidence in the findings because:\n- Some participants may have known which treatment they received, introducing bias.\n- The studies did not report outcomes we consider important, such as quality of life or mortality.\n- The evidence does not cover all ages, genotypes, or treatment combinations.\n- All trials were small, limiting the reliability of the results.\n\nWhat does this mean for people with sickle cell disease?\nAt present we cannot say that hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, or blood transfusions reliably protect kidney health in SCD. Clinicians and patients should be aware of the uncertainty and the need for larger, longer‑term trials before these treatments can be recommended for kidney protection.\n\nWhat is the currency of the evidence?\nOur search was completed in 2023 and no new randomised trials on these interventions and kidney outcomes have been published since then.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required completeness, title/subheading format, factual accuracy and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse patients:\n1. **Overly long sentence** – \"Hydroxyurea may improve the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine, but we are very uncertain about its effect on kidney filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) or serious complications such as acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospitalisation.\" (36 words). Long, multi‑part sentences are hard to follow. *Rewrite*: \"Hydroxyurea may help the kidney concentrate urine. However, we are very uncertain whether it improves kidney filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate). We also do not know if it reduces serious sickle‑cell complications such as acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospitalisation.\"\n2. **Technical term used without reminder** – later sections refer to \"microalbuminuria\" without briefly restating its meaning. Patients may forget the earlier definition. *Rewrite*: \"microalbuminuria (tiny amounts of protein in the urine)\" each time the term first appears in a new section.\n3. **Mixing kidney outcomes with unrelated SCD complications** – the sentence above lumps kidney filtration with acute chest syndrome, painful crises and hospitalisation, which are not kidney‑specific and can confuse the reader about what the review was measuring. *Rewrite*: \"Hydroxyurea may improve urine concentration, but we are very uncertain whether it improves kidney filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate). The trials also did not show clear effects on other sickle‑cell complications such as acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospitalisation.\"\n4. **Passive‑voice constructions** – e.g., \"The captopril study reported outcomes after six months, the lisinopril study after one month, and the duration of the hydroxyurea study was not specified.\" This hides who did the reporting. *Rewrite*: \"We reported outcomes from the captopril study after six months, from the lisinopril study after one month, and we could not determine the duration of the hydroxyurea study.\"\n5. **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – the draft contains many noun‑clusters (e g., \"the ability to concentrate urine\", \"the evidence does not allow us to say whether…\"). Converting some nouns to verbs improves readability. *Example rewrite*: change \"the evidence does not allow us to say whether…\" to \"we cannot say whether…\".\nThese issues are reflected in the metric report, which shows a high number of passive sentences (24, beyond the typical range), an excess of nouns (247) and complex/long words (complex_words = 153, long_words = 210). Reducing passive voice, noun density and sentence length will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns and make it clearer for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits but deviates on several readability metrics: passive_voice (24, beyond P90), nouns (247, beyond P90), complex_words_dc (305), complex_words (153) and long_words (210) are all far above typical PLS ranges. Readability indices (SMOG 14.7, Flesch‑Kincaid 12.8) are higher than the median, indicating the text is more complex than usual. These metric alerts support the editorial recommendation to simplify sentences, reduce passive constructions and lower noun/complex‑word density."
