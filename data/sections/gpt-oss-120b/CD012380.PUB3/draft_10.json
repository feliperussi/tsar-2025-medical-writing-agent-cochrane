  "draft": "Do blood transfusions, hydroxyurea (a medicine that reduces sickle‑cell crises), or ACE inhibitors (blood‑pressure medicines) prevent or slow chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- The current evidence does not let us say whether blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, or ACE inhibitors protect kidney health in sickle cell disease; small studies hint that hydroxyurea might improve the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine and that ACE inhibitors might lower protein in the urine, but overall effects remain uncertain and the trials reported no serious side‑effects.\n- No randomised trials have tested blood transfusions for kidney protection, and the few trials of hydroxyurea or ACE inhibitors were short, involved few participants, and did not assess quality of life or death.\n- Because the research is limited and uncertain, larger, well‑designed, longer‑term studies are needed, especially in older children and adults, to determine whether these treatments can protect kidney health and to identify any harms.\n\nWhy are kidney problems a concern for people with sickle cell disease?\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition where a person inherits two abnormal copies of the gene that makes haemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. Misshapen red cells can block tiny blood vessels, causing pain, organ damage, lung problems and a shorter life expectancy. The kidneys are often injured.\nKidney damage in SCD is called sickle cell nephropathy. It can appear early – even in children – as tiny amounts of protein in the urine (microalbuminuria). It can also show up as a reduced ability of the kidney’s filtering units (the glomeruli) to work properly. Over time this can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD), meaning the kidneys work poorly for at least three months. If CKD worsens, it can progress to larger protein loss (proteinuria) and eventually to end‑stage renal disease, where the kidneys fail completely. About 12 % of people with sickle cell nephropathy may reach this stage.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, red blood cell transfusions, or any combination of these can prevent or slow kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD, and whether the treatments are safe for this purpose.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared the listed interventions with a placebo or usual care. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our searches were completed in 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three trials that together enrolled 385 participants with SCD.\n- One trial compared hydroxyurea with placebo in 193 children aged 9 to 18 months. Hydroxyurea may improve the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine, but we are very uncertain whether it improves glomerular filtration rate (the test that measures how well the kidneys filter blood). The trial reported no serious side‑effects.\n- A second trial compared the ACE inhibitor captopril with placebo in 22 adults who had normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. Over six months the study did not show a clear reduction in protein loss or preservation of kidney function. The trial reported no serious side‑effects.\n- A third trial compared the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with vitamin C in 170 children aged 1 to 18 years who also had normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. After one month both groups showed a drop in protein loss, making it unclear whether lisinopril had any specific benefit. The trial reported no serious side‑effects.\nNo trial examined red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions for kidney protection.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low to very low confidence in the findings. Some participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies did not report important outcomes such as quality of life or death, and the evidence does not cover all ages, genotypes, or treatment combinations. All trials were small, which limits reliability.\n\nWhat does this mean for people with sickle cell disease?\nAt present we cannot say that hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, or blood transfusions reliably protect kidney health in SCD. Clinicians and patients should be aware of the uncertainty and the need for larger, longer‑term trials before these treatments can be recommended for kidney protection.\n\nWhat is the currency of the evidence?\nOur search was completed in 2023 and no new randomised trials on these interventions and kidney outcomes have been published since then.",

The metrics show 23 passive constructions (well above the typical PLS range). \n3. **Overly long sentences / bullet points** – the first key‑message bullet and the concluding sentence about future research each exceed 30 words, packing several ideas together and reducing readability. \n4. **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – the draft uses many abstract nouns (e.g., “research”, “evidence”, “interventions”), contributing to the high noun count (247, beyond typical PLS levels) and making sentences feel dense. \n5. **Missing simple definitions for key outcomes** – while the draft mentions “ability to concentrate urine”, it does not explain why this matters for kidney health.\nThese issues together exceed the threshold for acceptable clarity in a patient‑focused Plain Language Summary.\n\n**Suggested improvements**:\n- Replace jargon with brief definitions (e.g., “glomerular filtration rate – a test that shows how well the kidneys filter blood”).\n- Convert passive sentences to active voice (e.g., “The trial found no serious side‑effects”).\n- Break long sentences and bullet points into shorter, single‑idea statements.\n- Reduce noun‑heavy constructions by using more verbs (e.g., “We need larger studies” instead of “Larger, well‑designed, longer‑term studies are needed”).\n- Add a simple explanation of why urine‑concentrating ability matters for kidney health.\nThese revisions will bring the summary in line with the Cochrane plain‑language style guide and improve patient comprehension.",

Readability scores (Flesch‑Reading Ease 52, Grade 11) are acceptable, but the high passive and noun counts support the identified clarity issues."
