  "draft": "Do blood transfusions, hydroxyurea (a medicine that reduces sickle‑cell crises), or ACE inhibitors (blood‑pressure medicines) prevent or slow chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease?\n\nKey messages –\n- We cannot say whether blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, or ACE inhibitors protect kidney health in sickle cell disease because the evidence is limited and uncertain.\n- Small studies hint that hydroxyurea might help kidneys concentrate urine and that ACE inhibitors might lower protein loss in urine, but we are very unsure about any overall benefit or harm.\n- No trials tested blood transfusions for kidney protection, and the few hydroxyurea and ACE‑inhibitor studies were short, involved few participants, and did not look at quality of life or death. Larger, longer‑term trials are needed.\n\nWhy are kidney problems a concern for people with sickle cell disease?\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition where a person inherits two abnormal copies of the gene that makes haemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. Misshapen red cells can block tiny blood vessels, causing pain, organ damage, lung problems, and a shorter life expectancy. The kidneys are often injured.\nKidney damage in SCD is called sickle cell nephropathy. It can appear early – even in children – as tiny amounts of protein in the urine (microalbuminuria) or as a reduced ability of the kidney’s filtering units (the glomeruli) to work properly. Over time this can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD), which means the kidneys work poorly for at least three months. If CKD worsens, it can progress to larger protein loss (proteinuria) and eventually to end‑stage renal disease, where the kidneys fail completely. About 12 % of people with sickle cell nephropathy may reach this stage.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, red blood cell transfusions, or any combination of these can prevent or slow kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD, and whether the treatments are safe for this purpose.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared the listed interventions with a placebo or usual care. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our searches were completed in 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three trials that together enrolled 385 participants with SCD.\n- One trial compared hydroxyurea with placebo in 193 children aged 9 to 18 months. Hydroxyurea may improve the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine, but we are very uncertain whether it improves how well the kidneys filter blood (glomerular filtration rate). The trial did not show clear effects on serious sickle‑cell complications such as acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospitalisation, and no serious side‑effects were reported.\n- A second trial compared the ACE inhibitor captopril with placebo in 22 adults who had normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. Over six months the study did not show a clear reduction in protein loss or preservation of kidney function. No serious side‑effects were reported.\n- A third trial compared the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with vitamin C in 170 children aged 1 to 18 years who also had normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. After one month both groups showed a drop in protein loss, making it unclear whether lisinopril had any specific benefit. No serious side‑effects were reported.\nNo trial examined red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions for kidney protection.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low to very low confidence in the findings. Some participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies did not report important outcomes such as quality of life or death, and the evidence does not cover all ages, genotypes, or treatment combinations. All trials were small, which limits reliability.\n\nWhat does this mean for people with sickle cell disease?\nAt present we cannot say that hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, or blood transfusions reliably protect kidney health in SCD. Clinicians and patients should be aware of the uncertainty and the need for larger, longer‑term trials before these treatments can be recommended for kidney protection.\n\nWhat is the currency of the evidence?\nOur search was completed in 2023 and no new randomised trials on these interventions and kidney outcomes have been published since then.",

In addition, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Key messages –\" should be re‑worded as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\").\n2. **Undefined technical term** – \"glomerular filtration rate\" appears without explanation. Readers may not know what this means.\n   *Rewrite*: \"glomerular filtration rate (the test that measures how well the kidneys filter blood)\".\n3. **Long, dense sentence** – \"Kidney damage in SCD is called sickle cell nephropathy. It can appear early – even in children – as tiny amounts of protein in the urine (microalbuminuria) or as a reduced ability of the kidney’s filtering units (the glomeruli) to work properly.\" This can be split for easier reading.\n   *Rewrite*: \"Kidney damage in SCD is called sickle cell nephropathy. It can appear early – even in children – as tiny amounts of protein in the urine (microalbuminuria). It can also show up as a reduced ability of the kidney’s filtering units (the glomeruli) to work properly.\"\n4. **Excessive passive voice** – The draft contains 24 passive constructions (far above the typical range), which can obscure who is doing what (e.g., \"No serious side‑effects were reported.\").\n   *Rewrite*: \"The trial reported no serious side‑effects.\" Apply this change to all passive sentences.\n5. **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – The text uses many noun clusters (e.g., \"the captopril study reported outcomes after six months\"). Converting some nouns to verbs improves flow.\n   *Rewrite*: \"The captopril study measured outcomes after six months.\"\nAddressing these points will bring the PLS into full compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients.\n\nMetrics support these suggestions: passive_voice = 24 (BEYOND_P90), nouns = 241 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words = 149 (BEYOND_P90), and long_words = 206 (BEYOND_P90) indicate the draft is more passive, noun‑heavy, and uses many complex/long words than typical Cochrane PLSs. Reducing passive constructions, simplifying vocabulary, and breaking long sentences will align the draft with typical readability ranges (e.g., target SMOG <12, long_words <122).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is 754 words (within the 850‑word limit) and scores well on readability (Flesch Reading Ease 52, words per sentence 21.5). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in six metrics: passive_voice (24, beyond P90), nouns (241, beyond P90), complex_words_dc (299, beyond P90), complex_words (149, beyond P90), long_words (206, beyond P90), and smog_index (14.4, beyond P90). These indicate the draft is overly passive, noun‑heavy, and uses many complex/long words, which reduces clarity for a lay audience. Larger, longer‑term trials are needed, and the document should be revised accordingly."
