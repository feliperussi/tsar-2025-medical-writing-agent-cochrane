  "draft": "Do blood transfusions, hydroxyurea (a medicine that reduces sickle‑cell crises), or ACE inhibitors (blood‑pressure medicines) prevent or slow chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease?\n\nKey messages –\n- The current evidence does not let us say whether blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, or ACE inhibitors protect kidney health in sickle cell disease; small studies suggest hydroxyurea might improve urine concentration and ACE inhibitors might lower protein in the urine, but overall effects remain uncertain and serious side‑effects were not reported.\n- No randomised trials have examined blood transfusions for kidney protection, and the few trials of hydroxyurea or ACE inhibitors were short, involved few participants, and did not assess important outcomes such as quality of life or death.\n- Larger, well‑designed, longer‑term studies – especially in older children and adults – are needed to determine whether these treatments can protect kidney health and to identify any potential harms.\n\nWhy are kidney problems a concern for people with sickle cell disease?\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition. A person inherits two abnormal copies of the gene that makes haemoglobin – the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. Because the red cells are misshapen, they can block tiny blood vessels, causing pain, organ damage, lung problems and a shorter life expectancy. One organ that often gets hurt is the kidney.\nKidney damage in SCD is called sickle cell nephropathy. It can start early – even in children – and shows up as microalbuminuria (tiny amounts of protein in the urine) or as a reduced ability of the kidney’s filtering units (the glomeruli) to work properly. Over time this can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD), which means the kidneys work poorly for at least three months. If CKD worsens, it can progress to larger protein loss (proteinuria) and eventually end‑stage renal disease, where the kidneys fail completely. About 12 % of people with sickle cell nephropathy may reach this stage.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover whether hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, red blood cell transfusions, or any combination of these can prevent or lessen kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with SCD, and whether they are safe for this purpose.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared any of the listed interventions with a control (placebo or usual care). Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our searches were completed in 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three trials that together enrolled 385 participants with SCD.\n- One trial compared hydroxyurea with placebo in 193 children aged 9–18 months. Hydroxyurea may help the kidney concentrate urine, but we are very uncertain whether it improves glomerular filtration rate (GFR) – a test that shows how well the kidneys filter waste from the blood. The trial did not show clear effects on acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospitalisation, and no serious side‑effects were reported.\n- A second trial compared the ACE inhibitor captopril with placebo in 22 adults who had normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. Over six months we did not see a clear reduction in protein loss or preservation of kidney function. No serious side‑effects were reported.\n- A third trial compared the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with vitamin C in 170 children aged 1–18 years who had normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. After one month both groups showed a drop in protein loss, making it unclear whether lisinopril had any specific benefit. No serious side‑effects were reported.\nNo trial examined red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions for kidney protection.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are only low‑to‑very‑low confident in the findings. Some participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies did not report important outcomes like quality of life or death, and the evidence does not cover all ages, genotypes, or treatment combinations. All trials were small, which limits reliability.\n\nWhat does this mean for people with sickle cell disease?\nAt present we cannot say that hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, or blood transfusions reliably protect kidney health in SCD. Clinicians and patients should be aware of the uncertainty and the need for larger, longer‑term trials before these treatments can be recommended for kidney protection.\n\nWhat is the currency of the evidence?\nOur search was completed in 2023 and no new randomised trials on these interventions and kidney outcomes have been published since then.",

Suggested rewrites: • Break the long bullet into two shorter points. • Change passive phrasing to active (e.g., \"We call kidney damage in SCD sickle cell nephropathy\"). • Simplify noun‑dense sentences by using verbs and shorter clauses. • Replace parenthetical definitions with inline phrasing (e.g., \"hydroxyurea, a medicine that reduces sickle‑cell crises,\"). • Shorten the title to \"Do blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, or ACE inhibitors prevent or slow chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease?\" These changes will improve readability and align the draft with the style guide. The PLS evaluation also shows high passive voice (28 instances, beyond P90), excessive nouns (250, beyond P90) and many complex/long words, confirming the need for the above edits.",
