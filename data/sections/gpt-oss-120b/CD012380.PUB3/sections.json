  "key_messages": [
    "The current evidence does not allow us to say whether blood transfusions, hydroxyurea (a medication that reduces sickle‑cell crises), or ACE inhibitors (medicines that lower blood pressure) can prevent or slow chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease; small studies suggest hydroxyurea might improve the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine and ACE inhibitors might lower protein in the urine, but overall effects on kidney function remain uncertain and serious side effects were not reported.",
    "No randomised controlled trials have examined blood transfusions for kidney protection, and the few trials that looked at hydroxyurea or ACE inhibitors were short‑term, involved few participants, and did not assess important outcomes such as quality of life or death.",
    "Because the existing research is limited and uncertain, larger, well‑designed, longer‑term studies are needed—especially in older children and adults—to determine whether these treatments can protect kidney health in sickle cell disease and to identify any potential harms."

      "subheading": "Why are kidney problems a concern for people with sickle cell disease?",
      "content": "Sickle disease (SCD) is a genetic condition where a person inherits two abnormal copies of the gene that makes haemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. Because the red cells are misshapen, they can block tiny blood vessels, causing pain, damage to organs, lung problems and a shorter life expectancy. One of the organs that often gets hurt is the kidney.\n\nKidney damage in SCD is called sickle cell nephropathy. It can start early – even in children – and shows up as tiny amounts of protein in the urine (called microalbuminuria) or as a reduced ability of the \"filtering units\" of the kidney (the glomeruli) to work properly. Over time this can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD), which means the kidneys are not working well for at least three months. If CKD gets worse, it can progress to proteinuria (larger amounts of protein in the urine) and eventually end‑stage renal disease, where the kidneys fail completely. About 12 % of people with sickle cell nephropathy may reach this stage.\n\nDoctors have tried several ways to protect the kidneys in SCD, such as:\n* **Hydroxyurea: A medicine that reduces the number of sickled red cells.\n* **Angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)** – drugs that lower blood pressure inside the tiny kidney vessels and can reduce protein loss in the urine.\n* **Red blood cell transfusions** – giving healthy blood cells to replace the sickled ones.\nThese treatments are used for other problems in SCD, but it is not clear how well they work specifically to prevent or slow kidney damage."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to discover whether any of the above interventions – hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors, red blood cell transfusions, or combinations of them – can prevent or lessen kidney complications or chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease. In other words, they set out to answer the question: *Do these treatments keep the kidneys healthier in SCD, and are they safe to use for this purpose?*"

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review identified three randomised controlled trials involving a total of 385 participants with sickle cell disease. One trial enrolled 193 children aged 9 to 18 months and compared hydroxyurea with placebo; a second trial included 22 adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria and compared the ACE inhibitor captopril with placebo; and a third trial recruited 170 children aged 1 to 18 years with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria and compared the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with vitamin C. The captopril study reported outcomes after six months, the lisinopril study after one month, and the duration of the hydroxyurea study was not specified. Funding sources and the countries where the trials were conducted were not reported. No trials examined red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions for preventing or reducing kidney complications. Hydroxyurea may slightly improve urine concentration in young children, but we are very uncertain about its effect on kidney filtration rate or serious complications such as acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospital stays. For adults, it is unclear whether captopril reduces protein in the urine or helps preserve kidney function, and for children it is also unclear whether lisinopril reduces protein in the urine."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and the studies were very small.",
