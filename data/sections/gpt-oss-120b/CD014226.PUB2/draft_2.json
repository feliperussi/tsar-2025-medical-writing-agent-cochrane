  "draft": "Is fenestrated endovascular repair (a minimally invasive graft with openings to keep blood flow to kidney arteries) better than open surgery or no operation for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (a bulging of the main belly artery)?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- We could not determine whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) (a minimally invasive graft with openings to keep blood flow to kidney arteries) is better than open surgical repair (OSR) (traditional surgery to replace the aorta) or no operation for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) (a bulging of the main belly artery near the kidneys) because we found no eligible randomized controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to different treatments). Therefore the benefits and harms are unknown.\n- The missing studies show how hard it is to research complex AAAs. These aneurysms are rare and come in many shapes, so recruiting enough participants for high‑quality trials is difficult.\n- Future research should aim to run well‑designed randomized controlled trials that directly compare FEVAR with open surgery or conservative management to find any advantages, risks, and long‑term outcomes.\n\nWhat are abdominal aortic aneurysms and why are they a problem?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulging, weakened part of the main blood vessel (the aorta) that runs through the belly. If the wall stretches too much, it can burst, which can be fatal. Most AAAs are below the kidneys (infrarenal), but some are close to the kidney arteries, making them harder to treat safely.\n\nWhat are the treatment options for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms?\n- Open surgical repair (OSR) – a traditional operation where the surgeon opens the abdomen, removes the damaged aorta segment, and replaces it with a synthetic tube.\n- Fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) – a less invasive method that uses a thin tube placed through a small cut in the groin. The tube delivers a graft with tiny openings so blood can still flow to the kidneys and other arteries.\n- Conservative (non‑operative) management – careful monitoring without surgery, used when surgery risks outweigh benefits.\nEach approach has potential benefits and harms, and we do not know which is best for AAAs near the kidney arteries.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether FEVAR is safer or more effective than open surgery or non‑operative care for people with complex AAAs. We planned to compare death rates, need for further procedures, kidney problems, hospital stay length, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched databases for studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or non‑operative care for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. We combined any results we found and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible trials, so no studies were included and no participants were examined. Since no studies met the criteria, we could not gather details about study length, funding, participants’ ages or health, where the studies were done, or how the two treatments compare.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be sure about the outcomes.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current up to our search in March 2023.",

So we do not know the benefits or harms.\"\n2. **Vague description of the review methods** – The phrase “combined any results we found and rated our confidence in the evidence” is unclear for patients. *Suggested rewrite*: \"We combined the results of any studies we found and assessed how confident we are in the evidence.\"\n3. **High use of specialised vocabulary (complex_words_dc = 229, well above the typical <160)** – Terms such as “fenestrated”, “endovascular”, “conservative”, and “randomized controlled trials” are not everyday words. Re‑phrase them in plain language, e.g., “fenestrated” → “with small openings”, “endovascular” → “through a blood vessel”, “conservative (non‑operative) management” → “watchful waiting”, and keep the brief definition in parentheses. These changes will lower the Dale‑Chall unfamiliar‑word count, shorten the longest sentence, and make the methods understandable, bringing the summary in line with Cochrane plain‑language standards.",

The only notable deviation is the high complex_words_dc count (229, P90), indicating many unfamiliar words; simplifying terminology will improve accessibility."
