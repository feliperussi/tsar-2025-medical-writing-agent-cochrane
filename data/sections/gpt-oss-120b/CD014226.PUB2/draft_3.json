  "draft": "Is fenestrated endovascular repair (a minimally invasive graft with openings to keep blood flow to kidney arteries) better than open surgery or no operation for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (a bulging of the main belly artery)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We could not tell whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR)—a minimally invasive graft with openings for the kidney arteries—is better than open surgical repair (OSR) or no surgery for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) because we found no eligible randomized trials. So the benefits and harms are unknown.\n- The lack of studies shows how hard it is to research complex AAAs. These aneurysms are rare and come in many shapes, making it difficult to recruit enough participants for high‑quality trials.\n- Future research should run well‑designed randomized trials that directly compare FEVAR with open surgery or watchful waiting to find any advantages, risks, and long‑term outcomes.\n\nWhat are abdominal aortic aneurysms and why are they a problem?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulging, weakened area in the main blood vessel (the aorta) that runs through the belly. When the wall stretches too far, it can burst, which is often fatal. Most AAAs occur below the kidneys, but some grow close to the kidneys’ blood vessels, making them harder to fix safely.\n\nWhat are the treatment options for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms?\n- Open surgical repair (OSR) – a traditional operation where the surgeon opens the abdomen, removes the damaged part of the aorta and replaces it with a synthetic tube.\n- Fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) – a less invasive technique that uses a thin tube (catheter) inserted through a small cut in the groin. The tube delivers a graft that has small windows (fenestrations) so blood can still flow to the kidneys and other important arteries.\n- Watchful waiting (conservative management) – careful monitoring without surgery, used when the risks of an operation outweigh the benefits.\nEach option has potential benefits and harms, and we do not know which is best for AAAs near the kidney arteries.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover whether FEVAR is safer or more effective than open surgery or watchful waiting for people with these complex AAAs. We planned to compare death rates, need for further procedures, kidney problems, length of hospital stay, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared FEVAR with open surgery or watchful waiting for complex AAAs. We combined any results we found and assessed how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible randomized or quasi‑randomized trials, so there were zero included studies and no participants. Because no studies met our criteria, we could not extract information on study length, funding, participant ages or health, where the studies were done, or details of the two treatments.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be sure about the outcomes.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to our search in March 2023.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the subheading \"Key messages:\" is not phrased as a question (all other section headings are questions). In addition, several clarity issues could confuse readers: (1) The first key‑message sentence is long and packs two ideas together, making it hard to follow. (2) The methods paragraph says \"We combined any results we found\" even though no results were found, which is misleading. (3) The limitations statement is vague and does not convey the very low confidence that results from having zero studies. Suggested rewrites: • Change the heading to a question, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\" • Split the long key‑message sentence: \"We could not tell whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR)—a minimally invasive graft with openings for the kidney arteries—is better than open surgical repair (OSR) or no surgery for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). This is because we found no eligible randomised trials, so the benefits and harms remain unknown.\" • Clarify the methods: \"We searched several medical databases for studies that compared FEVAR with open surgery or watchful waiting for complex AAAs. Because no eligible studies were found, there were no results to combine or analyse.\" • Strengthen the limitation wording: \"We have very low confidence in the evidence because no eligible trials were identified, leaving us unable to assess the benefits or harms of the interventions.\" These changes address the mandatory style requirement and improve readability for patients. The PLS evaluation shows the draft is otherwise well‑aligned with typical PLS patterns (e.g., active voice 52, words per sentence 19.9, readability scores in the P25‑P75 range), so the primary issues are stylistic rather than metric‑driven.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation indicates strong conformity to typical Cochrane PLS patterns: readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 51.7, FKGL 10.97) are within the P25‑P75 range; active voice (52) and pronoun use (37) are in the upper quartile; sentence length (19.85 words) and passive voice (10) are typical. No metric deviates markedly, confirming the draft’s overall linguistic quality; the main concerns are the non‑question heading and a few clarity‑related phrasing issues."
