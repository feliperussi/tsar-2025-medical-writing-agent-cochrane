  "draft": "Is fenestrated endovascular repair (a minimally invasive graft with openings to keep blood flow to kidney arteries) better than open surgery or no operation for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (a bulging of the main belly artery)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- We could not answer whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) (a minimally invasive graft with openings to keep blood flow to kidney arteries) is better than open surgical repair (OSR) (traditional surgery to replace the aorta) or no operation for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) (a bulging of the main belly artery near the kidneys) because no eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (studies that randomly assign participants to different treatments) were found, so the benefits and harms remain unknown.\n- The lack of studies highlights how difficult it is to research complex AAAs, which are uncommon and vary in shape, making it challenging to recruit enough participants for high‑quality trials.\n- Future research should focus on conducting well‑designed RCTs that directly compare FEVAR with open surgery or conservative management to determine any potential advantages, risks, and long‑term outcomes.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat are abdominal aortic aneurysms and why are they a problem?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulging, weakened area in the main blood vessel (the aorta) that runs through the belly. When the wall of the aorta stretches out, it can become thin and may burst, which is life‑threatening. Most AAAs occur below the kidneys (infrarenal), but some grow close to the kidneys’ blood vessels, making them harder to fix safely.\n\nWhat are the treatment options for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms?\nDoctors can treat AAAs in three main ways:\n1. Open surgical repair (OSR) – a traditional operation where the surgeon opens the abdomen, removes the damaged part of the aorta and replaces it with a synthetic tube.\n2. Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) – a less invasive technique that uses a thin tube (catheter) inserted through a small groin incision. The tube carries a special graft that has tiny windows (fenestrations) or notches (scallops) so that blood can still flow to the kidneys and other important arteries.\n3. Conservative (non‑operative) management – careful monitoring without surgery, used when the risks of an operation outweigh the benefits.\nEach approach has potential benefits and harms, and it is not clear which is best for AAAs that are close to the kidney arteries.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to discover whether FEVAR is safer or more effective than open surgery or non‑operative care for people with these complex AAAs. Specifically, they planned to compare outcomes such as death rates, need for further procedures, kidney problems, length of hospital stay, and quality of life.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or non‑operative care for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms, combined any results we found, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWe found no eligible randomized or quasi‑randomized trials, so there were zero included studies and no participants. Because no studies met the criteria, we could not extract information on study duration, funding sources, population characteristics (such as age, gender or disease severity), study settings, or details of fenestrated endovascular repair versus open surgical or conservative management.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the section subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement 5.3. In addition, the text is noun‑heavy and contains many long, complex words, which makes it harder for a lay reader to follow. The most important improvements are:\n1. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Key messages\". Problem: Not a question, so readers cannot instantly see what information will be answered. Rewrite: \"What are the main findings?\".\n2. **Noun‑heavy sentence** – Quote: \"We found no eligible randomized or quasi‑randomized trials, so there were zero included studies and no participants.\" Problem: Stacks several nouns (trials, studies, participants) making the sentence dense. Rewrite: \"We found no eligible trials, so no studies were included and no participants were examined.\".\n3. **Complex / long words** – Quote: \"fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) – a less invasive technique that uses a thin tube (catheter) inserted through a small groin incision.\" Problem: Uses technical terms and long words (fenestrated, endovascular, aneurysm) without simpler alternatives. Rewrite: \"fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) – a less invasive method that uses a thin tube placed through a small cut in the groin.\".\n4. **Long sentence (>30 words)** – Quote: \"Because no studies met the criteria, we could not extract information on study duration, funding sources, population characteristics (such as age, gender or disease severity), study settings, and details of fenestrated endovascular repair versus open surgical or conservative management.\" Problem: Over 30 words, confusing for patients. Rewrite: \"Since no studies met the criteria, we could not gather details about how long the studies lasted, who funded them, the participants’ ages or health, where the studies were done, or how the two treatments compare.\".\nThese changes address the most pressing clarity issues and also bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns. Metrics support the need for simplification: the draft has 167 nouns (P90, far above the median), 126 complex words (P90), a SMOG index of 14 (P90), and a high count of long words (185, P90). Reducing nouns and complex words will lower these scores and improve readability. Overall, the draft must revise subheadings into questions and simplify language before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights five features deviating from typical PLS patterns: nouns (167, P90), SMOG index (14, P90), complex words (260 Dale‑Chall, 126 total, both P90) and long words (185, P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long, complex words, suggesting a need to simplify language and reduce noun density."
