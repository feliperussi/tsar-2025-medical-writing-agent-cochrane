  "key_messages": [
    "We could not answer whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) (a minimally invasive graft with openings to keep blood flow to kidney arteries) is better than open surgical repair (OSR) (traditional surgery to replace the aorta) or no operation for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) (a bulging of the main belly artery near the kidneys) because no eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (studies that randomly assign participants to different treatments) were found, so the benefits and harms remain unknown.",
    "The lack of studies highlights how difficult it is to research complex AAAs, which are uncommon and vary in shape, making it challenging to recruit enough participants for high‑quality trials.",
    "Future research should focus on conducting well‑designed RCTs that directly compare FEVAR with open surgery or conservative management to determine any potential advantages, risks, and long‑term outcomes."

      "subheading": "What are abdominal aortic aneurysms and why are they a problem?",
      "content": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulging, weakened area in the main blood vessel (the aorta) that runs through the belly. When the wall of the aorta stretches out, it can become thin and may burst, which is life‑threatening. Most AAAs occur below the kidneys (infrarenal), but some grow close to the kidneys’ blood vessels, making them harder to fix safely."

    {
      "subheading": "What are the treatment options for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms?",
      "content": "Doctors can treat AAAs in three main ways:\n1. **Open surgical repair (OSR)** – a traditional operation where the surgeon opens the abdomen, removes the damaged part of the aorta and replaces it with a synthetic tube.\n2. **Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR)** – a less invasive technique that uses a thin tube (catheter) inserted through a small groin incision. The tube carries a special graft that has tiny windows (fenestrations) or notches (scallops) so that blood can still flow to the kidneys and other important arteries.\n3. **Conservative (non‑operative) management** – careful monitoring without surgery, used when the risks of an operation outweigh the benefits.\nEach approach has potential benefits and harms, and it is not clear which is best for AAAs that are close to the kidney arteries."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to discover whether FEVAR is safer or more effective than open surgery or non‑operative care for people with these complex AAAs. Specifically, they planned to compare outcomes such as death rates, need for further procedures, kidney problems, length of hospital stay, and quality of life."

      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or non‑operative care for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms, combined any results we found, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found no eligible randomized or quasi‑randomized trials, so there were zero included studies and no participants. Because no studies met the criteria, we could not extract information on study duration, funding sources, population characteristics (such as age, gender or disease severity), study settings, or details of fenestrated endovascular repair versus open surgical or conservative management."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.",
