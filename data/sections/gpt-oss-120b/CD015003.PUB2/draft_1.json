  "draft": "Does taking colchicine (a low‑cost anti‑inflammation medicine) help prevent heart attacks, strokes and other heart problems in people who have never had heart disease?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Colchicine (a low‑cost anti‑inflammatory medicine) taken by people who have never had heart disease may lower the chance of dying from any cause, but the evidence is very uncertain; it does not clearly reduce heart attacks (myocardial infarction) or strokes (a sudden loss of brain function due to blocked blood flow), and it may increase the risk of diarrhoea (watery bowel movements).\n- Most of the studies were small, had methodological problems, and many focused on conditions other than heart disease, so the overall quality of the evidence is low and the findings cannot be applied confidently to the general population.\n- More large, well‑designed randomised trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive the medicine or not) that specifically look at heart‑related outcomes and track side effects over longer periods are needed to determine whether the drug is truly beneficial or harmful for primary prevention of cardiovascular events.\n\nINTRODUCTION / AIMS\nWhy is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease a major health problem?\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) happens when fatty plaques build up inside arteries. These plaques can narrow the vessels or break open, causing blockages that lead to heart attacks, strokes, or other serious complications. ACVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, affecting millions of people. Current prevention methods include lifestyle changes (healthy diet, exercise), cholesterol‑lowering drugs (statins), and medicines that stop blood clots, but many individuals still develop the disease, highlighting the need for additional, affordable strategies.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about colchicine?\nColchicine is an inexpensive anti‑inflammatory drug traditionally used for gout. The review set out to determine whether giving colchicine to adults who have never had a heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular event (primary prevention) can reduce the risk of dying, having a heart attack, or having a stroke, and whether it causes any important side‑effects. In other words, the authors compared colchicine with placebo, other anti‑inflammatory agents, or usual care to see if it is safe and effective for preventing heart problems in the general population.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched for studies that compared colchicine with placebo, other drugs or usual care in adults without prior cardiovascular disease, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nThe review identified fifteen randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,721 participants (1,412 analysed). All participants were adults without pre‑existing cardiovascular disease, representing the general population. Follow‑up periods ranged from 4 weeks to 728 weeks. Every trial tested oral colchicine, compared with placebo, methotrexate, or usual care/no treatment; no study compared colchicine with non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. Many of the trials were originally designed to study liver disease rather than heart outcomes. The abstract does not give details on funding sources, country locations, or participant demographics such as age or gender.\n\nMain results: Primary prevention with colchicine\nColchicine may reduce the chance of dying from any cause when used for primary prevention of heart disease, but the evidence is very uncertain. It probably has little or no effect on non‑fatal heart attacks, strokes, cardiovascular death, or atrial fibrillation, and we are very uncertain about those outcomes. Colchicine probably increases the risk of diarrhoea, although the certainty of this finding is also low. For other possible harms such as seizures or mental confusion, the evidence suggests little or no difference but remains very uncertain. Overall, the current research provides very uncertain information, so we cannot reliably say whether colchicine helps or harms people without existing cardiovascular events.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nCURRENCY\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search.",

Sections such as METHODS, RESULTS, LIMITATIONS and CURRENCY are headings, not questions, which breaks the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text contains several clarity‑reducing problems:\n1. **Passive voice** – e.g., \"The evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search.\" This hides who performed the update and makes the sentence harder to follow.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We updated the evidence to May 2023.\"\n2. **Nominalised, noun‑heavy headings** – e.g., \"Main results: Primary prevention with colchicine\" reads like a noun phrase and does not guide the reader.\n   *Rewrite:* \"What are the main results for primary prevention with colchicine?\"\n3. **Overly long sentence** – e.g., \"We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\"\n   *Rewrite:* \"We are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, and because the studies were very small.\"\n4. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – the sections should be re‑worded as questions to match the guide, for example:\n   *METHODS* → \"How did we find and assess the studies?\"\n   *RESULTS* → \"What did we find?\"\n   *LIMITATIONS* → \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n   *CURRENCY* → \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"\n5. **Paragraph structure** – some sections contain wall‑of‑text paragraphs. Break them into shorter paragraphs (2‑3 sentences each) and keep a blank line between headings and paragraphs.\nThese changes address the most important clarity and style issues and bring the draft into compliance with the Master Style Guide. The PLS evaluation shows 17 passive constructions (P75) and high nominalisation (25, P90), confirming the need to shift to more active, verb‑focused language. Complex‑word counts (152) and long‑word counts (222) are also beyond typical ranges, supporting the suggested simplifications.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits (671 words) and overall conforms to typical PLS patterns, but shows deviations in nominalisation (25, P90), noun count (189, P90), SMOG index (14.7, P90), and complex/long word counts (152 and 222, both BEYOND_P90). Passive voice is high (17, P75) and active voice is only just within the median range. These metric outliers align with the editorial observations of excessive noun‑heavy phrasing, passive constructions, and complex vocabulary."
