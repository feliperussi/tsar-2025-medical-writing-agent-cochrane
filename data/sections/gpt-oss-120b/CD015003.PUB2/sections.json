  "key_messages": [
    "Colchicine (a low‑cost anti‑inflammatory medicine) taken by people who have never had heart disease may lower the chance of dying from any cause, but the evidence is very uncertain; it does not clearly reduce heart attacks (myocardial infarction) or strokes (a sudden loss of brain function due to blocked blood flow), and it may increase the risk of diarrhoea (watery bowel movements).",
    "Most of the studies were small, had methodological problems, and many focused on conditions other than heart disease, so the overall quality of the evidence is low and the findings cannot be applied confidently to the general population.",
    "More large, well‑designed randomised trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive the medicine or not) that specifically look at heart‑related outcomes and track side effects over longer periods are needed to determine whether colchicine is truly beneficial or harmful for primary prevention of cardiovascular events."

      "subheading": "Why is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease a major health problem?",
      "content": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) happens when fatty plaques build up inside arteries. These plaques can narrow the vessels or break open, causing blockages that lead to heart attacks, strokes, or other serious complications. ACVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, affecting millions of people. Current prevention methods include lifestyle changes (healthy diet, exercise), cholesterol‑lowering drugs (statins), and medicines that stop blood clots, but many individuals still develop the disease, highlighting the need for additional, affordable strategies."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out about colchicine?",
      "content": "Colchicine is an inexpensive anti‑inflammatory drug traditionally used for gout. The review set out to determine whether giving colchicine to adults who have never had a heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular event (primary prevention) can reduce the risk of dying, having a heart attack, or having a stroke, and whether it causes any important side‑effects. In other words, the authors compared colchicine with placebo, other anti‑inflammatory agents, or usual care to see if it is safe and effective for preventing cardiovascular events in the general population."

      "subheading": "What did we find ? ",
      "content": "The review identified fifteen randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,721 participants (1,412 analysed). All participants were adults without pre‑existing cardiovascular disease, representing the general population. Follow‑up periods ranged from 4 weeks to 728 weeks. Every trial tested oral colchicine, compared with placebo, methotrexate, or usual care/no treatment; no study compared colchicine with non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. Many of the trials were originally designed to study liver disease rather than heart outcomes. The abstract does not give details on funding sources, country locations, or participant demographics such as age or gender."

      "subheading": "Main results: Primary prevention with colchicine",
      "content": "Colchicine may reduce the chance of dying from any cause when used for primary prevention of heart disease, but the evidence is very uncertain. It probably has little or no effect on non‑fatal heart attacks, strokes, cardiovascular death, or atrial fibrillation, and we are very uncertain about those outcomes. Colchicine probably increases the risk of diarrhoea, although the certainty of this finding is also low. For other possible harms such as seizures or mental confusion, the evidence suggests little or no difference but remains very uncertain. Overall, the current research provides very uncertain information, so we cannot reliably say whether colchicine helps or harms people without existing cardiovascular events."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
