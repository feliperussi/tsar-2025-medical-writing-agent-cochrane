  "draft": "Is treatment with hormone medicines that lower estrogen (GnRH analogues) effective for reducing pain and safe for bone health compared with other therapies in women with endometriosis?\n\nKey messages:\n- GnRH analogues (hormone medicines that lower estrogen) may reduce pelvic pain, period pain and pain during sex, but we have only limited confidence in this result.\n- They probably increase the chance of hot flushes (sudden feelings of warmth) and may lower bone mineral density – a measure of bone strength.\n- Very few reliable studies compare GnRH analogues with other options such as other hormone medicines, intra‑uterine devices or painkillers, and none compare them with no treatment.\n\nWhat is endometriosis and how is it usually treated?\nEndometriosis affects about 6‑11 % of women of reproductive age. Tissue that looks like the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or the pelvic lining. This tissue can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), chronic pelvic pain and may make it harder to become pregnant. Because the tissue still responds to hormones, it swells and bleeds each month, leading to inflammation and scar tissue.\nDoctors usually treat symptoms with hormonal medicines that suppress the menstrual cycle. These include oral contraceptives, progestogen pills, intra‑uterine devices that release progestogen, and the hormone drug danazol. GnRH analogues (GnRHas) work by temporarily turning off the body’s production of hormones that stimulate the ovaries, which reduces the growth and activity of the endometrial tissue and can lessen pain. A known side‑effect of GnRHas is a reduction in bone mineral density, which can increase the risk of osteoporosis if treatment is prolonged.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe asked two main questions: (1) How effective are GnRH analogues at relieving painful symptoms compared with other hormonal treatments, placebo or no treatment? (2) How safe are they, especially regarding changes in bone mineral density and other side‑effects? We also looked at overall quality of life, the most troublesome symptom for each woman and patient satisfaction.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and trial registries up to May 2022. We also checked reference lists and contacted study authors and experts. We included randomised controlled trials that compared GnRH analogues with other hormonal options, placebo, no treatment or GnRH analogues plus calcium‑regulating agents (calcium supplements).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 72 trials that enrolled 7,355 women with endometriosis. The trials compared GnRH analogues with several other treatments, such as placebo, the hormone danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, intra‑uterine progestogens, gestrinone, or GnRH combined with calcium supplements. Follow‑up ranged from 3 to 12 months.\n- Compared with placebo, GnRH analogues may reduce pelvic pain, period pain and pain during intercourse, but we have only limited confidence in this result.\n- Compared with placebo, GnRH analogues may increase the chance of hot flushes, but we are not sure how large this effect is.\n- When compared with danazol, we are uncertain whether GnRH analogues affect pain relief.\n- Adding calcium supplements to GnRH treatment may reduce the small loss of bone strength seen with GnRH alone, but we are not sure about this finding.\n- No eligible studies examined GnRH analogues versus no treatment, analgesics or intra‑uterine progestogens.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were small, and some participants knew which treatment they were getting. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in. These problems give us little confidence in the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence includes studies up to May 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nWe cannot be sure how well GnRH analogues relieve pain or how much they affect bone health because the existing studies are limited and uncertain. Women should discuss the potential benefits and side‑effects with their healthcare provider and be aware that more robust research is needed to provide clearer answers.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the sub‑heading format rule – the \"Key messages:\" heading is not phrased as a question. In addition, the text is noun‑heavy and contains many long, complex words, which the metrics flag (nouns = 207 > median, complex_words = 145, complex_words_dc = 291, long_words = 217). These reduce readability for patients. Suggested improvements:\n1. Change the heading to a question, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. Rewrite noun‑heavy sentences to use more verbs and fewer nouns, e.g., replace \"The trials compared GnRH analogues with several other treatments, such as placebo, the hormone danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, intra‑uterine progestogens, gestrinone, or GnRH combined with calcium supplements\" with \"We compared GnRH analogues to placebo, danazol, other progestogen medicines, gestrinone, and GnRH plus calcium supplements.\".\n3. Replace long, complex words with simpler alternatives, e.g., change \"temporarily turning off the body’s production of hormones that stimulate the ovaries\" to \"temporarily stopping the body’s production of hormones that stimulate the ovaries\".\n4. Shorten any sentences that exceed 30 words (e.g., the above sentence) to improve flow.\n5. Ensure active voice throughout (the draft already scores well on active voice, but keep this consistency). These changes will bring the draft into full compliance with the Master Style Guide and improve patient‑friendly readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and scores well on active voice and pronoun use, but deviates on several lexical metrics: nouns (207, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.6, beyond P90), complex words (145, beyond P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (291, beyond P90) and long words (217, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many long, complex words than typical PLSs, supporting the need for the suggested simplifications."
