  "draft": "Is treatment with hormone medicines that lower estrogen (GnRH analogues) effective for reducing pain and safe for bone health compared with other therapies in women with endometriosis?\n\nKey messages\n- GnRH analogues (hormone medicines that lower estrogen) may reduce pelvic pain, menstrual pain and pain during intercourse, but the evidence is uncertain – we are not sure how reliable the result is. They also increase the chance of hot flushes (sudden feelings of warmth) and may lower bone mineral density (BMD), a measure of bone strength.\n- Very few reliable studies compare GnRH analogues with other options such as other hormone medicines, intra‑uterine devices or painkillers, and none compare them with no treatment.\n- Because the current evidence is of low quality, we need well‑designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with longer follow‑up to clarify how effective GnRH analogues are for pain relief, how they affect bone health and what side‑effects occur.\n\nWhat is endometriosis and how is it usually treated?\nEndometriosis is a common condition that affects about 6‑11 % of women of reproductive age. Tissue that looks like the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or the pelvic lining. This tissue can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), chronic pelvic pain and may make it harder to become pregnant (infertility). Because the tissue still responds to hormones, it swells and bleeds each month, leading to inflammation and scar tissue. Doctors usually treat the symptoms with hormonal medicines that suppress the menstrual cycle. These include oral contraceptives, progestogen pills, intra‑uterine devices that release progestogen and drugs such as danazol. GnRH analogues (hormone medicines that lower estrogen) work by temporarily turning off the body’s production of hormones that stimulate the ovaries, which reduces the growth and activity of the endometrial tissue and can lessen pain. A known side‑effect of GnRH analogues is a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) – the amount of mineral (mainly calcium) in the bones that makes them strong – which can increase the risk of osteoporosis if treatment is prolonged.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about GnRH analogues for endometriosis?\nWe set two main questions: (1) How effective are GnRH analogues at relieving painful symptoms of endometriosis compared with other hormonal treatments, placebo or no treatment? (2) How safe are they, especially regarding changes in bone mineral density and other side‑effects? We also looked at whether GnRH analogues improve overall quality of life, the most troublesome symptom for each woman and patient satisfaction.\n\nMethods\nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and trial registries up to May 2022. We also checked reference lists and contacted study authors and experts. We included randomised controlled trials that compared GnRH analogues with other hormonal options, placebo, no treatment or with GnRH analogues plus calcium‑regulating agents.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 72 trials that included 7,355 women with endometriosis. The trials compared GnRH analogues with placebo, danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, intra‑uterine progestogens, gestrinone, or with GnRH analogues plus calcium‑regulating agents. Follow‑up times ranged from three to twelve months.\nWe found that GnRH analogues probably reduce pelvic pain compared with placebo, but the evidence is uncertain. We also found that GnRH analogues probably increase the chance of hot flushes compared with placebo, and the evidence is uncertain. When we compared GnRH analogues with danazol, the evidence did not show a clear difference in pain relief. Adding calcium‑regulating agents to GnRH analogues may lessen the small loss of bone density that occurs with GnRH alone, but we are not sure about this result. No eligible studies examined GnRH analogues versus no treatment, analgesics or intra‑uterine progestogens.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. Many studies were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and not all studies reported every outcome we wanted.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe included studies up to May 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nWe cannot be sure how well GnRH analogues relieve pain or how much they affect bone health because the existing studies are limited and uncertain. Women should discuss the potential benefits and side‑effects with their healthcare provider and consider that more robust research is needed to provide clearer answers.",

      "feedback": "Critical checks failed: (1) Not all subheadings are phrased as questions – e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Methods\", and \"Limitations of the evidence\" are statements, not questions. (2) Several statements overstate the certainty of the evidence, contradicting the source. For example, the draft says \"GnRH analogues probably reduce pelvic pain a lot\" and \"GnRH analogues probably increase the chance of hot flushes\", whereas the source describes the effects as \"may reduce\" and \"may be associated with a greater incidence\" with low‑certainty evidence. These inaccuracies mislead readers. The draft also uses noun‑heavy sentences and excessive nominalisation, reflected in the metric deviations (nouns 215 > median, nominalisations 23 > median), which reduce readability. Suggested improvements focus on re‑phrasing subheadings as questions, correcting certainty language, and simplifying noun‑heavy sentences.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Subheading format – Quote: \"Key messages\". Problem: Not a question, breaching style guide. Rewrite: \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. Subheading format – Quote: \"Methods\". Problem: Not a question. Rewrite: \"How did we conduct the review?\".\n3. Subheading format – Quote: \"Limitations of the evidence\". Problem: Not a question. Rewrite: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\".\n4. Overstating certainty – Quote: \"GnRH analogues probably reduce pelvic pain a lot compared with placebo, but the certainty of this evidence is low.\" Problem: Uses \"probably\" and \"a lot\" which imply higher confidence than the source (low‑certainty, may reduce). Rewrite: \"GnRH analogues may reduce pelvic pain compared with placebo, but the evidence is of low certainty.\".\n5. Overstating certainty – Quote: \"GnRH analogues probably increase the chance of hot flushes compared with placebo, and the evidence is uncertain.\" Problem: \"Probably\" suggests strong evidence; source says \"may be associated with a greater incidence\" with low certainty. Rewrite: \"GnRH analogues may increase the chance of hot flushes compared with placebo, but the evidence is uncertain (low certainty).\".\n\nThese changes will bring the PLS into compliance with the master style guide, ensure factual accuracy, and improve readability (metrics show high noun and nominalisation counts, which will be reduced by the suggested rewrites).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (733 words) and has moderate overall conformity. However, several metrics deviate strongly from typical PLS patterns: nouns (215 > median, BEYOND_P90), nominalisations (23 > median, P90), SMOG index (15.4 > median), and counts of complex and long words are all far above typical ranges. These indicate a noun‑heavy, complex style that hampers readability and aligns with the identified clarity issues."
