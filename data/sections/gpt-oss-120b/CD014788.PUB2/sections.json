  "plain_title": "Is treatment with hormone medicines that lower estrogen (GnRH analogues) effective for reducing pain and safe for bone health compared with other therapies in women with endometriosis?",
  "key_messages": [
    "GnRH analogues (hormone medicines that lower estrogen) may help reduce pelvic pain, menstrual pain, and pain during intercourse compared with a dummy treatment, but the evidence is weak and uncertain; they also appear to increase the chance of hot flushes (sudden feeling of warmth) and may lower bone mineral density (a measure of bone strength).",
    "There is very little reliable evidence comparing GnRH analogues with many other options such as other hormone medicines, intra‑uterine devices, or painkillers, and no studies compared them with no treatment at all.",
    "Because the current evidence is of low quality and often imprecise, well‑designed randomised trials with longer follow‑up are needed to clarify how effective GnRH analogues are for pain relief, how they affect bone health, and what side effects may occur."

      "subheading": "What is endometriosis and how is it usually treated?",
      "content": "Endometriosis is a common condition that affects about 6‑11 % of women of reproductive age. It occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or the tissue lining the pelvis. This misplaced tissue can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), chronic pelvic pain and may make it harder to become pregnant (infertility). Because the tissue still responds to hormones, it can swell and bleed each month, leading to inflammation and scar tissue. To relieve these symptoms, doctors use several approaches. Hormonal medicines that suppress the menstrual cycle are common; they include oral contraceptives, progestogen pills, intra‑uterine devices that release progestogen, and drugs such as danazol. Another class of medicines is gonadotropin‑releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas). GnRHas work by temporarily turning off the body’s production of the hormones that stimulate the ovaries, which reduces the growth and activity of the endometrial tissue and can lessen pain. A known side‑effect of GnRHas is a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) – the amount of mineral (mainly calcium) in the bones that makes them strong – which can increase the risk of osteoporosis if treatment is prolonged."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out about GnRH analogues for endometriosis?",
      "content": "The authors set out to answer two main questions: (1) How effective are GnRH analogues at relieving the painful symptoms of endometriosis compared with other hormonal treatments, placebo or no treatment? and (2) How safe are they, especially regarding changes in bone mineral density and other side‑effects? They also wanted to see whether GnRHas improve overall quality of life, the most troublesome symptom for each woman, and patient satisfaction. In short, the review examined whether the benefits of GnRHas for pain outweigh the risks, particularly the potential loss of bone strength."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 72 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 7,355 women with endometriosis, a condition that mainly affects women of reproductive age. All participants were women diagnosed with endometriosis. The trials compared gonadotropin‑releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues with a range of other hormonal treatments (placebo, danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, intra‑uterine progestogens, gestrinone) or with GnRH analogues combined with calcium‑regulating agents. Study follow‑up times varied, with some reporting outcomes after three months, others after six months, and at least one after twelve months. Information on the geographic locations of the studies or their funding sources was not reported."

      "subheading": "Main results: Effectiveness and safety of GnRH analogues",
      "content": "GnRH analogues probably reduce pelvic pain a lot compared with placebo, but the certainty of this evidence is low. They also probably increase the chance of hot flushes compared with placebo, again with low certainty. When compared with danazol, it is unclear whether GnRH analogues affect pain. Adding calcium‑regulating agents to GnRH analogues probably lessens the small loss of bone mineral density seen with GnRH alone, but confidence in this result is very low. No eligible studies examined GnRH analogues versus no treatment, analgesics, or intra‑uterine progestogens."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and the studies were very small.",
