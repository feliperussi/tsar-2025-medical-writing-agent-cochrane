  "draft": "Is treatment with hormone medicines that lower estrogen (GnRH analogues) effective for reducing pain and safe for bone health compared with other therapies in women with endometriosis?\n\n**Key messages**\n- GnRH analogues (hormone medicines that lower estrogen) may help reduce pelvic pain, menstrual pain, and pain during intercourse compared with a dummy treatment, but the evidence is weak and uncertain; they also appear to increase the chance of hot flushes (sudden feeling of warmth) and may lower bone mineral density (a measure of bone strength).\n- There is very little reliable evidence comparing GnRH analogues with many other options such as other hormone medicines, intra‑uterine devices, or painkillers, and no studies compared them with no treatment at all.\n- Because the current evidence is of low quality and often imprecise, well‑designed randomised trials with longer follow‑up are needed to clarify how effective GnRH analogues are for pain relief, how they affect bone health, and what side effects may occur.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is endometriosis and how is it usually treated?\nEndometriosis is a common condition that affects about 6‑11 % of women of reproductive age. It occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or the tissue lining the pelvis. This misplaced tissue can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), chronic pelvic pain and may make it harder to become pregnant (infertility). Because the tissue still responds to hormones, it can swell and bleed each month, leading to inflammation and scar tissue. To relieve these symptoms, doctors use several approaches. Hormonal medicines that suppress the menstrual cycle are common; they include oral contraceptives, progestogen pills, intra‑uterine devices that release progestogen, and drugs such as danazol. Another class of medicines is gonadotropin‑releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas). GnRHas work by temporarily turning off the body’s production of the hormones that stimulate the ovaries, which reduces the growth and activity of the endometrial tissue and can lessen pain. A known side‑effect of GnRHas is a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) – the amount of mineral (mainly calcium) in the bones that makes them strong – which can increase the risk of osteoporosis if treatment is prolonged.\nWhat did the review aim to find out about GnRH analogues for endometriosis?\nThe authors set out to answer two main questions: (1) How effective are GnRH analogues at relieving the painful symptoms of endometriosis compared with other hormonal treatments, placebo or no treatment? and (2) How safe are they, especially regarding changes in bone mineral density and other side‑effects? They also wanted to see whether GnRHas improve overall quality of life, the most troublesome symptom for each woman, and patient satisfaction. In short, the review examined whether the benefits of GnRHas for pain outweigh the risks, particularly the potential loss of bone strength.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies comparing GnRH analogues with other treatments or placebo in women with endometriosis, combined results on pain relief and bone density, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 72 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 7,355 women with endometriosis, a condition that mainly affects women of reproductive age. All participants were women diagnosed with endometriosis. The trials compared gonadotropin‑releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues with a range of other hormonal treatments (placebo, danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, intra‑uterine progestogens, gestrinone) or with GnRH analogues combined with calcium‑regulating agents. Study follow‑up times varied, with some reporting outcomes after three months, others after six months, and at least one after twelve months. Information on the geographic locations of the studies or their funding sources was not reported.\nMain results: Effectiveness and safety of GnRH analogues\nGnRH analogues probably reduce pelvic pain a lot compared with placebo, but the certainty of this evidence is low. They also probably increase the chance of hot flushes compared with placebo, again with low certainty. When compared with danazol, it is unclear whether GnRH analogues affect pain. Adding calcium‑regulating agents to GnRH analogues probably lessens the small loss of bone mineral density seen with GnRH alone, but confidence in this result is very low. No eligible studies examined GnRH analogues versus no treatment, analgesics, or intra‑uterine progestogens.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2022 of search.",

The PLS evaluation also shows a high number of passive constructions (19, beyond the typical range), excessive nominalisations (25) and an unusually high noun count (237) and readability scores (SMOG 15.9, complex words 179, long words 244), all of which make the text harder for patients to understand.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Key messages\". Problem: Not a question, breaching the Master Style Guide. Rewrite as: \"What are the main findings?\".\n2. **Passive voice** – Quote: \"GnRH analogues probably reduce pelvic pain a lot compared with placebo, but the certainty of this evidence is low.\" Problem: Uses passive‑like wording and vague agency. Rewrite: \"We found that GnRH analogues probably reduce pelvic pain compared with placebo, although the evidence is of low certainty.\" (similar changes throughout the Results section to bring active voice).\n3. **Nominalisation / noun‑heavy sentences** – Quote: \"Adding calcium‑regulating agents to GnRH analogues probably lessens the small loss of bone mineral density seen with GnRH alone, but confidence in this result is very low.\" Problem: Heavy noun phrase \"Adding calcium‑regulating agents…\". Rewrite: \"Calcium‑regulating agents probably reduce the small loss of bone density that occurs with GnRH alone, but we have very low confidence in this finding.\".\n4. **Complex / long words** – Quote: \"The trials compared gonadotropin‑releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues with a range of other hormonal treatments…\" Problem: Long technical terms and many multisyllabic words. Rewrite: \"The trials compared GnRH analogues with other hormone treatments such as placebo, danazol, progestogen pills, IUDs or gestrinone…\" (replace \"gonadotropin‑releasing hormone\" with the already‑defined abbreviation and use shorter synonyms).\n5. **Missing question‑style subheadings for other sections** – Quote: \"Methods\" and \"Limitations\". Problem: Not phrased as questions. Rewrite as: \"How did we find the evidence?\" and \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\".\n\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the Master Style Guide, lower the passive‑voice and noun counts, and improve readability scores, making the summary clearer for patients.",
