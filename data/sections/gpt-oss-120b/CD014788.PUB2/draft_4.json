  "draft": "Is treatment with hormone medicines that lower estrogen (GnRH analogues) effective for reducing pain and safe for bone health compared with other therapies in women with endometriosis?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- GnRH analogues (hormone medicines that lower estrogen) may reduce pelvic pain, menstrual pain and pain during intercourse, but the evidence is low‑certainty.\n- They may increase the chance of hot flushes (sudden feelings of warmth) and may lower bone mineral density (BMD), a measure of bone strength.\n- Very few reliable studies compare GnRH analogues with other options such as other hormone medicines, intra‑uterine devices or painkillers, and none compare them with no treatment.\n\nWhat is endometriosis and how is it usually treated?\nEndometriosis affects about 6‑11 % of women of reproductive age. Tissue that looks like the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or pelvic lining. This tissue can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), chronic pelvic pain and may make it harder to become pregnant (infertility). Because the tissue still responds to hormones, it swells and bleeds each month, leading to inflammation and scar tissue. Doctors usually treat symptoms with hormonal medicines that suppress the menstrual cycle. These include oral contraceptives, progestogen pills, intra‑uterine devices that release progestogen, and drugs such as danazol. GnRH analogues (GnRHas) work by temporarily turning off the body’s production of hormones that stimulate the ovaries, which reduces the growth and activity of the endometrial tissue and can lessen pain. A known side‑effect of GnRHas is a reduction in bone mineral density, which can increase the risk of osteoporosis if treatment is prolonged.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about GnRH analogues for endometriosis?\nWe asked two main questions: (1) How effective are GnRH analogues at relieving painful symptoms compared with other hormonal treatments, placebo or no treatment? (2) How safe are they, especially regarding changes in bone mineral density and other side‑effects? We also looked at overall quality of life, the most troublesome symptom for each woman and patient satisfaction.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and trial registries up to May 2022. We also checked reference lists and contacted study authors and experts. We included randomised controlled trials that compared GnRH analogues with other hormonal options, placebo, no treatment or GnRH analogues plus calcium‑regulating agents.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 72 trials that enrolled 7,355 women with endometriosis. The trials compared GnRH analogues with placebo, danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, intra‑uterine progestogens, gestrinone or with GnRH analogues plus calcium‑regulating agents. Follow‑up ranged from 3 to 12 months.\n- Compared with placebo, GnRH analogues may reduce pelvic pain, menstrual pain and pain during intercourse, but the evidence is of low certainty.\n- Compared with placebo, GnRH analogues may increase the chance of hot flushes, but the evidence is uncertain (low certainty).\n- When compared with danazol, we are uncertain whether GnRH analogues affect pain relief.\n- Adding calcium‑regulating agents to GnRH analogues may lessen the small loss of bone mineral density seen with GnRH alone, but confidence in this result is very low.\n- No eligible studies examined GnRH analogues versus no treatment, analgesics or intra‑uterine progestogens.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were small, some participants knew which treatment they received, and not all studies reported every outcome we wanted. These issues give us little confidence in the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence includes studies up to May 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nWe cannot be sure how well GnRH analogues relieve pain or how much they affect bone health because the existing studies are limited and uncertain. Women should discuss the potential benefits and side‑effects with their healthcare provider and be aware that more robust research is needed to provide clearer answers.",

Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in.”\n5. **Overly noun‑dense paragraph** – the list of comparators (“placebo, danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, intra‑uterine progestogens, gestrinone or with GnRH analogues plus calcium‑regulating agents”) is a long noun string that reduces readability. *Rewrite:* “The trials compared GnRH analogues with several other treatments, such as placebo, the hormone danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, intra‑uterine progestogens, gestrinone, or GnRH combined with calcium supplements.”\nThese issues stem from the metric analysis showing the draft is far above typical PLS levels for nouns (204 vs <116), complex words (149 vs <84), long words (214 vs <122) and SMOG index (14.9 vs <12.1). Reducing noun density and simplifying vocabulary will bring the text into the normal range and improve patient comprehension.",

Readability scores (Flesch‑Reading Ease 49, grade 11) are acceptable, but the lexical complexity needs reduction to match standard PLS patterns."
