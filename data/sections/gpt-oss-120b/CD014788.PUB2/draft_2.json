  "draft": "Is treatment with hormone medicines that lower estrogen (GnRH analogues) effective for reducing pain and safe for bone health compared with other therapies in women with endometriosis?\n\nKey messages\n- GnRH analogues (hormone medicines that lower estrogen) may reduce pelvic pain, menstrual pain and pain during intercourse, but the evidence is weak and uncertain; they also increase the chance of hot flushes (sudden feeling of warmth) and may lower bone mineral density (a measure of bone strength).\n- Very few reliable studies compare GnRH analogues with other options such as other hormone medicines, intra‑uterine devices or painkillers, and none compare them with no treatment.\n- Because the current evidence is of low quality, we need well‑designed randomised trials with longer follow‑up to clarify how effective GnRH analogues are for pain relief, how they affect bone health and what side‑effects occur.\n\nWhat is endometriosis and how is it usually treated?\nEndometriosis is a common condition that affects about 6‑11 % of women of reproductive age. Tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or the pelvic lining. This tissue can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), chronic pelvic pain and may make it harder to become pregnant (infertility). Because the tissue still responds to hormones, it swells and bleeds each month, leading to inflammation and scar tissue. Doctors usually treat the symptoms with hormonal medicines that suppress the menstrual cycle. These include oral contraceptives, progestogen pills, intra‑uterine devices that release progestogen and drugs such as danazol. GnRH analogues are another class; they temporarily switch off the body’s production of hormones that stimulate the ovaries, which reduces the growth and activity of the endometrial tissue and can lessen pain. A known side‑effect of GnRH analogues is a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) – the amount of mineral (mainly calcium) in the bones that makes them strong – which can increase the risk of osteoporosis if treatment is prolonged.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about GnRH analogues for endometriosis?\nWe set two main questions: (1) How effective are GnRH analogues at relieving painful symptoms of endometriosis compared with other hormonal treatments, placebo or no treatment? (2) How safe are they, especially regarding changes in bone mineral density and other side‑effects? We also looked at whether GnRH analogues improve overall quality of life, the most troublesome symptom for each woman and patient satisfaction.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and trial registries up to May 2022. We also checked reference lists and contacted study authors and experts. We included randomised controlled trials that compared GnRH analogues with other hormonal options, placebo, no treatment or with GnRH analogues plus calcium‑regulating agents.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 72 trials that together enrolled 7 355 women with endometriosis. The trials compared GnRH analogues with placebo, danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, intra‑uterine progestogens or gestrinone, or with GnRH analogues plus calcium‑regulating agents. Follow‑up times ranged from three to twelve months.\nWe found that GnRH analogues probably reduce pelvic pain compared with placebo, although the certainty of this evidence is low. We also found that GnRH analogues probably increase the chance of hot flushes compared with placebo, again with low certainty. When we compared GnRH analogues with danazol, the evidence did not show a clear difference in pain relief. Adding calcium‑regulating agents to GnRH analogues probably reduces the small loss of bone density that occurs with GnRH alone, but we have very low confidence in this finding. No eligible studies examined GnRH analogues versus no treatment, analgesics or intra‑uterine progestogens.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in. The overall risk of bias and imprecision were high.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to the May 2022 search.\n\nWhat does this mean for patients?\nWe cannot be sure how well GnRH analogues relieve pain or how much they affect bone health because the existing studies are limited and uncertain. Women should discuss the potential benefits and side‑effects with their healthcare provider and consider that more robust research is needed to provide clearer answers.",

      "feedback": "Critical checks passed (all required sections present, subheadings phrased as questions, factual accuracy confirmed, word count 752 < 850). However, several clarity and style problems would likely confuse a patient reader:\n1. Unexplained jargon – “low‑certainty evidence”. Quote: \"...the certainty of this evidence is low.\" / \"low‑certainty evidence\" appears several times. Problem: Readers do not know what “low‑certainty” means; it sounds technical and leaves them unsure about how confident the findings are. Rewrite: \"...the evidence is uncertain – we are not sure how reliable the result is.\" or \"...the evidence is of low certainty (meaning we are not sure how reliable it is).\"\n2. Long, complex sentence in Limitations. Quote: \"We have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in.\" Problem: Over 30 words, multiple clauses make it hard to follow. Rewrite: \"We have little confidence in the evidence. Many studies were small, some participants knew which treatment they got, and not all studies reported every outcome we wanted.\"\n3. Noun‑heavy phrasing – \"We identified 72 trials that together enrolled 7 355 women with endometriosis.\" Problem: Heavy nominalisation and noun count (218 nouns, far above the median of 116) reduces readability. Rewrite: \"We found 72 trials that included 7,355 women with endometriosis.\"\n4. Technical sentence about calcium‑regulating agents. Quote: \"Adding calcium‑regulating agents to GnRH analogues probably reduces the small loss of bone density that occurs with GnRH alone, but we have very low confidence in this finding.\" Problem: Long, contains several technical terms and repeats the earlier “low‑certainty” wording. Rewrite: \"When calcium‑regulating agents are added to GnRH analogues, the small loss of bone density seen with GnRH alone may be reduced. However, we are not sure about this result.\"\n5. Awkward passive phrasing – \"The evidence is up to date to the May 2022 search.\" Problem: Slightly awkward; active voice is clearer. Rewrite: \"We included studies up to May 2022.\"\n\nMetric support: The PLS evaluation shows high noun count (218 > BEYOND_P90), high nominalisation (25 > P90), and very high complexity scores (SMOG 15.7, complex_words 174, long_words 236 – all beyond P90). These numbers confirm the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many long, complex words, matching the issues identified above. Reducing nouns, nominalisations, and complex words will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most structural criteria, but several metrics deviate strongly from typical PLS patterns: nouns (218, beyond P90), nominalisations (25, P90), SMOG index (15.7, beyond P90), complex words (174, beyond P90) and long words (236, beyond P90). These indicate the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many complex, long words, which aligns with the identified clarity and style issues."
