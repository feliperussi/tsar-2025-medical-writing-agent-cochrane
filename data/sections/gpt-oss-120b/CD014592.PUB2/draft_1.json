  "draft": "Does estrogen (female hormone) therapy help reduce symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse (when pelvic organs drop into the vagina) in postmenopausal women?\n\n**Key messages**\n- There is not enough reliable evidence to say whether estrogen therapy (either taken as a pill or applied locally) reduces pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in post‑menopausal women; the existing studies were small, often poorly designed, and did not compare estrogen alone with no treatment or other standard therapies. When estrogen was used together with a vaginal pessary (a device placed in the vagina to support the organs), fewer unwanted vaginal problems were reported, and when used with surgery it seemed to lower the chance of a urinary tract infection after the operation, but these findings are uncertain and should be interpreted cautiously.\n- Most of the research looked at estrogen combined with other treatments rather than estrogen by itself, and the studies had a high risk of bias (meaning they were likely to have errors that could affect the results), so the overall picture of benefits and harms remains unclear.\n- Future research needs larger, well‑designed trials that evaluate estrogen alone and in combination with pelvic‑floor exercises, pessaries, or surgery, measure outcomes over the medium and long term, and assess any side effects and cost‑effectiveness.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse and why is it a problem for post‑menopausal women?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) happens when the uterus, bladder, or rectum slips down into the vagina because the muscles and tissues that normally hold them up become weak. It is very common – about half of women over 50 who have had at least one child experience it. The risk gets higher with older age, having more births, and being overweight. POP can cause uncomfortable symptoms such as a feeling of pressure, trouble with urination or bowel movements, and a bulge that can be seen or felt in the vagina, all of which can affect daily life and quality of life.\n\nWomen who have gone through menopause (the natural end of menstrual periods) often have lower levels of the hormone estrogen, which can make the vaginal tissues and surrounding muscles even less resilient. Because of this, doctors sometimes use estrogen therapy – either a cream or tablet that delivers the hormone locally (topical) or a pill that works throughout the whole body (systemic) – hoping it will improve the tissues and reduce POP symptoms. Other common treatments for POP include pelvic‑floor muscle training, devices called vaginal pessaries that hold the organs up, and surgery to repair the prolapse.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review set out to discover whether giving estrogen – either as a cream applied inside the vagina (topical) or as a pill taken by mouth (systemic) – helps relieve POP symptoms in post‑menopausal women, and whether it causes any harms. The authors also wanted to see how estrogen works when it is used together with other treatments such as pessaries or surgery, and to gather any information on the cost‑effectiveness of these approaches.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that evaluated local or systemic oestrogen therapy (alone or with other treatments) for pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women, combined their findings, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWe identified 14 randomised controlled trials that together included 1,002 post‑menopausal women with any grade of pelvic organ prolapse. All participants were women who had gone through menopause; the studies did not report exact ages. The trials tested estrogen therapy only when it was added to another treatment: three trials compared a vaginal pessary plus local estrogen cream with a pessary alone, and eleven trials compared surgery plus local estrogen cream with surgery alone. No study looked at estrogen by itself, and the abstract gave no details about follow‑up length, study locations, or funding sources.\n\nThe review found that there is not enough reliable evidence to say whether adding estrogen helps or harms pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. Adding a topical estrogen cream to a pessary might reduce vaginal side‑effects a little, but we are very uncertain about this. Adding a topical estrogen cream to surgery might lower the chance of a urinary‑tract infection after the operation a little, but we are also very uncertain about this.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all studies gave data on everything we wanted, the evidence does not cover all the people, treatments or outcomes we are interested in, and the studies were very small with few participants.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.",

This alone prevents approval. In addition, several clarity issues would confuse readers: (1) overly long, compound sentences; (2) excessive passive voice; (3) noun‑heavy phrasing; (4) unexplained technical terms such as “high risk of bias”. The metrics confirm these problems – words per sentence (26.4) is above the typical PLS range, passive voice (22) and noun count (216) are far beyond the median, and complex‑word counts are also high. The suggested rewrites address these issues and bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns.",
