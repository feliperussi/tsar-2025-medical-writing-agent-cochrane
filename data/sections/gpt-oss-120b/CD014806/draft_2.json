  "draft": "Does giving a sweet sugar solution (sucrose) reduce pain during heel‑prick tests (heel lance) in newborn babies?\n\nKey messages:\n- Giving a small amount of sucrose probably lowers the pain newborns feel during a heel‑lance, and no harmful side‑effects were reported.\n- Sucrose does not give extra pain relief compared with other simple options such as glucose solution, expressed breast milk, or skin‑to‑skin holding. Evidence about its benefit over non‑nutritive sucking (pacifier) or breastfeeding is uncertain.\n- Because many comparisons come from small or low‑quality studies, we need better research to confirm how sucrose stacks up against other soothing techniques and to check for rare long‑term effects.\n\nWhy is pain from heel‑lance a concern for newborn babies?\nWhen a baby is born, clinicians often need a tiny drop of blood to test for health problems. They obtain this sample by quickly pricking the baby’s heel – a procedure called a heel‑lance. Even though the prick is small, it can cause noticeable pain and distress in both full‑term and pre‑term infants. Repeated painful experiences early in life may affect a baby’s comfort, sleep, and later pain responses. Because babies cannot tell us how they feel, health‑care teams look for safe ways to calm them during these routine tests. One common approach is to give a small amount of sweet liquid, such as sucrose (table sugar), which is thought to have a soothing effect.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about using sucrose for pain relief?\nWe wanted to know whether giving sucrose to newborns actually reduces the pain they feel during a heel‑lance. We compared sucrose with other options – water or no treatment, non‑nutritive sucking (a pacifier), glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, music, acupuncture, gentle holding (facilitated tucking), and skin‑to‑skin contact – and we looked at immediate pain scores and any longer‑term effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases up to February 2022 for randomised controlled trials that compared sucrose with any of the above alternatives in newborns undergoing heel‑lance. We combined the results using standard Cochrane methods and rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 55 trials involving 6,273 newborns (both term and pre‑term). The trials compared sucrose with many other interventions, including water/placebo, non‑nutritive sucking, sucrose + non‑nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, laser acupuncture, music, facilitated tucking, and skin‑to‑skin care (often with water). The abstract did not give details about study duration, locations, or funding.\n\nMain results:\n- Sucrose probably reduces pain scores a little compared with no sweet solution. It also likely lowers pain shortly after the heel‑lance when measured with another pain scale.\n- We found no clear benefit of sucrose over non‑nutritive sucking, sucrose + non‑nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, or skin‑to‑skin care.\n- No important side effects were reported in any of the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings because the studies involved different types of babies, used varied methods, and were often very small. This variability reduces the certainty of the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised is current up to the February 2022 search.\n",

It also likely lowers pain shortly after the heel‑lance when measured with another pain scale.\" This does not tell the reader how much the pain is reduced or which pain scales were used. *Rewrite:* \"Sucrose probably reduces pain a little – about 1.7 points on the PIPP scale at 30 seconds and 2.1 points at 60 seconds after the heel‑lance – compared with giving no sweet solution. The reduction was similar when measured with the NIPS scale.\"\n2. **Passive voice for safety information** – \"No important side effects were reported in any of the studies.\" Passive phrasing hides who observed the safety outcome. *Rewrite:* \"We found no important side effects in any of the studies.\"\n3. **Unnecessary detail about the abstract** – \"The abstract did not give details about study duration, locations, or funding.\" This sentence adds no value for patients and may distract from the main message. *Rewrite:* *Delete the sentence.*\n4. **Noun‑heavy list of comparators** – \"The trials compared sucrose with many other interventions, including water/placebo, non‑nutritive sucking, sucrose + non‑nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, laser acupuncture, music, facilitated tucking, and skin‑to‑skin care (often with water).\" The long noun string makes the sentence hard to follow. *Rewrite:* \"The trials compared sucrose with several other options: water or placebo, a pacifier (non‑nutritive sucking), glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, laser acupuncture, music, gentle holding (facilitated tucking), and skin‑to‑skin care (often with water).\"\n5. **Missing definition of a technical term** – \"non‑nutritive sucking\" is first introduced without a simple explanation. *Rewrite:* \"non‑nutritive sucking (using a pacifier)\" (repeat briefly in the results for clarity).\nThese issues affect readability and patient understanding. The PLS evaluation also flags two metric deviations that support the editorial concerns: the draft contains a high noun count (163, beyond the typical PLS range) and a high number of complex Dale‑Chall words (232), indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more difficult vocabulary than usual. Reducing nouns and simplifying language, as suggested above, will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns.\nOverall judgment: The draft does not meet the required clarity standards for a patient‑focused Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most PLS metrics (e.g., low reading grade, good active voice), but deviates on two counts: nouns (163, above the typical 83‑116 range) and complex Dale‑Chall words (232, above the typical 115‑277 range). These deviations indicate noun‑heavy, complex wording that should be reduced for better patient readability."
