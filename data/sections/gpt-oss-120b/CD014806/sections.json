  "plain_title": "Does giving a sweet sugar solution (sucrose) reduce pain during heel‑prick tests (heel lance) in newborn babies?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Giving a small amount of sweet sugar solution (sucrose) probably reduces the pain that newborn babies feel during a heel‑prick test, as measured by standard newborn pain scales (such as PIPP scores), and no harmful side‑effects were reported.",
    "The review found that sucrose does not appear to give extra pain relief compared with other simple treatments like glucose solution, expressed breast milk (milk pumped from the mother), or skin‑to‑skin holding (holding the baby against a parent's bare skin), and the evidence about its benefit over methods such as non‑nutritive sucking (sucking on a dummy) or breastfeeding is uncertain.",
    "Because many of the comparisons are based on limited or low‑quality studies, further well‑designed research is needed to confirm how sucrose compares with other soothing techniques and to examine any longer‑term effects or rare adverse events."

      "subheading": "Why is pain from heel‑lance procedures a concern for newborn babies?",
      "content": "When a baby is born, doctors often need a tiny drop of blood to check for health problems. They get this sample by quickly pricking the baby's heel – a test called a heel‑lance. Even though the prick is very small, it can cause noticeable pain and distress in newborns, both full‑term and pre‑term. Repeated painful experiences early in life may affect a baby's comfort, sleep, and even how they respond to pain later on. Because babies cannot tell us how they feel, health‑care teams look for safe ways to calm them during these routine procedures. One common approach is to give a small amount of sweet liquid, such as sucrose (table sugar), which has been thought to have a soothing or pain‑relieving effect."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out about using sucrose for pain relief?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether giving sucrose to newborns actually reduces the pain they feel during a heel‑lance. Specifically, they examined how sucrose compares with other options – such as water, no treatment, non‑nutritive sucking (like a pacifier), glucose, breastfeeding, breast milk, music, acupuncture, gentle holding (facilitated tucking), and skin‑to‑skin contact – in terms of immediate pain scores (measured a few seconds after the prick) and any longer‑term effects. In short, the review set out to assess the effectiveness and safety of sucrose as a simple, low‑cost pain‑relief method for babies undergoing heel‑lance procedures."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 55 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 6,273 newborns (both term and preterm) who underwent heel‑lance procedures. The trials compared sucrose with a range of other interventions, including water/placebo/no intervention, non‑nutritive sucking, sucrose combined with non‑nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, laser acupuncture, music, facilitated tucking, and skin‑to‑skin care (often combined with water). The abstract did not provided details on study duration, country or setting, or funding sources."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Sucrose reduces pain after heel‑lance",
      "content": "Sucrose probably reduces pain scores slightly compared with giving no sweet solution, and probably reduces pain shortly after the heel‑lance when measured with another pain scale. It is unclear whether sucrose changes pain compared with non‑nutritive sucking, adding sucrose to non‑nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, or skin‑to‑skin care. No important side effects were reported."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search."
