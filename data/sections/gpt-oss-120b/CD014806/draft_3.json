  "draft": "Does giving a sweet sugar solution (sucrose) reduce pain during heel‑prick tests (heel lance) in newborn babies?\n\nKey messages:\n- Giving a small amount of sucrose probably reduces newborn pain during a heel‑lance by about 1.7 points on the PIPP scale at 30 seconds and 2.1 points at 60 seconds, and it also lowers pain by roughly 2 points on the NIPS scale immediately after the prick.\n- Sucrose does not give extra pain relief compared with other simple options such as glucose solution, expressed breast milk, or skin‑to‑skin holding. Evidence about its benefit over non‑nutritive sucking (using a pacifier) or breastfeeding is uncertain.\n- We found no important side effects in any of the studies, but many comparisons come from small or low‑quality trials, so more research is needed.\n\nWhy is pain from heel‑lance procedures a concern for newborn babies?\nWhen a baby is born, clinicians often need a tiny drop of blood to check for health problems. They obtain this sample by quickly pricking the baby’s heel – a test called a heel‑lance. Even though the prick is small, it can cause noticeable pain and distress in both full‑term and pre‑term infants. Repeated painful experiences early in life may affect a baby’s comfort, sleep, and later pain responses. Because babies cannot tell us how they feel, health‑care teams look for safe ways to calm them during these routine tests. One common approach is to give a small amount of sweet liquid, such as sucrose (table sugar), which is thought to have a soothing effect.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about using sucrose for pain relief?\nWe wanted to know whether giving sucrose to newborns actually reduces the pain they feel during a heel‑lance. We compared sucrose with several other options: water or placebo, non‑nutritive sucking (using a pacifier), glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, laser acupuncture, music, gentle holding (facilitated tucking), and skin‑to‑skin care (often with water). We looked at immediate pain scores measured a few seconds after the prick and at any longer‑term effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases up to February 2022 for randomised controlled trials that compared sucrose with any of the above alternatives in newborns undergoing heel‑lance. We combined the results using standard Cochrane methods and rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 55 trials involving 6,273 newborns (both term and pre‑term). The main findings were:\n- Sucrose probably reduces pain scores slightly compared with giving no sweet solution: about –1.7 points on the PIPP scale at 30 seconds and –2.1 points at 60 seconds after the lance. The reduction was similar when measured with the NIPS scale (–2.0 points) immediately after the procedure.\n- We found no clear benefit of sucrose over non‑nutritive sucking, sucrose + non‑nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, or skin‑to‑skin care.\n- We found no important side effects in any of the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these findings because the studies involved different types of babies, used varied methods, and were often very small. This variability reduces the certainty of the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised is current up to the February 2022 search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical clarity check because it contains several reader‑confusing problems:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as “PIPP scale”, “NIPS scale”, “non‑nutritive sucking” and even “heel‑lance” are used without a simple definition, leaving lay readers unsure what is being measured or what the procedure involves.\n2. **Overly long key‑message sentence** – the first bullet point packs three pieces of information into a 38‑word sentence, making it hard to follow.\n3. **Passive‑voice constructions** – sentences like “The evidence suggests that sucrose probably reduces pain scores…” hide who did the assessment and reduce immediacy.\n4. **Noun‑heavy wording** – the results paragraph is dense with a high noun count (163) and many complex words (225), which raises the reading difficulty and hampers readability.\n\n**Suggested rewrites**:\n- *Original*: “Giving a small amount of sucrose probably reduces newborn pain during a heel‑lance by about 1.7 points on the PIPP scale at 30 seconds and 2.1 points at 60 seconds, and it also lowers pain by roughly 2 points on the NIPS scale immediately after the prick.”\n  *Rewrite*: “Giving a tiny dose of sucrose probably reduces pain. On the PIPP pain scale (which rates facial expression, heart rate and oxygen levels) the score falls by about 1.7 points 30 seconds after the heel‑prick and by 2.1 points at 60 seconds. The NIPS scale (which looks at facial expression, crying and limb movement) shows a reduction of about 2 points right after the prick.”\n- *Original*: “The evidence suggests that sucrose probably reduces pain scores slightly compared with giving no sweet solution…”\n  *Rewrite*: “We found that sucrose probably reduces pain scores compared with giving no sweet solution…”\n- *Original*: “The review included 55 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 6,273 newborns (both term and pre‑term) who underwent heel‑lance procedures.”\n  *Rewrite*: “We included 55 trials with 6,273 newborn babies (both full‑term and pre‑term) who had a heel‑prick.”\n- *Add brief definitions*: After first mention of each scale, add a short parenthetical explanation, e.g., “PIPP (Premature Infant Pain Profile) – a score that combines facial expression, heart rate and oxygen saturation.”\n- *Add definition of non‑nutritive sucking*: “non‑nutritive sucking (using a pacifier without milk).”\nThese changes address the three most serious clarity problems and also reduce noun and complex‑word density, bringing the text closer to typical plain‑language summary standards.\n\nOverall, while the draft meets structural and factual requirements, the identified clarity issues are significant enough to prevent approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to most typical patterns (overall high conformity). However, two metrics deviate: nouns (163, P90) and complex_words_dc (225, P90), indicating the text is noun‑heavy and uses many unfamiliar words. These metric signals support the editorial recommendation to simplify wording and reduce noun density."
