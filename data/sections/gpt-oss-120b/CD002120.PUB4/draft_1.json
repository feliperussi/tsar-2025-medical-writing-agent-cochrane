  "draft": "Are birth control pills (combined oral contraceptives) effective and safe for treating painful menstrual cramps (primary dysmenorrhoea)?\n\nKey messages\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progestogenic) reduce menstrual pain in women with primary dysmenorrhoea compared with placebo or no treatment, and the evidence for this benefit is fairly reliable; however, they also increase the likelihood of side effects such as irregular bleeding (unexpected changes in menstrual flow), headaches, and nausea, with moderate confidence in these safety findings.\n- Taking the pill continuously (without the usual weekly break) may provide a little more pain relief than the standard cyclic regimen (three weeks of pills followed by a break), but it may also raise the chance of irregular bleeding; the evidence for this comparison is limited.\n- Future research should focus on long‑term safety, especially the risk of serious adverse events (serious unwanted health problems), and should include direct comparisons with NSAIDs (pain‑relieving medicines such as ibuprofen) to clarify the best management options for painful periods.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea means painful menstrual cramps that occur in women who have no other pelvic disease (such as fibroids or endometriosis). It is a very common problem and is one of the leading causes of pain and missed work or school days for women of reproductive age. The pain can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. The usual first‑line treatment is non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which reduce pain by lowering inflammation. Another option that many women use is a combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) of estrogen and progestogen, because it can also lessen menstrual pain by suppressing ovulation and stabilising hormone levels.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to determine how well combined oral contraceptive pills work for relieving the pain of primary dysmenorrhoea and what side‑effects they may cause. Specifically, they set out to compare the benefits (pain reduction and improvement) and harms (such as irregular bleeding, headaches, nausea, and any serious adverse events) of OCPs against placebo, no treatment, other OCP regimens, or NSAIDs.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with placebo, other contraceptives, or NSAIDs in women with primary dysmenorrhoea, combined their results, and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 21 randomised controlled trials with a total of 3,723 women who had primary dysmenorrhoea (menstrual pain without pelvic pathology). All participants were female and had confirmed primary dysmenorrhoea through clinical examination or ultrasound. The trials compared combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) with placebo or no treatment (11 trials), with other OCP regimens or dosages (8 trials), with a mixed OCP‑placebo design (1 trial), and with non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (1 trial). The abstract did not report the length of follow‑up, treatment duration, participant age, severity of pain, funding sources, or the geographic settings of the studies. No trials evaluated long‑term outcomes, other pharmacologic comparators beyond NSAIDs, or specific sub‑populations, highlighting gaps in the evidence.\nMain results: Effect of combined oral contraceptive pills on menstrual pain and side effects\nCombined oral contraceptive pills probably reduce menstrual pain. They cause a large increase in irregular bleeding – if about one in five women would have irregular bleeding without the pill, using the pill raises this to roughly four in ten. The pills probably increase the chance of headaches and nausea slightly, and probably increase the overall chance of side effects slightly. They may reduce the need for extra pain medication and may reduce days off work, but the evidence for these benefits is uncertain. Using the pill continuously (without the usual break) may reduce menstrual pain compared with the standard regimen, although the evidence is of low certainty. It is unclear whether the pills affect weight or cause serious side effects.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the studies were very small or there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check: many section subheadings are not phrased as questions, which the Master Style Guide requires. Additionally, several sentences are overly long or written in passive voice, and the text contains excessive noun‑heavy constructions (high noun count, nominalisations, and complex words) that reduce readability for patients. Key issues and concrete rewrites:\n1. Subheading not a question – \"Methods\". This does not follow the guide’s rule to phrase subheadings as questions. Rewrite: \"How did we search for and select studies?\"\n2. Subheading not a question – \"Key messages\". Rewrite: \"What are the main findings?\"\n3. Subheading not a question – \"Main results: Effect of combined oral contraceptive pills on menstrual pain and side effects\". Rewrite: \"What are the effects of combined oral contraceptives on pain and side‑effects?\"\n4. Long, complex sentence – \"We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the studies were very small or there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words and mixes several ideas, making it hard to follow. Rewrite: \"We are moderately confident in the evidence, but some studies may have been unblinded, used different populations or delivery methods, and were small. Because of these issues, the results are less certain.\"\n5. Passive construction – \"The evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search.\" Passive voice obscures who performed the search. Rewrite: \"We searched the literature up to March 2023.\"\nThese changes address the most important clarity and style problems and bring the draft into compliance with the Master Style Guide. The PLS evaluation also shows high scores for words per sentence (26.2, beyond the typical range), nominalisations (26), nouns (222), and complex‑word counts, confirming that the draft is more dense than typical Cochrane PLS texts. Reducing sentence length, nominalisations, and noun density—as suggested above—will improve readability scores and, more importantly, make the summary easier for patients to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is within the 850‑word limit (733 words) but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: words per sentence (26.2, P90), nominalisations (26, P90), noun count (222, beyond P90), automated readability index (15.6, P90), and complex‑word measures (all beyond P90). These indicate the text is longer, more noun‑heavy, and uses more complex vocabulary than usual, supporting the need for shorter sentences, fewer nominalisations, and simpler wording."
