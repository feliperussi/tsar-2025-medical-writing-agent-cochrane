  "plain_title": "Are birth control pills (combined oral contraceptives) effective and safe for treating painful menstrual cramps (primary dysmenorrhoea)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progestogenic) reduce menstrual pain in women with primary dysmenorrhoea compared with placebo or no treatment, and the evidence for this benefit is fairly reliable; however, they also increase the likelihood of side effects such as irregular bleeding (unexpected changes in menstrual flow), headaches, and nausea, with moderate confidence in these safety findings.",
    "Taking the pill continuously (without the usual weekly break) may provide a little more pain relief than the standard cyclic regimen (three weeks of pills followed by a break), but it may also raise the chance of irregular bleeding; the evidence for this comparison is limited.",
    "Future research should focus on long‑term safety, especially the risk of serious adverse events (serious unwanted health problems), and should include direct comparisons with NSAIDs (pain‑relieving medicines such as ibuprofen) to clarify the best management options for painful periods."

      "subheading": "What is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?",
      "content": "Primary dysmenorrhoea means painful menstrual cramps that occur in women who have no other pelvic disease (such as fibroids or endometriosis). It is a very common problem and is one of the leading causes of pain and missed work or school days for women of reproductive age. The pain can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. The usual first‑line treatment is non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which reduce pain by lowering inflammation. Another option that many women use is a combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) of estrogen and progestogen, because it can also lessen menstrual pain by suppressing ovulation and stabilising hormone levels."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to determine how well combined oral contraceptive pills work for relieving the pain of primary dysmenorrhoea and what side‑effects they may cause. Specifically, they set out to compare the benefits (pain reduction and improvement) and harms (such as irregular bleeding, headaches, nausea, and any serious adverse events) of OCPs against placebo, no treatment, other OCP regimens, or NSAIDs."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 21 randomised controlled trials with a total of 3,723 women who had primary dysmenorrhoea (menstrual pain without pelvic pathology). All participants were female and had confirmed primary dysmenorrhoea through clinical examination or ultrasound. The trials compared combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) with placebo or no treatment (11 trials), with other OCP regimens or dosages (8 trials), with a mixed OCP‑placebo design (1 trial), and with non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (1 trial). The abstract did not report the length of follow‑up, treatment duration, participant age, severity of pain, funding sources, or the geographic settings of the studies. No trials evaluated long‑term outcomes, other pharmacologic comparators beyond NSAIDs, or specific sub‑populations such as adolescents, highlighting gaps in the evidence."

      "subheading": "Main results: Effect of combined oral contraceptive pills on menstrual pain and side effects",
      "content": "Combined oral contraceptive pills probably reduce menstrual pain. They cause a large increase in irregular bleeding – if about one in five women would have irregular bleeding without the pill, using the pill raises this to roughly four in ten. The pills probably increase the chance of headaches and nausea slightly, and probably increase the overall chance of side effects slightly. They may reduce the need for extra pain medication and may reduce days off work, but the evidence for these benefits is uncertain. Using the pill continuously (without the usual break) may reduce menstrual pain compared with the standard regimen, although the evidence is of low certainty. It is unclear whether the pills affect weight or cause serious side effects."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the studies were very small or there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search."
