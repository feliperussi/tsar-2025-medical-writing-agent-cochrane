  "draft": "Do personal stress‑reduction programs (such as mindfulness or relaxation training) help lower work‑related stress in healthcare workers compared with no treatment?\n\nKey messages\n– Personal stress‑reduction programmes such as mindfulness (training that helps you notice thoughts and feelings) or relaxation (activities that help you unwind) appear to lower work‑related stress symptoms in healthcare workers, and no unwanted or harmful effects were reported.\n– The stress reduction may continue for several months after the programme ends, but the evidence is uncertain because many studies had methodological problems such as lack of blinding and small sample sizes.\n– Future research should include well‑designed, larger trials that follow participants for longer periods to confirm how long the benefit lasts and to detect any possible adverse effects.\n\nWhy is occupational stress a problem for healthcare workers?\nPeople who work in hospitals, clinics and other health‑care settings often face high demands, tight schedules and limited support from colleagues or managers. When job pressure exceeds a worker’s skills or the help they receive, they can develop work‑related stress. This stress can turn into burnout (feeling exhausted, detached and ineffective), physical complaints such as headaches or stomach problems, and can even reduce the quality of care patients receive. Because health‑care workers keep services running, high stress levels affect both staff wellbeing and the health system.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether programmes that target the individual health‑care worker – such as training to notice and manage stress, relaxation or exercise activities, changes to personal work habits, or a mix of these approaches – actually reduce stress symptoms. We compared these individual‑level interventions with doing nothing, waiting for treatment, receiving a placebo, or using a different type of stress‑reduction programme. We looked at short‑term effects (up to 3 months after the programme ended), medium‑term effects (more than 3 months up to a year), and long‑term effects (over a year).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched databases for randomised controlled trials that evaluated individual‑level stress‑reduction interventions for healthcare workers. We combined the findings and assessed our confidence in the evidence based on study quality, size and consistency.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 117 trials involving 11,119 health‑care workers. The trials tested four types of programmes:\n1. Programs that help people pay attention to their experience of stress.\n2. Programs that help people divert attention away from stress (for example, relaxation or exercise).\n3. Programs that try to change work‑related risk factors at the individual level.\n4. Programs that combine two or more of the above approaches.\nMost studies compared these programmes with doing nothing, a waiting‑list control, a placebo or another stress‑reduction programme.\nWe found low‑certainty evidence that the programmes can produce small reductions in stress symptoms in the short term (up to three months) and the medium term (more than three to up to twelve months). For example, programmes that focus on the experience of stress lowered burnout scores by about five points, programmes that divert attention away from stress lowered scores by about seven points, and combined programmes lowered scores by about eight points. Evidence about programmes that target work‑related, individual‑level factors was very uncertain, and we have no reliable evidence about long‑term effects (beyond twelve months).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, many studies were very small, and not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in.\n\nWhat is the currency of the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to February 2022.\n",

Suggested rewrite: \"We looked for studies that randomly assigned healthcare workers to either a stress‑reduction programme or to no programme, and then compared the results.\"\n2. **Long, dense sentence in the first key message** – Quote: \"Personal stress‑reduction programmes such as mindfulness (training that helps you notice thoughts and feelings) or relaxation (activities that help you unwind) appear to lower work‑related stress symptoms in healthcare workers, and no unwanted or harmful effects were reported.\"  The sentence exceeds 30 words and mixes two ideas. Suggested rewrite: \"Personal stress‑reduction programmes – for example, mindfulness (training that helps you notice thoughts and feelings) or relaxation (activities that help you unwind) – appear to lower work‑related stress in healthcare workers. The studies did not report any unwanted or harmful effects.\"\n3. **Unexplained evidence certainty wording** – Quote: \"We found low‑certainty evidence that the programmes can produce small reductions in stress symptoms…\"  Readers may not understand what “low‑certainty evidence” means. Suggested rewrite: \"We found evidence that suggests the programmes can reduce stress, but we are not very sure about the size of the benefit because many of the studies were small and had design problems.\"\nThese three issues are likely to confuse patients and therefore the PLS cannot be approved in its current form.\n\nAdditional metric support: the evaluation shows a very high number of nominalisations (29, beyond the 90th percentile) and a large count of complex and long words (127 and 189 respectively, both beyond the 90th percentile). These linguistic patterns reinforce the need to replace noun‑heavy phrasing with clearer verbs and simpler words, as illustrated in the suggested rewrites.",

Passive voice is low (P25) and active voice high (P75), which is good. The main concerns are the high noun‑density and technical vocabulary, which reduce plain‑language suitability."
