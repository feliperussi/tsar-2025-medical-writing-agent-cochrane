  "key_messages": [
    "Personal stress‑reduction programmes such as mindfulness (training that helps you notice thoughts and feelings) or relaxation (activities that help you unwind) appear to lower work‑related stress symptoms in healthcare workers compared with receiving no programme, and no unwanted or harmful effects were reported in the studies.",
    "The reduction in stress may continue for several months after the programme ends, but the evidence is uncertain because many studies had methodological problems (issues such as lack of blinding and small sample sizes).",
    "Future research should involve well‑designed, larger trials that follow participants for longer periods to confirm how long the benefit lasts and to detect any possible adverse effects (unwanted or harmful outcomes)."

      "subheading": "Why is occupational stress a problem for healthcare workers?",
      "content": "People who work in hospitals, clinics and other health‑care settings often face high demands, tight schedules and sometimes limited support from colleagues or managers. When the pressure of the job exceeds a worker’s skills or the help they receive, they can develop work‑related stress. This stress can turn into burnout (feeling exhausted, detached and ineffective), physical complaints such as headaches or stomach problems, and can even reduce the quality of care patients receive. Because health‑care workers are essential for keeping services running, high levels of stress can affect both the staff’s wellbeing and the health system as a whole."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether programmes that target the individual health‑care worker – such as training to notice and manage stress, relaxation or exercise activities, changes to personal work habits, or a mix of these approaches – actually reduce stress symptoms. They compared these individual‑level interventions with doing nothing, waiting for treatment, receiving a placebo, or using a different type of stress‑reduction programme. The review looked at how well the interventions worked in the short term (up to 3 months after the programme ended), the medium term (more than 3 months up to a year), and the long term (over a year)."

      "subheading": "What did we do?",

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We examined 117 randomised controlled trials that together involved 11,119 health‑care workers. All the trials tested individual‑level stress‑reduction programmes, which were grouped into four types: (1) programmes that help people pay attention to their experience of stress, (2) programmes that help people divert attention away from stress (for example, relaxation or exercise), (3) programmes that try to change work‑related risk factors at the individual level, and (4) programmes that combine two or more of the above approaches. Most studies compared these programmes with doing nothing, waiting‑list control, placebo, or another type of stress‑reduction programme.\n\nThe evidence from these studies is of low certainty, but it suggests that the programmes can lead to small reductions in stress symptoms in the short term (up to three months) and the medium term (more than three to up to twelve months). For example, programmes that focus on the experience of stress lowered burnout scores by about five points, programmes that divert attention away from stress lowered scores by about seven points, and combined programmes lowered scores by about eight points. Interventions that target work‑related, individual‑level factors showed very uncertain effects, and we have no reliable evidence about the long‑term effects (beyond twelve months) of any of these individual‑level stress‑reduction programmes."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search."
