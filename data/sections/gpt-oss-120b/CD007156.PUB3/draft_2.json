  "draft": "What treatments improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in oral submucous fibrosis (a stiffening of the mouth lining)?\n\nKey messages\n- Antioxidant medicines taken by mouth probably give a small increase in how wide the mouth can open and probably lessen the painful burning feeling in the mouth; the evidence is fairly reliable and side‑effects are usually mild, such as stomach upset.\n- Other treatments that have been tested – for example pentoxifylline (a drug that improves blood flow), steroid injections, physiotherapy or other drugs – have not shown clear benefits for mouth opening or burning sensation, and the evidence for these approaches is of low quality.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies that follow people for longer periods are needed to confirm which treatments truly help mouth opening and burning sensation and to understand any possible harms.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease that stiffens the lining of the mouth. It makes the cheeks and inner mouth tight, so the mouth cannot open very wide. This causes painful chewing, difficulty swallowing, and trouble speaking, which lowers quality of life. People with OSF also have a higher risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause is chewing areca nut (often found in betel quid), a habit common in some parts of Asia.\n\nWhat treatments are currently used to manage oral submucous fibrosis?\nWe first help people stop chewing areca nut – a behavioural approach that removes the main trigger. Beyond that, doctors have tried several options:\n- Systemic or topical medicines (e.g., antioxidants that protect cells, pentoxifylline that improves blood flow, steroids such as dexamazing that reduce inflammation).\n- Surgical procedures that release the tight tissue.\n- Physical therapies such as physiotherapy or ultrasound to improve mouth movement.\n- Alternative or complementary therapies.\nResearchers measure success by looking at how much the mouth can open (called interincisal distance – the gap between the upper and lower front teeth) and by asking patients to rate pain or burning on a visual analogue scale (VAS – a simple line where people mark how bad the feeling is).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to find out which interventions help people with OSF. Specifically, we evaluated benefits such as better mouth opening, less burning pain, and improved eating and speaking, and we also recorded harms such as side‑effects or complications.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials – studies that randomly assign participants to treatment groups – that compared drugs, surgery, physiotherapy or other therapies for OSF with placebo or no active treatment. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 30 trials that together included 2,176 adults with biopsy‑confirmed OSF. The trials tested many different treatments – medicines taken by mouth, injections, creams, physiotherapy, ultrasound and other alternative approaches – usually compared with placebo, no treatment, or sometimes another active treatment. Follow‑up periods varied: some results were reported at less than three months, some at three to six months and some after six months.\n\nWhat did the main results show for antioxidants and other treatments?\nAntioxidants may slightly increase mouth opening when measured at less than three months and probably increase it a bit at three to six months. After six months or longer, antioxidants probably make little or no difference to mouth opening. Antioxidants probably cause a large reduction in burning sensation both in the short term and over longer periods. Pentoxifylline may increase mouth opening slightly. For most other treatments, we are very uncertain about the evidence for benefits or harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the studies involved different types of people and different ways of delivering the interventions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is current to September 2022.",
