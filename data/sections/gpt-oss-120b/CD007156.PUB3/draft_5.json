  "draft": "What treatments improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in oral submucous fibrosis (a stiffening of the mouth lining)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Antioxidant medicines taken by mouth probably give a small increase in how wide the mouth can open (the distance between the front teeth) and probably lessen the painful burning feeling. We have moderate‑certainty evidence for these benefits, meaning we are fairly confident but not absolutely sure. Side‑effects are usually mild, such as stomach upset. Serious harms were only seen after a surgical graft, which is rarely used.\n- Other treatments that have been tested – for example pentoxifylline (a drug that improves blood flow), steroid injections, physiotherapy or other medicines – have not shown clear benefits for mouth opening or burning sensation, and the evidence for them is low‑certainty, meaning we are not very confident about the results.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies that follow people for longer are needed to confirm which treatments truly help and to understand any possible harms.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long‑lasting disease that makes the lining of the mouth stiff and tight. The cheeks and inner mouth cannot open very wide, which causes painful chewing, difficulty swallowing and trouble speaking. This lowers quality of life and increases the risk of mouth cancer. The main cause is chewing areca nut, a habit common in some parts of Asia.\n\nWhat treatments are currently used to manage oral submucous fibrosis?\nWe first help people stop chewing areca nut – a simple behavioural step that removes the main trigger. Beyond that, doctors try several options:\n- Systemic or topical medicines, such as antioxidants that protect cells, pentoxifylline that improves blood flow, and steroids like dexamethasone that reduce inflammation.\n- Surgical procedures that release the tight tissue.\n- Physical therapies such as physiotherapy or ultrasound to improve mouth movement.\n- Alternative or complementary therapies.\nResearchers measure success by looking at how much the mouth can open, called \"interincisal distance\" (the gap between the upper and lower front teeth), and by asking patients to rate pain or burning on a visual analogue scale (VAS), a simple line where they mark how bad the feeling is.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover which of these interventions actually help people with OSF. Specifically, we evaluated benefits such as better mouth opening, less burning pain, and improved eating and speaking, and we also recorded harms such as side‑effects or complications.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared drugs, surgery, physiotherapy or other therapies for OSF with placebo or no active treatment. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 30 randomised trials involving 2,176 adults with biopsy‑confirmed OSF. The trials tested many treatments – oral medicines, injections, creams, physiotherapy, ultrasound and other alternative approaches – usually compared with a placebo or no treatment.\nAntioxidants may increase mouth opening a little when measured less than three months after treatment. They probably increase opening a bit more when measured three to six months after treatment, but after six months they probably make little or no difference. Antioxidants probably cause a large reduction in burning sensation both in the short term and over longer periods. Pentoxifylline may increase mouth opening slightly. For most other treatments, the evidence is too uncertain to tell whether they help or cause any harm.\n\nHow certain are we about the results?\nWe have moderate‑certainty evidence for antioxidants, meaning we are fairly confident that they provide the small benefits described. The evidence for all other treatments is low‑certainty or very low‑certainty, so we are not confident about their effects.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have little confidence in many results because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the studies involved different types of people and different ways of delivering the interventions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe updated the evidence to include studies up to September 2022.",

These omissions mean the PLS does not meet the mandatory structure. Additionally, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Section heading for limitations**\n   - Quote: \"Limitations of the evidence\"\n   - Problem: Not phrased as a question, violating the style guide’s requirement for question‑style subheadings.\n   - Rewrite: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n2. **Missing currency section**\n   - Quote: (no text present)\n   - Problem: The review must state how up‑to‑date the evidence is; the draft omits this required subheading and statement.\n   - Rewrite: Add a new subheading and paragraph:\n     \"How current is the evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to 5 September 2022, so the findings reflect research published up to that date.\"\n3. **Jargon without definition**\n   - Quote: \"visual analogue scale (VAS)\"\n   - Problem: Readers may not know what a VAS is; the term is introduced without a plain‑language explanation.\n   - Rewrite: \"a visual analogue scale (VAS) – a simple line where you mark how bad the burning feeling is, from ‘no pain’ to ‘worst pain imaginable’\"\n4. **Long, dense sentence**\n   - Quote: \"Antioxidants may increase mouth opening a little when measured less than three months after treatment, and probably increase it a bit more when measured three to six months after treatment, but after six months they probably make little or no difference to mouth opening.\"\n   - Problem: Sentence exceeds 30 words and packs multiple time points, making it hard to follow.\n   - Rewrite: \"Antioxidants may increase mouth opening a little when measured less than three months after treatment. They probably increase it a bit more at three to six months. After six months, they probably make little or no difference.\"\n5. **High nominalisation and complex wording** (metric support)\n   - The evaluation shows nominalizations (26), complex words (134), long words (210) and a very high Dale‑Chall complex‑word count (282), all well beyond typical PLS ranges. This makes the text noun‑heavy and harder to read.\n   - Suggested overall edit: Replace noun‑heavy phrases with active verbs. Example: change \"The evidence was very uncertain for all other interventions\" to \"We are very uncertain about the evidence for other interventions.\"\n\nSupporting metrics: The draft scores well on readability (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 49.6, words per sentence 19.9) but shows significant deviation in nominalisation, noun count, SMOG (14.6), complex‑word counts and long‑word counts, indicating the text is still more complex than typical PLS. Reducing nominalisations and long words will improve clarity.\n\nOverall, because the mandatory structural elements are missing and several clarity issues remain, the PLS cannot be approved in its current form.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS meets word‑count limits and has good overall readability (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 49.6, words per sentence 19.9). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in nominalisation (26 vs median <13), noun count (180 vs median <116), SMOG index (14.6 vs median <12.1), complex‑word counts (134 vs median <84) and long‑word counts (210 vs median <122). These high complexity metrics support the need to simplify language and reduce noun‑heavy constructions. Reducing nominalisations and long words will improve clarity."
