  "draft": "What treatments improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in oral submucous fibrosis (a stiffening of the mouth lining)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Antioxidant medicines taken by mouth probably give a small increase in how wide the mouth can open and probably lessen the painful burning feeling. We have moderate‑certainty evidence for these benefits, and side‑effects are usually mild (for example stomach upset). Serious harms were only reported with a surgical graft, which is rarely used.\n- Other treatments that have been tested – such as pentoxifylline (a drug that improves blood flow), steroid injections, physiotherapy or other drugs – have not shown clear benefits for mouth opening or burning sensation, and the evidence for them is low‑certainty.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies that follow people for longer are needed to confirm which treatments truly help and to understand any possible harms.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long‑lasting disease that stiffens the lining of the mouth. The cheeks and inner mouth become tight, so the mouth cannot open very wide. This leads to painful chewing, difficulty swallowing and trouble speaking, which lowers quality of life. People with OSF also have a higher risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause is chewing areca nut (often found in betel quid), a habit common in some parts of Asia.\n\nWhat treatments are currently used to manage oral submucous fibrosis?\nWe first help people stop chewing areca nut – a behavioural step that removes the main trigger. Beyond that, doctors try several options:\n- Systemic or topical medicines (for example antioxidants that protect cells, pentoxifylline that improves blood flow, steroids such as dexamethasone that reduce inflammation).\n- Surgical procedures that release the tight tissue.\n- Physical therapies such as physiotherapy or ultrasound to improve mouth movement.\n- Alternative or complementary therapies.\nResearchers measure success by looking at how much the mouth can open, which we call the interincisal distance – the gap between the upper and lower front teeth when the mouth is opened as wide as possible – and by asking patients to rate pain or burning on a visual analogue scale (VAS), a simple line where they mark how bad the feeling is.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover which of these interventions actually help people with OSF. Specifically, we evaluated benefits such as better mouth opening, less burning pain, and improved eating and speaking, and we also recorded harms such as side‑effects or complications.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared drugs, surgery, physiotherapy or other therapies for OSF with placebo or no active treatment. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 30 randomised trials involving 2,176 adults with biopsy‑confirmed OSF. These trials tested many treatments – oral medicines, injections, creams, physiotherapy, ultrasound and other alternative approaches – usually compared with a placebo or no treatment.\n\nWhat were the main results for antioxidants and other treatments?\nAntioxidants may increase mouth opening a little when measured at less than three months and probably increase it a little at three to six months. After six months or longer, antioxidants probably make little or no difference to mouth opening. Antioxidants probably cause a large reduction in burning sensation both in the short term and over longer periods. Pentoxifylline may increase mouth opening slightly. For most other treatments, the evidence is too uncertain to tell whether they help or cause any harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the studies involved different types of people and different ways of delivering the interventions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe updated the evidence to include studies up to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, word‑count and factual accuracy, but several clarity problems would likely confuse patients:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as “moderate‑certainty evidence”, “low‑certainty evidence”, “interincisal distance” and “visual analogue scale” are used without plain explanations. This makes the key messages hard to grasp.\n2. **Overly long, dense sentences** – e.g., “Antioxidants may increase mouth opening a little when measured at less than three months and probably increase it a little at three to six months.” (25 words) packs two time‑points and two qualifiers together, reducing readability.\n3. **Passive constructions that hide the actor** – sentences like “The evidence was very uncertain for all other interventions…” do not tell the reader who is uncertain, making the statement feel abstract.\n4. **Noun‑heavy, nominalised language** – phrases such as “behavioural step”, “systemic or topical medicines”, “serious harms were only reported with a surgical graft” increase cognitive load. The metrics show high nominalisation (22), high noun count (179) and high complex‑word counts, confirming the need to shift to more verb‑focused, simpler wording.\n5. **Missing plain‑language definitions for measurement tools** – while “interincisal distance” is defined earlier, the definition is buried and not reiterated where the result is discussed, leaving readers unsure what the numbers mean.\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Replace jargon: “We are fairly confident (moderate‑certainty) that antioxidants help …” and add a brief note: “‘Moderate‑certainty’ means we have good, but not perfect, confidence in the result.”\n- Split the long sentence: “Antioxidants may increase how far the mouth can open when measured less than three months after treatment. They probably increase opening a bit more when measured three to six months after treatment.”\n- Use active voice: “We are very uncertain about the evidence for other treatments such as steroid injections or physiotherapy.”\n- Reduce noun‑heavy phrasing: “We first help people stop chewing areca nut – a simple behavioural step that removes the main trigger.” and “Serious harms were only seen after a surgical graft, which is rarely used.”\n- Reinforce measurement definition: “We measured mouth opening as the distance between the upper and lower front teeth (interincisal distance).”\n\nThese changes address the most significant clarity issues and align the draft with the Master Style Guide and typical PLS readability patterns (the evaluation shows high nominalisation, noun count and complex‑word metrics, indicating the draft is currently more noun‑heavy and complex than typical PLS texts).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit (668 words) and has good active‑voice (80) and pronoun use (45). However, several metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisation (22, P90), noun count (179, P90), SMOG index (14.3, P90), complex words (126, P90) and long words (193, P90) are all higher than the median, indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than usual. These metric signals support the editorial recommendation to simplify language, reduce nominalisations and lower word complexity."
