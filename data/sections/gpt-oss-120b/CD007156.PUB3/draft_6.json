  "draft": "What treatments improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in oral submucous fibrosis (a stiffening of the mouth lining)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Oral antioxidants taken by mouth probably increase how wide the mouth can open and probably lessen the burning feeling; we have moderate‑certainty evidence for these benefits and side‑effects are usually mild, such as stomach upset.\n- Other approaches – for example pentoxifylline (a blood‑flow drug), steroid injections, physiotherapy or other medicines – have not shown clear benefits for mouth opening or burning, and the evidence for them is low‑certainty.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials that follow people for longer are needed to confirm which treatments truly help and to understand any harms.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease that makes the lining of the mouth stiff and tight. The cheeks and inner mouth cannot open very wide, leading to painful chewing, difficulty swallowing and trouble speaking. This lowers quality of life and raises the risk of mouth cancer. The main cause is chewing areca nut, a habit common in parts of Asia.\n\nWhat treatments are currently used to manage oral submucous fibrosis?\nWe first help people stop chewing areca nut – a simple behavioural step that removes the main trigger. Beyond that, clinicians try several options:\n- Systemic or topical medicines such as antioxidants (which protect cells), pentoxifylline (which improves blood flow) and steroids like dexamethasone (which reduce inflammation).\n- Surgical procedures that release the tight tissue.\n- Physical therapies such as physiotherapy or ultrasound to improve mouth movement.\n- Alternative or complementary therapies.\nResearchers measure success by looking at the interincisal distance (the gap between the upper and lower front teeth) and by asking patients to rate pain or burning on a visual analogue scale (VAS) – a simple line where people mark how bad the feeling is, from “no pain” to “worst pain imaginable”.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover which of these interventions actually help people with OSF. Specifically, we evaluated benefits such as better mouth opening, less burning pain, and improved eating and speaking, and we also recorded harms such as side‑effects or complications.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared drugs, surgery, physiotherapy or other therapies for OSF with placebo or no active treatment. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 30 randomised trials involving 2,176 adults with biopsy‑confirmed OSF. The trials tested many treatments – oral medicines, injections, creams, physiotherapy, ultrasound and other alternative approaches – usually compared with a placebo or no treatment.\nAntioxidants may increase mouth opening a little when measured less than three months after treatment. They probably increase it a bit more at three to six months. After six months, they probably make little or no difference. Antioxidants probably cause a large reduction in burning sensation both in the short term and over longer periods. Pentoxifylline may increase mouth opening slightly. For most other treatments, the evidence is too uncertain to tell whether they help or cause any harm.\nWe have moderate‑certainty evidence for antioxidants and low‑ or very‑low‑certainty evidence for all other interventions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in many results because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the studies involved different types of people and different ways of delivering the interventions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to 5 September 2022, so the findings reflect research published up to that date.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "Critical checks failed: the draft is missing a sub‑heading that asks a question about the currency of the evidence (e.g., \"How current is the evidence?\"). This violates the style rule that all sections must be phrased as questions. Additionally, several clarity issues would likely confuse readers:\n1. **Missing currency heading** – the statement about the search date appears without a question‑style heading.\n2. **Technical term without plain‑language alternative** – “interincisal distance” is only defined once and then used repeatedly; many readers may still not grasp it.\n3. **Heavy noun‑phrases / nominalisations** – sentences such as “The evidence was very uncertain for the other interventions compared to placebo or no active treatment (intralesional dexamethasone injections, pentoxifylline, hydrocortisone plus hyaluronidase, physiotherapy).” are noun‑heavy and hard to follow.\n4. **Long, dense sentences** – e.g., “We identified 30 randomised trials involving 2,176 adults with biopsy‑confirmed OSF. The trials tested many treatments – oral medicines, injections, creams, physiotherapy, ultrasound and other alternative approaches – usually compared with a placebo, no treatment, or sometimes with another active treatment.” can be split for readability.\n5. **Some jargon remains** – phrases like “behavioural step” and “systemic or topical medicines” could be simplified.\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Add a heading: **How current is the evidence?**\n- Replace “interincisal distance” with “how wide the mouth can open (the gap between the front teeth)”.\n- Rewrite the nominalised sentence to active voice: “We are not sure whether other treatments such as steroid injections, pentoxifylline, hydrocortisone‑plus‑hyaluronidase, or physiotherapy help compared with placebo.”\n- Split the long sentence into two: “We identified 30 randomised trials with 2,176 adults who had biopsy‑confirmed OSF. These trials tested many approaches – medicines taken by mouth, injections, creams, physiotherapy, ultrasound and other alternative methods – and usually compared them with a placebo or no treatment.”\n- Simplify jargon: change “behavioural step” to “help people stop chewing areca nut” and “systemic or topical medicines” to “drugs taken by mouth or applied to the mouth”.\nThese changes address the most important clarity problems and bring the draft in line with the Master Style Guide. The PLS evaluation also shows high nominalisation (22), high noun count (174), and elevated readability indices (SMOG 14.1, complex words 122), confirming that the draft is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical PLS texts; the suggested edits will lower those metrics toward the typical ranges.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and scores well on active voice and pronoun use, but deviates on several complexity metrics: nominalisation (22, beyond typical P90), nouns (174, beyond typical P90), SMOG index (14.1, beyond typical P90), complex words (122, beyond typical P90) and long words (186, beyond typical P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many long/complex words than usual PLS, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
