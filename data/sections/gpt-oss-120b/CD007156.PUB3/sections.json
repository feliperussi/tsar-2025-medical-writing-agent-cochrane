  "key_messages": [
    "Antioxidant medicines taken by mouth probably give a small increase in how wide the mouth can open (the distance between the teeth when the mouth is opened) and probably lessen the painful burning feeling in the mouth (a painful sensation), with the evidence being fairly reliable; mild and temporary side‑effects such as stomach upset have been reported, and serious side‑effects were rare and only seen with a surgical graft (a procedure that moves tissue).",
    "Other treatments that have been tested, such as pentoxifylline (a drug that improves blood flow), steroid injections (medicine that reduces inflammation), physiotherapy (exercise therapy) or other drugs, have not shown clear benefits for mouth opening or burning sensation, and the available evidence for these approaches is of low quality (not very reliable).",
    "More well‑designed (carefully planned), larger studies that follow people for longer periods are needed to confirm which treatments truly help mouth opening and burning sensation, to compare different options directly, and to better understand any possible harms."

      "subheading": "What is oral submucous fibrosis and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long‑lasting disease that affects the lining of the mouth. It makes the cheeks and the inside of the mouth become stiff and tight, so the mouth can’t open very wide. This causes painful chewing, difficulty swallowing, and trouble speaking, which can lower a person’s quality of life. People with OSF also have a higher chance of developing mouth cancer. The main cause of OSF is chewing areca nut (often found in betel quid), a habit common in some parts of Asia."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What treatments are currently used to manage oral submucous fibrosis?",
      "content": "The first step in care is usually to help people stop chewing areca nut – a behavioural approach that removes the main trigger. Beyond that, doctors have tried many other options, such as:\n- Systemic or topical medicines (e.g., antioxidants that protect cells, pentoxifylline that improves blood flow, steroids like dexamethasone that reduce inflammation).\n- Surgical procedures to release the tight tissue.\n- Physical therapies such as physiotherapy or ultrasound to improve mouth movement.\n- Alternative or complementary therapies.\nResearchers measure success by looking at how much the mouth can open (called \"interincisal distance\", the gap between the upper and lower front teeth) and by asking patients about pain or burning sensations using a visual analogue scale (VAS), a simple line where people mark how bad the feeling is."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to discover which of these interventions actually help people with OSF. Specifically, they evaluated the benefits (like better mouth opening, less burning pain, improved eating and speaking) and the harms (side‑effects or complications) of each treatment. Their goal was to provide clear evidence about what works, what doesn’t, and what risks might be involved."

      "content": "We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatment groups) evaluating drugs, surgery, physiotherapy or other therapies for oral submucous fibrosis versus placebo or no active treatment, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at 30 randomised trials that together included 2,176 adults with oral submucous fibrosis confirmed by biopsy. The studies tested many different treatments – medicines taken by mouth, injections, creams, \"physiotherapy, ultrasound and other alternative approaches – usually compared with a placebo, no treatment, or sometimes with another active treatment. The trials were done in various countries, but the abstract does not say where. The length of follow‑up varied, with some results reported at less than three months, some at three to six months and some after six months. The abstracts did not give details about participants’ ages, gender, severity of disease, or who funded the studies."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Antioxidants and other treatments",
      "content": "Antioxidants may increase the opening of the mouth a little when measured less than three months after treatment, and probably increase it a little when measured three to six months after treatment. After six months or longer, antioxidants probably make little or no difference to mouth opening. Antioxidants probably cause a large reduction in the burning sensation in the mouth, both in the short term and over longer periods. Pentoxifylline may increase mouth opening slightly. For most other treatments, the evidence is too uncertain to tell whether they help or cause any harm."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the studies were very small, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search."
