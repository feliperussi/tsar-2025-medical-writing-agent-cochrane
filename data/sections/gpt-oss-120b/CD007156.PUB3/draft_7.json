  "draft": "What treatments improve mouth opening and reduce burning sensation in oral submucous fibrosis (a stiffening of the mouth lining)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Antioxidant medicines taken by mouth probably give a small increase in how wide the mouth can open (the gap between the front teeth) and probably lessen the painful burning feeling; the evidence is of moderate certainty and side‑effects are usually mild, such as stomach upset.\n- Other treatments that have been tested – for example pentoxifylline (a blood‑flow drug), steroid injections, physiotherapy or other medicines – have not shown clear benefits for mouth opening or burning, and the evidence for them is low‑certainty.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials that follow people for longer are needed to confirm which treatments truly help and to understand any harms.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a long‑lasting disease that makes the lining of the mouth stiff and tight. Because the cheeks and inner mouth cannot open very wide, people experience painful chewing, difficulty swallowing and trouble speaking. This lowers quality of life and increases the risk of mouth cancer. The main cause is chewing areca nut, a habit common in some parts of Asia.\n\nWhat treatments are currently used to manage oral submucous fibrosis?\nThe first step is to help people stop chewing areca nut – a simple behavioural step that removes the main trigger. Beyond that, clinicians try several options:\n- Drugs taken by mouth or applied to the mouth, such as antioxidants (which protect cells), pentoxifylline (which improves blood flow) and steroids like dexamethasone (which reduce inflammation).\n- Surgical procedures that release the tight tissue.\n- Physical therapies such as physiotherapy or ultrasound to improve mouth movement.\n- Alternative or complementary therapies.\nResearchers measure success by looking at how wide the mouth can open (the gap between the upper and lower front teeth) and by asking patients to rate pain or burning on a visual analogue scale (VAS) – a simple line where people mark how bad the feeling is.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover which of these interventions actually help people with OSF. Specifically, we evaluated benefits such as better mouth opening, less burning pain, and improved eating and speaking, and we also recorded harms such as side‑effects or complications.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared drugs, surgery, physiotherapy or other therapies for OSF with placebo or no active treatment. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 30 randomised trials that together included 2,176 adults with biopsy‑confirmed OSF. The trials tested many approaches – medicines taken by mouth, injections, creams, physiotherapy, ultrasound and other alternative methods – and usually compared them with a placebo or no treatment.\nAntioxidants may increase mouth opening a little when measured less than three months after treatment, and probably increase it a bit more at three to six months. After six months, antioxidants probably make little or no difference to mouth opening. Antioxidants probably cause a large reduction in burning sensation both in the short term and over longer periods. Pentoxifylline may increase mouth opening slightly. For most other treatments, we are not sure whether they help or cause any harm.\nWe have moderate‑certainty evidence for antioxidants and low‑ or very‑low‑certainty evidence for all other interventions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in many results because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the studies involved different types of people and different ways of delivering the interventions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to 5 September 2022, so the findings reflect research published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the mandatory completeness, title/subheading, factual accuracy, and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that could confuse a patient reader. The most important issues are:\n1. Long, dense sentences that combine multiple ideas (e.g., the sentence describing how success is measured). \n2. Technical terms that are still jargon even after brief definition (\"interincisal distance\", \"visual analogue scale (VAS)\").\n3. A very long sentence in the limitations section that lists several reasons for low confidence, making it hard to follow.\n4. Occasional passive constructions that hide who performed the action.\n5. Use of abstract certainty language (\"moderate certainty\") without a plain‑language explanation.\nThese issues are reflected in the metric analysis: the draft has high nominalisation (21), many nouns (181), and elevated SMOG (14) and complex‑word counts, all of which indicate noun‑heavy, complex wording. Reducing nominalisations, shortening sentences, and replacing technical terms with everyday language will improve readability and align the text with typical PLS patterns. Suggested concrete rewrites are provided below for each problem.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit and has good active‑voice (75) and pronoun use (39). However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns on six metrics: nominalisation (21, P90), noun count (181, P90), SMOG index (14.05, P90), complex words (DC 259, P90; total 121, P90) and long words (187, P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than usual, supporting the need to simplify wording and reduce nominalisations."
