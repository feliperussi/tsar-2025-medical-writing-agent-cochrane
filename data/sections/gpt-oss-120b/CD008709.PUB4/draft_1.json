  "draft": "Are single‑incision sling surgeries (a minimally invasive tape placed through the vagina) as effective as other sling procedures for treating stress urinary incontinence (leakage when coughing or exercising) in women?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Single‑incision slings (a minimally invasive tape placed through the vagina) appear to be about as effective as retropubic slings (a tape placed through a small incision behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (a tape placed through the side of the pelvis) for improving stress urinary incontinence (leakage when coughing or exercising) at about one year, based on patients’ own reports of cure or improvement (subjective cure); however, the evidence about differences in harms such as mesh exposure (the synthetic material becoming visible), urinary retention (difficulty emptying the bladder), repeat surgery, pain, or painful intercourse (dyspareunia) is uncertain and limited.\n- When compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings may lead to less long‑term pain after surgery and possibly fewer cases of urinary retention, while showing a similar or slightly lower rate of mesh exposure; the overall quality of the evidence for these differences is moderate but not definitive.\n- More research is needed that follows women for several years after surgery to clarify the safety profile (including mesh exposure, dyspareunia, and need for repeat procedures) and to compare single‑incision slings with other options such as autolographically derived fascial slings, as well as to assess cost‑effectiveness.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nStress urinary incontinence is a condition where a woman leaks urine when pressure on the bladder increases, such as during coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercising. This leakage can be embarrassing, affect daily activities, and lead to social isolation, while also creating costs for health services and personal care products. The condition is common and places a heavy health and economic burden on individuals and society.\n\nTreatments aim to support the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the bladder so it stays closed during activities that raise pressure. Traditional surgical options include retropubic slings (a tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (a tape passed through the side of the pelvis). More recently, \"single‑incision\" slings have been developed. These involve a short synthetic strip (often made of polypropylene, a type of plastic mesh) that is inserted through a single small incision in the front wall of the vagina to hold up the middle part of the urethra. Because they use less mesh and require a smaller incision, they are marketed as a minimally‑invasive alternative. However, the use of polypropylene mesh in pelvic surgeries has been restricted in many countries due to safety concerns.\n\nKey terms explained:\n- Single‑incision sling: A tiny surgical device placed through one small cut in the vaginal wall to support the urethra.\n- Polypropylene mesh: A plastic net material used in many pelvic surgeries; it has been linked to complications, leading to regulatory limits.\n- Retropubic sling: A longer tape placed behind the pubic bone to support the urethra.\n- Transobturator sling: A tape that goes through the side of the pelvis (the obturator foramen) to support the urethra.\n- Autologous fascial sling: A sling made from the woman's own tissue rather than synthetic mesh.\n- Mesh exposure/erosion: When the mesh becomes visible or protrudes into surrounding tissues, which can cause discomfort or infection.\n- Dyspareunia: Painful sexual intercourse.\n- Urinary retention: Inability to empty the bladder fully after surgery.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to determine how well single‑incision sling operations work for treating stress urinary incontinence in women and how safe they are compared with other surgical options. Specifically, they set out to:\n1. Compare the effectiveness of single‑incision slings with other mid‑urethral slings (retropubic, transobturator, and autologous fascial slings) in achieving patients’ reported cure or improvement of leakage.\n2. Assess the rates of adverse events such as mesh exposure, painful sex (dyspareunia), urinary retention, and the need for repeat surgery.\n3. Summarise any economic evaluations that looked at the cost‑effectiveness of single‑incision slings.\n\nIn short, the review sought to answer whether single‑incision slings are as effective and safe as the more established sling procedures, and whether they offer any economic advantage.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared single‑incision sling surgery with other treatments for stress urinary incontinence, combined their results on effectiveness, safety and costs, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review identified 62 randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that together enrolled 8 051 women with stress‑predominant urinary incontinence. The trials compared single‑incision mid‑urethral slings with other surgical options: one study (70 women) compared them with autologous fascial slings, ten studies compared them with retropubic slings, and fifty‑one studies compared them with transobturator slings. Sixteen trials used the TVT‑Secur sling, which was withdrawn from the market in 2013 and were analysed separately from the primary synthesis. No trials compared single‑incision slings with no treatment, conservative therapy, colposuspension or laparoscopic procedures. Follow‑up data were reported mainly at 12 months, with some outcomes assessed at 24 months or longer. The abstract does not provide details on participants’ age, severity grades, countries or settings of the trials, or sources of funding.\n\nMain results: Reduced pain with single‑incision slings\nSingle‑incision slings may make little to no difference to the chance of cure or improvement at 12 months compared with retropubic slings. It is unclear if single‑incision slings affect the risk of mesh exposure, postoperative urinary retention, or the need for repeat continence surgery when compared with retropubic slings. Compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings make little to no difference to the chance of cure or improvement at 12 months, but probably cause a large reduction in patient‑reported pain at 24 months. They also reduce the risk of mesh exposure slightly, probably reduce postoperative urinary retention slightly, may reduce quality of life slightly, and may increase the need for repeat surgery slightly when compared with transobturator slings. It is unclear if single‑incision slings affect dyspareunia or mesh exposure when compared with autologous fascial slings.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators or outcomes we were interested in, the studies were very small, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators or outcomes we were interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.",

In addition, several clarity and style problems would confuse readers: \n1. **Long, dense sentence** – \"Single‑incision slings (a minimally invasive tape placed through the vagina) appear to be about as effective as retropubic slings (a tape placed through a small incision behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (a tape placed through the side of the pelvis) for improving stress urinary incontinence (leakage when coughing or exercising) at about one year, based on patients’ own reports of cure or improvement (subjective cure); however, the evidence about differences in harms such as mesh exposure (the synthetic material becoming visible), urinary retention (difficulty emptying the bladder), repeat surgery, pain, or painful intercourse (dyspareunia) is uncertain and limited.\" – This 66‑word sentence is hard to follow. **Rewrite:** \"Do single‑incision slings work as well as other slings? At about one year, women report similar cure rates, but we are unsure about differences in harms such as mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat surgery, pain, or painful intercourse.\"\n2. **Passive‑voice overload** – many sentences begin with \"It is unclear if…\" or \"The review identified…\" (38 passive constructions, far above the typical range). Passive voice hides who did the action. **Rewrite example:** Change \"It is unclear if single‑incision slings affect the risk of mesh exposure\" to \"We do not know whether single‑incision slings change the risk of mesh exposure.\"\n3. **Heavy noun‑density** – the draft contains 355 nouns and 266 complex words, making the text noun‑heavy and difficult to read. Example: \"Single‑incision slings may make little to no difference to the chance of cure or improvement at 12 months compared with retropubic slings.\" **Rewrite:** \"Single‑incision slings probably do not change the chance of cure at 12 months compared with retropubic slings.\"\n4. **Jargon without definition** – terms like \"subjective cure\" and \"mesh exposure\" appear before they are explained, which can confuse patients. **Rewrite:** Introduce the term first, e.g., \"‘Subjective cure’ means the woman herself says her leakage has stopped or improved.\"\n5. **Structure and bullet formatting** – bullet points use hyphens but headings are not separated by blank lines, creating walls of text. Add a blank line before each heading and ensure each bullet starts with a dash. These changes will also address the metric deviations (high passive voice, nominalisation, long sentences, and complex‑word counts) and bring the draft closer to typical Cochrane PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is 1153 words (over the 850‑word limit). Readability metrics are borderline (FK grade 13.9, FRE 40.5) but several structural metrics are far from typical: passive voice 38 (beyond P90), nominalisations 38, nouns 355, complex words 266, long words 355, and words per sentence 25.6 (beyond P90). These indicate the text is overly dense, noun‑heavy, and uses many passive constructions, confirming the editorial concerns above."
