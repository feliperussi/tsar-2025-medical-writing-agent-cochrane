  "draft": "Are single‑incision: Are single‑incision sling surgeries (a minimally invasive tape placed through the vagina) as effective as other sling procedures for treating stress urinary incontinence in women?\n\nKey messages\n- Single‑incision slings work about as well as retropubic and transobturator slings at 12 months, based on women’s own reports of cure or improvement.\n- Compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings probably reduce long‑term pain and may lower the chance of urinary retention, while showing a similar or slightly lower risk of mesh exposure.\n- Evidence on other harms (mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat surgery, dyspareunia) is uncertain, and longer‑term data are needed.\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nStress urinary incontinence means urine leaks when pressure on the bladder rises, such as during coughing, sneezing, laughing or exercising. The leakage can be embarrassing, limit daily activities and lead to social isolation. It also creates costs for health services and personal care products, making it a common and costly health issue.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether single‑incision sling operations are as question: \"What did the review aim to find out?\" We wanted to know whether single‑incision sling operations are as effective and safe as other surgical options for stress urinary incontinence, and whether they offer any economic advantage. Specifically we compared single‑incision slings with retropubic slings, transobturator slings and autologous fascial slings on:\n1. Women’s reported cure or improvement (subjective cure).\n2. Adverse events such as mesh exposure (the synthetic material becoming visible), dyspareunia (painful sex), urinary retention (difficulty emptying the bladder) and need for repeat surgery.\n3. Cost‑effectiveness evidence.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register up to 20 September 2022. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared a single‑incision sling with another surgical option in women with stress‑predominant urinary incontinence. We extracted data on effectiveness, safety and costs and assessed the certainty of the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 62 trials involving 8 051 women. No trial compared single‑in‑incision slings with non‑surgical treatments.\n- Single‑incision vs retropubic slings (10 trials, ~300 women): cure or improvement at 12 months was similar (risk ratio 0.99). Evidence on mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat surgery and quality of life was uncertain.\n- Single‑incision vs transobturator slings (51 trials, ~2 360 women): cure or improvement at 12 months was the same (risk ratio 1.00, high certainty). Pain reported at 24 months was probably much lower with single‑incision slings (risk ratio 0.12, moderate certainty). Mesh exposure was slightly lower (risk ratio 0.61, high certainty). Urinary retention was probably reduced (risk ratio 0.68, moderate certainty). Quality of life may be slightly lower, and repeat surgery may be slightly higher, but the evidence is low certainty.\n- Single‑incision vs autologous fascial slings (1 trial, 70 women): we could not determine any differences in cure, pain, mesh exposure or dyspareunia because data were missing.\nTwo economic evaluations and one cost‑minimisation analysis were included, but the review did not find conclusive evidence on cost‑effectiveness.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in many findings because most trials were small, some participants knew which surgery they received, and not all outcomes were reported consistently. The follow‑up period was usually only 12 months, so long‑term safety remains unclear.\n\nWhat does this mean for women?\nCurrent evidence suggests that single‑incision slings are likely as effective as other sling types at one year and may cause less long‑term pain. However, we still do not know how they compare on mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat surgery or sexual pain over several years. Women should discuss these uncertainties with their clinicians and consider that longer‑term data are still needed.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails critical checks: it lacks a dedicated Currency section and the subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, violating the style guide. The title is duplicated and overly wordy. Several sentences are noun‑heavy and contain unnecessary nominalizations, contributing to high SMOG (15.1) and complex‑word counts (159 complex words, 305 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words). These issues reduce readability for patients. Top improvements needed: 1) Add a \"How up to date is this review?\" section stating the search was up to 20 September 2022. 2) Rephrase \"Key messages\" to a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\") and keep the bullet list. 3) Simplify the title to a single clear question: \"Are single‑incision sling surgeries (a minimally invasive tape placed through the vagina) as effective as other sling procedures for treating stress urinary incontinence in women?\" 4) Reduce nominalizations and noun density by using active verbs (e.g., change \"The review identified 62 randomised…\" to \"We found 62 trials that together enrolled 8 051 women.\"). 5) Fix the garbled sentence in the aims section (\"We wanted to know whether single‑incision sling operations are as question…\") to a clear statement: \"We wanted to know whether single‑incision sling operations are as effective and safe as other surgical options, and whether they are cost‑effective.\" These changes address the missing sections, subheading format, title clarity, and the high noun/nominalization metrics that were flagged (nominal and nominalization 29 → <13, nouns 210 → <116, SMOG 15.1 → <12.1).",

These suggest the draft is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical PLS texts, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalizations."
