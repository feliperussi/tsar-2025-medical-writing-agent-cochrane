  "key_messages": [
    "Video laryngoscopy (using a tiny camera to see the airway) may increase the chance of successful tube placement on the first try and may lead to fewer injuries to the throat (airway trauma) compared with direct laryngoscopy (looking straight at the airway), but it does not clearly shorten the time needed for the procedure; the overall evidence is limited and not very robust.",
    "The review found very uncertain evidence about whether video laryngoscopy reduces episodes of low oxygen levels (desaturation) or slow heart rate (bradycardia) during intubation, and there were no data on other possible harms.",
    "More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, to assess longer‑term safety, and to compare different video‑laryngoscopy devices in newborns."

      "subheading": "Why is securing the airway in newborns important?",
      "content": "When a baby is born, it sometimes needs help to breathe. The most reliable way to do this is by placing a small tube into the windpipe (the trachea) – a procedure called endotracheal intubation. This tube lets doctors give oxygen or ventilation directly to the lungs. If the tube is not placed quickly and correctly, the baby can lose oxygen, develop a slow heart rate, or suffer other serious complications. Therefore, finding the safest and most efficient way to insert this tube is a critical part of newborn care in delivery rooms and neonatal intensive‑care units."

    {
      "subheading": "What is videolaryngoscopy and how does it differ from direct laryngoscopy?",
      "content": "To insert the breathing tube, clinicians need to see the opening of the windpipe (the glottis). Traditionally, they use a tool called a direct laryngoscope – a metal blade that is placed in the mouth and requires the clinician to look directly at the glottis. Videolaryngoscopy uses a similar blade but adds a tiny camera that shows a video of the airway on a screen. This can give a clearer view, especially in very small patients like newborns, and may make it easier to place the tube on the first try."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors set out to compare videolaryngoscopy with the traditional direct laryngoscope in newborns (aged 0‑28 days). Specifically, they wanted to know whether using the video‑assisted device:\n• reduces the time needed to successfully place the breathing tube,\n• reduces the number of attempts required, and\n• increases the chance of getting the tube right on the first try.\nThey also looked at whether the video method might lower the risk of complications such as low oxygen levels, slow heart rate, or injury to the airway."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at eight randomised trials that together recorded 759 attempts to place a breathing tube in newborn babies (aged 0‑28 days) in hospitals around the world. All the studies compared using a video‑laryngoscope (devices such as the C‑MAC, Airtraq or Glidescope) with the usual direct laryngoscope. The trials were done in delivery rooms or neonatal intensive‑care units, but the abstract did not give details about the countries, the length of each study, funding sources or any other characteristics of the babies."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Videolaryngoscopy improves first‑attempt success and reduces airway injury",
      "content": "Using a video‑laryngoscope probably increases the chance that a newborn is successfully intubated on the first try – about 14 more babies per 100 compared with direct laryngoscopy. It probably makes little or no difference to the total number of attempts needed or the time taken for a successful intubation. Importantly, video‑laryngoscopy probably leads to a large reduction in airway trauma during the procedure. We are uncertain whether it changes the risk of the baby’s oxygen level dropping (desaturation) or developing a slow heart rate (bradycardia), and it probably makes little or no difference to the lowest oxygen level recorded during the attempt."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
