  "draft": "Is video laryngoscopy (using a tiny camera to see the airway) more effective than direct laryngoscopy (looking straight at the airway) for inserting breathing tubes in newborn babies?\n\nKey messages:\n- Video laryngoscopy (using a tiny camera to see the airway) may increase the chance of successful tube placement on the first try and may lead to fewer injuries to the throat (airway trauma) compared with direct laryngoscopy (looking straight at the airway), but it does not clearly shorten the time needed for the procedure; the overall evidence is limited and not very robust.\n- The review found very uncertain evidence about whether video laryngoscopy reduces episodes of low oxygen levels (desaturation) or slow heart rate (bradycardia) during intubation, and there were no data on other possible harms.\n- More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, to assess longer‑term safety, and to compare different video‑laryngoscopy devices in newborns.\n\nINTRODUCTION/AIMS\nWhy is securing the airway in newborns important?\nWhen a baby is born, it sometimes needs help to breathe. The most reliable way to do this is by placing a small tube into the windpipe (the trachea) – a procedure called endotracheal intubation. This tube lets doctors give oxygen or ventilation directly to the lungs. If the tube is not placed quickly and correctly, the baby can lose oxygen, develop a slow heart rate, or suffer other serious complications. Therefore, finding the safest and most efficient way to insert this tube is a critical part of newborn care in delivery rooms and neonatal intensive‑care units.\n\nWhat is videolaryngoscopy and how does it differ from direct laryngoscopy?\nTo insert the breathing tube, clinicians need to see the opening of the windpipe (the glottis). Traditionally, they use a tool called a direct laryngoscope – a metal blade that is placed in the mouth and requires the clinician to look directly at the glottis. Videolaryngoscopy uses a similar blade but adds a tiny camera that shows a video of the airway on a screen. This can give a clearer view, especially in very small patients like newborns, and may make it easier to place the tube on the first try.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review authors set out to compare videolaryngoscopy with the traditional direct laryngoscope in newborns (aged 0‑28 days). Specifically, they wanted to know whether using the video‑assisted device:\n• reduces the time needed to successfully place the breathing tube,\n• reduces the number of attempts required, and\n• increases the chance of getting the tube right on the first try.\nThey also looked at whether the video method might lower the risk of complications such as low oxygen levels, slow heart rate, or injury to the airway.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched for studies that compared videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation in newborns, combined their results on intubation time, attempts and first‑attempt success, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at eight randomised trials that together recorded 759 attempts to place a breathing tube in newborn babies (aged 0‑28 days) in hospitals around the world. All the studies compared using a video‑laryngoscope (devices such as the C‑MAC, Airtraq or Glidescope) with the usual direct laryngoscope. The trials were done in delivery rooms or neonatal intensive‑care units, but the abstract did not give details about the countries, the length of each study, funding sources or any other characteristics of the babies.\n\nMain results: Videolaryngoscopy improves first‑attempt success and reduces airway injury\nUsing a video‑laryngoscope probably increases the chance that a newborn is successfully intubated on the first try – about 14 more babies per 100 compared with direct laryngoscopy. It probably makes little or no difference to the total number of attempts needed or the time taken for a successful intubation. Importantly, video‑laryngoscopy probably leads to a large reduction in airway trauma during the procedure. We are uncertain whether it changes the risk of the baby’s oxygen level dropping (desaturation) or developing a slow heart rate (bradycardia), and it probably makes little or no difference to the lowest oxygen level recorded during the attempt.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nCURRENCY\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022 of search.",

Several major headings are plain nouns (e.g., \"INTRODUCTION/AIMS\", \"METHODS\", \"RESULTS\", \"LIMITATIONS\", \"CURRENCY\", and the sub‑heading \"Main results: Videolaryngoscopy improves first‑attempt success and reduces airway injury\"). This makes navigation harder for readers and does not follow the Master Style Guide.\n\nAdditional issues that reduce readability:\n1. **Passive voice** – the draft contains 22 passive constructions, far above the typical range (P90). Example: \"The review found very uncertain evidence about whether video laryngoscopy reduces episodes…\" Rewrite as active: \"We found very uncertain evidence…\"\n2. **Nominalisation** – 21 noun‑forms of verbs make sentences noun‑heavy. Example: \"The review authors set out to compare…\" can be changed to \"We compared…\"\n3. **High noun count** – 212 nouns (beyond P90) and many complex/long words make the text dense. Simplify phrasing and use more verbs. Example: \"The trials were done in delivery rooms or neonatal intensive‑care units, but the abstract did not give details…\" Rewrite: \"We did the trials in delivery rooms and NICUs; the abstract did not give details…\"\n\n**Suggested top‑level improvements**:\n- **Re‑write subheadings as questions**:\n  *Current*: \"INTRODUCTION/AIMS\" → *Suggested*: \"Why is securing the airway in newborns important?\" (already a question, keep)\n  *Current*: \"METHODS\" → *Suggested*: \"How did we find and analyse the studies?\"\n  *Current*: \"RESULTS\" → *Suggested*: \"What did we find?\" (already used for a sub‑section, keep)\n  *Current*: \"Main results: Videolaryngoscopy improves first‑attempt success and reduces airway injury\" → *Suggested*: \"Does videolaryngoscopy improve first‑attempt success and reduce airway injury?\"\n  *Current*: \"LIMITATIONS\" → *Suggested*: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n  *Current*: \"CURRENCY\" → *Suggested*: \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"\n- **Convert passive to active**:\n  *Current*: \"The review found very uncertain evidence about whether video laryngoscopy reduces episodes…\" → *Suggested*: \"We found very uncertain evidence about whether video laryngoscopy reduces episodes…\"\n- **Reduce nominalisations and noun‑heavy sentences**:\n  *Current*: \"The review authors set out to compare videolaryngoscopy with the traditional direct laryngoscope…\" → *Suggested*: \"We compared videolaryngoscopy with the traditional direct laryngoscope…\"\n- **Simplify long, complex wording**:\n  *Current*: \"It probably makes little or no difference to the total number of attempts needed or the time taken for a successful intubation.\" → *Suggested*: \"It probably does not change the number of attempts or the time needed for a successful intubation.\"\n\nImplementing these changes will bring the draft into compliance with the Master Style Guide and improve readability for patients.",
