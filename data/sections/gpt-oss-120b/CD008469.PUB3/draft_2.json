  "draft": "Is asthma education at home (teaching children and families about asthma in their own home) more effective than usual care (the standard treatment) or other types of education for children with asthma?\n\nKey messages\n- Home‑based asthma education (teaching about asthma at the child's home) probably makes little or no difference to emergency‑department visits or oral‑steroid courses compared with usual care or less‑intensive programmes, and no harms were reported; the evidence is uncertain because studies varied and had methodological limits.\n- More intensive home programmes (more sessions or longer duration) may lower hospital admissions compared with less intensive home programmes, but the evidence is also uncertain and shows no clear effect on quality of life or symptom‑free days.\n- Because the existing research is diverse and of limited quality, we need well‑designed trials with standard outcomes and longer follow‑up to identify which parts of home‑based education work best.\n\nWhy is asthma a concern for children and how can education help?\nAsthma is a long‑lasting condition that makes the airways in the lungs swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. It affects more than 260 million people worldwide, including many children. Asthma attacks (exacerbations) can happen suddenly, so children need to learn how to avoid triggers such as dust, pollen or smoke and how to use inhalers correctly. Teaching families about the disease and self‑management skills is a core part of asthma care. Education can be delivered in hospitals, schools or at home. Home visits may help families who cannot travel easily or who face financial barriers, but we do not know whether they work better than usual care.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether home‑based education programmes for children with asthma and their caregivers improve important health outcomes. Specifically, we examined whether these programmes reduce emergency‑department visits or courses of oral corticosteroids (pills that reduce inflammation). We also looked at quality of life (how well a child feels and functions day‑to‑day), days without symptoms, school attendance and hospital admissions. We compared home‑based education with usual care, waiting‑list controls or less‑intensive education delivered outside the home, and we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two other databases and two trial registries up to October 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors. We included randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to groups) that tested face‑to‑face home education for children aged 2‑18 years with asthma. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled results using random‑effects meta‑analysis and rated certainty with GRADE (a system for rating certainty of evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 26 trials that enrolled 5 122 participants aged 1‑18 years with mild to severe asthma. All trials delivered face‑to‑face home education and compared it with usual care, waiting‑list controls, less‑intensive education outside the home, or less‑intensive home education. Most outcomes were measured around six months after the start of the programme.\nWe found that home‑based education probably makes little or no difference to emergency‑department visits (Peto odds ratio (a statistical measure of the odds of an event) 1.22, 95 % CI 0.50 to 2.94) or to oral‑steroid courses (mean difference (MD) −0.18, 95 % CI −0.63 to 0.26). The evidence for quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance and hospital admissions is very uncertain.\nWhen we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes, we saw little or no difference in emergency visits (odds ratio (OR) 1.36, 95 % CI 0.35 to 5.30) or steroid courses (MD 0.08, 95 % CI −0.14 to 0.30). More intensive programmes may reduce hospital admissions (OR 0.14, 95 % CI 0.04 to 0.55), but this finding is uncertain. There was no clear effect on quality of life or symptom‑free days.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nAll studies were at risk of bias because participants and educators usually knew which group they were in. The trials varied in participants, settings and how the education was delivered, and many were small. These factors make the overall certainty low to very low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to October 2022.",

Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers: (1) the first key‑message bullet is overly long and uses jargon (\"oral‑steroid courses\", \"methodological limits\"); (2) statistical terms such as \"Peto odds ratio\", \"mean difference (MD)\" and \"GRADE\" are not explained; (3) a passive‑voice sentence (“All studies were at risk of bias…”) obscures who made the judgment; (4) heavy nominalisation and noun‑heavy phrasing make sentences hard to follow; (5) the draft contains many passive constructions (20, P90) and excessive nominalisations (37, beyond P90) and noun density (228, beyond P90), confirming the readability concerns. These issues need to be addressed before the PLS can be approved.",

These metric deviations align with the identified clarity and style issues."
