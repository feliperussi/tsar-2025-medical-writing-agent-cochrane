  "draft": "Is asthma education at home more effective than usual care or other education for children with asthma?\n\nKey messages?\n– Home‑based asthma education shows little or no clear benefit over usual care or less‑intensive education in preventing emergency‑department visits or the need for oral steroids, and no harmful effects were reported; the evidence is uncertain because the studies varied and had methodological limitations.\n– More intensive home programmes (more sessions or longer duration) may reduce hospital admissions compared with less‑intensive programmes, but the evidence is also uncertain and does not show clear effects on quality of life or symptom‑free days.\n– Because existing research is diverse and of limited quality, we need well‑designed trials with standard outcomes and longer follow‑up to identify which parts of home‑based education work best.\n\nWhy is asthma a concern for children and how can education help?\nAsthma is a long‑lasting condition that makes the airways in the lungs swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. It affects more than 260 million people worldwide, including many children. Because asthma attacks (sudden worsening of symptoms) can happen quickly, children need to learn how to avoid triggers such as dust, pollen or smoke and how to use inhalers (devices that deliver medicine to the lungs) correctly. Teaching families about the disease and self‑management skills is a core part of asthma care. We can deliver this education in hospitals, schools or at home. Home‑based lessons may help families who find it hard to travel to clinics or who face financial barriers, but we do not yet know whether learning at home works better than usual care.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether home‑based education programmes for children with asthma and their caregivers improve important health outcomes. Specifically, we asked if such education reduces the number of asthma attacks that lead to emergency‑department visits or require a short course of oral corticosteroids (steroid pills taken by mouth to calm inflammation). We also examined effects on quality of life (how well a child feels and functions), days without symptoms, school attendance and hospital admissions. We compared home‑based education with usual care, waiting‑list controls or less‑intensive education delivered outside the home, and we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes. A randomised controlled trial (participants are randomly assigned to groups) provides the most reliable comparison, and a Peto odds ratio is a statistical method that compares the chances of an event between groups.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two additional databases and two trial registries up to October 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors. Two reviewers independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled results where appropriate and used the GRADE system to rate how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 26 randomised controlled trials that together included 5,122 children and teenagers aged 1 to 18 years with asthma of any severity. All trials tested face‑to‑face, home‑based education programmes. Most outcomes were measured around six months after the programme started.\nWhen we compared home‑based education with usual care or less‑intensive education outside the home, we found little or no difference in emergency‑department visits or the need for oral steroids. The evidence for quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance and hospital admissions is very uncertain.\nWhen we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes, we also found little or no difference in emergency visits or steroid courses. More intensive programmes may reduce hospital admissions, but this finding is uncertain. We saw no clear effect on quality of life or symptom‑free days.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nBecause participants and educators often knew which group they were in, the studies may be biased. The trials differed in the ages of children, asthma severity, settings and how the education was delivered, and many were small. These factors lower our confidence in the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to October 2022, so the review includes all research published before that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required completeness, accuracy and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader. 1) **Unexplained jargon** – the sentence \"...a Peto odds ratio is a statistical method that compares the chances of an event between groups\" introduces a technical term that is unnecessary for a patient audience and interrupts the flow. 2) **Overly long sentences** – e.g., \"When we compared home‑based education with usual care or less‑intensive education outside the home, we found little or no difference in emergency‑department visits or the need for oral steroids\" (27 words) packs two ideas together and can be split for easier reading. 3) **Heavy passive voice and noun‑heavy phrasing** – the draft contains 23 passive constructions and 35 nominalisations (e.g., \"The evidence suggests that providing home‑based asthma education…\"), making it harder to see who is doing what. 4) **Key‑message bullet is dense** – the first bullet mixes several concepts (benefit, safety, uncertainty) in one long line, reducing readability. 5) **Complex vocabulary** – the text includes many long and unfamiliar words (e.g., \"heterogeneity\", \"methodological\"), reflected by high scores for complex_words (160) and long_words (217). These issues together exceed the threshold for acceptable patient‑focused clarity. Suggested actions: replace or remove the Peto odds ratio reference; break long sentences into two shorter ones; rewrite passive statements in active voice (e.g., \"We found little or no difference…\"); reduce noun‑heavy phrases by using verbs; simplify the first key‑message bullet into two shorter points; swap complex words for everyday alternatives. These changes will bring the draft in line with Cochrane plain‑language standards and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (word count 710, Flesch reading ease 51.7, active voice 72) but flags several out‑of‑range metrics: passive_voice (23, beyond P90), nominalization (35, beyond P90), nouns (211, beyond P90), complex_words_dc (304), complex_words (160), long_words (217) and smog_index (14.8). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy sentences and high lexical complexity, supporting the editorial recommendation to simplify language and increase active voice."
