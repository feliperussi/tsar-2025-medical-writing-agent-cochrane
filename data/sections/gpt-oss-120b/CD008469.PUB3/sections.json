  "key_messages": [
    "Home‑based asthma education (teaching about asthma at the child's home) appears to provide little or no clear benefit over usual care (standard treatment) or less‑intensive education (fewer or shorter teaching sessions) in preventing emergency department visits (hospital trips for urgent care) or the need for oral corticosteroids (steroid pills taken by mouth), and no harmful effects were reported; the evidence is uncertain because the studies were varied and had methodological limitations.",
    "More intensive home‑based programs (those with more sessions or longer duration) may reduce the chance of hospitalisation (staying in hospital) compared with less intensive home programs, but the evidence is also uncertain and does not show clear effects on quality of life (overall wellbeing) or symptom‑free days (days without asthma symptoms).",
    "Because the existing research is diverse and of limited quality, further well‑designed studies with standard outcomes and longer follow‑up are needed to identify which parts of home‑based education work best."

      "subheading": "Why is asthma a concern for children and how can education help?",
      "content": "Asthma is a long‑lasting condition that makes the airways in the lungs swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. It affects more than 260 million people worldwide, including many children. Because asthma can flare up suddenly (called \"exacerbations\" or asthma attacks), children need to learn how to avoid triggers (like dust, pollen or smoke) and how to use their inhalers correctly. Teaching families about the disease and self‑management skills is a key part of asthma care. This education can be given in hospitals, schools or at home. Providing lessons at home may be especially useful for families who have trouble travelling to clinics or who face financial barriers, but it is not clear whether learning at home works better than the usual care that children receive elsewhere."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to discover whether educational programmes delivered in the home to children with asthma (and their caregivers) improve important health outcomes. Specifically, they wanted to know if home‑based education reduces the number of asthma attacks that lead to emergency‑department visits or require a short course of oral corticosteroids (a type of medicine taken by mouth to calm inflammation). They also examined effects on quality of life (how well a child feels and functions day‑to‑day), days without symptoms, school attendance and hospital admissions. The review compared home‑based education with usual care, waiting‑list or less‑intensive education given outside the home, and also compared more intensive versus less intensive home programmes. Note: a \"randomised controlled trial\" is a study where participants are randomly assigned to different groups to fairly compare treatments, and a \"Peto odds ratio\" is a statistical method used to compare the chances of an event between groups."

      "content": "We searched for studies that evaluated home‑based asthma education for children (and their caregivers) compared with usual care or less‑intensive education. Eligible studies reported outcomes such as asthma exacerbations, quality of life, or symptom control. Data were extracted, pooled where appropriate, and the certainty of the evidence was assessed."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at 26 randomised controlled trials that together included 5,122 children and teenagers aged 1 to 18 years who had asthma ranging from mild to severe. All the studies tested face‑to‑face, home‑based education programmes that aimed to help young people manage their asthma themselves. These programmes were compared with usual care, waiting‑list controls, less‑intensive education delivered outside the home, or less‑intensive home‑based education. The main outcomes were measured after about six months, but the exact length of each trial varied and was not clearly reported. The abstract did not give any details about where the studies were carried out, who funded them, or the gender breakdown of participants.\n\nThe evidence suggests that providing home‑based asthma education, whether compared with usual care or with a less‑intensive programme delivered outside the home, probably makes little or no difference to the number of emergency department visits or the need for oral steroids. We are very uncertain about any effect on quality of life, days without symptoms, school attendance, or hospital admissions. When a more intensive home‑based programme is compared with a less intensive one, it also appears to make little or no difference to emergency visits, steroid courses, or days missed from school, but it might lead to a noticeable reduction in hospital admissions—although this finding is not certain. For quality of life and symptom‑free days, the more intensive programme probably has little or no effect, and the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the education, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search."
