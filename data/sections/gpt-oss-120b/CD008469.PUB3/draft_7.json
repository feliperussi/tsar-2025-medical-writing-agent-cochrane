  "draft": "Is asthma education at home (teaching children and families about asthma in their own home) more effective than usual care (the standard treatment) or other types of education for children with asthma?\n\nKey messages –\n– Home‑based asthma education (teaching about asthma at the child's home) provides little or no clear benefit over usual care or less‑intensive education in preventing emergency‑department visits (hospital trips for urgent care) or the need for oral corticosteroids (steroid pills taken by mouth). No harmful effects were reported, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies varied and had methodological limitations.\n– More intensive home programmes (more sessions or longer duration) may reduce the chance of hospitalisation (staying in hospital) compared with less‑intensive home programmes, but the evidence is also uncertain and does not show clear effects on quality of life (overall wellbeing) or symptom‑free days (days without asthma symptoms).\n– Because the existing research is diverse and of limited quality, we need well‑designed trials with standard outcomes and longer follow‑up to identify which parts of home‑based education work best.\n\nWhy is asthma a concern for children and how can education help?\nAsthma is a long‑lasting condition that makes the airways in the lungs swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. It affects more than 260 million people worldwide, including many children. Asthma attacks (also called exacerbations) can happen suddenly, so children need to learn how to avoid triggers such as dust, pollen or smoke and how to use their inhalers (devices that deliver medicine to the lungs) correctly. Teaching families about the disease and self‑management skills (how to control asthma day‑to‑day) is a core part of asthma care. Education can be given in hospitals, schools or at home. Home‑based lessons may be especially useful for families who have trouble travelling to clinics or who face financial barriers, but we do not yet know whether learning at home works better than usual care.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether educational programmes delivered in the home to children with asthma (and their caregivers) improve important health outcomes. Specifically, we asked if home‑based education reduces the number of asthma attacks that lead to emergency‑department visits or require a short course of oral corticosteroids (a type of medicine taken by mouth to calm inflammation). We also looked at quality of life (how well a child feels and functions), days without symptoms, school attendance and hospital admissions. We compared home‑based education with usual care, waiting‑list controls or less‑intensive education given outside the home, and we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two other databases and two trial registries up to October 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors. We included randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) that tested face‑to‑face home education for children aged 2‑18 years with asthma. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results of similar studies using standard statistical methods. We used the GRADE system (a method that rates how confident we are in the evidence) to judge the certainty of the evidence. When we reported statistical comparisons we used a Peto odds ratio (a measure that compares the chance of an event between groups).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 26 trials that together included 5,122 children and teenagers aged 1‑18 years with asthma of any severity. All trials tested face‑to‑face home education and compared it with usual care, waiting‑list controls, less‑intensive education outside the home, or less‑intensive home education. Most outcomes were measured around six months after the programme started.\nWe found that home‑based asthma education does not reduce emergency‑department visits or the need for oral steroids, whether it is compared with usual care or with a less‑intensive programme delivered outside the home. The evidence for quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance and hospital admissions is very uncertain.\nWhen we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes, we saw little or no difference in emergency visits or steroid courses. More intensive programmes may reduce hospital admissions, but this finding is uncertain. There was no clear effect on quality of life or symptom‑free days.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nBecause participants and educators often knew which group they were in, the studies may be biased. The trials differed in the children studied, the settings, and how the education was delivered, and many were small. These factors make the overall certainty low to very low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to October 2022, so the review includes all research published before that date.",

However, several linguistic features deviate strongly from typical PLS patterns: passive voice (28 instances, beyond the 90th percentile), nominalizations (37), total nouns (250), SMOG index (15.3), complex words (174) and long words (243) are all far above the median ranges, indicating the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than usual PLSs. These metric deviations align with the identified clarity and style issues."
