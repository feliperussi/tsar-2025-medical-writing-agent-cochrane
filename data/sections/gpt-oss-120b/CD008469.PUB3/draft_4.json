  "draft": "Is asthma education at home (teaching children and families about asthma in their own home) more effective than usual care (the standard treatment) or other types of education for children with asthma?\n\nKey messages –\n- Home‑based asthma education (teaching about asthma at the child’s home) appears to provide little or no clear benefit over usual care or less‑intensive programmes in preventing emergency‑department visits or the need for oral corticosteroids (steroid pills taken by mouth); no harms were reported, and the evidence is uncertain because the studies varied widely and had methodological limitations.\n- More intensive home programmes (more sessions or longer duration) may reduce the chance of hospitalisation (staying in hospital) compared with less‑intensive home programmes, but the evidence is also uncertain and does not show clear effects on quality of life (overall wellbeing) or symptom‑free days (days without asthma symptoms).\n- Because existing research is diverse and of limited quality, we need well‑designed trials with standard outcomes and longer follow‑up to identify which parts of home‑based education work best.\n\nWhy is asthma a concern for children and how can education help?\nAsthma is a long‑lasting condition that makes the airways in the lungs swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. It affects more than 260 million people worldwide, including many children. Asthma attacks (called exacerbations) can happen suddenly. Children need to learn how to avoid triggers such as dust, pollen, or smoke, and how to use inhalers correctly. Teaching families about the disease and self‑management skills is a core part of asthma care. Healthcare providers can deliver asthma education in hospitals, schools or at home. Home visits may be especially useful for families who have trouble travelling or who face financial barriers, but we do not yet know whether learning at home works better than usual care.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether education programmes delivered in the home to children with asthma and their caregivers improve important health outcomes. Specifically, we examined whether home‑based education reduces the number of asthma attacks that lead to emergency‑department visits or require a short course of oral corticosteroids (steroid pills taken by mouth). We also looked at quality of life (how well a child feels and functions day‑to‑day), days without symptoms, school attendance and hospital admissions. We compared home‑based education with usual care, waiting‑list controls or less‑intensive education delivered outside the home, and we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two other databases and two trial registries up to October 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors. We included randomised controlled trials that tested face‑to‑face home education for children aged 2‑18 years with asthma. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results of similar studies using standard statistical methods and rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 26 trials that enrolled 5 122 participants aged 1‑18 years with mild to severe asthma. All trials delivered face‑to‑face home education and compared it with usual care, waiting‑list controls, less‑intensive education outside the home, or less‑intensive home education. Most outcomes were measured around six months after the start of the programme.\nThe evidence shows that home‑based education probably makes little or no difference to emergency‑department visits or to oral‑steroid courses. The evidence for quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance and hospital admissions is very uncertain.\nWhen we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes, we saw little or no difference in emergency visits or steroid courses. More intensive programmes may reduce hospital admissions, but this finding is uncertain. There was no clear effect on quality of life or symptom‑free days.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nBecause participants and educators usually knew which group they were in, all studies had a risk of bias. The trials varied in participants, settings and how the education was delivered, and many were small. These factors make the overall certainty low to very low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to October 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check: the subheading \"Key messages –\" is not phrased as a question, which the Master Style Guide requires for all subheadings. In addition, several clarity issues would confuse readers: (1) the bullet points under Key messages contain very long, compound sentences that overload the reader; (2) the term \"GRADE\" is introduced without any explanation of what it means; (3) many sentences are noun‑heavy and use nominalisations (e.g., \"The evidence suggests that providing home‑based asthma education…\"), making the text harder to follow; (4) the draft contains a high amount of passive constructions (21 instances, well above the typical PLS range) which obscures who is doing what. These issues, combined with the subheading problem, mean the PLS does not meet the required standards.\n\nSuggested concrete fixes:\n- Change the subheading to a question, e.g., \"What are the main findings?\" and keep the bullet list underneath.\n- Split each long bullet into two shorter points, e.g., \"Home‑based asthma education appears to provide little or no benefit over usual care or less‑intensive programmes in preventing emergency‑department visits or the need for oral steroids. No harms were reported, and the evidence is uncertain because the studies varied widely and had methodological limitations.\"\n- Add a brief definition after the first mention of GRADE, e.g., \"We rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system (a framework that grades the certainty of evidence).\"\n- Rewrite noun‑heavy sentences into active voice, e.g., replace \"The evidence suggests that providing home‑based asthma education…\" with \"We found that home‑based asthma education makes little or no difference…\"\n- Reduce passive voice throughout, aiming for fewer than 13 passive constructions as the metric suggests.\n\nThese revisions will improve readability, meet the style guide, and align the draft with typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on overall readability (Flesch Reading Ease 51.86, Grade 11) but shows significant deviations in several linguistic features: passive voice (21 instances, beyond P90), nominalisation (38, beyond P90), noun count (228, beyond P90), and high counts of complex and long words. These metrics indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need to simplify language, reduce passive constructions, and break up long sentences. This further justifies the recommended revisions."
