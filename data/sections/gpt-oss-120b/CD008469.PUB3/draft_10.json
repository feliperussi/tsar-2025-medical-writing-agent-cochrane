  "draft": "Is asthma education at home (teaching children and families about asthma in their own home) more effective than usual care (the standard treatment) or other types of education for children with asthma?\n\nKey messages –\n- Home‑based asthma education (teaching about asthma at the child's home) shows little or no clear benefit over usual care or less‑intensive education for preventing emergency‑department visits or the need for oral corticosteroids (steroid pills taken by mouth). No harmful effects were reported, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies varied and were often small.\n- More intensive home programmes (more sessions or longer duration) may reduce the chance of hospital admission, but the evidence is also uncertain and does not show clear effects on quality of life (overall wellbeing) or symptom‑free days (days without asthma symptoms). Better quality studies are needed.\n\nWhy is asthma a concern for children and how can education help?\nAsthma is a long‑lasting condition that makes the airways in the lungs swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. It affects more than 260 million people worldwide, including many children. Because asthma attacks (sudden worsening of symptoms) can happen quickly, children need to learn how to avoid triggers such as dust, pollen or smoke and how to use inhalers (devices that deliver medicine to the lungs) correctly. Teaching families about the disease and self‑management skills is a core part of asthma care. Education can be given in hospitals, schools or at home. Home‑based lessons may help families who find it hard to travel to clinics or who face financial barriers, but we do not yet know whether learning at home works better than usual care.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether home‑based education programmes for children with asthma and their caregivers improve important health outcomes. Specifically, we asked if such education reduces the number of asthma attacks that lead to emergency‑department visits or require a short course of oral corticosteroids. We also looked at quality of life, days without symptoms, school attendance and hospital admissions. We compared home‑based education with usual care, waiting‑list controls or less‑intensive education delivered outside the home, and we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two additional databases and two trial registries up to October 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors. Two reviewers independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled results where appropriate and used the GRADE system to rate how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 26 randomised controlled trials that together included 5,122 children and teenagers aged 1 to 18 years with asthma of any severity. All trials tested face‑to‑face, home‑based education programmes. Most outcomes were measured around six months after the programme started.\nWhen we compared home‑based education with usual care or less‑intensive education outside the home, we found little or no difference in emergency‑department visits or the need for oral steroids. The evidence for quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance and hospital admissions is very uncertain.\nWhen we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes, we also found little or no difference in emergency visits or steroid courses. More intensive programmes may reduce hospital admissions, but this finding is uncertain. We saw no clear effect on quality of life or symptom‑free days.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nBecause participants and educators often knew which group they were in, the studies may be biased. The trials differed in the ages of children, asthma severity, settings and how the education was delivered, and many were small. These factors lower our confidence in the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched for studies up to October 2022, so the review includes all research published before that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical style requirement: the \"Key messages\" heading is not phrased as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\"). All other required sections are present and the factual content matches the source, but several clarity problems would likely confuse readers:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as \"randomised controlled trials\" and \"GRADE system\" appear without simple explanations.\n2. **Overly long sentences** – e.g., \"Because asthma attacks (sudden worsening of symptoms) can happen quickly, children need to learn how to avoid triggers such as dust, pollen or smoke and how to use inhalers (devices that deliver medicine to the lungs) correctly.\" This exceeds 30 words and packs multiple ideas.\n3. **Passive constructions** – the draft contains 20 passive voice instances (P90), e.g., \"The main outcomes were measured after about six months,\" which obscures who performed the action.\n4. **Heavy nominalisation** – 34 noun‑forms (BEYOND_P90) such as \"assessment\" and \"evaluation\" make sentences noun‑heavy and harder to follow.\n5. **Bullet‑point formatting** – the key‑message list uses a dash but the heading itself is not a question, breaking the subheading rule.\nThese issues, combined with the subheading violation, prevent approval. Suggested rewrites are provided below for each point.\n\n**Suggested rewrites**:\n- Change heading to \"What are the key messages?\"\n- Explain jargon: \"We looked at randomised controlled trials – studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups – and used the GRADE system, a method that tells us how confident we can be in the results.\"\n- Shorten long sentence: \"Asthma attacks can happen quickly. Children need to learn how to avoid triggers like dust, pollen, or smoke and how to use inhalers correctly.\"\n- Convert passive to active: \"We measured the main outcomes about six months after the programme started.\"\n- Replace nominalisations: \"We assessed the quality of the evidence\" instead of \"assessment of the quality of the evidence\".\nAddressing these points will bring the PLS into full compliance with the Master Style Guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on readability (Flesch Reading Ease 54.5, grade 10.4) and active voice (64, P75), but deviates markedly on several metrics: passive voice (20, P90), nominalizations (34, BEYOND_P90), noun count (206, BEYOND_P90), complex words (135, P90), long words (198, P90), and Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (278, BEYOND_P90). These deviations indicate excessive noun‑heavy, passive, and technical language, supporting the identified clarity and style issues."
