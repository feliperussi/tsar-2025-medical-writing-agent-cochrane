  "draft": "Is asthma education at home more effective than usual care or other types of education for children with asthma?\n\nKey messages?\n- Home‑based asthma education shows little or no clear benefit over usual care or less‑intensive programmes in preventing emergency‑department visits or the need for oral corticosteroids (steroid pills taken by mouth), and no harms were reported. The evidence is uncertain because the studies differed a lot and had methodological limits.\n- More intensive home programmes (more sessions or longer duration) may reduce the chance of hospital admission, but the evidence is also uncertain and there is no clear effect on quality of life (overall wellbeing) or days without asthma symptoms.\n- Because the existing research is diverse and of limited quality, we need well‑designed trials with standard outcomes and longer follow‑up to identify which parts of home‑based education work best.\n\nWhy is asthma a concern for children and how can education help?\nAsthma is a long‑lasting condition that makes the airways in the lungs swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. It affects more than 260 million people worldwide, including many children. Asthma. Because asthma attacks (called exacerbations) can happen suddenly, children need to learn how to avoid triggers such as dust, pollen or smoke and how to use inhalers correctly. Teaching families about the disease and self‑management skills is a core part of asthma care. Education can be given in hospitals, schools or at home. Home visits may help families who have trouble travelling or who face financial barriers, but we do not know whether they work better than usual care.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether education programmes delivered in the home to children with asthma and their caregivers improve important health outcomes. Specifically, we examined whether home‑based education reduces the number of asthma attacks that lead to emergency‑department visits or require a short course of oral corticosteroids (steroid pills taken by mouth). We also looked at quality of life (how well a child feels and functions day‑to‑day), days without symptoms, school attendance and hospital admissions. We compared home‑based education with usual care, waiting‑list controls or less‑intensive education delivered outside the home, and we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two other databases and two trial registries up to October 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors. We included randomised controlled trials that tested face‑to‑face home education for children aged 2‑18 years with asthma. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled results using random‑effects meta‑analysis and rated certainty with GRADE (a system for judging how confident we are in the evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 26 trials that enrolled 5 122 participants aged 1‑18 years with mild to severe asthma. All trials delivered face‑to‑face home education and compared it with usual care, waiting‑list controls, less‑intensive education outside the home, or less‑intensive home education. Most outcomes were measured around six months after the start of the programme.\nThe evidence shows that home‑based education probably makes little or no difference to emergency‑department visits or to oral‑steroid courses. The evidence for quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance and hospital admissions is very uncertain.\nWhen we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes, we saw little or no difference in emergency visits or steroid courses. More intensive programmes may reduce hospital admissions, but this finding is uncertain. There was no clear effect on quality of life or symptom‑free days.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nAll studies were at risk of bias because participants and educators usually knew which group they were in. The trials varied in participants, settings and how the education was delivered, and many were small. These factors make the overall certainty low to very low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required structural and factual checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader. The most important issues are:\n1. **Excessive passive voice** – e.g., \"Asthma education may be provided in various settings.\" This hides who delivers the education and makes the sentence harder to follow. Rewrite actively: \"Healthcare providers can deliver asthma education in many settings.\"\n2. **Noun‑heavy, passive constructions** – e.g., \"All studies were at risk of bias because participants and educators usually knew which group they were in.\" This phrasing is clunky and obscures the cause‑effect relationship. A clearer version is: \"Because participants and educators usually knew their group, all studies had a risk of bias.\"\n3. **Unexplained technical terminology** – the methods section mentions \"random‑effects meta‑analysis\" without explanation, which is unnecessary for a patient audience. Simplify to: \"We combined the results of similar studies using standard statistical methods.\"\n4. **Long, compound sentence** – e.g., \"Because asthma attacks (called exacerbations) can happen suddenly, children need to learn how to avoid triggers such as dust, pollen or smoke and how to use inhalers correctly.\" This 28‑word sentence can be split for easier reading: \"Asthma attacks can happen suddenly. Children need to learn how to avoid triggers such as dust, pollen, or smoke, and how to use inhalers correctly.\"\n5. **Wordy phrasing** – e.g., \"the evidence is uncertain because the studies differed a lot and had methodological limits.\" Replace with a concise version: \"The evidence is uncertain because the studies varied widely and had methodological limitations.\"\nThese issues are reflected in the PLS evaluation metrics: the draft has 22 passive‑voice instances (far above the typical PLS range), 35 nominalizations, 214 nouns, and high counts of complex and long words. Reducing passive constructions, nominalizations, and simplifying vocabulary will improve readability and align the summary with Cochrane plain‑language standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (50% of features in best quartile) but notable deviations: passive_voice (22, P90), nominalization (35, BEYOND_P90), nouns (214, BEYOND_P90), and high complex/long word counts (complex_words_dc 296, complex_words 154, long_words 203 – all BEYOND_P90). Readability scores are strong (Flesch Reading Ease 56, grade ~10), but the excess of passive and noun‑heavy language suggests the text is harder for patients than typical Cochrane PLSs."
