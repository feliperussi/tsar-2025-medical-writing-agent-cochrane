  "draft": "Is asthma education at home more effective than usual care or other education for children with asthma?\n\nKey messages –\n- Home‑based asthma education (teaching about asthma at the child’s home) makes little or no difference to emergency‑department visits or the need for oral corticosteroids (steroid pills taken by mouth) when compared with usual care or less‑intensive programmes. No harms were reported, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies varied a lot and had methodological limitations.\n- More intensive home programmes (more sessions or longer duration) may lower the chance of hospitalisation (staying in hospital) compared with less‑intensive home programmes. The evidence is still uncertain and shows no clear effect on quality of life (overall wellbeing) or symptom‑free days (days without asthma symptoms).\n- Because the existing research is diverse and of limited quality, we need well‑designed trials with standard outcomes and longer follow‑up to find out which parts of home‑based education work best.\n\nWhy is asthma a concern for children and how can education help?\nAsthma is a long‑lasting condition that makes the airways in the lungs swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. It affects more than 260 million people worldwide, including many children. Asthma attacks (called exacerbations) can happen suddenly. Children need to learn how to avoid triggers such as dust, pollen or smoke and how to use inhalers correctly. Teaching families about the disease and self‑management skills is a core part of asthma care. Education can be given in hospitals, schools or at home. Home visits may be especially useful for families who have trouble travelling or who face financial barriers, but we do not yet know whether learning at home works better than usual care.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether education programmes delivered in the home to children with asthma and their caregivers improve important health outcomes. Specifically, we examined whether home‑based education reduces the number of asthma attacks that lead to emergency‑department visits or require a short course of oral corticosteroids. We also looked at quality of life, days without symptoms, school attendance and hospital admissions. We compared home‑based education with usual care, waiting‑list controls or less‑intensive education delivered outside the home, and we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two other databases and two trial registries up to October 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors. We included randomised controlled trials that tested face‑to‑face home education for children aged 2‑18 years with asthma. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results of similar studies using standard statistical methods. We rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system (a framework that grades the certainty of evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 26 trials that enrolled 5 122 participants aged 1‑18 years with mild to severe asthma. All trials delivered face‑to‑face home education and compared it with usual care, waiting‑list controls, less‑intensive education outside the home, or less‑intensive home education. Most outcomes were measured around six months after the start of the programme.\nWe found that home‑based education probably makes little or no difference to emergency‑department visits or oral‑steroid courses. The evidence for quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance and hospital admissions is very uncertain.\nWhen we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes, we saw little or no difference in emergency visits or steroid courses. More intensive programmes may reduce hospital admissions, but this finding is uncertain. There was no clear effect on quality of life or symptom‑free days.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nBecause participants and educators usually knew which group they were in, all studies had a risk of bias. The trials varied in participants, settings and how the education was delivered, and many were small. These factors make the overall certainty low to very low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to October 2022.",

Passive voice hides who did what and nominalisations turn actions into nouns, reducing readability. **Rewrite example:** Change \"The evidence suggests that providing home‑based asthma education…\" to \"We found that home‑based asthma education…\".\n4. **Wordy description of study size** – \"We examined 26 trials that enrolled 5 122 participants aged 1‑18 years with mild to severe asthma.\" This can be expressed more directly. **Rewrite:** \"We looked at 26 trials involving 5,122 children aged 1‑18 years with asthma of any severity.\"\n5. **Unclear risk‑of‑bias sentence** – \"Because participants and educators usually knew which group they were in, all studies had a risk of bias.\" The phrase “risk of bias” is technical and the causal link is vague. **Rewrite:** \"Because participants and educators often knew which group they were in, the studies may be biased.\"\nThese issues are reflected in the metric report: passive_voice = 22 (P90), nominalization = 38 (BEYOND_P90), nouns = 219 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words = 159 (BEYOND_P90) and long_words = 210 (BEYOND_P90).
