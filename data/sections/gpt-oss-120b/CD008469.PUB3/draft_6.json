  "draft": "Is asthma education at home (teaching children and families about asthma in their own home) more effective than usual care (the standard treatment) or other types of education for children with asthma?\n\nKey messages –\n- Home‑based asthma education (teaching about asthma at the child's home) provides little or no clear benefit over usual care or less‑intensive education in preventing emergency‑department visits (hospital trips for urgent care) or the need for oral corticosteroids (steroid pills taken by mouth). No harmful effects were reported, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies varied and had methodological limitations.\n- More intensive home programmes (more sessions or longer duration) may reduce the chance of hospitalisation (staying in hospital) compared with less‑intensive home programmes, but the evidence is also uncertain and does not show clear effects on quality of life (overall wellbeing) or symptom‑free days (days without asthma symptoms).\n- Because the existing research is diverse and of limited quality, we need well‑designed trials with standard outcomes and longer follow‑up to identify which parts of home‑based education work best.\n\nWhy is asthma a concern for children and how can education help?\nAsthma is a long‑lasting condition that makes the airways in the lungs swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. It affects more than 260 million people worldwide, including many children. Because asthma can flare up suddenly (called \"exacerbations\" or asthma attacks), children need to learn how to avoid triggers (like dust, pollen or smoke) and how to use their inhalers correctly. Teaching families about the disease and self‑management skills (how to control asthma day‑to‑day) is a key part of asthma care. Education can be given in hospitals, schools or at home. Providing lessons at home may be especially useful for families who have trouble travelling to clinics or who face financial barriers, but we do not yet know whether learning at home works better than usual care.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether educational programmes delivered in the home to children with asthma (and their caregivers) improve important health outcomes. Specifically, we asked if home‑based education reduces the number of asthma attacks that lead to emergency‑department visits or require a short course of oral corticosteroids (a type of medicine taken by mouth to calm inflammation). We also looked at quality of life (how well a child feels and functions), days without symptoms, school attendance and hospital admissions. We compared home‑based education with usual care, waiting‑list controls or less‑intensive education given outside the home, and we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two other databases and two trial registries up to October 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors. We included randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) that tested face‑to‑face home education for children aged 2‑18 years with asthma. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results of similar studies using standard statistical methods. We used the GRADE system to judge how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 26 trials involving 5,122 children and teenagers aged 1‑18 years with asthma of any severity. All trials tested face‑to‑face home education and compared it with usual care, waiting‑list controls, less‑intensive education outside the home, or less‑intensive home education. Most outcomes were measured around six months after the programme started.\nWe found that home‑based asthma education does not reduce emergency‑department visits or the need for oral steroids, whether it is compared with usual care or with a less‑intensive programme delivered outside the home. The evidence for quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance and hospital admissions is very uncertain.\nWhen we compared more intensive with less intensive home programmes, we saw little or no difference in emergency visits or steroid courses. More intensive programmes may reduce hospital admissions, but this finding is uncertain. There was no clear effect on quality of life or symptom‑free days.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nBecause participants and educators often knew which group they were in, the studies may be biased. The trials differed in the children studied, the settings, and how the education was delivered, and many were small. These factors make the overall certainty low to very low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft is missing the required \"Currency\" section (e.g., a subheading phrased as a question such as \"How current is the evidence?\") which is a critical completeness check. Additionally, the text contains several clarity and style problems that would confuse readers:\n1. **Passive voice overload** – many sentences hide who did what (e.g., \"The evidence suggests that providing home‑based asthma education, whether compared with usual care or with a less‑intensive programme delivered outside the home, probably makes little or no difference…\"). This contributes to the metric showing 26 passive constructions (beyond P90).\n2. **Nominalisations and noun‑heavy sentences** – phrases like \"the number of emergency department visits\" and \"the evidence is very uncertain\" make sentences bulky; the draft has 36 nominalisations and 238 nouns (both beyond P90).\n3. **Long, complex sentences** – several sentences exceed 30 words, making them hard to follow for patients (e.g., the 31‑word sentence starting with \"We looked at 26 trials…\").\n4. **Jargon without definition** – terms such as \"Peto odds ratio\" and \"GRADE\" appear without plain‑language explanations, which can alienate lay readers.\n5. **Missing paragraph breaks and bullet formatting** – the key‑messages list uses hyphens correctly, but other sections run together without blank lines, reducing readability.\n\nSuggested concrete rewrites:\n- Replace passive wording: \"The evidence suggests that providing home‑based asthma education…\" → \"We found that home‑based asthma education…\".\n- Reduce nominalisation: \"the number of emergency department visits\" → \"how often children went to the emergency department\".\n- Shorten long sentence: \"We looked at 26 trials involving 5,122 children…\" → \"We examined 26 trials with 5,122 children aged 1‑18 years.\"\n- Define jargon: add after first mention \"Peto odds ratio (a statistical measure that compares the chance of an event between groups)\" and \"GRADE (a system that rates how confident we are in the evidence)\".\n- Insert missing currency section: \"How current is the evidence?\\nWe searched for studies up to October 2022, so the review includes all research published before that date.\"\n\nThese changes address the most impactful clarity issues and bring the draft into line with the Master Style Guide while also correcting the critical missing section.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but notable deviations: passive_voice (26 instances, BEYOND_P90), nominalization (36, BEYOND_P90), nouns (238, BEYOND_P90), complex_words_dc (339, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (163, BEYOND_P90), long_words (233, BEYOND_P90), and smog_index (14.87, P90). These metrics confirm the editorial observations of excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy language, and high lexical complexity, supporting the recommended reductions."
