  "draft": "Do special skin dressings or holding devices (tape/straps) reduce failures and infections in artery tubes (peripheral arterial catheters) used in hospitals?\n\nKey messages –\n- Current research does not show a clear benefit of any special dressing or holding device (such as tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, suture‑less securement devices, or integrated securement dressings) in preventing catheter failure or catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). – the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.\n- The few trials that compared different products found little or no difference for outcomes such as catheter dislodgement (tube moving out of place), blockage (occlusion), or adverse events (unwanted side‑effects). – these findings are based on limited, low‑quality data.\n- More large, well‑designed randomised trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) are needed to determine whether any dressing or securement method can reliably reduce failure, infection, or harms.\n\nWhy are peripheral arterial catheters used and what problems can they cause?\nWe insert a thin, flexible tube into an artery near the skin to draw blood repeatedly and monitor blood pressure continuously. The tube is essential for safe anaesthesia and critical‑care monitoring, but it can become loose, blocked, or break – a problem called catheter failure. When failure occurs we must remove the tube and insert a new one, which is uncomfortable and raises the risk of infection, including CRBSI (infection that spreads from the catheter into the bloodstream).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether different dressings and securement devices help prevent catheter failure, dislodgement, blockage, or infection in hospital patients. We compared standard polyurethane dressings with bordered polyurethane dressings, tissue adhesive, suture‑less securement devices, and integrated securement dressings.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to 16 May 2023. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We included randomised controlled trials that compared any dressing or securement device for peripheral arterial catheters in hospitalized people.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five randomised controlled trials involving 1,228 participants and the same number of catheters. The trials compared:\n- Standard polyurethane dressings alone versus the same dressings with tissue adhesive.\n- Standard polyurethane dressings versus bordered polyurethane dressings.\n- Standard dressings plus suture‑less securement devices versus standard dressings alone.\n- Integrated securement dressings versus standard dressings.\nAll four comparisons showed very uncertain evidence; none demonstrated a clear reduction in catheter failure, CRBSI, dislodgement, blockage, or adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which product they received, the studies were small, some outcomes were not reported, and the trials involved different types of patients and methods.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nOur searches were current to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural checklist, but several clarity problems would likely confuse patients. 1) Jargon appears without prior definition: the term “catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI)” is used in the key messages before the abbreviation is explained. Rewrite to introduce the definition earlier, e.g., “catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), an infection that spreads from the catheter into the bloodstream”. 2) Some sentences are overly long and combine multiple ideas, making them hard to follow. Example: “When failure occurs we must remove the tube and insert a new one, which is uncomfortable and raises the risk of infection, including CRBSI (infection that spreads from the catheter into the bloodstream).” Split into two sentences: “When a catheter fails we have to remove it and insert a new one. This is uncomfortable and increases the risk of infection, including catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI).” 3) Excessive passive voice reduces readability (23 passive constructions, P90). Example: “The evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search.” Change to active: “We searched the literature up to May 2023.” 4) Wordy phrasing adds unnecessary length: “the studies were small and had methodological limitations.” Simplify to “the studies were small and had limitations.” 5) High lexical complexity (138 complex words, 249 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words, both P90) makes the text harder for lay readers. Replace technical terms where possible (e.g., “peripheral arterial catheters” → “artery tubes”) and use simpler synonyms (“utilize” → “use”). Addressing these issues will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is 496 words (within limit) but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: passive_voice (23, P90), nominalization (25, P90), coleman_liau_index (14.5, P90), gunning_fog_index (19.4, P90), lix (60, P90), smog_index (14.2, P90), dale_chall_readability (9.0, BEYOND_P90), and high counts of complex_words (138) and long_words (195). These indicate the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than usual PLS, supporting the need for the suggested simplifications."
