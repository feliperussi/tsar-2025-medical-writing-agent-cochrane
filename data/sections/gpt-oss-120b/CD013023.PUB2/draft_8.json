  "draft": "Do special skin dressings or holding devices (tape/straps) reduce failures and infections in artery tubes (peripheral arterial catheters) used in hospitals?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- Current research does not show a clear benefit of any special dressing or holding device (for example, tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, suture‑less devices, or integrated securements). We found no reduction in catheter failure or catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) – an infection that spreads from the catheter into the blood.\n- The few trials that compared different products showed little or no difference in outcomes such as catheter dislodgement (tube moving out of place), blockage (occlusion), or adverse events (unwanted side‑effects). These results come from limited and low‑quality data.\n- More large, well‑designed randomised trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) are needed to determine whether any dressing or securement method can reliably reduce catheter failure, infection, or harms.\n\nWhy are peripheral arterial catheters used and what problems can they cause?\nWe place a thin, flexible tube into an artery near the skin to draw blood repeatedly and to monitor blood pressure continuously. This helps doctors in operating rooms and intensive‑care units. However, the tube can become loose, blocked, or break – a problem called catheter failure. When failure occurs we must remove the tube and insert a new one, which is uncomfortable and raises the risk of infection, including CRBSI.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether different dressings and securement devices help prevent catheter failure, dislodgement, blockage, or infection in hospital patients. We compared standard polyurethane dressings with bordered polyurethane dressings, tissue adhesive, suture‑less securement devices, and integrated securement dressings.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to 16 May 2023. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We included randomised controlled trials that compared any dressing or securement device for peripheral arterial catheters in hospitalized people.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five randomised controlled trials involving 1,228 participants and the same number of catheters. The trials compared:\n- Standard polyurethane dressings alone versus the same dressings plus tissue adhesive.\n- Standard dressings versus bordered polyurethane dressings.\n- Standard dressings plus suture‑less securement devices versus standard dressings alone.\n- Integrated securement dressings versus standard dressings.\nWe did not report study duration, funding sources, participants’ ages, gender, illness severity, or the countries where the trials were conducted. Because the evidence is limited and uncertain, we cannot say that any dressing or securement method reduces catheter failure, bloodstream infection, dislodgement, blockage, or side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which product they received, the studies were small, some outcomes were not reported, and the trials involved different types of patients and methods.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nOur searches were current to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several reader‑confusing problems:\n1. **Overly long, dense paragraph in “What did we find?”** – the paragraph packs four different comparisons into one block, making it hard for a lay reader to follow.\n2. **Excessive passive constructions** – e.g., “The review did not provide details…”, which obscures who did the action and contributes to the high passive_voice count (23, well above the typical P90 range).\n3. **Wordy phrasing** – sentences such as “We place a thin, flexible tube into an artery near the skin to draw blood repeatedly and to monitor blood pressure continuously.” are longer than needed and reduce readability.\nThese issues, together with the metric‑driven evidence of high passive_voice (23 > median 13), high nominalisation (25 > median 13), and high complex‑word counts (complex_words = 137 > median 84; complex_words_dc = 257 > median 160), mean the PLS does not yet meet the required clarity for patients.\n\nSuggested top‑level improvements:\n- Break the “What did we find?” paragraph into a short introductory sentence followed by a bullet list, each bullet naming one comparison and its main result.\n- Convert passive sentences to active voice (e.g., change “The review did not provide details…” to “We did not provide details…”).\n- Simplify long sentences and replace nominalisations with verbs (e.g., rewrite the tube‑placement sentence as “We insert a thin, flexible tube into an artery to draw blood and monitor pressure.”).\nAddressing these three points will bring the draft into line with the Master Style Guide and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (e.g., Flesch Reading Ease 42, Grade 12). However, it deviates markedly on several metrics: passive_voice (23, beyond P90), nominalisation (25, beyond P90), smog_index (14.1, beyond P90), dale_chall_readability (8.8, beyond P90), and high counts of complex and long words. These deviations indicate the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need to reduce passive constructions, nominalisations, and complex vocabulary."
