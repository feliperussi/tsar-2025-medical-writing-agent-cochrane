  "draft": "Do special skin dressings or holding devices (tape/straps) reduce failures and infections in artery tubes (peripheral arterial catheters) used in hospitals?\n\nKey messages:\n- Current research does not show a clear benefit of any special dressing or holding device (for example, tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, suture‑less devices, or integrated securements) in preventing catheter failure or bloodstream infection that can come from the catheter (CRBSI). No harmful effects were reported, but the studies were small and had methodological problems, so the evidence is uncertain.\n- The few trials that compared different products found little or no difference for outcomes such as catheter dislodgement (tube moving out of place), blockage (occlusion), or side‑effects. These findings are based on limited and low‑quality data.\n- More large, well‑designed randomised trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) are needed to determine whether any dressing or securement method can reliably reduce catheter failure, infection, dislodgement, blockage, or harms.\n\nWhy are peripheral arterial catheters used and what problems can they cause?\nIn operating rooms and intensive‑care units we often need quick, reliable access to a patient’s arteries. A peripheral arterial catheter is a thin, flexible tube placed into an artery near the skin. It lets clinicians draw blood repeatedly and monitor blood pressure continuously. The tube can become loose, blocked, or break – a problem called catheter failure. When this happens the catheter must be removed and a new one inserted, which is uncomfortable and raises the risk of infection, including bloodstream infection that can come from the catheter (CRBSI).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether different dressings and securement devices help prevent catheter failure, dislodgement, blockage, or infection in hospital patients. We compared standard polyurethane dressings with bordered polyurethane dressings, tissue adhesive, suture‑less securement devices, and integrated securement dressings.\n\nHow did we search for and select studies?\nWe searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to 16 May 2023. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We included randomised controlled trials that compared any dressing or securement device for peripheral arterial catheters in hospitalized people.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five randomised controlled trials involving 1,228 participants and the same number of catheters. The trials compared:\n1. Standard polyurethane dressings alone versus the same dressings plus tissue adhesive.\n2. Standard dressings versus bordered polyurethane dressings.\n3. Standard dressings plus suture‑less securement devices versus standard dressings alone.\n4. Integrated securement dressings versus standard dressings.\nThe review did not provide details about study duration, funding sources, participants’ ages, gender, illness severity, or the countries where the trials were carried out. Because the evidence is limited and uncertain, we cannot say that any dressing or securement method (tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, suture‑less devices, or integrated securements) reduces catheter failure, bloodstream infection, dislodgement, blockage, or side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which product they received, the studies were small, some outcomes were not reported, and the trials involved different types of patients and methods.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nOur searches were current to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failed: the subheading \"Key messages:\" is not phrased as a question, which breaches the Master Style Guide requirement that all section subheadings be questions. Additionally, the draft contains several clarity and style issues that could confuse readers:\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Key messages:\" should be reworded as a question (e.g., \"What are the main findings?\").\n2. **Passive‑voice / nominalisation** – \"The review did not provide details about study duration, funding sources, participants’ ages, gender, illness severity, or the countries where the trials were carried out.\" This construction is noun‑heavy and passive‑like, making the sentence harder to follow. Rewrite as active: \"We did not report study duration, funding sources, participants’ ages, gender, illness severity, or the countries where the trials were conducted.\" (Metrics show 28 passive constructions and 25 nominalisations, far above typical PLS levels.)\n3. **Unexplained jargon** – Acronym \"CRBSI\" appears without a clear definition in the key messages. Add a brief explanation: \"catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) – an infection that spreads from the catheter into the blood.\"\n4. **Long, dense sentences** – The first key‑message bullet runs over 30 words and packs several ideas. Split it for readability: \"Current research does not show a clear benefit of any special dressing or holding device (for example, tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, suture‑less devices, or integrated securements). We found no reduction in catheter failure or bloodstream infection (CRBSI).\"\n5. **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – \"The few trials that compared different products found little or no difference for outcomes such as catheter dislodgement (tube moving out of place), blockage (occlusion), or side‑effects.\" Replace nouns with verbs: \"The few trials that compared different products showed little or no difference in outcomes such as catheter dislodgement, blockage, or side‑effects.\"\nThese revisions will lower the passive‑voice count, reduce nominalisations, shorten sentences, and bring the draft into line with the style guide while improving patient‑readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (563 words) and scores well on many readability indices (e.g., Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 42, FK grade 11). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: passive_voice (28, BEYOND_P90), nominalization (25, BEYOND_P90), nouns (169, BEYOND_P90), smog_index (14.9, BEYOND_P90), dale_chall_readability (8.9, BEYOND_P90), complex_words_dc (286, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (157, BEYOND_P90), and long_words (223, BEYOND_P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy language, and many long/complex words, supporting the suggested edits above."
