  "draft": "Do special skin dressings or holding devices (tape/straps) reduce failures and infections in artery tubes (peripheral arterial catheters) used in hospitals?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Current research does not show a clear benefit of any special dressing or holding device (such as tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, suture‑less securement devices, or integrated securement dressings) in preventing peripheral arterial catheter failure or catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI, an infection that spreads into the blood). No harmful effects were reported, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.\n- The few trials that compared different products found little or no difference for outcomes such as catheter dislodgement (tube moving out of place), blockage (occlusion), or adverse events (unwanted side‑effects). These findings are based on limited and low‑quality data.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to determine whether any dressing or securement method can reliably reduce catheter failure or infection and to assess potential harms.\n\nWhy are peripheral arterial catheters used and what problems can they cause?\nIn operating rooms and intensive‑care units we often need quick, reliable access to a patient’s arteries. A peripheral arterial catheter is a thin, flexible tube placed into an artery near the skin. It lets us draw blood repeatedly and monitor blood pressure continuously. The catheters can fail – they may become loose, blocked, or break – requiring removal and reinsertion, which is uncomfortable and raises the risk of infection, including CRBSI.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether different dressings and securement devices help prevent catheter failure, dislodgement, blockage, or infection in hospital patients. We compared standard polyurethane dressings, bordered‑polyurethane dressings, tissue adhesive, suture‑less securement devices, and integrated securement dressings.\n\nHow did we search for and select studies?\nWe searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to 16 May 2023. We included randomised controlled trials that compared any dressing or securement device for peripheral arterial catheters in hospitalized people. Two reviewers independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five randomised controlled trials involving 1,228 participants and the same number of catheters. The trials compared standard polyurethane dressings alone with: (1) the same dressings plus tissue adhesive, (2) bordered polyurethane dressings, (3) standard dressings plus suture‑less securement devices, and (4) integrated securement dressings. We did not record how long the studies lasted, who funded them, participants’ ages or genders, how sick they were, or where the trials took place. The evidence is very limited and uncertain, and we cannot say that any of the products reliably reduces failure, infection, dislodgement, blockage, or side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which product they received. The studies were small, some outcomes were not reported, and the trials involved different types of patients and methods.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nOur searches were current to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the mandatory checks (all required sections are present, sub‑headings are phrased as questions, facts and word‑count are correct) but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a patient reader. 1) The first key‑message bullet is a single, 45‑word sentence that packs many ideas, technical terms and clauses together, making it hard to follow. 2) The term “randomised” appears before it is explained, leaving readers unsure what it means. 3) The sentence “We did not record how long the studies lasted, who funded them, participants’ ages or genders, how sick they were, or where the trials took place.” is vague and sounds passive; it does not explain why this information is missing. 4) The sentence about the uncertainty of dressing effects is long (38 words) and uses several nominalisations (“make a difference”), which reduces readability. 5) The draft contains a high number of passive constructions (21) and nominalisations (25), reflected in the metrics (passive_voice = 21 → P90, nominalization = 25 → P90, smog_index = 14.4 → P90, dale_chall_readability = 8.74 → BEYOND_P90). These linguistic patterns contribute to the high complexity scores and make the text harder for lay readers.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑limit (524 words) and includes all required sections, but readability metrics show several deviations: passive_voice = 21 (P90), nominalization = 25 (P90), smog_index = 14.4 (P90), dale_chall_readability = 8.74 (BEYOND_P90), and high counts of complex and long words.
