  "draft": "Do special skin dressings or holding devices (tape/straps) reduce failures and infections in artery tubes (peripheral arterial catheters) used in hospitals?\n\nKey messages –\n- Current research does not show a clear benefit of any special dressing or holding device (such as tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, suture‑less securement devices, or integrated securement dressings) in preventing artery tube (peripheral arterial catheter) failure or catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), an infection that spreads from the catheter into the bloodstream. The evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had limitations.\n- The few trials that compared different products found little or no difference for outcomes such as tube dislodgement (the tube moving out of place), blockage (occlusion), or unwanted side‑effects. These findings are based on limited and low‑quality data.\n- More large, well‑designed randomised trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) are needed to determine whether any dressing or securement method can reliably reduce failure, infection, or harms.\n\nWhy are artery tubes used and what problems can they cause?\nIn operating rooms and intensive‑care units, doctors need quick, reliable access to a patient’s arteries. An artery tube (a thin, flexible tube placed into an artery near the skin) lets them draw blood repeatedly and monitor blood pressure continuously. The tubes are essential for safe anaesthesia and critical‑care monitoring, but they can fail – the tube may become loose, blocked, or break. When a tube fails we have to remove it and insert a new one. This is uncomfortable and increases the risk of complications such as infection. One serious infection is catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), where germs travel from the tube into the bloodstream.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether different dressings and securement devices help prevent tube failure, dislodgement, blockage, or infection in hospital patients. We compared standard polyurethane dressings with bordered polyurethane dressings, tissue adhesive, suture‑less securement devices, and integrated securement dressings.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to 16 May 2023 in the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We included randomised controlled trials that compared any dressing or securement device for artery tubes in hospitalized people.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five randomised controlled trials involving 1,228 participants and the same number of artery tubes. The trials compared:\n- Standard polyurethane dressings alone versus the same dressings with tissue adhesive.\n- Standard polyurethane dressings versus bordered polyurethane dressings.\n- Standard dressings plus suture‑less securement devices versus standard dressings alone.\n- Integrated securement dressings versus standard dressings.\nAll four comparisons showed very uncertain evidence. None demonstrated a clear reduction in tube failure, CRBSI, dislodgement, blockage, or unwanted side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which product they received, the studies were small, some outcomes were not reported, and the trials involved different types of patients and methods.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nOur searches were current to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required structural checks, but three major clarity problems would likely confuse patients: (1) the first key‑message bullet is overly long and packed with technical jargon; (2) the methods sentence lists many databases in a single, dense clause; (3) several sentences (e.g., the currency statement and the limitations sentence) are written in passive voice and noun‑heavy style, making the meaning hard to follow. These issues, together with the metric‑driven evidence of excessive passive constructions (24, beyond P90), high nominalisation (27, beyond P90) and a high noun count (163, beyond P90), indicate the text needs simplification and more active phrasing. Suggested rewrites are provided below.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but flags several deviations: passive_voice (24, BEYOND_P90), nominalization (27, BEYOND_P90), nouns (163, BEYOND_P90), and readability indices (smog, dale_chall) are higher than typical PLS ranges. These metrics support the editorial recommendation to reduce passive constructions, nominalisations, and noun‑heavy sentences to improve readability for a lay audience."
