  "key_messages": [
    "Current research does not show a clear benefit of any special dressing or holding device (such as tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, sutureless securement devices, or integrated securement dressings) in preventing peripheral arterial catheter (tube placed in an artery) failure or catheter‑related bloodstream infection (infection that spreads into the blood); no harmful effects were reported, and the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.",
    "The few trials that compared different products found little or no difference between them for outcomes such as catheter dislodgement (tube moving out of place), blockage (occlusion), or adverse events (unwanted side effects), but these findings are based on limited and low‑quality data.",
    "More large, well‑designed randomised trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) are needed to determine whether any dressing or securement method can reliably reduce catheter failure or infection and to assess any potential harms."

      "subheading": "Why are peripheral arterial catheters used and what problems can they cause?",
      "content": "In operating rooms and intensive‑care units, doctors often need quick, reliable access to a patient’s arteries. A peripheral arterial catheter (a thin, flexible tube placed into an artery near the surface of the skin) lets them draw blood repeatedly and monitor blood pressure continuously. While these catheters are essential for safe anaesthesia and critical‑care monitoring, they can fail – the tube may become loose, blocked, or break. When a catheter fails it has to be removed and a new one inserted, which is uncomfortable for the patient and increases the risk of complications such as infection. One serious infection is a catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), where germs travel from the catheter into the bloodstream. To keep the catheter in place and reduce these risks, hospitals use dressings (sticky coverings) and securement devices (things like adhesive patches, tissue glue, or special clips) that hold the catheter firmly against the skin."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether different types of dressings and securement devices actually help prevent catheter failure, dislodgement, blockage, or infections in hospital patients. Specifically, they compared products such as standard polyurethane dressings, bordered polyurethane dressings, tissue adhesive, suture‑less securement devices, and integrated securement dressings to see which, if any, reduced the chances of the catheter stopping working or causing harmful complications."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified five randomised controlled trials that together involved 1,228 participants and the same number of peripheral arterial catheters. The trials compared different dressing and securement approaches for arterial catheters: standard polyurethane dressings alone versus the same dressings with tissue adhesive; bordered polyurethane dressings versus standard polyurethane; standard polyurethane dressings with suture‑less securement devices versus standard polyurethane alone; and integrated securement dressings versus standard polyurethane. The review did not provide details about the length of the studies, funding sources, participant ages, genders, severity of illness, or the countries where the trials were carried out. The available evidence is very limited and uncertain. We are very uncertain whether any of the dressing or securement methods—adding tissue adhesive, using bordered polyurethane dressings, adding suture‑less securement devices, or using integrated securement dressings—make a difference to catheter failure, bloodstream infection, catheter dislodgement, blockage, or side‑effects. Overall, the current evidence does not show a clear benefit or harm of any particular dressing or securement method, and more robust research is needed to reduce this uncertainty."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search."
