  "draft": "Do special skin dressings or holding devices (tape/straps) reduce failures and infections in artery tubes (peripheral arterial catheters) used in hospitals?\n\nKey messages\n- Current research does not show a clear benefit of any special dressing or holding device – such as tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, suture‑less securement devices, or integrated securement dressings – in preventing tube failure or infection that spreads into the blood. No harmful effects were reported, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.\n- The few trials that compared different products found little or no difference for outcomes such as tube moving out of place, blockage (occlusion), or side‑effects. These findings are based on limited and low‑quality data.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to determine whether any dressing or securement method can reliably reduce tube failure or infection and to assess potential harms.\n\nWhy are peripheral arterial catheters used and what problems can they cause?\nIn operating rooms and intensive‑care units we often need quick, reliable access to a patient’s arteries. A peripheral arterial catheter (a thin, flexible tube placed into an artery near the skin) lets us draw blood repeatedly and monitor blood pressure continuously. While these tubes are essential for safe anaesthesia and critical‑care monitoring, they can fail – the tube may become loose, blocked, or break. When a tube fails we must remove it and insert a new one, which is uncomfortable for the patient and raises the risk of complications such as infection. One serious infection is catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), where germs travel from the tube into the bloodstream. To keep the tube in place and reduce these risks, hospitals use dressings (sticky coverings) and securement devices (adhesive patches, tissue glue, or special clips) that hold the tube firmly against the skin.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether different dressings and securement devices help prevent tube failure, dislodgement, blockage, or infection in hospital patients. We compared standard polyurethane dressings, bordered‑polyurethane dressings, tissue adhesive, suture‑less securement devices, and integrated securement dressings.\n\nHow did we search for and select studies?\nWe searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to 16 May 2023. We included randomised controlled trials that compared any dressing or securement device for peripheral arterial catheters in hospitalized people. Two reviewers independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five randomised controlled trials involving 1,228 participants and 1,228 tubes. The trials compared four approaches:\n- Standard polyurethane dressings alone;\n- Standard dressings with tissue adhesive;\n- Bordered polyurethane dressings; and\n- Standard dressings with suture‑less securement devices.\nWe also examined integrated securement dressings versus standard polyurethane. The review did not record how long the studies lasted, who funded them, the ages or genders of participants, how sick they were, or where the trials took place. Overall, the evidence is very limited and uncertain. We are not sure whether any of these products – tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane dressings, suture‑less securement devices or integrated securement dressings – reduce tube failure, infection, dislodgement, blockage, or side‑effects. No clear benefit or harm emerged from the available data.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which product they received, the studies were small, some outcomes were not reported, and the trials involved different patients and methods.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nWe completed our searches up to May 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that **all subheadings must be phrased as questions** – the \"Key messages\" heading is not a question. In addition, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers: (1) the passive‑voice sentence \"The review did not record how long the studies lasted…\" obscures who did the recording; (2) the limitations paragraph is a long, dense sentence that mixes several ideas, making it hard to follow; (3) the \"Key messages\" heading itself is not a question, violating the style guide; (4) the draft contains many nominalisations and noun‑heavy constructions (e.g., \"methodological limitations\", \"participants often knew which product they received\"), which increase reading difficulty; (5) a few technical terms (e.g., CRBSI) are introduced without a clear lay definition. Suggested rewrites: \n- Change heading to \"What are the key messages?\" \n- Rewrite passive sentence to active: \"We did not record how long the studies lasted, who funded them, participants' ages or genders, how sick they were, or where the trials took place.\"\n- Split the limitations sentence: \"We are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which product they received. The studies were small, some outcomes were not reported, and the trials involved different types of patients and methods.\"\n- Replace nominalised phrases with verbs: \"The studies used different methods\" instead of \"methodological limitations\".\n- Define CRBSI when first mentioned: \"catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), an infection that spreads into the blood\". These changes will improve readability and bring the draft into full compliance with the Master Style Guide. Metrics support these edits: passive_voice = 23 (P90), nominalization = 27 (P90), nouns = 174 (P90), complex_words = 154 (BEYOND_P90), long_words = 212 (BEYOND_P90). Reducing these will lower the reading grade level and improve the overall PLS conformity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability targets (e.g., Flesch Reading Ease 44.6, FKGL 11.9). However, several metrics deviate strongly from typical PLS patterns: passive_voice (23, P90), nominalization (27, P90), noun count (174, P90), smog_index (14.8, P90), dale_chall_readability (8.7, BEYOND_P90), complex_words_dc (298, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (154, BEYOND_P90), and long_words (212, BEYOND_P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy phrasing, and high lexical complexity, which reduce clarity for a lay audience."
