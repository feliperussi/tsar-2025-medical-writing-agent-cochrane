  "draft": "Do special skin dressings or holding devices (tape/straps) reduce failures and infections in artery tubes (peripheral arterial catheters) used in hospitals?\n\nKey messages:\n- Current research does not show a clear benefit of any special dressing or holding device – for example tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, suture‑less securement devices, or integrated securement dressings – in preventing catheter failure or bloodstream infection. No harmful effects were reported, but the studies were small and had methodological limitations, so the evidence is uncertain.\n- The few trials that compared different products found little or no difference for outcomes such as catheter dislodgement (tube moving out of place), blockage (occlusion), or side‑effects. These findings are based on limited and low‑quality data.\n- More large, well‑designed randomised trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) are needed to determine whether any dressing or securement method can reliably reduce catheter failure or infection and to assess any potential harms.\n\nWhy are peripheral arterial catheters used and what problems can they cause?\nIn operating rooms and intensive‑care units we often need quick, reliable access to a patient’s arteries. A peripheral arterial catheter (a thin, flexible tube placed into an artery near the skin) lets us draw blood repeatedly and monitor blood pressure continuously. The tube can become loose, blocked, or break – a problem called catheter failure. When this happens the catheter must be removed and a new one inserted, which is uncomfortable and raises the risk of infection, including catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), where germs enter the blood.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether different dressings and securement devices help prevent catheter failure, dislodgement, blockage, or infection in hospital patients. We compared standard polyurethane dressings with bordered polyurethane dressings, tissue adhesive, suture‑less securement devices, and integrated securement dressings.\n\nHow did we search for and select studies?\nWe searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to 16 May 2023. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We included randomised controlled trials that compared any dressing or securement device for peripheral arterial catheters in hospitalized people.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) involving 1,228 participants and the same number of catheters. The trials compared standard polyurethane dressings alone with: (1) the same dressings plus tissue adhesive, (2) bordered polyurethane dressings, (3) standard dressings plus suture‑less securement devices, and (4) integrated securement dressings. The review did not have information about study duration, funding sources, participants’ ages, genders, illness severity, or the countries where the trials were conducted. The evidence is limited and uncertain, so we cannot say that any dressing or securement method – such as tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, suture‑less devices, or integrated securements – reduces catheter failure, infection, dislodgement, blockage, or side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which product they received, the studies were small, some outcomes were not reported, and the trials involved different types of patients and methods.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nOur searches were current to May 2023.",
