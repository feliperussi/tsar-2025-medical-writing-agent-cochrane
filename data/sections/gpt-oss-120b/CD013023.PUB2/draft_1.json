  "draft": "Do special skin dressings or holding devices (tape/straps) reduce failures and infections in artery tubes (peripheral arterial catheters) used in hospitals?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Current research does not show a clear benefit of any special dressing or holding device (such as tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, sutureless securement devices, or integrated securement dressings) in preventing peripheral arterial catheter (tube placed in an artery) failure or catheter‑related bloodstream infection (infection that spreads into the blood); no harmful effects were reported, and the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.\n- The few trials that compared different products found little or no difference between them for outcomes such as catheter dislodgement (tube moving out of place), blockage (occlusion), or adverse events (unwanted side effects), but these findings are based on limited and low‑quality data.\n- More large, well‑designed randomised trials (studies? studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) are needed to determine whether any dressing or securement method can reliably reduce catheter failure or infection and to assess any potential harms.\n\nWHY ARE PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL CATHETERS USED AND WHAT PROBLEMS CAN THEY CAUSE?\nIn operating rooms and intensive‑care units, doctors often need quick, reliable access to a patient’s arteries. A peripheral arterial catheter (a thin, flexible tube placed into an artery near the surface of the skin) lets them draw blood repeatedly and monitor blood pressure continuously. While these catheters are essential for safe anaesthesia and critical‑care monitoring, they can fail – the tube may become loose, blocked, or break. When a catheter fails it has to be removed and a new one inserted, which is uncomfortable for the patient and increases the risk of complications such as infection. One serious infection is a catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), where germs travel from the catheter into the bloodstream. To keep the catheter in place and reduce these risks, hospitals use dressings (sticky coverings) and securement devices (things like adhesive patches, tissue glue, or special clips) that hold the catheter firmly against the skin.\n\nWHAT DID THE REVIEW AIM TO FIND OUT?\nThe authors wanted to know whether different types of dressings and securement devices actually help prevent catheter failure, dislodgement, blockage, or infections in hospital patients. Specifically, they compared products such as standard polyurethane dressings, bordered polyurethane dressings, tissue adhesive, suture‑less securement devices, and integrated securement dressings to see which, if any, reduced the chances of the catheter stopping working or causing harmful complications.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched databases for trials (studies that randomly assigned participants to groups) comparing different dressings and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters in hospitalized patients. We combined the findings from the identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWHAT DID WE FIND?\nWe identified five randomised controlled trials that together involved 1,228 participants and the same number of peripheral arterial catheters. The trials compared different dressing and securement approaches for arterial catheters: standard polyurethane dressings alone versus the same dressings with tissue adhesive; bordered polyurethane dressings versus standard polyurethane; standard polyurethane dressings with suture‑less securement devices versus standard polyurethane alone; and integrated securement dressings versus standard polyurethane. The review did not provide details about the length of the studies, funding sources, participant ages, genders, severity of illness, and the countries where the trials were carried out. The available evidence is very limited and uncertain. We are very uncertain whether any of the dressing or securement methods—adding tissue adhesive, using bordered polyurethane dressings, adding suture‑less securement devices, or using integrated securement dressings—make a difference to catheter failure, bloodstream infection, catheter dislodgement, blockage, or side‑effects. Overall, the current evidence does not show a clear benefit or harm of any particular dressing or securement method, and more robust research is needed to reduce this uncertainty.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF EVIDENCE\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.\n\nEVIDENCE CURRENCY\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because several subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., “METHODS”, “LIMITATIONS OF EVIDENCE”, “EVIDENCE CURRENCY”). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement that subheadings be question‑style. In addition, the text contains multiple clarity problems that would confuse readers: long, noun‑heavy sentences, excessive passive constructions, and jargon without clear definitions. Suggested improvements: 1. Subheading format – change “METHODS” to a question such as “How did we search for and select studies?”. Change “LIMITATIONS OF EVIDENCE” to “What are the limitations of the evidence?”. Change “EVIDENCE CURRENCY” to “How up‑to‑date is the evidence?”. 2. Long sentence – original: “The trials compared different dressing and securement approaches for arterial catheters: standard polyurethane dressings alone versus the same dressings with tissue adhesive; bordered polyurethane dressings versus standard polyurethane; standard polyurethane dressings with suture‑less securement devices versus standard polyurethane alone; and integrated securement dressings versus standard polyurethane.” Rewrite: “The trials compared four approaches: (1) standard polyurethane dressings alone, (2) the same dressings with tissue adhesive, (3) bordered polyurethane dressings, and (4) standard polyurethane dressings with suture‑less securement devices. We also looked at integrated securement dressings versus standard polyurethane.” 3. Passive voice – original: “The review did not provide details about the length of the studies, funding sources, participant ages, genders, severity of illness, and the countries where the trials were carried out.” Rewrite: “We did not have details on study length, funding sources, participants’ ages and genders, illness severity, or the countries where the trials were conducted.” 4. Jargon without definition – phrase “catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI)” appears later without reminder of the abbreviation. Add a brief definition the first time it is used, e.g., “catheter‑related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), an infection that spreads from the catheter into the blood.” 5. Noun‑heavy sentence – original: “The available evidence is very limited and uncertain.” Rewrite to a more active form: “We have very limited and uncertain evidence.” These changes address the most confusing elements and also reduce the high counts of passive voice (26 instances), long sentences (average 27.5 words per sentence), and noun‑heavy constructions (222 nouns) highlighted by the PLS evaluation. By re‑phrasing subheadings as questions and simplifying language, the draft will better meet the style guide and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft deviates strongly from typical PLS patterns: readability scores are low (Flesch Reading Ease 25.8, far below the typical 40‑50 range) and grade‑level indices are high (Flesch‑Kincaid 16.5, Gunning Fog 22). There are many long sentences (27.5 words avg, beyond the typical 19‑28) and a high number of passive constructions (26, beyond typical 9‑23). Noun count (222) and nominalizations (38) are also far above typical levels, contributing to the low readability. These metric alerts support the editorial suggestions above."
