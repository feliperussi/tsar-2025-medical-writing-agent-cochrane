  "key_messages": [
    "Organisational policies and staff education that aim to create a \"least‑restraint\" approach (changing rules and providing training) probably reduce the number of older residents who are restrained, especially belt restraints, and no serious harms were reported.",
    "Short, simple education programmes for staff alone (brief training sessions) show uncertain effects on restraint use; the current evidence does not clearly demonstrate a benefit or a risk.",
    "More high‑quality, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, explore long‑term outcomes, assess any possible harms, and investigate whether similar approaches work in community settings."

      "subheading": "Why are physical restraints used in long‑term care, and why is this a problem?",
      "content": "Many older people living in care homes or receiving care at home are sometimes fitted with devices such as bed‑rails, belts around chairs or beds, or other devices that limit their movement. These are called *physical restraints* – tools that keep a person from moving freely. Care staff often use them hoping to prevent falls, protect the person from harming themselves, or make it easier to provide care. However, research shows that these restraints do not reliably prevent injuries and can cause serious harm, including injuries, loss of dignity, reduced quality of life, and even death. Because of these safety and effectiveness concerns, health organisations worldwide recommend that physical restraints should be avoided whenever possible."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to discover whether specific programmes or strategies can safely reduce or stop the use of physical restraints for older adults who need long‑term care, either in residential facilities or at home. They compared two main types of interventions: (1) *organisational interventions* that try to create a \"least‑restraint\" policy by changing staff training, care culture, and facility rules, and (2) *simple educational interventions* that aim to increase staff knowledge and attitudes about restraints. The review examined how these approaches affect the number of residents who are restrained, the use of particular restraints such as belts, and any related serious adverse events."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 11 studies that together included 19,003 older people living in long‑term residential care facilities. All participants had dementia and the average age was about 85 years. The evidence came from ten randomised controlled trials and one controlled clinical trial. The interventions fell into three groups: (1) four organisational programmes that introduced a \"least‑restraint\" policy with staff education, champion training and culture change; (2) six simple educational programmes aimed at improving staff knowledge and attitudes toward restraints, sometimes with ward‑based guidance; and (3) one programme that gave staff information about each resident’s fall risk. Most studies compared these interventions with usual care, although two also provided extra informational materials about restraint reduction. All studies were conducted in residential care settings; no community‑based studies were found."

      "subheading": "Main results: Organisational policies probably reduce restraint use",
      "content": "Organisational policies that aim to use the least restraints probably reduce the number of residents who have any physical restraint and probably lead to a large reduction in the number of residents who have belt restraints. These policies may make little or no difference to the number of falls, fall‑related injuries, the amount of psychotropic medication prescribed, quality of life, or agitation. Simple educational programmes for staff have unclear effects on whether residents are restrained, probably make little or no difference to restraint intensity, falls, fall‑related injuries, and agitation, and it is unclear whether they affect psychotropic medication use. Providing staff with information about a resident’s fall risk probably makes little or no difference to the number of restraints used or to falls."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all studies provided all the data we wanted, the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search."
