  "draft": "Do organisational policies and staff education reduce the use of physical restraints (devices such as bed rails or belts) for older adults in care homes?\n\nKey messages\n– Policies that create a “least‑restraint” approach (using restraints only when absolutely necessary) probably lower the number of residents who are restrained, especially belt restraints, and no serious harms were reported.\n– Short, simple education programmes for staff alone show uncertain effects on restraint use; the current evidence does not clearly show a benefit or a risk.\n– More high‑quality, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, look at long‑term outcomes, assess possible harms, and test whether similar approaches work in community settings.\n\nWhy are physical restraints used in long‑term care, and why is this a problem?\nMany older people living in care homes or receiving care at home are sometimes fitted with devices such as bed‑rails, belts around chairs or beds, or other devices that limit movement. These are called physical restraints – tools that keep a person from moving freely. Staff often use them hoping to prevent falls, protect the person from self‑harm, or make care easier. Research shows that restraints do not reliably prevent injuries and can cause serious harm, including injuries, loss of dignity, reduced quality of life, and even death. Because of these safety concerns, health organisations worldwide recommend avoiding restraints whenever possible.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether specific programmes can safely reduce or stop the use of physical restraints for older adults who need long‑term care, either in residential facilities or at home. We compared two main types of interventions: (1) organisational interventions that try to create a “least‑restraint” policy by changing staff training, care culture, and facility rules, and (2) simple educational interventions that aim to increase staff knowledge and attitudes about restraints.\n\nHow did we search for and select studies?\nWe searched eight databases up to August 2022 for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that evaluated restraint‑reduction programmes in older people receiving long‑term care. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We combined results where possible and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 11 studies that together included 19 003 residents (average age ≈ 85 years) living in long‑term residential care. All participants had dementia. The studies comprised ten randomised controlled trials and one controlled clinical trial. The interventions fell into three groups: (1) four organisational programmes that introduced a “least‑restraint” policy with staff education, champion training and culture change; (2) six simple educational programmes that provided staff training and sometimes ward‑based guidance; and (3) one programme that gave staff information about each resident’s fall risk. All studies compared the interventions with usual care; we did not find any community‑based studies.\n\nWhat are the main findings?\nOrganisational policies that aim to use the least restraints probably reduce the proportion of residents who are restrained and probably cut belt‑restraint use by about half. These policies did not change the number of falls or fall‑related injuries. They also did not affect how much psychotropic medication was prescribed, residents’ quality of life, or agitation, and no serious adverse events were reported.\nSimple educational programmes for staff showed unclear effects on whether residents were restrained. They probably made little or no difference to restraint intensity, falls, fall‑related injuries, or agitation, and the impact on medication use remains uncertain.\nProviding staff with information about a resident’s fall risk probably made little or no difference to restraint use or to falls.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe are fairly sure about these results, but some uncertainty remains. Some studies may be biased because participants knew which treatment they received, many studies were small, and some data were missing or varied across settings. These factors lower our confidence.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to August 2022.",

Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers: (1) long, dense sentences in the “What are the main findings?” paragraph make key points hard to follow; (2) technical terms such as “psychotropic medication” are not explained; (3) passive constructions like “No serious adverse events were reported” obscure who observed the lack of events; (4) noun‑heavy phrasing (“The interventions fell into three groups”) reduces readability; (5) the paragraph on confidence mixes several ideas without clear breaks. These issues, combined with metric flags (20 passive voice instances, 21 nominalizations, 212 nouns, high complex‑word counts), indicate the draft needs revision before approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but notable deviations: passive voice (20, P90), nominalizations (21, P90), nouns (212, BEYOND_P90), complex words (156, BEYOND_P90), and long words (211, BEYOND_P90) are all well above typical PLS ranges, indicating the text is more noun‑ and passive‑heavy than usual. Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading Ease 50, P75), but the high noun and complexity counts suggest the draft could be simplified for better patient comprehension."
