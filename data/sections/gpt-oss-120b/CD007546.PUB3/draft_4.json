  "draft": "Do organisational policies and staff education reduce the use of physical restraints (devices such as bed rails or belts) for older adults in care homes?\n\nKey messages\n– Policies that create a “least‑restraint” approach (using restraints only when absolutely necessary) probably lower the number of residents who are restrained, especially belt restraints, and we did not see any serious harms.\n– Short, simple education programmes for staff alone show uncertain effects on restraint use; the current evidence does not clearly show a benefit or a risk.\n– More high‑quality, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, explore long‑term outcomes, assess possible harms, and test whether similar approaches work in community settings.\n\nWhy are physical restraints used in long‑term care, and why is this a problem?\nMany older people living in care homes or receiving care at home are sometimes fitted with devices such as bed‑rails, belts around chairs or beds, or other devices that limit movement. These are called physical restraints – tools that keep a person from moving freely. Staff often use them hoping to prevent falls, protect the person from self‑harm, or make care easier. Research shows that restraints do not reliably prevent injuries and can cause serious harm, including injuries, loss of dignity, reduced quality of life, and even death. Because of these safety concerns, health organisations worldwide recommend avoiding restraints whenever possible.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether specific programmes can safely reduce or stop the use of physical restraints for older adults who need long‑term care, either in residential facilities or at home. We compared two main types of interventions: (1) organisational interventions that try to create a “least‑restraint” policy by changing staff training, care culture, and facility rules, and (2) simple educational interventions that aim to increase staff knowledge and attitudes about restraints.\n\nHow did we search for and select studies?\nWe searched eight databases up to August 2022 for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that evaluated restraint‑reduction programmes in older people receiving long‑term care. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We combined results where possible and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 11 studies that together included 19 003 residents (average age ≈ 85 years) living in long‑term residential care. All participants had dementia. The studies comprised ten randomised controlled trials and one controlled clinical trial. The interventions fell into three groups: (1) four organisational programmes that introduced a “least‑restraint” policy with staff education, champion training and culture change; (2) six simple educational programmes that provided staff training and sometimes ward‑based guidance; and (3) one programme that gave staff information about each resident’s fall risk. All studies compared the interventions with usual care; we did not find any community‑based studies.\n\nWhat are the main findings?\nOrganisational policies that aim to use the least restraints probably reduce the proportion of residents who are restrained and probably cut belt‑restraint use by about half. These policies did not change the number of falls or fall‑related injuries. They also did not affect how much psychotropic medication (drugs that affect mood, behavior or thinking) was prescribed, residents’ quality of life, or agitation, and we did not see any serious adverse events.\nSimple educational programmes for staff showed unclear effects on whether residents were restrained. They probably made little or no difference to restraint intensity, falls, fall‑related injuries, or agitation, and the impact on medication use remains uncertain.\nProviding staff with information about a resident’s fall risk probably made little or no difference to restraint use or to falls.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, some studies were small, data were missing in several reports, and the studies used different types of people and delivery methods.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe are fairly sure about these results, but some uncertainty remains. Risk of bias, small study sizes, and missing data lower our confidence.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the subheading format requirement: two section headings are not phrased as questions (\"Key messages\" and \"Limitations\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide and the critical check that all subheadings must be questions. Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Key messages\". Rewrite as a question, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. **Subheading not a question** – \"Limitations\". Rewrite as a question, e.g., \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\".\n3. **Long, dense sentence** – \"Organisational policies that aim to use the least restraints probably reduce the number of residents who have any physical restraint and probably lead to a large reduction in the number of residents who have belt restraints.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words and packs two ideas. Split it: \"Organisational policies that aim to use the least restraints probably reduce the number of residents who have any physical restraint. They also appear to cut belt‑restraint use by about half.\".\n4. **Unexplained jargon** – terms like \"moderately confident\", \"GRADE\", \"randomised controlled trials\" are not defined for a lay audience. Replace with plain language: \"We are fairly sure about these results, but some uncertainty remains\" and \"We used standard methods to judge how reliable the evidence is\".\n5. **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – \"The interventions fell into three groups\" and \"The organisational interventions intended to promote a least‑restraint policy included a variety of components\". Use more verbs: \"We grouped the interventions into three types\" and \"The organisational interventions tried to create a least‑restraint policy by educating staff, training champions, and changing rules\".\nThese changes address the most important readability and style problems while keeping the factual content accurate. Metrics support: the evaluation shows high nominalisation (22, beyond typical), excessive nouns (225, beyond typical), and high SMOG (15.1) and Dale‑Chall scores, indicating the text is more complex than typical PLS. Reducing noun‑heavy sentences and long words, as suggested above, will bring these metrics closer to the median ranges.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit but deviates from typical plain‑language summary patterns on several metrics: nominalisation (22, P90), noun count (225, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.1, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.29, P90), complex words (160, beyond P90) and long words (220, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than usual PLS, supporting the need to simplify language, reduce nominalisations, and break up long sentences."
