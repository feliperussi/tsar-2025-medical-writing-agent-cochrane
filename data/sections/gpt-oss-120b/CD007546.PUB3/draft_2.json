  "draft": "Do organisational policies and staff education reduce the use of physical restraints (devices such as bed rails or belts) for older adults in care homes?\n\nKey messages\n– Organisational policies that promote a “least‑restraint” approach (using restraints only when absolutely necessary) probably lower the number of residents who are restrained, especially belt restraints, and no serious harms were reported.\n\n– Short, simple education programmes for staff alone show uncertain effects on restraint use; the current evidence does not clearly demonstrate a benefit or a risk.\n\n– More high‑quality, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, explore long‑term outcomes, assess possible harms, and test whether similar approaches work in community settings.\n\nWhy are physical restraints used in long‑term care, and why is this a problem?\nMany older people in care homes or receiving care at home are fitted with devices such as bed‑rails or belts that limit their movement. These are called physical restraints – tools that keep a person from moving freely. Staff often use them hoping to prevent falls, protect the person from self‑harm, or make care easier. Research shows that restraints do not reliably prevent injuries and can cause serious harm, including injuries, loss of dignity, reduced quality of life, and even death. Because of these safety concerns, health organisations worldwide recommend avoiding restraints whenever possible.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether specific programmes can safely reduce or stop the use of physical restraints for older adults who need long‑term care, either in residential facilities or at home. We compared (1) organisational interventions that try to create a “least‑restraint” policy by changing staff training, care culture, and facility rules, and (2) simple educational interventions that aim to increase staff knowledge and attitudes about restraints.\n\nHow did we search for and select studies?\nWe searched eight databases up to August 2022 for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that evaluated restraint‑reduction interventions in older people receiving long‑term care. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We combined results where possible and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 11 studies that together included 19 003 residents (average age ≈ 85 years) living in long‑term residential care. All participants had dementia. The evidence came from ten randomised controlled trials and one controlled clinical trial. The interventions fell into three groups: (1) four organisational programmes that introduced a “least‑restraint” policy with staff education, champion training and culture change; (2) six simple educational programmes that provided staff training and sometimes ward‑based guidance; and (3) one programme that gave staff information about each resident’s fall risk. All studies compared the interventions with usual care; no community‑based studies were found.\n\nWhat are the main findings?\nOrganisational policies that aim for the least‑restraint approach probably reduce the proportion of residents who are restrained and probably cut belt‑restraint use by about half. These policies made little or no difference to the number of falls, fall‑related injuries, use of psychotropic medication, quality of life, or agitation, and no serious adverse events were reported. Simple educational programmes for staff showed unclear effects on whether residents were restrained and probably made little or no difference to restraint intensity, falls, injuries, or agitation; the impact on medication use remains uncertain. Providing staff with information about a resident’s fall risk probably made little or no difference to restraint use or falls.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these results. Some studies may have been influenced because participants knew which intervention they received, many studies were small, and the data were sometimes incomplete or varied across settings. These factors reduce our certainty.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to August 2022.",
