  "draft": "Do medicines (such as proton‑pump inhibitors) help treat gastro‑oesophageal reflux (acid reflux) in infants and children?\n\nKey messages –\n- Medicines that lower stomach acid – proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2‑antagonists – do not clearly relieve reflux symptoms in infants or older children. The evidence is very uncertain, and the studies did not report any harms.\n- Small studies in some age groups sometimes suggested a modest improvement, but overall the data are limited, inconsistent, and do not give reliable information about healing of the oesophagus or long‑term outcomes.\n- Because the evidence is weak and incomplete, we need well‑designed randomised trials with more participants and longer follow‑up, especially in groups such as preterm infants and children with neurological conditions, to determine whether these medicines truly help and whether any harms appear.\n\nWhat is gastro‑oesophageal reflux and why does it matter for babies and children?\nGastro‑oesophageal reflux (often shortened to GOR) is when stomach contents flow back up the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach (the oesophagus). It can cause spitting up, coughing, irritability and discomfort. About half of babies under three months experience GOR, and it usually improves as the child grows. In some older children, or in babies with other health problems, reflux can continue, affect growth, sleep and quality of life. When reflux causes enough symptoms that doctors decide treatment is needed, it is called gastro‑oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Doctors sometimes prescribe medicines that lower stomach acid – PPIs or H2‑antagonists – to try to reduce the problem.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about medicines for reflux in children?\nWe wanted to know whether acid‑reducing medicines actually work for infants and children. We compared each medicine with a dummy treatment (placebo) that looks like the medicine but contains no active drug, or with another medicine. Our main questions were: do the medicines reduce symptoms that children and parents notice, do they change the amount of acid that reaches the oesophagus, and are there any side‑effects? We also looked at how confident we can be in the results.\n\nHow did we carry out the review?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared acid‑reducing medicines with placebo or another drug in children up to 16 years old. We included studies published up to September 2022. Two reviewers checked each study, extracted the data and rated the confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 36 trials that together enrolled 2,251 infants and children with reflux, from newborns to 16 years old. The trials tested PPIs such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole and pantoprazole, and one H2‑antagonist (ranitidine). The overall evidence is very uncertain.\n- Omeprazole may have little or no effect on infant symptoms, and the evidence is very uncertain. When compared with ranitidine, the data suggest a possible small benefit, but certainty remains low.\n- Esomeprazole appears to have little or no effect on symptoms in newborns, with great uncertainty.\n- In older children, different doses of rabeprazole and pantoprazole also show little or no difference in symptom improvement, and the certainty is low.\nOverall, we do not have reliable evidence that any of these medicines help children with reflux.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies involved different types of participants, used different ways of giving the medicines, and were generally very small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to September 2022.",

In addition, the text is noun‑heavy and contains many long, complex words, making it harder for patients to read. The most important improvements are:\n1. Sub‑heading format – Change \"Key messages –\" to a question such as \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. Noun‑heavy sentence – Original: \"We identified 36 trials that together enrolled 2,251 infants and children with reflux, from newborns to 16 years old.\" Rewrite: \"We found 36 trials that included 2,251 infants and children with reflux, from newborns up to 16 years old.\" (reduces noun load).\n3. Complex / long words – Original: \"The overall evidence is very uncertain.\" Rewrite: \"We are very unsure about the evidence.\" (shorter, more familiar words).\n4. Jargon without definition – Original: \"We compared each medicine with a dummy treatment (placebo) that looks like the medicine but contains no active drug, or with another medicine.\" Rewrite: \"We compared each medicine with a placebo – a pill that looks the same but has no active drug – or with another medicine.\" (clarifies \"dummy treatment\").\n5. Long sentence – Original: \"Omeprazole may have little or no effect on infant symptoms, and the evidence is very uncertain. When compared with ranitidine, the data suggest a possible small benefit, but certainty remains low.\" Rewrite: \"Omeprazole may have little or no effect on infant symptoms, and we are very unsure about this result. When we compare it with ranitidine, the data hint at a small benefit, but the certainty is still low.\" (splits into clearer sentences).\nThese changes address the most confusing elements for readers and also bring the draft closer to the typical PLS metric ranges (reducing nouns, complex words, and long words).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to most typical patterns (high active voice, good readability scores). However, four metrics deviate: nouns (166 vs typical <116), complex_words_dc (252 vs <160), complex_words (116 vs <84), and long_words (178 vs <122). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long, complex words, supporting the suggested edits to simplify language and reduce noun density."
