  "draft": "Do medicines (such as proton‑pump inhibitors) help treat gastro‑oesophageal reflux (acid reflux) in infants and children?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Medicines that lower stomach acid – proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2‑antagonists – do not show a clear benefit for relieving reflux symptoms in infants or older children, and the evidence is very uncertain; the studies we found did not report specific harmful effects.\n- Small studies in some age groups sometimes suggested a modest improvement, but the overall data are limited, inconsistent, and do not give reliable information about healing of the oesophagus (endoscopic changes) or long‑term outcomes.\n- Because the current evidence is weak and incomplete, we need well‑designed randomised trials with more participants and longer follow‑up, especially in groups such as preterm infants and children with neurological conditions, to determine whether these medicines truly help and whether any harms appear.\n\nWhat is gastro‑oesophageal reflux and why does it matter for babies and children?\nGastro‑oesophageal reflux (often called GOR) is when stomach contents flow back up the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach (the oesophagus). It can cause spitting up, coughing, irritability and discomfort. About half of babies under three months experience GOR, and it usually improves as the child grows. In some older children or in babies with other health problems, reflux can continue, affect growth, sleep and quality of life, and may be called gastro‑oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) when treatment is needed. Doctors sometimes prescribe medicines that lower stomach acid – PPIs or H2‑antagonists – to try to reduce the problem.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about medicines for reflux in children?\nWe wanted to know whether these acid‑reducing medicines actually work for infants and children. We compared any such medicine with a dummy treatment (placebo) or with another medicine. Our main questions were: do the medicines reduce symptoms that children and parents notice, do they change the amount of acid that reaches the oesophagus, and are there any side‑effects? We also assessed how confident we can be in the results.\n\nHow did we carry out the review?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared acid‑reducing medicines with placebo or another drug in children up to 16 years old. We summarised the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 36 trials that together enrolled 2,251 infants and children with reflux, ranging from newborns to 16 years. The trials tested PPIs such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole and pantoprazole, and one H2‑antagonist (ranitidine). The evidence from these trials is very uncertain. Omeprazole may have little or no effect on infant symptoms, and we are very unsure about this result. Compared with ranitidine, omeprazole may reduce infant symptoms, but the certainty is still very low. Esomeprazole also shows little or no effect in newborns. In older children, different doses of rabeprazole and pantoprazole appear to make little or no difference to symptom improvement. Overall, we do not have reliable evidence that any of these medicines help children with reflux.\n\nWhat are the limits of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies involved different types of participants, used different ways of giving the medicines, and were generally very small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical clarity checks: (1) The first key‑message bullet is a long, compound sentence that mixes two ideas and uses vague wording – “did not report specific harmful effects” – which may mislead readers into thinking harms were not looked for. (2) In the Results section the statements about omeprazole are contradictory – one sentence says it may have little or no effect, the next says it may reduce infant symptoms – creating confusion about the actual finding. (3) The term “placebo” is used without any brief definition, leaving non‑expert readers unsure what it means. These issues would likely confuse patients and need to be rewritten. Additionally, the draft contains a high number of nouns, complex words and long words (nouns = 161 >P90, complex_words_dc = 235 >P90, long_words = 167 >P90), making the text denser than typical PLS. Reducing noun‑heavy phrasing and swapping long, technical words for simpler alternatives will improve readability.\n\nSuggested improvements:\n1. Problematic sentence: “Medicines that lower stomach acid – proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2‑antagonists – do not show a clear benefit for relieving reflux symptoms in infants or older children, and the evidence is very uncertain; the studies we found did not report specific harmful effects.”\n   Why problematic: Too long, mixes benefit and safety information, and “did not report specific harmful effects” is vague.\n   Rewrite: “Medicines that lower stomach acid – proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2‑antagonists – do not clearly relieve reflux symptoms in infants or older children. The evidence is very uncertain, and the studies did not report any harms.”\n\n2. Problematic sentences: “Omeprazole may have little or no effect on infant symptoms, and we are very unsure about this result. Compared with ranitidine, omeprazole may reduce infant symptoms, but the certainty is still very low.”\n   Why problematic: The two sentences appear contradictory, which can confuse readers about whether omeprazole helps.\n   Rewrite: “Omeprazole may have little or no effect on infant symptoms, and the evidence is very uncertain. When compared with ranitidine, the data suggest a possible small benefit, but the certainty remains low.”\n\n3. Problematic term: “placebo” appears in the Methods and Results without explanation.\n   Why problematic: Readers unfamiliar with research terminology may not understand what a placebo is.\n   Rewrite: Add a brief definition, e.g., “a dummy treatment (placebo) that looks like the medicine but contains no active drug.”\n\n4. Problematic phrasing (noun‑heavy): “The evidence from these trials is very uncertain.”\n   Why problematic: Uses abstract noun “evidence” repeatedly, contributing to high noun count.\n   Rewrite: “We are very uncertain about the trial results.”\n\n5. Problematic long word: “pharmacological” (12 letters) appears in the title of the original abstract but not needed in the PLS.\n   Why problematic: Increases long‑word count.\n   Rewrite: Use “medicine” instead of “pharmacological treatment” where appropriate.\n\nThese revisions address the major clarity issues and also reduce the high noun, complex‑word and long‑word counts identified by the PLS evaluation.\n\nOverall, the draft currently exceeds typical PLS patterns for nouns (161 >P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (235 >P90) and long words (167 >P90), indicating a need to simplify language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well on most metrics (e.g., readability scores in the best quartile), but deviates on three key features: nouns (161, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (235, P90) and long words (167, P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long or unfamiliar words, suggesting simplification is needed."
