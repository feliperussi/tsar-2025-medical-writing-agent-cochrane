  "key_messages": [
    "Medicines such as proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs) (drugs that lower stomach acid) and H2‑antagonists (another type of acid‑reducing drug) have not shown a clear benefit for relieving reflux symptoms in infants or older children, and the evidence is very uncertain; no specific harmful effects were reported in the studies we found.",
    "Small studies in specific age groups sometimes suggested a modest improvement in symptoms, but the overall data are limited, inconsistent, and do not provide reliable information about healing of the oesophagus (endoscopic changes) or long‑term outcomes.",
    "Because the current evidence is weak and incomplete, further well‑designed randomised trials with larger numbers of participants and longer follow‑up are needed, especially in sub‑groups such as preterm infants and children with neurological conditions, to determine whether these medicines truly help and whether any harms emerge."

      "subheading": "What is gastro‑oesophageal reflux and why is it a concern for babies and children?",
      "content": "Gastro‑oesophageal reflux (often shortened to GOR) is when the contents of the stomach flow back up into the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach (the oesophagus). This can cause spitting up, coughing, irritability and discomfort. It is very common in early infancy – about half of babies under three months experience it – and usually gets better as the child grows. However, for some older children, or for babies who have other health problems, the reflux can continue for a long time and may affect their growth, sleep and quality of life. When the reflux causes enough symptoms that doctors decide treatment is needed, it is called gastro‑oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). To try to reduce the acid that comes up, doctors sometimes prescribe medicines such as proton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs, which lower stomach acid) or H₂‑antagonists (another type of acid‑reducing drug)."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers aim to find out about drug treatments for reflux in children?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether the medicines that are used to treat reflux in infants and children actually work. They compared any drug that reduces stomach acid or changes how the stomach works with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or with other drugs. Their main questions were: do these medicines lessen the symptoms that children and parents notice, do they change the amount of acid that reaches the oesophagus, and are there any side‑effects? They also looked at how confident we can be in the results they found."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 36 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 2,251 infants and children with gastro‑oesophageal reflux, ranging from newborns to 16 years old. The studies compared several medicines – proton‑pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole and pantoprazole, and an H₂‑antagonist (ranitidine) – with placebo or with each other. The abstract did not give details about how long the treatments lasted, the follow‑up periods, the funding sources or the countries where the trials were carried out.\n\nThe evidence from these trials is very uncertain. Omeprazole may have little or no effect on infant symptoms, and we are very unsure about this result. Compared with ranitidine, omeprazole of omeprazole may reduce infant symptoms, but again the certainty is very low. Esomeprazole may have little or no effect on symptoms in newborns, with great uncertainty. In older children, different doses of rabeprazole appear to make little or no difference to symptom improvement, and the certainty is very low. Pantoprazole may also have little or no effect on symptoms in young children, with very uncertain evidence. Overall, we do not have reliable evidence to show that any of these medicines help children with reflux."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and because the studies were very small.",
