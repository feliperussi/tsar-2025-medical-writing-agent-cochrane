  "draft": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalized mental training to help with daily tasks) effective for people with mild to moderate dementia?\n\nKey messages:\n- Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia do everyday activities better; participants often reach the personal daily goals they set and feel more confident.\n- For family or unpaid caregivers (care partners), CR gives small improvements in some quality‑of‑life areas, but at the end of treatment there is a slight increase in depressive symptoms and a small drop in psychological wellbeing.\n- The evidence comes mainly from one large, high‑quality trial, so more diverse and longer‑term studies are needed to confirm benefits and explore any downsides.\n\nWhy is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?\nDementia slowly reduces memory, thinking and planning abilities. In the mild‑to‑moderate stage many people still live at home, but they may find cooking, dressing, paying bills or remembering appointments difficult. These problems lower independence and increase reliance on family or professional caregivers. Medicines such as cholinesterase inhibitors (drugs that boost brain chemicals) do not fully restore daily abilities, so non‑drug approaches like CR are explored.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about cognitive rehabilitation?\nWe wanted to know whether CR – a personalised, goal‑oriented programme that teaches strategies for everyday tasks – improves daily functioning and other important outcomes for people with dementia and for their care partners. Specifically, we looked at everyday activity performance, quality of life, mood, cognitive abilities and care‑partner wellbeing. We also examined whether factors such as type of dementia, programme length or who delivered the training might influence the results.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared CR with usual care for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia and measured outcomes for the person or their care partner. We combined the results of eligible trials and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six trials that together enrolled 1,702 participants aged 76 to 80 years; about 59 % had Alzheimer’s disease. All trials compared a personalised CR programme with an inactive control such as usual care. Outcomes were measured at the end of the treatment period and again at medium‑term follow‑up (3–12 months).\n\nWhat were the main results?\n- CR produced a large increase in everyday goal attainment (goal attainment means achieving the personal daily tasks a person set, such as remembering medication or preparing a simple meal) and a large increase in satisfaction with goal attainment.\n- Smaller benefits were seen for self‑efficacy (confidence in one’s ability to do tasks), immediate memory recall and auditory selective attention (the ability to focus on sounds, like listening to a conversation in a noisy room).\n- Small declines were observed in overall ability to carry out everyday activities (general functional ability), memory and anxiety.\n- No major harms were reported.\n- For care partners, CR slightly improved some quality‑of‑life areas. At the end of treatment (short‑term) there was a slight rise in depressive symptoms and a small decrease in psychological wellbeing.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings because participants and therapists usually knew which treatment they received, and only six trials were available. This limits how certain we can be about the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to October 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

It also led to a large increase in how satisfied people felt about reaching their goals.”\n- Replace “general functional ability” with a clearer phrase like “overall ability to do everyday tasks such as dressing, cooking, or paying bills.”\n- Reduce noun‑heavy phrasing throughout, e.g., change “small declines were observed in overall ability to carry out everyday activities (general functional ability), memory and anxiety” to “people’s overall ability to do everyday tasks, their memory, and their anxiety got a little worse.”\nThese changes will lower the nominalisation count and make the summary more accessible for patients and caregivers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (ARI 11.8, Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 46.4) are within typical ranges. However, six metrics deviate (nominalisation, noun count, SMOG, complex words, complex words DC, long words) all in the P90 range, indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many complex/long words than typical patient‑leaflet summaries. This supports the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
