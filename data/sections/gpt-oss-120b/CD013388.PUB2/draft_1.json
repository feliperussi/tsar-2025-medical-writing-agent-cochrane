  "draft": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalized mental training to help with daily tasks) effective for people with mild to moderate dementia?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Cognitive rehabilitation (personalised mental training to help with daily tasks) appears to improve everyday functioning (how well a person can do daily activities) for people with mild to moderate dementia (early to middle stages of memory and thinking problems), with strong evidence that participants achieve their personal goals (goal attainment) and feel more confident (self‑efficacy); a few small negative effects on overall functional ability, memory, and anxiety were noted, but no major harms were reported.\n- For care partners (people who provide unpaid support, such as family members), the training led to small improvements in some aspects of quality of life, while short‑term assessments showed slight worsening of mood (depression) and psychological wellbeing.\n- Because the findings rely heavily on one large study, more well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up (checking results a few months later) and diverse participants are needed to confirm benefits, understand any downsides, and determine how best to deliver cognitive rehabilitation.\n\n**Introduction**\nWhy is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?\nDementia is a condition that gradually impairs memory, thinking and the ability to plan or carry out everyday tasks. When the disease is in its mild or moderate stage, people often still live at home, but they may struggle with simple activities such as cooking, dressing, paying bills or remembering appointments. These difficulties reduce independence and increase the need for support from family members or professional caregivers. While medicines such as cholinesterase inhibitors are sometimes used, they do not fully restore the ability to manage daily life. Non‑drug approaches, including various forms of cognitive training and rehabilitation, are therefore explored to help people keep doing the things that matter to them.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about cognitive rehabilitation?\nThe authors wanted to know whether cognitive rehabilitation (CR) – a personalised, goal‑oriented programme that teaches people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia strategies to cope with everyday tasks – actually improves daily functioning and other important outcomes for both the people with dementia and their care partners. Specifically, they set out to (1) evaluate the effects of CR on everyday activity performance, quality of life, mood and cognitive abilities; (2) assess any impact on the wellbeing of the people who provide care; and (3) explore factors that might influence how well CR works, such as the type of dementia, the length of the programme or who delivers it.\n\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assigned participants to cognitive rehabilitation or control) evaluating CR for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia and related care‑partner outcomes, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,702 people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia. Participants were on average 76 to 80 years old and the proportion of men ranged from about 30 % to 80 %. Where the type of dementia was reported, most participants had Alzheimer’s disease (about 59 % of the whole sample and 81 % of those with a specified diagnosis). All trials compared a personalised cognitive‑rehabilitation programme with an inactive control such as usual care. Outcomes were measured at the end of the treatment period and again at medium‑term follow‑up (3–12 months). Details on the length of the interventions, the countries where the studies were conducted and the funding sources were not provided in the abstract.\n\nMain results: Large improvement in everyday goal attainment\nCognitive rehabilitation produced a large increase in everyday goal attainment for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia (high certainty). It also led to a large increase in satisfaction with goal attainment (high certainty). Smaller benefits were seen for self‑efficacy, immediate recall and auditory selective attention, while there were slight reductions in general functional ability and some other outcomes. Overall, the strongest and most certain effect was the substantial boost in achieving personal daily goals.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failures: • Subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"), which breaches the Master Style Guide requirement. • The draft contains excessive nominalisations and noun‑heavy sentences, making it harder for lay readers (e.g., \"Main results: Large improvement in everyday goal attainment\" and many long passive constructions). • Several sentences exceed 30 words and use technical jargon without plain‑language definitions (e.g., \"high‑certainty evidence\" and \"standardised mean difference\"). Suggested top improvements: 1) Rewrite subheadings as questions, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\", \"Why did we do this review?\", \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\". 2) Reduce nominalisations and noun density: change \"Main results: Large improvement in everyday goal attainment\" to \"What improvement did we see in everyday goals?\" and replace \"high‑certainty evidence\" with \"strong evidence\". 3) Shorten long sentences and replace jargon: rewrite \"Cognitive rehabilitation produced a large increase in everyday goal attainment for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia (high certainty).\" as \"People with mild‑to‑moderate dementia who received cognitive rehabilitation were much more likely to achieve their daily goals, and the evidence is strong.\" 4) Define technical terms in plain language when first used, e.g., add after “standardised mean difference (SMD)”: \"a way of measuring how big the effect is\". 5) Convert passive voice to active voice: change \"The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search\" to \"We searched up to October 2022\". Supporting metrics: the draft shows 29 nominalisations (beyond P90), 198 nouns (beyond P90), high Gunning Fog (19.4) and SMOG (16) scores, and 18 passive constructions, confirming the need to simplify language and increase active voice.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets the word limit (733 words) but deviates on several readability and style metrics: nominalisations (29, BEYOND_P90), nouns (198, BEYOND_P90), Gunning Fog (19.43, P90), SMOG (16, BEYOND_P90), complex words (177, BEYOND_P90), and long words (242, BEYOND_P90) are all far above typical PLS ranges, indicating overly complex, noun‑heavy text. Passive voice count (18) is also high (P75). These metric deviations support the editorial recommendations to reduce nominalisations, simplify vocabulary, shorten sentences, and use active voice."
