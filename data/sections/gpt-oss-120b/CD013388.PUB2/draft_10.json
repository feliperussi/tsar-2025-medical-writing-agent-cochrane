  "draft": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalized mental training to help with daily tasks) effective for people with mild to moderate dementia?\n\nKey messages:\n- Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia improve everyday functioning. Participants usually reach the personal goals they set (goal attainment – doing the daily tasks they chose, such as remembering medication) and feel more confident (self‑efficacy – belief in their ability to do everyday tasks).\n- For unpaid care partners, CR gives small improvements in some quality‑of‑life areas, but short‑term assessments show a slight increase in depressive symptoms and a small drop in psychological wellbeing.\n- Most of the evidence comes from one large, high‑quality trial; we need more diverse and longer‑term studies to confirm benefits and to understand any downsides.\n\nWhy is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?\nDementia gradually reduces memory, thinking and planning abilities. In the mild‑to‑moderate stage many people still live at home, but they may find cooking, dressing, paying bills or remembering appointments difficult. These problems lower independence and increase reliance on family or professional caregivers. Medicines such as cholinesterase inhibitors do not fully restore daily abilities, so we explore non‑drug approaches like CR.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about cognitive rehabilitation?\nWe wanted to know whether CR – a personalised, goal‑oriented programme that teaches strategies for everyday tasks – improves daily functioning and other important outcomes for people with dementia and for their care partners. Specifically, we examined everyday activity performance, quality of life, mood, cognitive abilities and care‑partner wellbeing. We also looked at whether factors such as type of dementia, programme length or who delivered the training might influence the results.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared CR with usual care for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia and measured outcomes for the person or their care partner. We combined the results of the eligible trials and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six trials that together enrolled 1,702 participants aged 76 to 80 years; about 59 % had Alzheimer’s disease. All trials compared a personalised CR programme with an inactive control such as usual care. We measured outcomes at the end of the treatment period and again at medium‑term follow‑up (3–12 months).\n\nMain results:\n- CR produced a large increase in everyday goal attainment (high certainty) and a large increase in satisfaction with goal attainment.\n- Smaller benefits were seen for self‑efficacy (confidence in doing tasks). There was also a modest improvement in immediate memory recall. Participants were better able to focus on sounds in noisy environments (auditory selective attention – hearing a conversation despite background noise).\n- General functional ability (overall capacity to carry out daily activities like dressing or cooking) showed a slight decline, and memory and anxiety showed small worsening.\n- We did not find any major harms.\n- For care partners, CR gave small improvements in some quality‑of‑life areas. In the short term, participants reported a slight increase in depressive symptoms and a small decrease in psychological wellbeing.\n‑\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings because participants and therapists usually knew which treatment they received, and only six trials were available. This limits how certain we can be about the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to October 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

Their ages ranged from 76 to 80 years, and about 59 % had Alzheimer’s disease.\"\n5. **High noun and nominalisation density** – The draft contains many noun‑heavy phrases (e.g., \"general functional ability\", \"small improvements in some quality‑of‑life areas\") which increase reading difficulty. Re‑phrasing some of these as verbs improves flow.\n   *Rewrite example:* Change \"General functional ability showed a slight decline\" to \"People’s overall ability to carry out daily activities declined slightly.\"\nThese changes address the most confusing elements and also reduce the high noun and nominalisation counts flagged by the PLS evaluation (24 nominalisations, 166 nouns, and high complex‑word counts).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on word count (588 words) and overall readability (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 46.7, grade ~11.6). However, several metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisations (24, beyond P90), noun count (166, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.6, beyond P90), and high counts of complex and long words. These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than usual, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
