  "draft": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalized mental training to help with daily tasks) effective for people with mild to moderate dementia?\n\nKey messages:\n- Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia do everyday activities better. We found strong evidence that participants achieve the personal goals they set and feel more confident (self‑efficacy).\n- For care partners, CR slightly improves some areas of quality of life, but short‑term data show a small increase in depressive symptoms and a slight drop in overall psychological wellbeing.\n- Most of the evidence comes from one large, high‑quality trial. We need more well‑designed studies with longer follow‑up and more diverse participants to confirm the benefits and understand any downsides.\n\nWhy is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?\nDementia gradually impairs memory, thinking and planning. In the mild‑to‑moderate stage many people still live at home, but they may find simple tasks such as cooking, dressing, paying bills or remembering appointments difficult. These problems reduce independence and increase the need for support from family or professional caregivers. Medicines such as cholinesterase inhibitors do not fully restore the ability to manage daily life, so non‑drug approaches like cognitive rehabilitation are explored to help people keep doing the things that matter to them.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about cognitive rehabilitation?\nWe wanted to know whether cognitive rehabilitation – a personalised, goal‑oriented programme that teaches strategies for everyday tasks – improves daily functioning and other important outcomes for people with dementia and for their care partners. Specifically, we looked at everyday activity performance, quality of life, mood, cognitive abilities and care‑partner wellbeing. We also explored whether factors such as type of dementia, programme length or who delivered the training might influence the results.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared CR with usual care for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia and measured outcomes for the person with dementia or their care partner. We combined the results of eligible trials and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six trials that together enrolled 1,702 participants aged 76 to 80 years; about 59 % had Alzheimer’s disease. All trials compared a personalised CR programme with an inactive control such as usual care. Outcomes were measured at the end of the programme and again at medium‑term follow‑up (3–12 months).\n\nMain results: Large improvement in everyday goal attainment\nCR produced a large increase in everyday goal attainment – that is, participants were more likely to meet the personal daily goals they set – and a large increase in satisfaction with goal attainment. Smaller benefits were seen for confidence (self‑efficacy), immediate memory recall and auditory selective attention – the ability to focus on important sounds while ignoring background noise. Small declines were observed in general functional ability, memory and anxiety. No major harms were reported.\n\nFor care partners, CR slightly improved some areas of quality of life. Short‑term data, however, showed a slight rise in depressive symptoms and a small drop in psychological wellbeing.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe are moderately confident in the findings because participants and therapists usually knew which treatment they received, and only six trials were available. This limits how certain we can be about the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to October 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because several section headings are not phrased as questions and the required \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\" heading is missing. This breaks the Master Style Guide requirement for subheadings. Additionally, the draft contains a high level of nominalisation (22 instances) and several noun‑heavy headings that could be rewritten as active, question‑style headings. Finally, one long sentence (\"CR produced a large increase in everyday goal attainment – that is, participants were more likely to meet the personal daily goals they set – and a large increase in satisfaction with goal attainment.\") could be split for easier reading. Suggested rewrites: \n1. Change \"Methods\" to \"How did we find the evidence?\" \n2. Change \"Main results: Large improvement in everyday goal attainment\" to \"What were the main results?\" \n3. Add a new subheading \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\" before the paragraph about the search date. \n4. Rewrite the long sentence as two shorter sentences: \"CR produced a large increase in everyday goal attainment – participants were more likely to meet the personal daily goals they set. It also led to a large increase in satisfaction with goal attainment.\" \n5. Rephrase \"Limitations of the evidence\" as \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" These changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability.\n\nMetrics support these edits: the evaluation shows a high nominalisation count (22, beyond typical P90) and a high noun count (163, beyond typical P90), indicating the text is noun‑heavy. The passive voice count (14) is within the typical range, but converting headings to active questions will further reduce nominalisation and improve clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit (575 words) and has good overall conformity (moderate). Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 46, FKGL 11.6). However, several metrics deviate: nominalisations (22, P90), nouns (163, P90), SMOG index (14.7, P90), complex words (143, P90) and long words (188, P90) are higher than typical PLS ranges, indicating the text is more noun‑ and complex‑word heavy than usual. Adjusting headings and reducing nominalisations will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns."
