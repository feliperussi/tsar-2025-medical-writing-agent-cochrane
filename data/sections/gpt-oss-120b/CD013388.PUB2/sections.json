  "plain_title": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalized mental training to help with daily tasks) effective for people with mild to moderate dementia?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Cognitive rehabilitation (personalised mental training to help with daily tasks) appears to improve everyday functioning (how well a person can do daily activities) for people with mild to moderate dementia (early to middle stages of memory and thinking problems), with strong evidence that participants achieve their personal goals (goal attainment) and feel more confident (self‑efficacy); a few small negative effects on overall functional ability, memory, and anxiety were noted, but no major harms were reported.",
    "For care partners (people who provide unpaid support, such as family members), the training led to small improvements in some aspects of quality of life, while short‑term assessments showed slight worsening of mood (depression) and psychological wellbeing.",
    "Because the findings rely heavily on one large study, more well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up (checking results a few months later) and diverse participants are needed to confirm benefits, understand any downsides, and determine how best to deliver cognitive rehabilitation."

      "subheading": "Why is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?",
      "content": "Dementia is a condition that gradually impairs memory, thinking and the ability to plan or carry out everyday tasks. When the disease is in its mild or moderate stage, people often still live at home, but they may struggle with simple activities such as cooking, dressing, paying bills or remembering appointments. These difficulties reduce independence and increase the need for support from family members or professional caregivers. While medicines such as cholinesterase inhibitors are sometimes used, they do not fully restore the ability to manage daily life. Non‑drug approaches, including various forms of cognitive training and rehabilitation, are therefore explored to help people keep doing the things that matter to them."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out about cognitive rehabilitation?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether cognitive rehabilitation (CR) – a personalised, goal‑oriented programme that teaches people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia strategies to cope with everyday tasks – actually improves daily functioning and other important outcomes for both the people with dementia and their care partners. Specifically, they set out to (1) evaluate the effects of CR on everyday activity performance, quality of life, mood and cognitive abilities; (2) assess any impact on the wellbeing of the people who provide care; and (3) explore factors that might influence how well CR works, such as the type of dementia, the length of the programme or who delivers it."

      "content": "We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assigned participants to cognitive rehabilitation or control) evaluating CR for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia and related care‑partner outcomes, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified six randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,702 people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia. Participants were on average 76 to 80 years old and the proportion of men ranged from about 30 % to 80 %. Where the type of dementia was reported, most participants had Alzheimer’s disease (about 59 % of the whole sample and 81 % of those with a specified diagnosis). All trials compared a personalised cognitive‑rehabilitation programme with an inactive control such as usual care. Outcomes were measured at the end of the treatment period and again at medium‑term follow‑up (3–12 months). Details on the length of the interventions, the countries where the studies were conducted and the funding sources were not provided in the abstract."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Large improvement in everyday goal attainment",
      "content": "Cognitive rehabilitation produced a large increase in everyday goal attainment for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia (high certainty). It also led to a large increase in satisfaction with goal attainment (high certainty). Smaller benefits were seen for self‑efficacy, immediate recall and auditory selective attention, while there were slight reductions in general functional ability and some other outcomes. Overall, the strongest and most certain effect was the substantial boost in achieving personal daily goals."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search."
