  "draft": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalised mental training to help with daily tasks) effective for people with mild to moderate dementia?\n\nKey messages:\n- Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia reach daily goals and feel more confident (self‑efficacy). The evidence for these benefits is strong.\n- For care partners, CR gives small improvements in some quality‑of‑life areas, but short‑term assessments showed a small rise in depressive symptoms and a slight drop in psychological wellbeing.\n- Most of the evidence comes from one large, high‑quality study. We need more well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up and more diverse participants to confirm the benefits and understand any downsides.\n\nWhy is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?\nDementia gradually reduces memory, thinking and the ability to plan or carry out everyday tasks. In the mild‑to‑moderate stage many people still live at home, but they may find simple activities such as cooking, dressing, paying bills or remembering appointments difficult. These problems lower independence and increase the need for help from family or professional caregivers. Medicines such as cholinesterase inhibitors do not fully restore the ability to manage daily life, so non‑drug approaches like cognitive rehabilitation are explored to help people keep doing the things that matter to them.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about cognitive rehabilitation?\nWe wanted to know whether cognitive rehabilitation (CR) – a personalised, goal‑oriented programme that teaches strategies for everyday tasks – improves daily functioning and other important outcomes for people with dementia and for their care partners. Specifically, we looked at effects on everyday activity performance, quality of life, mood, cognitive abilities, and on the wellbeing of care partners. We also explored whether factors such as type of dementia, programme length or who delivered the training might influence the results.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to CR or to a control) that evaluated CR for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia and reported outcomes for the person with dementia or their care partner. We combined the results of the eligible trials and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six trials that together enrolled 1,702 participants aged 76 to 80 years. Most participants (about 59%) had Alzheimer’s disease. All trials compared a personalised CR programme with an inactive control such as usual care. Outcomes were measured at the end of the programme and again after 3 to 12 months.\n- People who received CR were much more likely to achieve their personal daily goals and reported higher satisfaction with goal attainment. The evidence for these effects is strong.\n- Small positive effects were also seen for confidence (self‑efficacy), immediate memory recall and the ability to focus on sounds (auditory selective attention).\n- There were small drops in the ability to do everyday tasks, in memory, and in anxiety levels, but no major harms were reported.\n- For care partners, the training produced small improvements in certain quality‑of‑life domains, while short‑term data showed a small rise in depressive symptoms and a slight drop in psychological wellbeing.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because participants and therapists usually knew which group they were in, and because only six trials were available. This limits how certain we can be about the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to October 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

Additionally, the draft contains a high density of nouns and complex words (165 nouns, 137 complex words, 177 long words) and a SMOG index of 14.4, indicating the language is more complex than typical PLS texts. Reducing noun‑heavy sentences and substituting simpler synonyms would improve readability. Overall, the draft needs these clarifications and simplifications before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability metrics (e.g., Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 49, words per sentence 19). However, it deviates on several lexical complexity measures: nouns (165, >P90), SMOG index (14.4, >P90), complex words (137, >P90), complex words (DC) (244, >P90) and long words (177, >P90). These suggest the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long or complex words, supporting the need to simplify terminology and reduce noun density."
