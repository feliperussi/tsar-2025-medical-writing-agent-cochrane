  "draft": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalized mental training to help with daily tasks) effective for people with mild to moderate dementia?\n\nKey messages:\n- Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) improves everyday functioning (how well a person can do daily activities) for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia; we found strong evidence that participants meet their personal daily goals (goal attainment) and feel more confident (self‑efficacy).\n- For care partners, CR gives small improvements in some quality‑of‑life areas, but short‑term assessments show a slight worsening of mood (more depressive symptoms) and a small drop in psychological wellbeing (overall mental health).\n- Most evidence comes from one large, high‑quality trial. We need more well‑designed studies with longer follow‑up (checking results a few months later) and more diverse participants to confirm benefits and understand any downsides.\n\nWhy is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?\nDementia gradually impairs memory, thinking and planning. In the mild‑to‑moderate stage many people still live at home, but they may find simple activities such as cooking, dressing, paying bills or remembering appointments difficult. These problems reduce independence and increase the need for support from family or professional caregivers. Medicines such as cholinesterase inhibitors do not fully restore the ability to manage daily life, so non‑drug approaches like cognitive rehabilitation are explored to help people keep doing the things that matter to them.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about cognitive rehabilitation?\nWe wanted to know whether cognitive rehabilitation (CR) – a personalised, goal‑oriented programme that teaches strategies for everyday tasks – improves daily functioning and other important outcomes for people with dementia and for their care partners. Specifically, we looked at everyday activity performance, quality of life, mood, cognitive abilities and care‑partner wellbeing. We also explored whether factors such as type of dementia, programme length or who delivered the training might influence the results.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared CR with usual care for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia and measured outcomes for the person with dementia or their care partner. We combined the results of eligible trials and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six trials that together enrolled 1,702 participants aged 76 to 80 years; about 59 % had Alzheimer’s disease. All trials compared a personalised CR programme with an inactive control such as usual care. Outcomes were measured at the end of the programme and again at medium‑term follow‑up (3–12 months).\n- CR produced a large increase in everyday goal attainment (meeting the personal daily goals you set) and a large increase in satisfaction with goal attainment. This effect was supported by high‑certainty evidence.\n- Small benefits were also seen for confidence (self‑efficacy), immediate memory recall and auditory selective attention (the ability to focus on important sounds while ignoring background noise).\n- Small declines (worsening) were observed in overall functional ability, memory and anxiety, but no major harms were reported.\n- For care partners, CR led to small improvements in some quality‑of‑life domains. Short‑term data, however, showed a slight rise in depressive symptoms (feelings of sadness) and a small drop in psychological wellbeing.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because participants and therapists usually knew which treatment they received, and only six trials were available. This limits how certain we can be about the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to October 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, title and sub‑heading format, factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Long, compound bullet sentence** – \"Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) improves everyday functioning (how well‑being a person can do daily activities) for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia; we found strong evidence that participants meet their personal daily goals (goal attainment) and feel more confident (self‑efficacy).\" This sentence packs three ideas and uses a semicolon, making it hard to follow.\n   *Rewrite:* \"Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia do everyday activities better. We found strong evidence that participants achieve the personal goals they set and feel more confident (self‑efficacy).\"\n2. **Unexplained technical term** – \"auditory selective attention\" appears in the results without a clear lay definition.\n   *Rewrite:* \"auditory selective attention – the ability to focus on important sounds while ignoring background noise.\"\n3. **Over‑reliance on parenthetical definitions** – many key concepts are explained in brackets (e.g., \"goal attainment (meeting the personal daily goals you set)\") which interrupts the reading flow.\n   *Rewrite:* Integrate the definition into the sentence: \"CR produced a large increase in everyday goal attainment – that is, participants were more likely to meet the personal daily goals they set.\"\n4. **Potentially confusing phrasing about harms** – \"Small declines (worsening) were observed in overall functional ability, memory and anxiety\" mixes the terms \"overall functional ability\" and \"general functional ability\" used elsewhere, which may confuse readers.\n   *Rewrite:* \"Small declines were seen in general functional ability, memory and anxiety.\"\n5. **Nominalised language and dense nouns** – the draft contains many noun‑heavy phrases (e.g., \"small improvements in some quality‑of‑life domains\") that reduce readability. Re‑phrasing to active verbs improves clarity.\n   *Rewrite:* \"CR slightly improved some areas of quality of life for care partners.\"\nThese issues are supported by the metric analysis, which shows high nominalisation (23, beyond typical range), many complex words (151, beyond P90), and a high SMOG index (14.8, above the median). Reducing nominalisations, simplifying vocabulary and shortening sentences will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns and make it easier for patients to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is 594 words (within the 850‑word limit) and scores moderately on typical PLS patterns. Readability indices are around the median (e.g., Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 44, FKGL 12.5). However, several metrics deviate markedly: nominalisations (23, beyond P90), nouns (168, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.8, above median), complex words (151, beyond P90), long words (190, beyond P90) and complex Dale‑Chall words (260, beyond P90). These suggest the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than typical PLS, supporting the need for the suggested simplifications."
