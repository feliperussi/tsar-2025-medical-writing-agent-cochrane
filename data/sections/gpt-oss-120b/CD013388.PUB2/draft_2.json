  "draft": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalised mental training to help with daily tasks) effective for people with mild to moderate dementia?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) – a personalised, goal‑oriented mental training programme – helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia (early to middle stages of memory and thinking problems) achieve their daily goals and feel more confident (self‑efficacy). The evidence for these benefits is strong.\n- For care partners (people who provide unpaid support, such as family members) the training gives small improvements in some aspects of quality of life, but short‑term assessments show a slight worsening of mood (depression) and psychological wellbeing.\n- Most of the evidence comes from one large, high‑quality study. We need more well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up and more diverse participants to confirm the benefits and understand any downsides.\n\nWhy is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?\nDementia gradually reduces memory, thinking and the ability to plan or carry out everyday tasks. In the mild‑to‑moderate stage many people still live at home, but they may find simple activities such as cooking, dressing, paying bills or remembering appointments difficult. These problems lower independence and increase the need for help from family or professional caregivers. Medicines such as cholinesterase inhibitors do not fully restore the ability to manage daily life, so non‑drug approaches like cognitive rehabilitation are explored to help people keep doing the things that matter to them.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about cognitive rehabilitation?\nWe wanted to know whether cognitive rehabilitation (CR) – a personalised, goal‑oriented programme that teaches strategies for everyday tasks – improves daily functioning and other important outcomes for people with dementia and for their care partners. Specifically, we looked at effects on everyday activity performance, quality of life, mood, cognitive abilities, and on the wellbeing of care partners. We also explored whether factors such as type of dementia, programme length or who delivered the training might influence the results.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to CR or to a control) that evaluated CR for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia and reported outcomes for the person with dementia or their care partner. We combined the results of the eligible trials and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six trials that together enrolled 1,702 participants aged 76 to 80 years. Most participants (about 59%) had Alzheimer’s disease. All trials compared a personalised CR programme with an inactive control such as usual care. Outcomes were measured at the end of the programme and again after 3 to 12 months.\n- People who received CR were much more likely to achieve their personal daily goals, and they reported higher satisfaction with goal attainment. The evidence for these effects is strong.\n- Small positive effects were also seen for confidence (self‑efficacy), immediate memory recall and the ability to focus on sounds (auditory selective attention).\n- Slight reductions were observed in overall functional ability and in some memory and anxiety measures, but no major harms were reported.\n- For care partners, the training produced small improvements in certain quality‑of‑life domains, while short‑term data showed a modest increase in depression and a small decline in psychological wellbeing.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because participants and therapists usually knew which group they were in, and because only six trials were available. This limits how certain we can be about the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to October 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the structural and factual checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse patients:\n1. Long, jargon‑heavy opening bullet – \"Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) – a personalised, goal‑oriented mental training programme – helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia (early to middle stages of memory and thinking problems) achieve their daily goals and feel more confident (self‑efficacy).\" This 32‑word sentence mixes technical terms (goal‑oriented, self‑efficacy) without clear explanation. Rewrite: \"Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia (early‑to‑mid stage memory problems) reach daily goals and feel more confident. We call this confidence ‘self‑efficacy.’\"\n2. Unexplained jargon – terms such as “goal‑oriented”, “self‑efficacy”, and “auditory selective attention” appear without plain‑language definitions. Replace with simple phrasing, e.g., “goal‑oriented (focused on the person’s own goals)”, “self‑efficacy (confidence in doing things)”, “auditory selective attention (ability to focus on sounds)”.\n3. Ambiguous wording about mood effects – \"short‑term assessments show a slight worsening of mood (depression) and psychological wellbeing\" and later \"modest increase in depression and a small decline in psychological wellbeing\" can be misread. Rewrite: \"short‑term assessments showed a small rise in depressive symptoms and a slight drop in psychological wellbeing.\"\n4. Noun‑heavy result bullet – \"Slight reductions were observed in overall functional ability and in some memory and anxiety measures\" is dense and uses many nouns. Rewrite: \"There were small drops in the ability to do everyday tasks, in memory, and in anxiety levels.\"\n5. Overuse of parentheses for definitions – while helpful, the many parenthetical explanations break the flow. Integrate the definitions into the sentence as shown above.\nThese issues are supported by the metric report, which flags high counts of complex words (146, beyond P90), long words (194, beyond P90) and nouns (175, P90). Reducing these will improve readability for the intended audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most metric percentiles are within typical ranges, but it deviates markedly on nouns (P90), SMOG (P90), complex words (beyond P90), long words (P90) and complex words (Dale‑Chall) (P90). These deviations indicate excessive noun density and lexical complexity, confirming the need to simplify language and shorten sentences."
