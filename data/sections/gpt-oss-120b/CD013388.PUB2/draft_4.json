  "draft": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalised mental training to help with daily tasks) effective for people with mild to moderate dementia?\n\nKey messages:\n- Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia achieve their personal daily goals (goal attainment) and feel more confident in doing tasks (self‑efficacy). The evidence for these benefits is strong.\n- For care partners (family or friends who provide unpaid support), CR gives small improvements in some quality‑of‑life areas, but short‑term data show a slight increase in depressive symptoms and a small drop in psychological wellbeing.\n- Most of the evidence comes from one large, high‑quality study. We need more well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up and more diverse participants to confirm the benefits and understand any downsides.\n\nWhy is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?\nDementia gradually reduces memory, thinking and the ability to plan or carry out everyday tasks. In the mild‑to‑moderate stage many people still live at home, but they may find simple activities such as cooking, dressing, paying bills or remembering appointments difficult. These problems lower independence and increase the need for help from family or professional caregivers. Medicines such as cholinesterase inhibitors do not fully restore the ability to manage daily life, so non‑drug approaches like cognitive rehabilitation are explored to help people keep doing the things that matter to them.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about cognitive rehabilitation?\nWe wanted to know whether cognitive rehabilitation (CR) – a personalised, goal‑oriented programme that teaches strategies for everyday tasks – improves daily functioning and other important outcomes for people with dementia and for their care partners. Specifically, we looked at effects on everyday activity performance, quality of life, mood, cognitive abilities, and on the wellbeing of care partners. We also explored whether factors such as type of dementia, programme length or who delivered the training might influence the results.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to CR or to a control) that evaluated CR for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia and reported outcomes for the person with dementia or their care partner. We combined the results of the eligible trials and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six trials that together enrolled 1,702 participants aged 76 to 80 years. Most participants (about 59%) had Alzheimer’s disease. All trials compared a personalised CR programme with an inactive control such as usual care. Outcomes were measured at the end of the programme and again after 3 to 12 months.\n- People who received CR were much more likely to achieve their personal daily goals (goal attainment) and reported higher satisfaction with meeting those goals. The evidence for these effects is strong.\n- Small positive effects were also seen for confidence (self‑efficacy), immediate memory recall and the ability to focus on sounds (auditory selective attention).\n- There were small drops in overall functional ability, memory and anxiety, but no major harms were reported.\n- For care partners, the training produced small improvements in certain quality‑of‑life domains, while short‑term data showed a slight rise in depressive symptoms and a small drop in psychological wellbeing.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because participants and therapists usually knew which group they were in, and because only six trials were available. This limits how certain we can be about the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to October 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several patient‑facing problems:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as “goal attainment”, “self‑efficacy”, “auditory selective attention” and “medium‑term follow‑up” appear without plain‑language definitions, leaving readers unsure what they mean. Rewrite e.g. “goal attainment (meeting the personal daily goals you set)”.\n2. **Ambiguous negative‑effect wording** – the sentence “There were small drops in overall functional ability, memory and anxiety” could be read as a good thing. Clarify that these are small declines (worsening) in those areas.\n3. **Lengthy, dense sentence** – “We are moderately confident in the evidence because participants and therapists usually knew which group they were in, and because only six trials were available.” is hard to follow. Split into two sentences: “We are moderately confident in the evidence because participants and therapists usually knew which treatment they received. In addition, only six trials were available, which limits certainty.”\n4. **High nominalisation and noun‑heavy style** – the draft contains many noun forms (e.g., “assessment”, “evaluation”, “evidence”) and a high total noun count (168, well above the median of 116). Replace nouns with active verbs where possible: change “The evidence for these benefits is strong” to “We found strong evidence that these benefits occur.”\n5. **Missing plain‑language definitions for outcome measures** – the results list includes “auditory selective attention” without explanation. Add a brief lay description: “the ability to focus on important sounds while ignoring background noise”.\nThese issues together would likely confuse or frustrate a non‑expert reader. Addressing them will also reduce the high nominalisation and noun counts flagged by the PLS evaluation (nominalisation 21 → target <13; nouns 168 → target <116).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count and structural requirements and scores well on active voice (66, P75) and pronouns (33, P75). However, it deviates on several lexical metrics: nominalisation (21, P90), total nouns (168, P90), SMOG index (14.6, P90), complex words (140, P90) and long words (185, P90). These indicate a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style that can hinder readability for patients."
