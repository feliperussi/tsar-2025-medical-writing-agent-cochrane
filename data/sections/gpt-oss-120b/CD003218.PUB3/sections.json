  "key_messages": [
    "Psychostimulant medicines (drugs that increase alertness) may reduce how sleepy people with myotonic dystrophy feel, according to self‑reported questionnaires (like the Epworth Sleepiness Scale), but the evidence is limited and it is unclear whether they improve objective sleepiness tests (such as the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test); they may also increase the chance of unwanted side effects (adverse events), though this is not well established.",
    "The trials only looked at short‑term use (up to four weeks), involved a small number of adult participants, and did not include children, so we do not know if the results apply to longer‑term treatment or to younger people.",
    "Because the current evidence is limited and uncertain, more well‑designed randomised trials are needed that evaluate both short‑ and long‑term benefits and harms of psychostimulants for daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy."

      "subheading": "What is myotonic dystrophy and why is excessive daytime sleepiness a problem?",
      "content": "Myotonic dystrophy is a genetic muscle disorder that causes weakness, trouble relaxing muscles, and many other health issues. A common complaint among people with this condition is \"hypersomnia\" – feeling very sleepy during the day even after a normal night’s sleep. This excessive daytime sleepiness can make everyday tasks, work, and social life difficult, and it reduces quality of life. Doctors sometimes use medicines called psychostimulants (for example, modafinil) to try to keep people awake, but it is not clear how well these drugs work or how safe they are for people with myotonic dystrophy."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out about psychostimulant medicines?",
      "content": "The authors of this review wanted to discover whether psychostimulant drugs improve daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy. Specifically, they looked at randomised trials that compared a psychostimulant with a placebo or no treatment, and they examined outcomes such as objective sleep tests (like the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test), self‑reported sleepiness scales (such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale), quality of life, and any side‑effects. Their goal was to determine both the benefits and the risks of using these medicines in the short term."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review identified six short‑term randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 136 adults (aged 18‑70 years) with genetically or electromyographically confirmed myotonic dystrophy and excessive daytime sleepiness. Five trials used a cross‑over design and all tested psychostimulant agents, most often modafinil, against placebo or no treatment. The studies lasted up to four weeks; information on gender distribution, disease severity, country of conduct and funding sources was not reported. No long‑term outcomes or planned subgroup analyses were available."

      "subheading": "Main results: Effect on sleepiness",
      "content": "It is unclear whether psychostimulants improve objective sleepiness measured by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, and the evidence is also unclear for effects on sleep latency measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. However, psychostimulants may reduce how sleepy people feel, as reported on questionnaires. The impact on quality of life remains uncertain, and psychostimulants may increase the chance of experiencing side effects."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and because the studies were very small and there were not enough participants to be certain about the results.",
