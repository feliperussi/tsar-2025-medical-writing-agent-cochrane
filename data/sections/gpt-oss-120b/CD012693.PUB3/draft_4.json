  "draft": "Does adjusting the dose of fertility hormones based on ovarian‑reserve tests (tests that measure a woman’s egg supply) improve pregnancy rates or reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) for women undergoing IVF/ICSI?\n\nKey messages\n- Using ovarian‑reserve tests to set the hormone dose does not clearly increase the chance of a live birth, and any benefit is uncertain.\n- No specific dose strategy showed a clear advantage for women predicted to be low, normal or high responders, and higher doses add cost without proven benefit.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to confirm whether personalised dosing improves pregnancy outcomes or safely reduces OHSS, and to identify the most effective testing methods and dosing algorithms.\n\nWhy is choosing the right medication dose important for IVF/ICSI treatment?\nWomen undergoing IVF (in‑vitro fertilisation) or ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) receive daily injections of follicle‑stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH stimulates the ovaries to produce several eggs at once, which are then collected for fertilisation. If too few eggs develop (a “poor response”), the cycle may be cancelled because the chance of a successful pregnancy is lower. If too many eggs develop (a “hyper‑response”), the woman risks ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) – a condition where the ovaries swell, causing abdominal pain and, in severe cases, serious health problems. Traditionally, doctors set the starting FSH dose mainly based on a woman’s age. Many now also use ovarian‑reserve tests (ORTs) that estimate how many eggs a woman has left. The main ORTs are:\n- Basal FSH (bFSH) – a blood test that measures the natural level of FSH.\n- Antral follicle count (AFC) – an ultrasound count of tiny fluid‑filled sacs (follicles) in the ovary.\n- Anti‑Müllerian hormone (AMH) – a blood test that reflects the size of the egg supply.\nWe wanted to know whether tailoring the FSH dose using these markers leads to better outcomes, such as higher chances of pregnancy and fewer cases of OHSS.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe aimed to determine whether adjusting the FSH dose according to ovarian‑reserve test results improves the chance of a live birth or ongoing pregnancy for women undergoing IVF/ICSI, and whether it reduces the risk of severe OHSS. We compared studies that used individualised dosing strategies (guided by AMH, AFC or bFSH) with studies that used a standard dose for all women or different dosing algorithms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two trial registers for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) – studies where participants are randomly assigned to dosing groups – up to February 2023. We combined the results where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 trials that included 8,520 women undergoing IVF or ICSI. In these studies, the dose of FSH was chosen based on ovarian‑reserve tests (AMH, AFC or basal FSH) and compared with a standard dose or with other dosing plans. Overall, we do not know whether tailoring the FSH dose changes a woman’s chance of having a baby or the risk of severe OHSS. An ORT‑based algorithm might raise the live‑birth chance slightly – for example, from 25 % with a standard dose to about 30 % – and it may also lower the chance of moderate or severe OHSS. However, the evidence is very uncertain because the trials were small and often unblinded.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the findings. Many studies were small, and participants and clinicians often knew which dosing strategy was used, which can bias results. The overall certainty of the evidence ranges from very low to low.\n\nLimitations\nWe could not find details about follow‑up length, study locations or funding in many reports. The small size of the trials and lack of blinding increase the risk of bias, making the results uncertain.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nWe searched for studies up to February 2023, so the review includes all relevant trials published before that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the style requirement that all subheadings be phrased as questions – ‘Key messages’ and ‘Limitations’ are not questions. This is a critical violation of the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text contains several clarity and style problems that would confuse readers: (1) excessive passive voice (19 instances, beyond the typical P90 range), (2) noun‑heavy sentences (179 nouns, also beyond P90), (3) a high proportion of difficult words (292 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words, beyond P90) and long words (176, beyond P90), and (4) some long, complex sentences that could be split. These issues reduce readability despite the overall good metric scores for readability indices. The following specific improvements are recommended:\n\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Key messages\"\n   - Problem: Does not follow the required question format, making navigation less intuitive.\n   - Rewrite: \"What are the key messages?\"\n\n2. **Subheading not a question** – \"Limitations\"\n   - Problem: Same issue as above.\n   - Rewrite: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n\n3. **Passive voice** – \"The dose of FSH was chosen based on ovarian‑reserve tests…\"\n   - Problem: Passive construction hides who made the decision, making the sentence harder to follow.\n   - Rewrite: \"We chose the FSH dose based on ovarian‑reserve tests…\"\n\n4. **Noun‑heavy, complex sentence** – \"Overall, we do not know whether tailoring the FSH dose changes a woman’s chance of having a baby or the risk of severe OHSS.\"\n   - Problem: Long noun phrase and abstract wording can confuse patients.\n   - Rewrite: \"We still do not know if adjusting the FSH dose changes a woman's chance of having a baby or her risk of severe OHSS.\"\n\n5. **Jargon without definition** – \"hyper‑response\" and \"OHSS\"\n   - Problem: These terms are technical and may be unfamiliar.\n   - Rewrite: \"If too many eggs develop (a ‘hyper‑response’), the woman can develop ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a condition where the ovaries swell and cause pain.\"\n\nThese revisions address the most impactful clarity issues and bring the draft into compliance with the style guide. The metrics support these suggestions: the draft has 19 passive constructions (P90), 179 nouns (P90), 292 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (beyond P90), 117 complex words (P90), and 176 long words (P90), all indicating the need to simplify language and increase active voice.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count and overall readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 55.6, FKGL 11.1). However, several metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: passive voice (19, P90), noun count (179, P90), Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (292, BEYOND_P90), complex words (117, P90) and long words (176, P90). These indicate the text is more passive, noun‑heavy, and uses many difficult/long words than usual, supporting the recommended edits."
