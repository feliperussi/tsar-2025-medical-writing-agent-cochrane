  "draft": "Does adjusting the dose of fertility hormones based on ovarian reserve tests (tests that measure a woman’s egg supply) improve pregnancy rates or reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) for women undergoing IVF/ICSI (in‑vitro fertilisation with intracytoplasmic sperm injection)?\n\nKey messages\n- Adjusting the hormone dose based on ovarian‑reserve tests does not clearly increase the chance of having a baby. The evidence is uncertain, and any possible reduction in OHSS is also unclear.\n- Comparing different dose strategies for women predicted to be low, normal, or high responders showed no clear advantage for any specific dose. Using higher doses also raises medication costs without proven benefit.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether personalised dosing truly improves pregnancy outcomes or safely reduces OHSS, and to identify which testing methods and dosing algorithms work best.\n\nWhy is choosing the right medication dose important for IVF/ICSI treatment?\nWomen undergoing IVF or ICSI receive daily injections of follicle‑stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate the ovaries to produce several eggs. If too few eggs develop (a “poor response”), the cycle may be cancelled because the chance of a successful pregnancy is lower. If too many eggs develop (a “hyper‑response”), the woman risks ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) – a condition where the ovaries become swollen and painful and can lead to serious complications. Traditionally, doctors set the starting FSH dose mainly based on a woman’s age. Many now also use ovarian‑reserve tests (ORTs) that estimate how many eggs a woman has left. These tests include:\n- Basal FSH (bFSH) – a blood test that measures the natural level of FSH.\n- Antral follicle count (AFC) – an ultrasound count of tiny fluid‑filled sacs (follicles) in the ovary.\n- Anti‑Müllerian hormone (AMH) – a blood test that reflects the size of the egg supply.\nWe wanted to know whether tailoring the FSH dose using these markers leads to better outcomes, such as higher pregnancy rates and fewer cases of OHSS.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to determine whether adjusting the FSH dose according to ovarian‑reserve test results improves the chance of a live birth or ongoing pregnancy for women undergoing IVF/ICSI, and whether it reduces the risk of severe OHSS. We compared studies that used individualised dosing strategies (guided by AMH, AFC or bFSH) with studies that used a standard dose for all women or different dosing algorithms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two trial registers for randomised controlled trials up to February 2023. We included trials that compared ovarian‑reserve‑marker‑guided FSH dosing with standard or other dosing strategies. We combined the results where possible and assessed our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 26 randomised controlled trials involving 8,520 women undergoing IVF or ICSI. The trials compared an individualised FSH dose chosen according to ORTs (AMH, AFC or bFSH) with either a uniform dose or other individualised algorithms. Some trials directly compared higher versus lower FSH doses within groups predicted to be low, normal or high responders, and eight trials tested a specific ORT‑based algorithm against a non‑ORT approach.\nOverall, we do not know whether tailoring the FSH dose to ovarian‑reserve markers changes a woman’s chance of having a baby or the risk of severe OHSS. An ORT‑based algorithm might raise the chance of a live birth slightly – for example, from 25 % with a standard dose to about 30 % – and it may also lower the chance of moderate or severe OHSS. However, the evidence is very uncertain because the trials were small and often unblinded.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the findings. Many studies were small, and participants and clinicians often knew which dosing strategy was used, which can bias results. The overall certainty of the evidence ranges from very low to low.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous version and includes all relevant trials up to February 2023.\n",

This fails the critical completeness check. Additionally, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers: (1) long, complex sentences that bundle multiple ideas; (2) occasional unexplained jargon or overly technical phrasing; (3) excessive passive constructions and noun‑heavy phrasing that reduce readability. Suggested rewrites are provided below. Metrics support these observations: passive_voice count is 20 (well above the typical P90 range), nouns 173 (P90), smog_index 14.3 (P90), complex_words 133 (P90), long_words 189 (P90), and complex_words_dc 296 (beyond P90), indicating the text is more complex than typical PLSs.",

These suggest the text is more complex and less active than typical Cochrane PLSs."
