  "draft": "Does adjusting the dose of fertility hormones based on ovarian reserve tests (tests that measure a woman’s egg supply) improve pregnancy rates or reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome for women undergoing IVF/ICSI (in‑vitro fertilisation with intracytoplasmic sperm injection)?\n\nKey messages\n- Adjusting the dose of fertility hormones based on ovarian reserve tests (tests that measure a woman's egg supply) does not clearly increase the chance of having a baby (live birth) and the evidence is uncertain; the approach may lower the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (a serious reaction where the ovaries swell), but the size of this benefit is also unclear.\n- Studies that compared different dose strategies for women predicted to be low, normal, or high responders (women expected to produce few, average, or many eggs) did not show a clear advantage for any specific dose, and using higher doses can increase medication cost without proven benefit.\n- More large, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether personalised dosing truly improves pregnancy outcomes or safely reduces ovarian hyperstimulation, and to identify which testing methods and dosing algorithms (step‑by‑step plans) work best.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhy is choosing the right medication dose important for IVF/ICSI treatment?\nWomen who undergo in‑vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) receive daily injections of a hormone called follicle‑stimulating hormone (FSH). This medication helps the ovaries produce several eggs at once, which are then collected for fertilisation. If too few eggs are produced (a “poor response”), the cycle may be cancelled because the chances of a successful pregnancy are higher with more eggs. If too many eggs are produced (a “hyper‑response”), the woman is at risk of a serious complication called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can cause abdominal swelling, pain and, in severe cases, organ problems. Traditionally, doctors decide the starting FSH dose mainly based on a woman's age, but many now also use special tests that estimate a woman’s “ovarian reserve” – how many eggs she likely has left. These tests include:\n• Basal FSH (bFSH) – a blood test measuring the natural level of FSH.\n• Antral follicle count (AFC) – an ultrasound count of tiny fluid‑filled sacs (follicles) in the ovary.\n• Anti‑Müllerian hormone (AMH) – a blood test that reflects the size of the egg supply. The question is whether tailoring the FSH dose using these ovarian‑reserve markers leads to better outcomes, such as higher chances of pregnancy and fewer cases of OHSS.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors set out to determine whether adjusting the amount of FSH based on ovarian‑reserve test results improves the chances of a live birth or ongoing pregnancy for women undergoing IVF/ICSI, and whether it reduces the risk of severe OHSS. They compared studies that used individualised dosing strategies (guided by AMH, AFC or bFSH) with studies that used a standard dose for all women or different dosing algorithms.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for trials that compared ovarian‑reserve‑marker‑guided FSH dosing with standard or other dosing strategies in IVF/ICSI cycles (random‑assigned studies); we combined their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 26 randomised controlled trials that together involved 8,520 women undergoing IVF or ICSI. The studies compared an individualised dose of the fertility drug FSH, chosen according to ovarian‑reserve tests such as AMH, AFC or basal FSH, with either a standard (uniform) dose or with other individualised dosing algorithms. Some trials directly compared higher versus lower FSH doses within groups predicted to be low, normal or high responders, and eight trials tested a specific ovarian‑reserve‑test‑based (ORT) dosing algorithm against a non‑ORT approach. The abstract does not give details about how long participants were followed, where the studies were carried out, or who funded them. All participants were women undergoing IVF/ICSI and were grouped by predicted ovarian response; age and other demographic information were not reported.\n\nMain results: Effect of individualising FSH dose\nIt is unclear whether tailoring the FSH dose to ovarian‑reserve markers changes a woman's chance of having a baby or the risk of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Using an ovarian‑reserve‑test‑based algorithm might increase the chance of having a baby or the chance of having a baby slightly – for example, if 25 out of 100 women would have a baby with standard dosing, the algorithm could raise that to about 30 out of 100. The same algorithm may also reduce the chance of moderate or severe OHSS.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023 of search.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because several subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., “Key messages”, “Methods”, “Limitations”, “Currency”). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement. In addition, the text contains multiple clarity problems that would confuse patients: (1) very long sentences that exceed 30 words and pack several ideas together, making them hard to follow; (2) frequent passive constructions and noun‑heavy phrasing that obscure who is doing what; (3) technical jargon (e.g., “hyperstimulation syndrome”, “nominalisation”) that is not always defined in plain language. Suggested improvements: • Rewrite subheadings as questions (e.g., change “Methods” to “How did we find the evidence?”). • Break the first key‑message bullet into two shorter sentences: “Adjusting the hormone dose based on ovarian‑reserve tests does not clearly increase the chance of having a baby. The evidence is uncertain, and any possible reduction in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is also unclear.” • Convert passive phrasing such as “It is unclear whether tailoring the FSH dose …” to active voice: “We do not know whether tailoring the FSH dose …”. • Replace noun‑heavy phrases like “the abstract does not give details about how long participants were followed” with a concise active sentence: “The studies did not report how long participants were followed.” • Define any remaining technical terms in simple language or replace them with everyday words (e.g., “ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) – a condition where the ovaries become swollen and painful”). These changes address the most impactful readability issues and bring the draft into line with the style guide. Metrics support the editorial judgment: words per sentence = 32.84 (well beyond the typical 19‑28 range), passive voice = 31 (far above the typical 9‑23), nominalisations = 26, nouns = 219, and complex‑word counts are all in the “beyond P90” zone, confirming the need to simplify sentence structure and reduce noun‑heavy language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit but deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns: words per sentence (32.8) and passive voice (31) are beyond the 90th percentile; nominalisations, noun count, and all readability indices (FKGL 15.9, GFI 20.6, SMOG 14.7, etc.) are also beyond the 90th percentile, indicating overly complex, noun‑heavy, and passive text. These metric deviations align with the identified clarity and style issues."
