  "key_messages": [
    "Adjusting the dose of fertility hormones based on ovarian reserve tests (tests that measure a woman's egg supply) does not clearly increase the chance of having a baby (live birth) and the evidence is uncertain; the approach may lower the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (a serious reaction where the ovaries swell), but the size of this benefit is also unclear.",
    "Studies that compared different dose strategies for women predicted to be low, normal, or high responders (women expected to produce few, average, or many eggs) did not show a clear advantage for any specific dose, and using higher doses can increase medication cost without proven benefit.",
    "More large, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether personalised dosing truly improves pregnancy outcomes or safely reduces ovarian hyperstimulation, and to identify which testing methods and dosing algorithms (step‑by‑step plans) work best."

      "subheading": "Why is choosing the right medication dose important for IVF/ICSI treatment?",
      "content": "Women who undergo in‑vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) receive daily injections of a hormone called follicle‑stimulating hormone (FSH). This medication helps the ovaries produce several eggs at once, which are then collected for fertilisation. If too few eggs are produced (a “poor response”), the cycle may be cancelled because the chances of a successful pregnancy are higher with more eggs. If too many eggs are produced (a “hyper‑response”), the woman is at risk of a serious complication called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can cause abdominal swelling, pain and, in severe cases, organ problems. Traditionally, doctors decide the starting FSH dose mainly based on a woman's age, but many now also use special tests that estimate a woman’s “ovarian reserve” – how many eggs she likely has left. These tests include:\n• Basal FSH (bFSH) – a blood test measuring the natural level of FSH.\n• Antral follicle count (AFC) – an ultrasound count of tiny fluid‑filled sacs (follicles) in the ovary.\n• Anti‑Müllerian hormone (AMH) – a blood test that reflects the size of the egg supply. The question is whether tailoring the FSH dose using these ovarian‑reserve markers leads to better outcomes, such as higher chances of pregnancy and fewer cases of OHSS."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to determine whether adjusting the amount of FSH based on ovarian‑reserve test results improves the chances of a live birth or ongoing pregnancy for women undergoing IVF/ICSI, and whether it reduces the risk of severe OHSS. They compared studies that used individualised dosing strategies (guided by AMH, AFC or bFSH) with studies that used a standard dose for all women or different dosing algorithms."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 26 randomised controlled trials that together involved 8,520 women undergoing IVF or ICSI. The studies compared an individualised dose of the fertility drug FSH, chosen according to ovarian‑reserve tests such as AMH, AFC or basal FSH, with either a standard (uniform) dose or with other individualised dosing algorithms. Some trials directly compared higher versus lower FSH doses within groups predicted to be low, normal or high responders, and eight trials tested a specific ovarian‑reserve‑test‑based (ORT) dosing algorithm against a non‑ORT approach. The abstract does not give details about how long participants were followed, where the studies were carried out, or who funded them. All participants were women undergoing IVF/ICSI and were grouped by predicted ovarian response; age and other demographic information were not reported."

      "subheading": "Main results: Effect of individualising FSH dose",
      "content": "It is unclear whether tailoring the FSH dose to ovarian‑reserve markers changes a woman's chance of having a baby or the risk of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Using an ovarian‑reserve‑test‑based algorithm might increase the chance of having a baby slightly – for example, if 25 out of 100 women would have a baby with standard dosing, the algorithm could raise that to about 30 out of 100. The same algorithm may also reduce the chance of moderate or severe OHSS."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
