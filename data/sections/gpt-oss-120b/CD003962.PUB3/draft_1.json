  "draft": "Are non‑immunosuppressive treatments (medicines that do not suppress the immune system) such as blood‑pressure drugs, diet changes, or tonsil removal helpful for IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy)?\n\n- Non‑immunosuppressive treatments can be helpful for IgA nephropathy; blood‑pressure‑lowering medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (a hormone system that helps control blood pressure), such as ACE inhibitors (drugs that block an enzyme) or ARBs (drugs that block a related receptor), tend to lower protein loss in the urine (proteinuria) and may improve kidney function, and studies did not show a clear increase in side‑effects.\n- Other approaches, such as surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy), anticoagulants (drugs that thin the blood), fish‑oil supplements (oil rich in omega‑3 fatty acids), or traditional herbal medicines (plant‑based remedies), showed only limited or uncertain benefits, and the evidence mainly comes from small studies or from specific populations (for example, Japanese patients), making it unclear how well the results apply to most people.\n- Because many studies were small, short‑term, and of variable quality, more large, well‑designed trials that follow patients for longer periods and include diverse groups are needed to determine the true long‑term benefits and possible harms of these non‑immunosuppressive options.\n\nWHAT IS IG A NEPHROPATHY AND WHY DOES IT MATTER?\nIgA nephropathy (often called IgAN) is the most common type of kidney disease that starts in the tiny filtering units of the kidney (the glomeruli). It happens when a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in these filters, causing inflammation and damage. Over time, this can lead to the kidneys working less well. About 20‑40 % of people with IgAN develop kidney failure within 25 years, meaning they may need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Because the disease usually progresses slowly, doctors try to slow it down with treatments that do not suppress the immune system. These non‑immunosuppressive approaches focus on controlling blood pressure, reducing the amount of protein that leaks into the urine (proteinuria), and avoiding the side‑effects of long‑term immune‑targeting drugs.\n\nWHAT TREATMENTS ARE USED THAT DO NOT SUPPRESS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM?\nThe main non‑immunosuppressive strategies include:\n- Antihypertensive medicines – drugs that lower blood pressure, especially those that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS). These are often called ACE inhibitors or ARBs.\n- Lifestyle and dietary changes – such as limiting salt intake or using supplements like fish oil.\n- Procedures like tonsillectomy – removal of the tonsils, which some studies have looked at as a way to affect the disease.\n- Other agents – including anticoagulants, herbal medicines, and antimalarial drugs.\nThese approaches aim to protect kidney function while keeping the risk of serious side‑effects low.\n\nWHAT DID THE REVIEW AIM TO FIND OUT?\nThe authors wanted to answer two key questions: (1) Do non‑immunosuppressive treatments help people with IgA nephropathy? This includes looking at whether they lower protein in the urine, improve kidney function, or reduce the chance of kidney failure. (2) Are these treatments safe? They examined whether the medicines or procedures cause any harmful side‑effects. To do this, they gathered and analysed all randomised controlled trials that tested any non‑immunosuppressive therapy in children or adults with a confirmed (biopsy‑proven) diagnosis of IgAN.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched for studies evaluating non‑immunosuppressive therapies for IgA nephropathy in adults and children, combined their results with meta‑analysis, and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWHAT DID WE FIND?\nWe identified 80 randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that together enrolled 4,856 people with biopsy‑confirmed IgA nephropathy, including both adults and children. The studies tested a range of non‑immunosuppressive treatments such as drugs that block the renin‑angiotensin system (ACE inhibitors or ARBs), tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish‑oil supplements, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial drugs. Comparators were placebo or no treatment, symptomatic care, or standard care alone. The trials were carried out in various settings around the world; the only specific geographic note was that all tonsillectomy trials were done in Japan. Details on how long participants were followed and on funding sources were not provided in the abstract.\n\nMAIN RESULTS: RENIN‑ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM INHIBITION\nDrugs that block the renin‑angiotensin system probably lower the amount of protein in the urine and probably improve kidney function in people with IgA nephropathy. However, the available trials were few, small and of limited duration, so the long‑term benefits and possible harms of this treatment remain uncertain.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF EVIDENCE\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in.\n\nEVIDENCE CURRENCY STATEMENT\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the style requirement that all sub‑headings be phrased as questions (e.g., \"METHODS\", \"LIMITATIONS OF EVIDENCE\", \"EVIDENCE CURRENCY STATEMENT\" are not questions). This breaches the Master Style Guide and therefore the critical check. In addition, several clarity issues would confuse readers:\n1. **Overly long bullet sentence** – \"Non‑immunosuppressive treatments can be helpful for IgA nephropathy; blood‑pressure‑lowering medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (a hormone system that helps control blood pressure), such as ACE inhibitors (drugs that block an enzyme) or ARBs (drugs that block a related receptor), tend to lower protein loss in the urine (proteinuria) and may improve kidney function, and studies did not show a clear increase in side‑effects.\" This 45‑word sentence packs multiple ideas and uses many commas, making it hard to follow. **Rewrite:** \"Non‑immunosuppressive treatments can help people with IgA nephropathy. Blood‑pressure‑lowering medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system – such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs – usually reduce protein in the urine and may improve kidney function. The studies did not show a clear increase in side‑effects.\"\n2. **Jargon without plain‑language definition** – \"renin‑angiotensin system\" is only described as \"a hormone system that helps control blood pressure\" and later as \"RAS\" without a simple definition. Readers may still be lost. **Rewrite:** \"The renin‑angiotensin system (RAS) is a set of hormones that control blood pressure. Medicines that block this system help lower blood pressure and protect the kidneys.\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy paragraph** – The section \"WHAT IS IG A NEPHROPATHY AND WHY DOES IT MATTER?\" contains long noun strings (e.g., \"the most common type of kidney disease that starts in the tiny filtering units of the kidney (the glomeruli)\") and the metrics show 242 nouns (far beyond the typical PLS range). Splitting into shorter sentences with more verbs improves readability. **Rewrite:** \"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common kidney disease that begins in the tiny filters called glomeruli. In IgAN, a protein called immunoglobulin A builds up in these filters, causing inflammation and damage. Over time the kidneys work less well.\"\n4. **Missing question‑format sub‑headings** – Headings such as \"METHODS\", \"LIMITATIONS OF EVIDENCE\" and \"EVIDENCE CURRENCY STATEMENT\" are not phrased as questions, violating the style guide. **Rewrite examples:** \"How did we find the evidence?\" (instead of \"METHODS\"), \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" (instead of \"LIMITATIONS OF EVIDENCE\"), \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\" (instead of \"EVIDENCE CURRENCY STATEMENT\").\n5. **Long average sentence length** – The evaluation shows 26.35 words per sentence (P90) and a SMOG index of 14.3 (P90), indicating high reading difficulty. Breaking sentences to 15‑20 words each will lower these scores and match typical PLS patterns.\nThese issues, together with the sub‑heading format problem, mean the draft does not meet the required standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit but deviates on several readability metrics: words per sentence (26.35, P90), nouns (242, beyond P90), complex words (159, beyond P90), and long words (233, beyond P90). Readability indices (Flesch‑Kincaid grade 13.3, Gunning Fog 18.3) are higher than typical PLS ranges, confirming the need to shorten sentences and simplify vocabulary."
