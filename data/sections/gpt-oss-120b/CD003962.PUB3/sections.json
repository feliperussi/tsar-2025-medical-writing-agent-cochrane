  "key_messages": [
    "Non‑immunosuppressive treatments can be helpful for IgA nephropathy; blood‑pressure‑lowering medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (a hormone system that helps control blood pressure), such as ACE inhibitors (drugs that block an enzyme) or ARBs (drugs that block a related receptor), tend to lower protein loss in the urine (proteinuria) and may improve kidney function, and studies did not show a clear increase in side‑effects.",
    "Other approaches, such as surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy), anticoagulants (drugs that thin the blood), fish‑oil supplements (oil rich in omega‑3 fatty acids), or traditional herbal medicines (plant‑based remedies), showed only limited or uncertain benefits, and the evidence mainly comes from small studies or from specific populations (for example, Japanese patients), making it unclear how well the results apply to most people.",
    "Because many studies were small, short‑term, and of variable quality, more large, well‑designed trials that follow patients for longer periods and include diverse groups are needed to determine the true long‑term benefits and possible harms of these non‑immunosuppressive options."

      "subheading": "What is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?",
      "content": "IgA nephropathy (often called IgAN) is the most common type of kidney disease that starts in the tiny filtering units of the kidney (the glomeruli). It happens when a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in these filters, causing inflammation and damage. Over time, this can lead to the kidneys working less well. About 20‑40 % of people with IgAN develop kidney failure within 25 years, meaning they may need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Because the disease usually progresses slowly, doctors try to slow it down with treatments that do not suppress the immune system. These non‑immunosuppressive approaches focus on controlling blood pressure, reducing the amount of protein that leaks into the urine (proteinuria), and avoiding the side‑effects of long‑term immune‑targeting drugs."

      "subheading": "What treatments are used that do not suppress the immune system?",
      "content": "The main non‑immunosuppressive strategies include:\n- Antihypertensive medicines – drugs that lower blood pressure, especially those that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS). These are often called ACE inhibitors or ARBs.\n- Lifestyle and dietary changes – such as limiting salt intake or using supplements like fish oil.\n- Procedures like tonsillectomy – removal of the tonsils, which some studies have looked at as a way to affect the disease.\n- Other agents – including anticoagulants, herbal medicines, and antimalarial drugs.\nThese approaches aim to protect kidney function while keeping the risk of serious side‑effects low."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to answer two key questions: (1) Do non‑immunosuppressive treatments help people with IgA nephropathy? This includes looking at whether they lower protein in the urine, improve kidney function, or reduce the chance of kidney failure. (2) Are these treatments safe? They examined whether the medicines or procedures cause any harmful side‑effects. To do this, they gathered and analysed all randomised controlled trials that tested any non‑immunosuppressive therapy in children or adults with a confirmed (biopsy‑proven) diagnosis of IgAN."

      "subheading": "Methods",

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 80 randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that together enrolled 4,856 people with biopsy‑confirmed IgA nephropathy, including both adults and children. The studies tested a range of non‑immunosuppressive treatments such as drugs that block the renin‑angiotensin system (ACE inhibitors or ARBs), tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish‑oil supplements, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial drugs. Comparators were placebo or no treatment, symptomatic care, or standard care alone. The trials were carried out in various settings around the world; the only specific geographic note was that all tonsillectomy trials were done in Japan. Details on how long participants were followed and on funding sources were not provided in the abstract."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Renin‑angiotensin system inhibition",
      "content": "Drugs that block the renin‑angiotensin system probably lower the amount of protein in the urine and probably improve kidney function in people with IgA nephropathy. However, the available trials were few, small and of limited duration, so the long‑term benefits and possible harms of this treatment remain uncertain."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023 of search."
