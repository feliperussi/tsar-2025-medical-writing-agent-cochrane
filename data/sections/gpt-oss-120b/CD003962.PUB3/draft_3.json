  "draft": "Are non‑immunosuppressive treatments (medicines that do not suppress the immune system) such as blood‑pressure drugs, diet changes, or tonsil removal helpful for IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Blood‑pressure‑lowering medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS – a hormone system that controls blood pressure), such as ACE inhibitors (drugs that block an enzyme) or ARBs (drugs that block a related receptor), usually lower protein loss in the urine (proteinuria) and may improve kidney function. The studies did not show a clear increase in side‑effects.\n- Other approaches – tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils), blood‑thinners, fish‑oil supplements (rich in omega‑3 fatty acids), and herbal medicines – showed limited or uncertain benefits. Most evidence comes from small studies or from specific populations (for example, Japanese patients), so it is unclear how well the results apply to most people.\n- Because many studies were small, short‑term, and of variable quality, we need larger, well‑designed trials that follow diverse groups for longer periods to determine the true long‑term benefits and possible harms of these options.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common type of kidney disease that starts in the tiny filtering units called glomeruli. It happens when a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in these filters, causing inflammation and damage. Over time the kidneys work less well. About 20‑40 % of people with IgAN develop kidney failure within 25 years, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Because the disease progresses slowly, we try to slow it down with treatments that do not suppress the immune system. These approaches focus on controlling blood pressure, reducing protein loss in the urine, and avoiding the side‑effects of long‑term immune‑targeting drugs.\n\nWhat treatments are used that do not suppress the immune system?\nWe use several non‑immunosuppressive strategies:\n- Antihypertensive medicines – drugs that lower blood pressure, especially those that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS). These are often called ACE inhibitors or ARBs.\n- Lifestyle and dietary changes – such as limiting salt intake or taking fish‑oil supplements.\n- Procedures like tonsillectomy – removal of the tonsils, which some studies have examined.\n- Other agents – including blood‑thinners, herbal medicines, and antimalarial drugs.\nThese approaches aim to protect kidney function while keeping the risk of serious side‑effects low.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe asked two questions: (1) Do non‑immunosuppressive treatments help people with IgA nephropathy? We looked at whether they lower protein in the urine, improve kidney function, or reduce the chance of kidney failure. (2) Are these treatments safe? We examined whether the medicines or procedures cause harmful side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to December 2023. Two reviewers independently screened the results, extracted data, and assessed study quality. We combined the results using meta‑analysis and rated the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 80 randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that together enrolled 4,856 participants with biopsy‑confirmed IgA nephropathy. The trials tested several non‑immunosuppressive treatments: RAS‑blocking drugs (ACE inhibitors or ARBs), tonsillectomy, blood‑thinners, fish‑oil supplements, herbal medicines and antimalarial drugs. Comparators were placebo, no treatment, symptomatic care, or standard care alone.\n\nWhat are the main results for renin‑angiotensin system inhibition?\nDrugs that block the RAS probably lower protein in the urine and probably improve kidney function in people with IgA nephropathy. However, the trials were few, small, and of limited duration, so the long‑term benefits and possible harms remain uncertain.\n\nWhat do we know about other treatments?\nTonsillectomy may increase remission of proteinuria and microscopic haematuria, but the evidence comes only from Japanese studies and is of low certainty. Blood‑thinners, fish‑oil supplements, and herbal medicines showed small short‑term benefits, but these disappeared when compared with standard care. Evidence for antimalarial drugs is very limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, and the evidence does not cover all people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous Cochrane review. The evidence is current to December 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets all critical checks: it includes every required section, all headings are phrased as questions, the title is a question, factual details (80 trials, 4,856 participants, main findings on RAS inhibition and tonsillectomy) match the source, and the word count is 733 (<850). Minor clarity improvements are recommended:\n1. Jargon without explanation – terms like “quasi‑randomised”, “GRADE approach” and “meta‑analysis” appear in the methods section. Rewrite to plain language, e.g., “We looked at studies that were randomly assigned to treatments (or almost random) and we judged the quality of the evidence using a standard system.”\n2. Long bullet‑point sentence in the key messages – the first bullet is dense. Split into two sentences: “Blood‑pressure‑lowering medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS) – such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs – usually lower protein loss in the urine (proteinuria) and may improve kidney function. The studies did not show a clear increase in side‑effects.”\n3. Noun‑heavy phrasing – the opening sentence of the “What treatments are used …” section can be made more active: “We use several non‑immunosuppressive strategies, including blood‑pressure medicines, diet changes, tonsil removal, blood‑thinners, herbal remedies, and antimalarial drugs.”\nThese edits will reduce noun density and complex‑word counts (the metrics show high values for nouns, complex words, and long words) and further improve readability, but they do not affect the overall approval status. Overall, the PLS conforms well to typical Cochrane plain‑language patterns (61% of features in the best quartile). The only notable metric deviations are high noun count, complex‑word and long‑word counts, which are addressed by the suggested wording changes.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on most readability metrics (words per sentence 17.9, FK grade 10, Flesch reading ease 55, active voice 76) placing it in the top quartile for many features. However, nouns (222), complex words (152), Dale‑Chall complex words (338), and long words (214) are well above typical PLS ranges, indicating a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style. Adjusting phrasing to use more verbs and simpler words will bring these metrics closer to the median and improve patient‑facing clarity."
