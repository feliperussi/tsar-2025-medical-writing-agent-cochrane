  "draft": "Are non‑immunosuppressive treatments (medicines that do not suppress the immune system) such as blood‑pressure drugs, diet changes, or tonsil removal helpful for IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Non‑immunosuppressive treatments can help people with IgA nephropathy. Blood‑pressure‑lowering medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS – a set of hormones that control blood pressure), such as ACE inhibitors (drugs that block an enzyme) or ARBs (drugs that block a related receptor), usually reduce protein in the urine and may improve kidney function. The studies did not show a clear increase in side‑effects.\n- Other approaches – tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils), anticoagulants (blood‑thinning drugs), fish‑oil supplements (rich in omega‑3 fatty acids), and traditional herbal medicines – showed limited or uncertain benefits. Most evidence comes from small studies or from specific populations (for example, Japanese patients), so it is unclear how well the results apply to most people.\n- Because many studies were small, short‑term, and of variable quality, we need larger, well‑designed trials that follow diverse groups for longer periods to determine the true long‑term benefits and possible harms of these options.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common kidney disease that starts in the tiny filters called glomeruli. In IgAN, a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in these filters, causing inflammation and damage. Over time the kidneys work less well. About 20‑40 % of people with IgAN develop kidney failure within 25 years, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Because the disease progresses slowly, doctors try to slow it down with treatments that do not suppress the immune system. These approaches focus on controlling blood pressure, reducing protein loss in the urine (proteinuria), and avoiding the side‑effects of long‑term immune‑targeting drugs.\n\nWhat treatments do not suppress the immune system?\nThe main non‑immunosuppressive strategies include:\n- Antihypertensive medicines – drugs that lower blood pressure, especially those that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS). These are often called ACE inhibitors or ARBs.\n- Lifestyle and dietary changes – such as limiting salt intake or taking fish‑oil supplements.\n- Procedures like tonsillectomy – removal of the tonsils, which some studies have examined as a way to affect the disease.\n- Other agents – including anticoagulants, herbal medicines, and antimalarial drugs.\nThese approaches aim to protect kidney function while keeping the risk of serious side‑effects low.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to answer two questions: (1) Do non‑immunosuppressive treatments help people with IgA nephropathy? We looked at whether they lower protein in the urine, improve kidney function, or reduce the chance of kidney failure. (2) Are these treatments safe? We examined whether the medicines or procedures cause harmful side‑effects. To answer these questions, we gathered and analysed all randomised controlled trials that tested any non‑immunosuppressive therapy in children or adults with a biopsy‑proven diagnosis of IgAN.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to December 2023. Two reviewers independently screened the results, extracted data, and assessed study quality. We combined the results using meta‑analysis and rated the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 80 randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that together enrolled 4,856 participants with biopsy‑confirmed IgA nephropathy. The trials tested a range of non‑immunosuppressive treatments, including RAS‑blocking drugs (ACE inhibitors or ARBs), tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish‑oil supplements, traditional Chinese medicines, and antimalarial drugs. Comparators were placebo, no treatment, symptomatic care, or standard care alone.\n\nMain results – renin‑angiotensin system inhibition:\nDrugs that block the RAS probably lower protein in the urine and probably improve kidney function in people with IgA nephropathy. However, the trials were few, small, and of limited duration, so the long‑term benefits and possible harms remain uncertain.\n\nOther treatments:\nTonsillectomy may increase remission of proteinuria and microscopic haematuria, but the evidence comes only from Japanese studies and is of low certainty. Anticoagulants, fish‑oil supplements, and traditional Chinese medicines showed small benefits in some short‑term studies, but these benefits disappeared when compared with standard care. Evidence for antimalarial drugs is very limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, and the evidence does not cover all people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous Cochrane review. The evidence is current to December 2023.\n",

Sections such as \"Key messages:\", \"Main results – renin‑angiotensin system inhibition:\" and \"Other treatments:\" are not questions, violating the MASTER_STYLE_GUID GUIDE. Additionally, the text is noun‑heavy (237 nouns, far above the typical PLS range) and contains many complex and long words (166 complex words, 236 long words), which reduces readability for patients. Suggested improvements: \n1. Change \"Key messages:\" to a question, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\". \n2. Rephrase \"Main results – renin‑angiotensin system inhibition:\" as \"What are the main results for renin‑angiotensin system inhibition?\". \n3. Rephrase \"Other treatments:\" to \"What do we know about other treatments?\". \n4. Reduce noun‑heavy sentences by using more active verbs, e.g., change \"The trials tested a range of non‑immunosuppressive treatments, including RAS‑blocking drugs (ACE inhibitors or ARBs), tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish‑oil supplements, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial drugs.\" to \"We tested several non‑immunosuppressive treatments: RAS‑blocking drugs (ACE inhibitors or ARBs), tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish‑oil supplements, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial drugs.\" \n5. Simplify complex wording where possible, e.g., replace \"traditional Chinese medicines\" with \"herbal medicines\" and \"anticoagulants\" with \"blood‑thinners\" when first introduced. These changes will bring the subheadings into compliance, lower noun and complex‑word counts, and improve overall clarity for a patient audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (771 words) and most readability metrics are within the lower quartile (e.g., words per sentence 19.27, Flesch‑Kincaid grade 11). However, it deviates markedly on noun count (237, beyond P90), complex words (166, beyond P90), long words (236, beyond P90), and Dale‑Chall readability (8.33, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need to simplify language and increase verb usage."
