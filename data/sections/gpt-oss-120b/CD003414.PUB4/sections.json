  "key_messages": [
    "We cannot tell whether a natural menstrual cycle (the body’s own cycle), hormone medicines (HT – drugs that give estrogen and progesterone), or ovulation‑triggering drugs (medicines that cause the ovary to release an egg) is best for preparing the uterus lining before a frozen embryo transfer, because the available studies show no clear advantage of one method over another for achieving a live birth (birth of a living baby), and they did not report any important safety problems.",
    "The evidence comes from a limited number of trials and is not strong, with many studies not reporting key outcomes (important results such as miscarriage or multiple pregnancy) or having few participants, making the findings uncertain.",
    "More well‑designed, larger randomised trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) are needed that directly compare these preparation methods, report both benefits and any possible harms, and include enough participants to give reliable answers."

      "subheading": "Why is preparing the uterus important for frozen embryo transfer?",
      "content": "Many couples experience infertility, meaning they cannot conceive naturally. One way to help them is to create embryos in the laboratory and then place (transfer) these embryos into the woman's uterus. Often the embryos are frozen first and transferred later – a process called frozen‑thawed embryo transfer (FET). FET can increase the overall chance of pregnancy, lower costs and is relatively simple to perform. Before an embryo can implant, the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) must be in the right state. Doctors can prepare this lining in several ways:\n\n* **Natural cycle:** the woman's own ovulation is allowed to happen without medication, and the endometrium develops on its own.\n* **Hormone‑therapy (HT) cycle:** doctors give estrogen and progesterone pills or patches to artificially build up the lining.\n* **Ovulation‑induction cycle:** medicines are used to trigger ovulation, then the lining is supported with hormones.\n\nHT can be given with or without a drug called a gonadotrophin‑releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa), which temporarily suppresses the woman's own hormone production. The review looks at all these different approaches and their variations."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers aim to discover about these preparation methods?",
      "content": "The authors set out to compare the **effectiveness** (how often a live birth occurs) and **safety** (risk of miscarriage and other harms) of the different cycle regimens used before FET. Specifically, they wanted to know whether natural cycles, hormone‑therapy cycles (with or without GnRHa), ovulation‑induction cycles, and modified natural cycles (where a small hormone trigger is given) lead to different rates of live birth, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage, or multiple pregnancy. They also examined the various sub‑types within each main group to see if any particular method might be better or safer for women undergoing frozen embryo transfer."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 32 randomised controlled trials that together involved 6,352 women undergoing frozen‑thawed embryo transfer (FET). All participants were sub‑fertile women receiving FET. The trials compared different ways of preparing the uterus before transfer, including natural (spontaneous ovulatory) cycles, hormone‑therapy (HT) cycles, HT cycles with GnRHa suppression, modified natural cycles using an hCG trigger, and ovulation‑induction cycles. The abstract does not give details about how long each trial lasted, the ages of the women, the countries where the studies were carried out, or the sources of funding."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Choice of cycle preparation does not clearly affect outcomes",
      "content": "Across the many comparisons of preparation methods, the evidence shows little or no difference in the chances of a live birth, miscarriage, ongoing pregnancy, or multiple pregnancy. The certainty of the evidence ranges from low to moderate, and for some outcomes (especially multiple pregnancy) the certainty is very low. Overall, no particular preparation regimen appears to be better or worse than another for women undergoing frozen‑embryo transfer."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2022 of search."
