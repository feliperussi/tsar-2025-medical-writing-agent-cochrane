  "draft": "Is combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation (cleaning the bowel with a laxative solution and taking antibiotics by mouth) before planned colon surgery more effective at preventing infections and leaks than a bowel cleanse alone or no preparation?\n\nKey messages\n- Using both mechanical cleaning and oral antibiotics together probably reduces surgical site infections (SSIs – infections at the incision) and anastomotic leaks (leakage where two bowel sections are joined) compared with mechanical cleaning alone, based on moderate‑quality evidence.\n- The combined approach does not appear to change death rates, postoperative ileus (temporary slowdown of the bowel after surgery), or length of hospital stay when compared with mechanical cleaning alone.\n- Evidence is very uncertain about how the combined method compares with oral antibiotics alone or with no bowel preparation, so we cannot say whether it is better or worse in those cases.\n\nWhy are complications after elective colorectal surgery a concern?\nElective colorectal surgery (planned operations on the colon or rectum) can save lives, but complications often occur after the operation. The most serious problems are SSIs and anastomotic leaks. Both can lead to longer hospital stays, delayed recovery, and lasting health issues. The large bowel naturally contains many bacteria, which raises the risk of infection compared with other abdominal surgeries. To lower this risk, doctors clean the bowel before surgery – either mechanically (by giving liquids that flush out stool) or with oral antibiotics (pills that reduce bacterial numbers). Mechanical cleaning alone has not shown clear benefits, and it is unclear whether adding oral antibiotics helps or harms.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether a combined approach of mechanical bowel preparation plus oral antibiotic bowel preparation (MBP + oAB) reduces postoperative complications compared with mechanical preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no preparation at all.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, trial registries and reference lists up to December 2021 for randomised controlled trials in adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery. We included trials that compared MBP + oAB with one of the three alternatives and that used standard intravenous antibiotics around the time of surgery. We pooled the results and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 21 trials involving 5,264 participants. All trials compared MBP + oAB with either mechanical preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no preparation. Compared with mechanical preparation alone, MBP + oAB probably reduces SSIs by about 44% and anastomotic leaks by about 40% (moderate‑certainty evidence). For every 100 patients treated with the combined method instead of mechanical cleaning alone, roughly 40‑45 fewer develop an infection or a leak. The combined method probably makes little or no difference to death rates, postoperative ileus, or length of hospital stay. Evidence comparing the combined method with oral antibiotics alone or with no preparation is very uncertain, so we cannot draw firm conclusions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence, but some studies may have been unblinded, included diverse participants, used different delivery methods, and were small in size. Side‑effects were reported in only a few trials.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current up to our December 2021 search.",

Reducing passive voice, nominalisations, and long sentences will bring the text into the normal PLS pattern and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but notable deviations: passive_voice (20, P90), nominalization (26, P90), SMOG index (14.9, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (146, BEYOND_P90), long_words (182, P90). These suggest the draft is more complex and noun‑heavy than typical PLS texts, supporting the need to simplify language, reduce passive constructions, and shorten sentences."
