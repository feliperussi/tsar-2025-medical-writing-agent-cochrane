  "draft": "Is combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation (cleaning the bowel with a laxative solution and taking antibiotics by mouth) before planned colon surgery more effective at preventing infections and leaks than a bowel cleanse alone or no preparation?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Combined mechanical bowel preparation (cleaning the bowel with a laxative solution) and oral antibiotic bowel preparation (taking antibiotics by mouth before surgery) probably reduces surgical site infections (infections at the incision site) and anastomotic leaks (leakage where two sections of bowel are joined) compared with mechanical preparation alone, based on moderate‑quality evidence; there was no clear difference in death, postoperative ileus (temporary bowel paralysis), or length of hospital stay, and side‑effects were rarely reported.\n- Evidence comparing the combined approach with oral antibiotics alone or with no bowel preparation is very uncertain, so it is unclear whether the combined method offers any advantage or disadvantage over those alternatives.\n- Future research should include well‑designed trials that directly compare combined preparation with oral antibiotics alone and with no preparation, report any side‑effects, and examine specific types of colon surgery to clarify the best pre‑operative bowel‑cleansing strategy.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy are complications after elective colorectal surgery a concern?\nElective colorectal surgery – operations planned in advance to remove or repair parts of the colon or rectum – can be life‑saving, but the success of these procedures depends heavily on what happens after the operation. The most serious problems that can arise are surgical site infections (SSIs), which are infections where the incision was made, and anastomotic leakages, where the new connection (anastomosis) between two pieces of bowel breaks down and leaks intestinal contents. Both complications can lead to longer hospital stays, delayed recovery, and lasting health problems. Because the large bowel naturally contains many bacteria, surgeries on this organ carry a higher risk of infection compared with other abdominal operations. To try to lower this risk, doctors often clean out the bowel before surgery – a process called bowel preparation. This can be done mechanically (by giving patients liquids that flush out the stool) and/or with oral antibiotics (pills that reduce the number of bacteria). While cleaning the bowel mechanically alone has not shown clear benefits, it is still unclear whether combining mechanical cleaning with oral antibiotics (combined MBP + oAB) is helpful or harmful.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors set out to determine whether using a combined approach of mechanical bowel preparation plus oral antibiotic bowel preparation (MBP + oAB) before elective colorectal surgery reduces postoperative complications compared with mechanical preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all. In other words, they wanted to assess the best pre‑surgery cleaning strategy to prevent infections and anastomotic leaks.\n\n**Methods**\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared combined mechanical and oral‑antibiotic bowel preparation with mechanical preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no preparation in adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery. We pooled the results across these studies and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 21 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 5,264 adults undergoing planned colorectal surgery. Each trial compared a bowel preparation that combined mechanical cleaning and oral antibiotics (MBP + oAB) with one of three alternatives: mechanical preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no preparation at all. All participants also received standard intravenous antibiotics around the time of surgery. The studies included patients having colon or rectal resections for both cancer and non‑cancer reasons, but the abstract did not give details about participants’ ages, gender, disease severity, study locations, duration, or funding sources.\nMain results: Combined mechanical and oral antibiotic preparation versus mechanical preparation alone\nUsing both mechanical cleaning and oral antibiotics together probably reduces the chance of surgical site infections and anastomotic leaks compared with using mechanical cleaning alone. For every 100 patients treated with the combined preparation instead of mechanical preparation only, about 40 to 45 fewer would develop an infection or a leak. The combined preparation probably makes little or no difference to death rates, postoperative ileus, or length of hospital stay when compared with mechanical preparation alone.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical style checks: subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"), which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text is hard to read for patients because of (1) excessive passive voice and noun‑heavy constructions (30 passive clauses, 44 nominalisations, 229 nouns), (2) very long, complex sentences that exceed 30 words, and (3) unexplained technical terms (e.g., \"anastomotic leak\", \"post‑operative ileus\").\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Subheading format – rewrite each heading as a question. Example: change \"Methods\" to \"What did we do?\".\n2. Long, passive sentence – original: \"We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.\" Rewrite: \"We are moderately confident in the evidence, but some studies may have been unblinded, included diverse participants, used different delivery methods, and were small in size.\"\n3. Jargon without definition – provide brief definitions in the main text, e.g., \"post‑operative ileus – a temporary slowdown of the bowel after surgery\".\n4. Noun‑heavy sentence – original: \"The combined preparation probably makes little or no difference to death rates, postoperative ileus, or length of hospital stay when compared with mechanical preparation alone.\" Rewrite: \"The combined preparation probably does not change death rates, bowel paralysis after surgery, or how long patients stay in hospital compared with mechanical preparation alone.\"\n5. Awkward phrasing – original: \"The evidence is up to date to December 2021 of search.\" Rewrite: \"The evidence is current up to our December 2021 search.\"\n\nThese changes will reduce passive voice, lower noun density, shorten sentences, and align the structure with the style guide, making the summary clearer for patients.\n\nMetrics support: The evaluation shows 30 passive constructions (well above the typical 9‑23 range) and 44 nominalisations (typical 8‑27). Readability scores are far from typical PLS values (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 24.6 vs typical 32‑48; Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 15.8 vs typical 11‑16). Reducing sentence length and simplifying vocabulary should raise the reading ease above 40 and bring grade level below 13, matching typical PLS patterns.",

These metrics confirm the need for shorter sentences, more active voice, and simpler wording."
