  "plain_title": "Is combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation (cleaning the bowel with a laxative solution and taking antibiotics by mouth) before planned colon surgery more effective at preventing infections and leaks than a bowel cleanse alone or no preparation?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Combined mechanical bowel preparation (cleaning the bowel with a laxative solution) and oral antibiotic bowel preparation (taking antibiotics by mouth before surgery) probably reduces surgical site infections (infections at the incision site) and anastomotic leaks (leakage where two sections of bowel are joined) compared with mechanical preparation alone, based on moderate‑quality evidence; there was no clear difference in death, postoperative ileus (temporary bowel paralysis), or length of hospital stay, and side‑effects were rarely reported.",
    "Evidence comparing the combined approach with oral antibiotics alone or with no bowel preparation is very uncertain, so it is unclear whether the combined method offers any advantage or disadvantage over those alternatives.",
    "Future research should include well‑designed trials that directly compare combined preparation with oral antibiotics alone and with no preparation, report any side‑effects, and examine specific types of colon surgery to clarify the best pre‑operative bowel‑cleansing strategy."

      "subheading": "Why are complications after elective colorectal surgery a concern?",
      "content": "Elective colorectal surgery – operations planned in advance to remove or repair parts of the colon or rectum – can be life‑saving, but the success of these procedures depends heavily on what happens after the operation. The most serious problems that can arise are surgical site infections (SSIs), which are infections where the incision was made, and anastomotic leakages, where the new connection (anastomosis) between two pieces of bowel breaks down and leaks intestinal contents. Both complications can lead to longer hospital stays, delayed recovery, and lasting health problems. Because the large bowel naturally contains many bacteria, surgeries on this organ carry a higher risk of infection compared with other abdominal operations. To try to lower this risk, doctors often clean out the bowel before surgery – a process called bowel preparation. This can be done mechanically (by giving patients liquids that flush out the stool) and/or with oral antibiotics (pills that reduce the number of bacteria). While cleaning the bowel mechanically alone has not shown clear benefits, it is still unclear whether combining mechanical cleaning with oral antibiotics (combined MBP + oAB) is helpful or harmful."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to determine whether using a combined approach of mechanical bowel preparation plus oral antibiotic bowel preparation (MBP + oAB) before elective colorectal surgery reduces postoperative complications compared with mechanical preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all. In other words, they wanted to assess the best pre‑surgery cleaning strategy to prevent infections and anastomotic leaks."

      "subheading": "What did we do?",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared combined mechanical and oral‑antibiotic bowel preparation with mechanical preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no preparation in adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery. We pooled the results across these studies and assessed our confidence in the evidence."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 21 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 5,264 adults undergoing planned colorectal surgery. Each trial compared a bowel preparation that combined mechanical cleaning and oral antibiotics (MBP + oAB) with one of three alternatives: mechanical preparation alone, oral antibiotics alone, or no preparation at all. All participants also received standard intravenous antibiotics around the time of surgery. The studies included patients having colon or rectal resections for both cancer and non‑cancer reasons, but the abstract did not give details about participants’ ages, gender, disease severity, study locations, duration, or funding sources."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Combined mechanical and oral antibiotic preparation versus mechanical preparation alone",
      "content": "Using both mechanical cleaning and oral antibiotics together probably reduces the chance of surgical site infections and anastomotic leaks compared with using mechanical cleaning alone. For every 100 patients treated with the combined preparation instead of mechanical preparation only, about 40 to 45 fewer would develop an infection or a leak. The combined preparation probably makes little or no difference to death rates, postoperative ileus, or length of hospital stay when compared with mechanical preparation alone."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to December 2021 of search."
