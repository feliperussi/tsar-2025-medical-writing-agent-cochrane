  "draft": "Is heated, humidified air delivered through small nasal tubes (nasal high flow therapy) a safe and effective first breathing support for babies born early compared with other non‑invasive methods?\n\nKey messages:\n- Nasal high‑flow therapy (heated, humidified air delivered through small nasal tubes) works about as well as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP – steady pressure that keeps the airway open) or nasal intermittent positive‑pressure ventilation (NIPPV – a device that gives breaths through the nose) in preventing death or chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia – a long‑term lung problem) for babies born at 28 weeks gestation or later. It may increase the chance that doctors need to switch to another support within the first three days, but it usually does not increase the need for a breathing tube (invasive mechanical ventilation). It also appears to cause fewer nose injuries and fewer lung air leaks (pneumothorax – air around the lung).\n- Very few babies born before 28 weeks were studied, so we cannot be sure the same benefits and risks apply to the most premature infants.\n- The evidence comes from a small number of trials and has some uncertainty. More well‑designed research is needed, especially in extremely preterm babies and to look at long‑term outcomes such as lung health and brain development.\n\nWhat is respiratory distress in preterm infants and why is it a problem?\nBabies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy are called preterm. Their lungs are often not fully developed, so many struggle to breathe after birth. This condition is called respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Severe RDS can lead to death or to long‑term lung damage called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Both outcomes can affect the child’s health for years, so we aim to give extra breathing support soon after birth.\n\nWhat is nasal high‑flow (NHF) therapy and how is it used?\nNHF therapy delivers warm, moist air (sometimes mixed with extra oxygen) through two tiny tubes placed in the baby’s nose. The gas flows faster than normal breathing – usually 2 to 8 L per minute. The goal is to help the baby breathe without inserting a tube into the airway (mechanical ventilation). We can use NHF as the first line of support, before trying any invasive ventilation, to prevent or treat RDS in preterm infants.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether using NHF as the first breathing support is as safe and effective as other non‑invasive methods such as CPAP or NIPPV. We looked at outcomes including death, chronic lung disease (BPD), the need for a breathing tube within the first three days, treatment failure (the need to change to another support), lung air leaks (pneumothorax), and nose injuries.\n\nHow did we carry out the review?\nWe searched the literature up to March 2022 for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared NHF with other non‑invasive supports. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 13 trials that enrolled a total of 2,540 preterm infants. Most infants were at least 28 weeks gestation; very few were younger than 28 weeks. Eleven trials compared NHF with CPAP and four trials compared NHF with NIPPV.\n\nCompared with CPAP, NHF probably makes little or no difference to the combined risk of death or chronic lung disease, to death alone, and to chronic lung disease alone. NHF probably increases the chance of treatment failure within the first three days, but it probably does not increase the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. NHF probably reduces the risk of pneumothorax and reduces nose injuries.\n\nCompared with NIPPV, the evidence is uncertain about the combined risk of death or chronic lung disease. NHF probably makes little or no difference to death, to treatment failure, and to the need for mechanical ventilation. NHF probably reduces nose injuries and probably makes little or no difference to pneumothorax.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because many trials were small, some participants and staff knew which treatment was given, and the studies used different devices and flow rates. Very few infants younger than 28 weeks were included, so we cannot be sure the findings apply to the most premature babies.\n\nWhat is the current evidence currency?\nWe updated the review with searches completed in March 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS shows moderate overall conformity. Readability scores are good (Flesch‑Reading Ease 59, Grade 9.8). However, several metrics deviate: passive voice (31 instances, beyond P90), nominalizations (26, beyond P90), noun count (209, beyond P90), SMOG (13.6, beyond P90), complex words (122, beyond P90) and long words (193, beyond P90). These indicate the draft is somewhat noun‑heavy and uses many complex forms, which aligns with the suggested edits to reduce passive constructions and nominalisations."
