  "draft": "Is heated, humidified air delivered through small nasal tubes (nasal high flow therapy) a safe and effective first breathing support for babies born early compared with other non‑invasive methods?\n\nKey messages:\n- Nasal high‑flow therapy (heated, humidified air through small nasal tubes) works about as well as CPAP or NIPPV at preventing death or chronic lung disease in babies born at 28 weeks or later. It may lead to early treatment failure but does not usually increase the need for a breathing tube, and it reduces nose injuries and lung air leaks.\n- Few infants younger than 28 weeks were studied, so we cannot be sure the same benefits and risks apply to the most premature babies.\n- The evidence comes from a limited number of trials with some uncertainty; more well‑designed research is needed, especially in extremely preterm infants and for long‑term outcomes such as lung health and brain development.\n\nWhat is respiratory distress in preterm infants and why is it a problem?\nBabies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy are called preterm. Their lungs are often under‑developed, so many struggle to breathe after birth. This condition is called respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Severe RDS can lead to death or to long‑term lung damage called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Both outcomes can affect the child’s health for years, so clinicians aim to provide extra breathing support soon after birth.\n\nWhat is nasal high‑flow (NHF) therapy and how is it used?\nNHF therapy delivers warm, moist air (sometimes mixed with extra oxygen) through two tiny tubes placed in the baby’s nose. The gas flows at 2–8 L/min, faster than normal breathing. The goal is to support breathing without inserting a tube into the airway (mechanical ventilation). NHF can be used as the first line of support, before any invasive ventilation, to prevent or treat RDS in preterm infants.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether using NHF as the first breathing support is as safe and effective as other non‑invasive methods such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP – a steady pressure that keeps the airway open) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV – a device that gives breaths through the nose). We examined outcomes including death, BPD, need for a breathing tube within the first three days, treatment failure, lung air leaks (pneumothorax), and nose injuries.\n\nHow did we carry out the review?\nWe searched the literature up to March 2022 for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared NHF with other non‑invasive supports in preterm infants with early respiratory distress. We combined the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find about nasal high‑flow compared with CPAP and NIPPV?\nWe identified 13 trials involving 2,540 infants (most were ≥28 weeks gestation). Compared with CPAP, NHF probably makes little or no difference to the combined risk of death or BPD, to death alone, and to BPD alone. NHF likely increases the chance of treatment failure within the first three days, but it probably does not increase the need for mechanical ventilation. NHF probably reduces the risk of pneumothorax and nasal trauma.\nWhen compared with NIPPV, the evidence is uncertain about the combined risk of death or BPD. NHF probably makes little or no difference to death, to treatment failure, and to the need for mechanical ventilation. NHF probably reduces nasal trauma and probably makes little or no difference to pneumothorax.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because many trials were small, some participants and staff knew which treatment was given, and the studies used different devices and flow rates. Very few infants younger than 28 weeks were included, so we cannot be sure the findings apply to the most premature babies.\n\nWhat is the current evidence currency?\nWe updated the review with searches completed in March 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because several passages are likely to confuse readers. 1) The first key‑message bullet is a single, very long sentence that packs multiple ideas, abbreviations and definitions together, making it hard to follow. 2) Some sentences use passive or awkward constructions (e.g., \"The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.\") which obscure who did what. 3) Technical terms such as \"treatment failure\", \"mechanical ventilation\", \"pneumothorax\" and \"nasal trauma\" are introduced without simple, everyday explanations for a lay audience. These issues exceed the acceptable level of confusion for a plain‑language summary. Suggested rewrites are provided below. The PLS metrics also flag high passive voice (29 instances, beyond typical), high nominalisation (25), many nouns (180) and a large number of complex Dale‑Chall words (281) and long words (175), confirming the editorial concerns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit and scores well on readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 59.6, FKGL 9.96). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in passive voice (BEYOND_P90), nominalisation (P90), noun count (P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (BEYOND_P90) and long words (BEYOND_P90). These deviations indicate the text is more noun‑heavy, uses more passive constructions and contains many complex words, which can reduce clarity for patients."
