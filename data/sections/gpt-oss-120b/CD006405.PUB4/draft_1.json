  "draft": "Is heated, humidified air delivered through small nasal tubes (nasal high flow therapy) a safe and effective first breathing support for babies born early compared with other non‑invasive methods?\n\nKey messages:\n- Nasal high‑flow therapy (heated, humidified air delivered through small nasal tubes) appears to work about as well as other non‑invasive supports such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP – a method that keeps the airway open with steady pressure) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV – a method that gives breaths through the nose) in preventing death or chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia – a long‑term lung problem) in preterm babies born at 28 weeks gestation or later, but it is more likely to be judged as a treatment failure (the need to switch to another breathing support) within the first three days; however, this does not usually lead to a higher need for invasive mechanical ventilation (breathing support using a tube placed into the airway), and it may cause fewer nose injuries (nasal trauma) and fewer lung air leaks (pneumothorax – air in the space around the lung).\n- The studies included very few infants born before 28 weeks gestation, so we do not know whether the same benefits and risks apply to the most premature babies.\n- Because the evidence comes from a limited number of trials with some uncertainty, more well‑designed research is needed, especially in extremely preterm infants and to look at longer‑term outcomes such as lung health and brain development.\n\nWHAT IS RESPIRATORY DISTRESS IN PRETERM INFANTS AND WHY IS IT A PROBLEM?\nBabies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy are called preterm. Their lungs are often not fully developed, so soon after birth many of them struggle to breathe on their own. This condition is known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). If the breathing problem is severe, it can lead to death or to long‑term lung damage called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Both outcomes are serious and can affect the baby’s health for years. Because of this, doctors try to give these infants extra help with breathing right after they are born.\n\nWHAT IS NASAL HIGH‑FLOW (NHF) THERAPY AND HOW IS IT USED?\nNasal high‑flow therapy delivers warm, moist air (sometimes mixed with extra oxygen) through two tiny tubes placed in the baby’s nose. The gas is pushed at a higher speed than normal (more than 1 litre per minute, usually 2–8 L/min). The idea is to support the baby’s breathing without needing a tube down the throat (which is called mechanical ventilation). nHF can be used as the first line of support – that is, before any invasive ventilation is tried – to prevent or treat RDS in preterm infants.\n\nWHAT DID THE REVIEW AIM TO FIND OUT?\nThe authors wanted to know whether using nasal high‑flow therapy as the first breathing support for preterm babies is as safe and effective as other non‑invasive methods, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Specifically, they looked at whether nHF changes the chances of death, long‑term lung problems (BPD), the need for a breathing tube within the first three days, and other important outcomes like treatment failure, lung injury (pneumothorax), and damage to the baby’s nose.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched for studies that compared nasal high‑flow therapy with other non‑invasive respiratory supports for preterm infants with early respiratory distress, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWHAT DID WE FIND?\nWe identified 13 randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that enrolled a total of 2,540 preterm infants born before 37 weeks' gestation. Most participants were infants of at least 28 weeks' gestational age; very few were extremely preterm (<28 weeks). The trials compared nasal high‑flow (nHF) therapy—delivered via heated, humidified air and oxygen through small nasal prongs at flows of about 2–8 L/min—with other non‑invasive respiratory supports. Eleven studies compared nHF with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and four studies compared nHF with nasal intermittent positive‑pressure ventilation (NIPPV). No trials compared nHF with ambient oxygen or low‑flow nasal cannulae, and the abstract did not provide details on study locations, follow‑up periods, or funding sources.\n\nMAIN RESULTS: NASAL HIGH‑FLOW VERSUS CPAP AND NIPPV\nCompared with CPAP, nasal high‑flow probably makes little to no difference to the combined risk of death or chronic lung disease, to death alone, and to chronic lung disease alone. It probably increases the chance of treatment failure within the first three days, but probably makes little to no difference to the need for mechanical ventilation. Nasal high‑flow probably reduces the risk of pneumothorax and probably reduces nasal trauma compared with CPAP.\n\nWhen compared with NIPPV, it is unclear whether nasal high‑flow affects the combined risk of death or chronic lung disease. It probably makes little to no difference to death alone, to treatment failure within the first three days, and to the need for mechanical ventilation. Nasal high‑flow probably reduces nasal trauma and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of pneumothorax.\n\nLIMITATIONS OF EVIDENCE\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all studies provided all the data we needed, the studies were done in different types of babies or used different ways of delivering the therapy, the evidence does not cover the most premature babies we are interested in, and the studies were small or there were not enough events to be sure about the results.\n\nEVIDENCE CURRENCY\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical checks: (1) Word count is 961 words, exceeding the 850‑word limit. (2) Several subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"METHODS\" and \"MAIN RESULTS: NASAL HIGH‑FLOW VERSUS CPAP AND NIPPV\"), breaching the style guide. (3) The text contains many long, complex sentences and heavy passive voice, making it hard for patients to follow.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Word count reduction** – Trim redundant phrasing, especially in the key messages and background. Example rewrite: \"Nasal high‑flow works as well as CPAP or NIPPV at preventing death or chronic lung disease in babies ≥28 weeks, but it may lead to early treatment failure without increasing the need for a breathing tube, and it reduces nose injuries and lung air leaks.\" (reduces length from 71 to 38 words).\n2. **Convert subheadings to questions** – Change \"METHODS\" to \"HOW DID WE CARRY OUT THE REVIEW?\" and \"MAIN RESULTS: NASAL HIGH‑FLOW VERSUS CPAP AND NIPPV\" to \"WHAT DID WE FIND ABOUT NASAL HIGH‑FLOW COMPARED WITH CPAP AND NIPPV?\".\n3. **Break up overly long sentences** – The first key‑message sentence is 71 words and confusing. Suggested rewrite: \"Nasal high‑flow therapy (heated, humidified air through small nasal tubes) works about as well as CPAP or NIPPV at preventing death or chronic lung disease in babies born at 28 weeks or later. It is more likely to be judged a treatment failure within the first three days, but this rarely leads to invasive ventilation. It also appears to cause fewer nose injuries and fewer lung air leaks (pneumothorax).\"\n4. **Reduce passive voice** – Example: \"The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.\" → \"We updated the review with searches completed in March 2022.\"\n5. **Simplify noun‑heavy phrasing** – Replace noun‑dense sentences like \"The studies included very few infants born before 28 weeks gestation, so we do not know whether the same benefits and risks apply to the most premature babies.\" with \"Few infants were younger than 28 weeks, so we cannot say if the results apply to the most premature babies.\"\n\nThese changes address the most serious clarity and style issues and will also bring the metrics closer to typical PLS patterns (currently 40 passive constructions, 31 nominalisations, 268 nouns, and high complex‑word counts). Reducing sentence length and passive voice will lower the words‑per‑sentence (currently 25.3, P90) and improve readability scores. Overall, the draft needs substantial revision before it can be approved.",

Readability scores are moderate (FRE 51, FKGL 12.4) but the excessive sentence length and noun density reduce patient‑friendly readability."
