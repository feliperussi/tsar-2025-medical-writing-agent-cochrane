  "plain_title": "Is sinus surgery (endoscopic sinus surgery) better than medicine alone for improving nose and lung health in people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic disease that affects lungs and sinuses) and nasal polyps (growths in the nose)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "We do not know if adding endoscopic sinus surgery (a minimally invasive operation to open the sinuses) to standard medical treatment improves nasal symptoms or lung health in people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic condition that affects the lungs and sinuses) and nasal polyps (small growths inside the nose); the only study we found was small and did not provide clear evidence of benefit or harm.",
    "The review also could not determine whether surgery reduces the need for antibiotics, hospital stays, or pulmonary exacerbations (lung flare‑ups), and only one minor bleeding event during surgery was reported.",
    "More well‑designed, larger studies that follow patients for at least a year are needed to find out whether sinus surgery truly helps the nose and lungs and to understand any possible risks."

    {
      "subheading": "What is cystic fibrosis and how does it affect the nose?",
      "content": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that makes the body’s mucus and other secretions unusually thick and sticky. This thick mucus can block the tiny passages in the sinuses (the air‑filled spaces behind the nose), leading to chronic rhinosinusitis – a long‑lasting inflammation of the sinuses – and the growth of nasal polyps, which are soft, non‑cancerous lumps inside the nose that can cause congestion, runny nose and reduced sense of smell."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What treatments are usually used for sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis?",
      "content": "Doctors often try medicines first, such as nasal rinses, steroids or antibiotics, to reduce inflammation and infection. When these medicines are not enough, an operation called endoscopic sinus surgery may be offered. This surgery uses a thin camera and small instruments to open the blocked sinus passages and remove nasal polyps, allowing medicines to reach the sinuses more effectively."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to discover whether adding sinus surgery – either alone or together with standard medical treatment – improves outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis who have chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. Specifically, the authors wanted to know if surgery helps with nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial colonisation, lowers the need for antibiotics, decreases lung‑related flare‑ups (pulmonary exacerbations) and improves overall lung function, compared with medical treatment alone."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared sinus surgery (with or without medical treatment) to medical treatment alone in people with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found only one small randomised trial that met the review’s criteria. The study enrolled 28 people aged 19‑28 years who had cystic fibrosis together with chronic sinus infection and nasal polyps. Participants were split into two groups: one received nasal irrigation alone (standard medical care) and the other received nasal irrigation plus endoscopic sinus surgery (polypectomy with extended sinusotomy). The abstract gave no details about how long participants were followed, the duration of the interventions, the country where the study was done, or who funded it.\n\nThe evidence from this single study is very uncertain. We do not know whether adding sinus surgery to standard medical care improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial colonisation, lowers the need for antibiotics, decreases lung flare‑ups, or improves lung function in people with cystic fibrosis. The surgery appeared generally safe, with only one brief bleeding episode that was quickly managed. Overall, we cannot tell if the surgery makes a difference."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people/intervention/comparators/outcomes we were interested in.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search."
