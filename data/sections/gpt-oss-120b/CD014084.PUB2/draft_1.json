  "draft": "Is sinus surgery (endoscopic sinus surgery) better than medicine alone for improving nose and lung health in people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic disease that affects lungs and sinuses) and nasal polyps (growths in the nose)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- We do not know if adding endoscopic sinus surgery (a minimally invasive operation to open the sinuses) to standard medical treatment improves nasal symptoms or lung health in people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic condition that affects the lungs and sinuses) and nasal polyps (small growths inside the nose); the only study we found was small and did not provide clear evidence of benefit or harm.\n- The review also could not determine whether surgery reduces the need for antibiotics, hospital stays, or pulmonary exacerbations (lung flare‑ups), and only one minor bleeding event during surgery was reported.\n- More well‑designed, larger studies that follow patients for at least a year are needed to find out whether sinus surgery truly helps the nose and lungs and to understand any possible risks.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and how does it affect the nose?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that makes the body’s mucus and other secretions unusually thick and sticky. This thick mucus can block the tiny passages in the sinuses (the air‑filled spaces behind the nose), leading to chronic rhinosinusitis – a long‑lasting inflammation of the sinuses – and the growth of nasal polyps, which are soft, non‑cancerous lumps inside the nose that can cause congestion, runny nose and reduced sense of smell.\n\nWhat treatments are usually used for sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis?\nDoctors often try medicines first, such as nasal rinses, steroids or antibiotics, to reduce inflammation and infection. When these medicines are not enough, an operation called endoscopic sinus surgery may be offered. This surgery uses a thin camera and small instruments to open the blocked sinus passages and remove nasal polyps, allowing medicines to reach the sinuses more effectively.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe review set out to discover whether adding sinus surgery – either alone or together with standard medical treatment – improves outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis who have chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. Specifically, the authors wanted to know if surgery helps with nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial colonisation, lowers the need for antibiotics, decreases lung‑related flare‑ups (pulmonary exacerbations) and improves overall lung function, compared with medical treatment alone.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared sinus surgery (with or without medical treatment) to medical treatment alone in people with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found only one small randomised trial that met the review’s criteria. The study enrolled 28 people aged 19‑28 years who had cystic fibrosis together with chronic sinus infection and nasal polyps. Participants were split into two groups: one received nasal irrigation alone (standard medical care) and the other received nasal irrigation plus endoscopic sinus surgery (polypectomy with extended sinusotomy). The abstract gave no details about how long participants were followed, the duration of the interventions, the country where the study was done, or who funded it.\n\nThe evidence from this single study is very uncertain. We do not know whether adding sinus surgery to standard medical care improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial colonisation, lowers the need for antibiotics, decreases lung flare‑ups, or improves lung function in people with cystic fibrosis. The surgery appeared generally safe, with only one brief bleeding episode that was quickly managed. Overall, we cannot tell if the surgery makes a difference.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people/intervention/comparators/outcomes we were interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because several section subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., “Methods”, “Limitations”, “Currency”). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement that subheadings be question‑style. In addition, the text contains multiple clarity and readability problems that would confuse patients:\n1. Jargon without clear definition – “pulmonary exacerbations” and “chronic rhinosinusitis” appear in key messages without simple explanations.\n2. Very long sentences – e.g., the title/question runs over 30 words and the first key‑message bullet is a 38‑word run‑on, making it hard to follow.\n3. Heavy noun‑density and nominalisation – the draft uses 193 nouns and 30 nominalisations (well above typical PLS ranges), resulting in noun‑heavy sentences that obscure who is doing what (e.g., “The surgery appeared generally safe, with only one brief bleeding episode that was quickly managed.”).\n4. Passive constructions – 16 passive instances (at the high end of the typical range) reduce clarity, especially in sentences describing results.\n5. Complex vocabulary – SMOG index 15.2, Dale‑Chall 8.45, and 152 complex words indicate the text is at a higher reading level than the target (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 38.8, grade 13.6).\nThese issues are supported by the PLS evaluation metrics, which flag nominalisation, noun count, SMOG, Dale‑Chall, and complex‑word counts as beyond the 90th percentile. To meet Cochrane PLS standards, the subheadings must be re‑written as questions, sentences shortened to ≤30 words, jargon explained in plain language, passive voice converted to active, and noun‑heavy phrasing replaced with clearer verbs and simpler words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but shows moderate overall conformity. Key deviations are in nominalisation (30 vs typical <13), noun count (193 vs typical <116), SMOG index (15.2 vs typical <12.1), Dale‑Chall readability (8.45 vs typical <7.7), and complex‑word counts (152 complex words, 309 Dale‑Chall complex words) – all beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than typical PLS. Readability scores (FRE 38.8, FKGL 13.6) are at the lower‑end of acceptable range but still high for a patient audience."
