  "draft": "Does a gentle electric pad (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, TENS) reduce period pain in women?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (a gentle electric pad that sends mild currents to the skin) may reduce period pain (primary dysmenorrhoea) compared with a dummy treatment or no treatment, but the evidence is limited and uncertain; no studies reported side effects, so it is not known whether TENS causes any unwanted effects.\n- It is unclear whether one type of TENS (high‑frequency, which delivers rapid pulses) works better than another type (low‑frequency, which delivers slower pulses), and comparisons with other common pain‑relief methods such as medication or acupressure also remain uncertain.\n- Future research should include well‑designed trials that assess not only pain relief but also other important outcomes such as the need for extra pain medication, impact on daily activities, quality of life, and any possible adverse effects, to provide clearer guidance.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why is it a problem?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea (often called period pain or menstrual cramps) is painful cramping that many women experience during their menstrual periods. It is called \"primary\" because the pain is not caused by any other pelvic disease – it is a direct result of the normal hormonal changes that cause the uterus to contract. The pain can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities, school or work, and can reduce quality of life. Most women treat the pain with medicines such as non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen, but some cannot take these drugs because of side‑effects or personal preference. This has led researchers to look for non‑drug alternatives.\n\nWhat is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and how might it help?\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS, is a device that delivers small electrical currents through electrodes placed on the skin over the painful area. The currents can be delivered at a high frequency (many pulses per second) or a low frequency (fewer pulses). TENS is thought to relieve pain by blocking pain signals from reaching the brain, prompting the body to release its own natural pain‑killers (endogenous opioids), and reducing muscle strain in the uterus. Because it does not involve medication, TENS could be an attractive option for women who want a drug‑free way to manage menstrual cramps.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to determine whether TENS – both high‑frequency and low‑frequency versions – is effective and safe for relieving pain from primary dysmenorrhoea. Specifically, they compared TENS with placebo or no treatment and with other common treatments such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, acupressure, or interferential current therapy. The goal was to see if TENS reduces pain and whether it causes any unwanted side‑effects.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared high- or low-frequency TENS with placebo, no treatment or other therapies in women with primary dysmenorrhoea, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWe looked at 20 randomised controlled trials that together included 585 women aged 12 to 49 years who had primary dysmenorrhoea. The studies compared high‑frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), low‑frequency TENS, placebo or no treatment, and other options such as acupressure, acetaminophen (paracetamol), non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and interferential current therapy. High‑frequency TENS may reduce menstrual pain a little compared with no treatment or placebo, and low‑frequency TENS may also reduce pain compared with no treatment or placebo. It is unclear whether high‑frequency TENS works better than low‑frequency TENS or other treatments, and it is also unclear whether low‑frequency TENS differs from other treatments such as acetaminophen. Reported side‑effects were rare and no serious adverse events were identified.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024 of search.",

This alone makes the PLS non‑compliant with the Master Style Guide. In addition, several clarity problems would likely confuse a patient reader: (1) technical terms such as “interferential current therapy”, “endogenous opioids”, “high‑frequency” and “low‑frequency” are used without plain‑language explanations; (2) a long, dense sentence in the Results paragraph bundles two findings together, making it hard to follow; (3) passive‑voice wording (“The evidence is up to date to April 2024 of search”) obscures who performed the search; (4) the text contains many nominalisations and long, complex words, contributing to a higher SMOG (13.95) and a very high count of unfamiliar Dale‑Chall words (284), which are well beyond typical PLS ranges. These issues reduce readability and violate the style guide’s emphasis on active voice and plain language. To meet Cochrane standards the draft needs to re‑phrase the non‑question subheadings, simplify jargon, break up long sentences, convert passive constructions to active voice, and reduce nominalisations and complex vocabulary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is within the 850‑word limit (680 words) and shows average readability scores (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 48.7, FK‑Grade 11.8). However, several metrics deviate markedly from typical PLS patterns: nominalisations (26, beyond P90), nouns (180, P90), SMOG index (13.95, P90), complex words (144, P90), long words (198, P90) and especially complex Dale‑Chall words (284, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words than is usual for patient‑focused summaries."
