  "draft": "Do physical interventions (like wearing masks, washing hands, and keeping distance) reduce the spread of respiratory viruses?\n\nKey messages:\n- Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the chance of getting flu‑like illness, while regular hand washing (hand hygiene) probably reduces overall respiratory illness a little; harms such as discomfort were rarely measured.\n- Higher‑grade respirators (N95/P2 respirators, which are tight‑fitting masks that filter out at least 95 % of tiny particles) do not clearly outperform standard surgical masks for preventing infection in health‑care settings, and both can cause discomfort.\n- Many studies had methodological problems, low adherence to the interventions, and limited reporting of side effects, so larger well‑designed trials are needed.\n\nWhy are outbreaks of respiratory viruses a concern and what can we do?\nViruses that cause acute respiratory infections (ARIs) – illnesses of the nose, throat and lungs such as flu, SARS and COVID‑19 – spread quickly and can lead to severe illness, hospitalisation and death. Medicines and vaccines help, but they are not always enough, especially when a new virus appears. Researchers therefore study \"physical interventions\" – actions that do not involve drugs – to interrupt transmission. These include wearing masks, keeping distance, washing hands, isolating sick people and using protective equipment such as goggles or face shields.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases for randomised controlled trials that tested physical measures (for example masks, hand washing, distancing) to interrupt or reduce the spread of ARIs. We combined the results and judged confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 78 trials, including 11 new ones that added 610,872 participants. The trials were done in schools, homes, hospitals and community settings across high‑ and low‑income countries. Interventions tested were medical or surgical masks versus no mask, N95/P2 respirators versus medical or surgical masks, and hand‑hygiene programmes versus no intervention. No trials evaluated gowns, gloves, face shields or entry‑port screening.\nWearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the chance of flu‑like illness. Using an N95/P2 respirator instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little or no difference to the chance of laboratory‑confirmed influenza infection. Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of an acute respiratory infection slightly – about a 14 % relative reduction, which translates to roughly 5 fewer cases per 100 people.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence, although many studies were not blinded (participants were aware of the intervention they received) and adherence to the measures was low. Not all studies reported every outcome, and the studies varied in the people studied and how the interventions were delivered. The evidence therefore does not cover all groups, interventions, comparators or outcomes of interest, and many trials were small or had few events.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to October 2022.",

The reduction is about 14 % – roughly five fewer people out of every 100 become ill.\"\n3. **Passive voice** – \"The trials were done in schools, homes, hospitals and community settings across high‑ and low‑income countries.\"\n   *Problem:* Passive construction hides who carried out the work.\n   *Rewrite:* \"Researchers carried out the trials in schools, homes, hospitals and community settings in both high‑ and low‑income countries.\"\n4. **Wordy phrasing** – \"We examined 78 trials, including 11 new ones that added 610,872 participants.\"\n   *Problem:* Unnecessary words make the sentence longer.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We examined 78 trials, including 11 new ones with a total of 610,872 participants.\"\nThese issues are reflected in the metric analysis: the draft shows a high nominalisation count (22, beyond the typical range) and a relatively high number of complex and long words, which together lower readability. Reducing jargon, shortening sentences, and converting passive constructions to active voice will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns and improve patient‑friendly comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit (518 words) and has moderate overall conformity. Readability scores are around the median (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 45.8, FKGL 12.2). However, several metrics deviate: nominalisation (22, P90), SMOG index (13.95, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.51, P90), and counts of complex/long words are all higher than typical PLS ranges, indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words. These metric signals support the editorial recommendation to simplify language, reduce nominalisations, and use more active, concise sentences."
