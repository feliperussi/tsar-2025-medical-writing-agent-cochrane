  "draft": "Do physical interventions (like wearing masks, washing hands, and keeping distance) reduce the spread of respiratory viruses?\n\nKey messages:\n- Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the chance of getting flu‑like illness, while regular hand cleaning (hand hygiene) probably lowers overall respiratory illness a little; harms such as discomfort were rarely measured.\n- Higher‑grade respirators (N95/P2 respirators, which are tight‑fitting masks that filter out at least 95 % of tiny particles) do not clearly outperform standard surgical masks for preventing infection in health‑care settings, and both can cause discomfort.\n- Many studies had methodological problems, low follow‑up with the rules, and limited reporting of side effects, so larger well‑designed trials are needed.\n\nWhy are outbreaks of respiratory viruses a concern and what can we do?\nViruses that cause acute respiratory infections (ARIs) – illnesses of the nose, throat and lungs such as flu, SARS and COVID‑19 – spread quickly and can lead to severe illness, hospitalisation and death. Medicines and vaccines help, but they are not always enough, especially when a new virus appears. Researchers therefore study \"physical interventions\" – actions that do not involve drugs – to interrupt transmission. These include wearing masks, keeping distance, cleaning hands, isolating sick people and using protective equipment such as goggles or face shields.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases for randomised controlled trials that tested physical measures (for example masks, hand hygiene, distancing) to interrupt or reduce the spread of ARIs. We combined the results and judged confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 78 trials, including 11 new ones that added 610,872 participants. The trials were done in schools, homes, hospitals and community settings across high‑ and low‑income countries. Interventions tested were medical or surgical masks versus no mask, N95/P2 respirators versus medical or surgical masks, and hand‑hygiene programmes versus no intervention. No trials evaluated gowns, gloves, face shields or entry‑port screening.\n\nWearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the chance of flu‑like illness. Using an N95/P2 respirator instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little or no difference to the chance of influenza infection confirmed by a lab test. Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of an acute respiratory infection slightly – a 14% relative reduction, which translates to about 5 fewer cases per 100 people.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\nWe are fairly sure about the evidence, but many studies let participants know which intervention they received, did not report all outcomes, used different populations or delivery methods, and were often small or had few events. This means the evidence does not cover all people, interventions, comparators or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to October 2022.",

Simplifying the language also aligns with the metric findings that show high SMOG (13.6) and high Dale‑Chall scores, indicating the text is more complex than typical PLS. Reducing complex words and clarifying phrasing will bring the draft into the typical PLS range.\n\n**Metric support:** The evaluation shows elevated SMOG (13.6) and Dale‑Chall readability (8.44) scores, plus a high count of complex words (117) and unfamiliar words (233). These deviations indicate the text is more complex than usual, supporting the need for simplification.",
