  "draft": "Do physical interventions (like wearing masks, washing hands, and keeping distance) reduce the spread of respiratory viruses?\n\n**What are the key messages?**\n- Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the chance of getting flu‑like illness, while regular hand cleaning (hand hygiene) probably reduces overall respiratory illness a little; harms such as discomfort were rarely measured.\n- Higher‑grade respirators (N95/P2 respirators, tight‑fitting masks that filter at least 95 % of tiny particles) do not clearly outperform standard surgical masks for preventing infection in health‑care settings, and both can cause discomfort.\n- Many studies had methodological problems, low adherence, and limited reporting of side effects, so larger well‑designed trials are needed.\n\n**Why are outbreaks a concern and what can we do?**\nViruses that cause acute respiratory infections (ARIs) – illnesses of the nose, throat and lungs such as flu, SARS and COVID‑19 – spread quickly and can lead to severe illness, hospitalisation and death. Medicines and vaccines help, but they are not always enough, especially when a new virus appears. Researchers therefore study \"physical interventions\" – actions that do not involve drugs – to interrupt transmission. These include wearing masks, keeping distance, cleaning hands, isolating sick people and using protective equipment such as goggles or face shields.\n\n**How did we find the evidence?**\nWe searched major databases for randomised controlled trials that tested physical measures (e.g., masks, hand hygiene, distancing) to interrupt or reduce the spread of ARIs. We combined the results and judged confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe examined 78 trials, including 11 new ones that added 610,872 participants. The trials were conducted in schools, homes, hospitals and community settings across high‑ and low‑income countries. Interventions tested were medical or surgical masks versus no mask, N95/P2 respirators versus medical or surgical masks, and hand‑hygiene programmes versus no intervention. No trials evaluated gowns, gloves, face shields or entry‑port screening.\nWearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the chance of flu‑like illness. Using an N95/P2 respirator instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little or no difference to the chance of laboratory‑confirmed influenza infection. Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of an acute respiratory infection slightly – about 14 fewer cases per 100 people.\n\n**What are the limitations?**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because many studies allowed participants to know which intervention they received, did not report all outcomes, used different populations and delivery methods, and were often small or had few events. The evidence therefore does not cover all people, interventions, comparators or outcomes of interest.\n\n**How current is the evidence?**\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to October 2022.",

This factual error must be corrected.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Incorrect absolute reduction figure – hand hygiene**\n   - Problematic sentence: “Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of an acute respiratory infection slightly – about 14 fewer cases per 100 people.”\n   - Why it’s problematic: The number is not supported by the source and misleads readers about the size of the benefit.\n   - Suggested rewrite: “Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of an acute respiratory infection slightly – about 5 fewer cases per 100 people (a 14% relative reduction).”\n\n2. **Clarify magnitude of hand‑hygiene benefit**\n   - Problematic sentence: “Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of an acute respiratory infection slightly – about 14 fewer cases per 100 people.” (same sentence)\n   - Why it’s problematic: Readers may not understand the difference between relative and absolute effects.\n   - Suggested rewrite: “Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of an acute respiratory infection slightly – a 14% relative reduction, which translates to roughly 5 fewer cases per 100 people.”\n\n3. **Simplify the confidence statement**\n   - Problematic sentence: “We are moderately confident in the evidence because many studies: allowed participants to know which intervention they received, did not report all outcomes, used different populations and delivery methods, and were often small or had few events.”\n   - Why it’s problematic: Long, complex sentence with several clauses can overwhelm readers.\n   - Suggested rewrite: “We are moderately confident in the evidence. Many studies let participants know which intervention they received, did not report all outcomes, used different populations or delivery methods, and were often small or had few events.”\n\n4. **Reduce technical jargon**\n   - Problematic phrase: “laboratory‑confirmed influenza infection.”\n   - Why it’s problematic: The term may be unfamiliar to some readers.\n   - Suggested rewrite: “influenza infection confirmed by a lab test.”\n\n5. **Address high lexical complexity**\n   - The PLS evaluation shows high smog_index (13.68), dale_chall_readability (8.47), and many complex words (118) and unfamiliar words (233). Simplifying wording (e.g., replacing “moderately confident” with “fairly sure”, “adherence” with “following the rules”) will lower these scores and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and includes all required sections with question‑style headings. Metrics show good overall conformity (high active voice, low words per sentence). However, readability scores are elevated: smog_index (13.7) and dale_chall_readability (8.5) are above typical PLS ranges, and the counts of complex and unfamiliar words are high (118 and 233). These indicate the text is more complex than typical PLS, supporting the need to simplify wording and reduce jargon."
