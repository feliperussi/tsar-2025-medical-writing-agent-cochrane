  "draft": "Do physical interventions (like wearing masks, washing hands, and keeping distance) reduce the spread of respiratory viruses?\n\nKey messages:\n- Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably does not change your chance of getting flu‑like illness.\n- Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of an acute respiratory infection (a sudden illness affecting the lungs and airways), but discomfort or skin irritation were rarely measured.\n- Higher‑grade respirators (N95/P2 masks that filter at least 95 % of tiny particles) do not clearly outperform standard surgical masks in health‑care settings, and both can cause discomfort.\n\nWhy are outbreaks of respiratory viruses a concern and what can we do?\nViruses that cause acute respiratory infections (ARIs) – illnesses that affect the nose, throat and lungs such as flu, SARS and COVID‑19 – spread quickly and can lead to severe illness, hospitalisation and death. Medicines and vaccines help, but they are not needed enough when a new virus appears. Researchers therefore study \"physical interventions\" – actions that do not involve drugs – to interrupt transmission. These include wearing masks, keeping distance, washing hands, isolating sick people and using protective equipment such as goggles or face shields.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases for studies where participants were randomly assigned to different groups (randomised controlled trials, RCTs). We combined the results and judged our confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 78 RCTs, including 11 new ones that added 610,872 participants. The trials were carried out in schools, homes, hospitals and community settings in both high‑ and low‑income countries. The interventions tested were:\n- Medical or surgical masks versus no mask.\n- N95/P2 respirators versus medical or surgical masks.\n- Hand‑hygiene programmes versus no intervention.\nNo trials evaluated gowns, gloves, face shields or entry‑port screening.\nThe main findings were:\n- Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably does not change the chance of getting flu‑like illness.\n- Using an N95/P2 respirator instead of a medical or surgical mask probably does not change the chance of a laboratory‑confirmed flu infection.\n- Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of an acute respiratory infection by about 14 % – roughly five fewer people out of every 100 become ill.\nHarms such as discomfort or skin irritation were rarely measured.\n\nLimitations of the evidence\nWe have moderate confidence in these results, but many studies were not blinded (participants knew which intervention they received) and adherence to the measures was low. Not all studies reported every outcome, and the studies varied in the people studied and how the interventions were delivered. The evidence therefore does not cover all groups, interventions, comparators or outcomes of interest, and many trials were small or had few events.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to October 2022.",

    {

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the \"Limitations of the evidence\" subheading is not phrased as a question (e.g., \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"). All other required sections are present, the title and other subheadings are questions, the factual details match the source, and the word count is within limits. However, this subheading issue prevents the PLS from meeting the Master Style Guide. Additionally, a few clarity improvements are recommended:\n1. Problematic phrase: \"Medicines and vaccines help, but they are not needed enough when a new virus appears.\" – unclear wording. Suggested rewrite: \"Medicines and vaccines help, but they may not be sufficient when a new virus appears.\"\n2. Long, dense sentence: \"Viruses that cause acute respiratory infections (ARIs) – illnesses that affect the nose, throat and lungs such as flu, SARS and COVID‑19 – spread quickly and can lead to severe illness, hospitalisation and death.\" – could be split for readability. Suggested rewrite: \"Viruses that cause acute respiratory infections (ARIs) affect the nose, throat and lungs. Examples include flu, SARS and COVID‑19. They spread quickly and can lead to severe illness, hospitalisation, and death.\"\n3. Passive construction: \"Harms such as discomfort or skin irritation were rarely measured.\" – rewrite in active voice: \"We rarely measured harms such as discomfort or skin irritation.\"\nThese changes will improve clarity and align the text with the style guide while the metric profile (e.g., 15 passive sentences, 108 complex words, and a high complex_words_dc count) supports the need for more active voice and simpler wording.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows strong overall conformity: most metrics fall within typical PLS ranges (e.g., FKGL 11.68 at P25, FRE 50.14 at P75). The only notable deviation is the high complex_words_dc count (220, P90), indicating many unfamiliar words; reducing jargon and simplifying language will further improve readability."
