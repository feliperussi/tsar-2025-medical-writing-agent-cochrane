  "draft": "Do physical interventions (like wearing masks, washing hands, and keeping distance) reduce the spread of respiratory viruses?\n\nKey messages:\n- Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the chance of getting flu‑like illness, while regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of a sudden respiratory illness a little; harms such as discomfort were rarely measured.\n- Higher‑grade respirators (N95/P2 respirators, which are tight‑fitting masks that filter out at least 95 % of tiny particles) do not clearly outperform standard surgical masks for preventing infection in health‑care settings, and both can cause discomfort.\n- Many studies had methodological problems, low adherence to the interventions, and limited reporting of side effects, so larger well‑designed trials are needed.\n\nWhy are outbreaks of respiratory viruses a concern and what can we do?\nViruses that cause acute respiratory infections (ARIs) – illnesses that affect the nose, throat and lungs such as the flu, SARS and COVID‑19 – spread quickly and can lead to severe illness, hospitalisation and death. Medicines and vaccines help, but they are not always enough, especially when a new virus appears. Researchers therefore study \"physical interventions\" – actions that do not involve drugs – to interrupt transmission. These include wearing masks, keeping distance from others, washing hands, isolating sick people and using protective equipment such as goggles or face shields.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases for randomised controlled trials that tested physical measures (for example masks, hand washing, distancing) to interrupt or reduce the spread of ARIs. We combined the results and judged confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 78 trials, including 11 new ones with a total of 610,872 participants. Researchers carried out the trials in schools, homes, hospitals and community settings in both high‑ and low‑income countries. The interventions tested were medical or surgical masks versus no mask, N95/P2 respirators versus medical or surgical masks, and hand‑hygiene programmes versus no intervention. No trials evaluated gowns, gloves, face shields or entry‑port screening.\nWearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the chance of flu‑like illness. Using an N95/P2 respirator instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little or no difference to the chance of flu that has been confirmed by a lab test. Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of a sudden respiratory illness. The reduction is about 14 % – roughly five fewer people out of every 100 become ill.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence, although many studies were not blinded (participants knew which intervention they received) and adherence to the measures was low. Not all studies reported every outcome, and the studies varied in the people studied and how the interventions were delivered. The evidence therefore does not cover all groups, interventions, comparators or outcomes of interest, and many trials were small or had few events.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to October 2022.",

Key problems and concrete rewrites:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – \"We searched major databases for randomised controlled trials…\" (sentence). Readers may not know what a randomised controlled trial is. *Rewrite*: \"We searched major databases for studies where participants were randomly assigned to different groups (randomised controlled trials)…\"\n2. **Ambiguous term** – \"Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of a sudden respiratory illness.\" (sentence). The phrase \"sudden respiratory illness\" is unclear. *Rewrite*: \"Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of an acute respiratory infection (a sudden illness affecting the lungs and airways).\"\n3. **Awkward wording** – \"Using an N95/P2 respirator instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little or no difference to the chance of flu that has been confirmed by a lab test.\" (sentence). The construction is cumbersome. *Rewrite*: \"Using an N95/P2 respirator instead of a medical or surgical mask probably does not change your chance of getting a flu that is confirmed by a laboratory test.\"\n4. **Overly long bullet point** – First key‑message bullet combines two ideas in one long sentence: \"Wearing a medical or surgical mask… while regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of a sudden respiratory illness, harms such as discomfort were rarely measured.\" This can overwhelm readers. *Rewrite*: Split into two bullets:\n   - \"Wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably does not change your chance of getting flu‑like illness.\"\n   - \"Regular hand washing probably reduces the chance of an acute respiratory infection, but harms such as discomfort were rarely measured.\"\n5. **Missing simple definition** – The term \"ARIs\" appears earlier without a plain‑language reminder. *Rewrite*: Add a brief reminder after first use, e.g., \"acute respiratory infections (ARIs) – illnesses that affect the nose, throat and lungs.\"\nThese changes address the most confusing elements and also bring the draft’s readability metrics closer to typical PLS patterns (the current SMOG index (13.8) and counts of complex/long words are above the median; simplifying terminology will lower these scores).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights four metrics that deviate: SMOG index (13.8, beyond typical median), complex_words_dc (239), complex_words (118), and long_words (169) – all higher than typical PLS ranges. This indicates the draft contains more complex and long words than usual, supporting the need to simplify jargon and shorten sentences as recommended."
