  "key_messages": [
    "Physical interventions show mixed results: wearing masks in the community does not clearly reduce the spread of respiratory viruses, while regular hand cleaning (hand hygiene) probably lowers the overall number of respiratory illnesses a little, and harms such as discomfort or skin irritation were rarely measured.",
    "Higher‑grade respirators (N95/P2 respirators, which are tight‑fitting masks that filter out small particles) do not appear to give a clear benefit over standard surgical masks (loose‑fitting masks used in medical settings) for preventing infection in health‑care settings, and both types can cause discomfort (unpleasant feeling while wearing).",
    "Because many studies had methodological problems (issues with how the study was done), low adherence (people did not consistently follow the intervention), and limited reporting of side effects (unwanted effects), more large, well‑designed trials are needed to determine how these measures work in different groups and settings."

      "content": "Viruses that cause acute respiratory infections (ARIs) – illnesses that affect the nose, throat and lungs such as the flu, SARS and COVID‑19 – spread quickly around the world and can lead to severe illness, hospitalisation and death. Medicines and vaccines help, but they are not always enough to prevent the virus from moving from person to person, especially when a new virus appears. Because of this, researchers look at “physical interventions” – actions that do not involve drugs – to interrupt transmission. These include things like wearing masks, keeping a distance from others, cleaning hands, isolating sick people, and using protective equipment such as goggles or face shields.\n\nMedical or surgical masks are simple cloth or paper coverings that catch large droplets. N95/P2 respirators are tighter‑fitting masks that filter out at least 95 % of tiny airborne particles, offering a higher level of protection. All of these measures aim to reduce the spread of the virus without relying on medication."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to: assess the effectiveness of physical interventions?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know how well these physical measures work. Specifically, they set out to assess the effectiveness of interventions such as screening at entry points, isolation, quarantine, physical distancing, personal protective equipment (including medical/surgical masks, N95/P2 respirators, glasses), hand hygiene, and even simple actions like gargling, in reducing the spread of acute respiratory viruses."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We examined 78 randomised (including cluster) controlled trials, of which 11 new trials added 610,872 participants. The studies were carried out in a wide range of settings – community members such as schoolchildren and residents of immigrant neighbourhoods, health‑care workers and patients in hospital wards – and in both high‑income and low‑income countries across several continents. The interventions tested were physical measures: medical or surgical masks versus no mask, N95/P2 respirators versus medical or surgical masks, and hand‑hygiene programmes versus no intervention. No randomised trials were found for gowns, gloves, face shields or screening at entry ports. The review found that wearing a medical or surgical mask in the community probably makes little or no difference to the chance of getting flu‑like illness, using an N95 or P2 respirator instead of a medical or surgical mask probably makes little or no difference to the chance of a laboratory‑confirmed influenza infection, and regular hand‑washing and other hand‑hygiene measures probably reduce the chance of an acute respiratory infection slightly – about 14 fewer people per 100 may become ill compared with those who do not use these measures."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, the evidence does not cover all the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we care about, and the studies were very small or based on few cases.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search."
