  "draft": "Is psychedelic-assisted therapy (therapy using psychedelic drugs like psilocybin or LSD) effective for reducing anxiety, depression, and existential distress (deep fear about meaning and dying) in people with serious illnesses?\n\n- Psychedelic‑assisted therapy using classical psychedelics (drugs such as psilocybin or LSD) may reduce anxiety and depression and possibly lessen existential distress (deep fear about meaning and dying) in people with life‑threatening illnesses; no serious side effects were reported, though mild effects such as temporary blood pressure? (typo) temporary blood pressure rise, nausea, anxiety or emotional upset were common, and the overall certainty of the evidence is low because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.\n- Evidence for psychedelic‑assisted therapy using MDMA (a drug sometimes called ‘Ecstasy’) is very uncertain, with no clear benefit for anxiety or depression and similar uncertainty about side effects.\n- More large, well‑designed randomised trials with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm any benefits, clarify the risk of side effects, improve blinding (keeping participants unaware of which treatment they receive), and determine whether these therapies are useful for different types of serious illness.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy do people with life‑threatening illnesses often experience anxiety, depression, and existential distress?\nWhen someone is diagnosed with a serious condition such as cancer, the uncertainty about the future, physical symptoms, and the impact on daily life can lead to strong feelings of worry (anxiety), sadness (depression), and a sense of loss of meaning or purpose (existential distress). These emotional problems are common and can reduce quality of life. Standard care usually includes medicines for mood, counselling, and support groups, but many patients still struggle despite these options.\n\nWhat is psychedelic‑assisted therapy and how might it help?\nPsychedelic‑assisted therapy is a treatment approach where a person takes a psychedelic drug—such as psilocybin (the active ingredient in \"magic mushrooms\"), LSD, or MDMA (sometimes called \"Ecstasy\")—under close supervision of trained clinicians. The session includes preparation before the drug is taken, a guided experience while the drug is active, and follow‑up meetings to help the person make sense of what they felt. Researchers think that the intense, often spiritual experience can reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress by changing patterns of thinking and emotion. However, these substances are illegal in most countries and can cause side‑effects like temporary high blood pressure, nausea, or mild anxiety.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to determine whether psychedelic‑assisted therapy is effective and safe for people with life‑threatening diseases. Specifically, they compared the therapy with placebo or other active treatments (such as antidepressant medicines) to see if it reduces anxiety, depression, and existential distress, and to identify any harms that might occur.\n\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared psychedelic‑assisted therapy with placebo or other treatments for anxiety, depression, or existential distress in people with life‑threatening illnesses, combined their findings, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at six randomised controlled trials that together included 149 adults with life‑threatening illnesses (most commonly cancer). Data from 140 participants. The participants were aged 36 to 64 years. The studies were carried out in outpatient settings in the United States and Switzerland, lasted between six and twelve months, and were funded by organisations that support psychedelic‑assisted therapy rather than by pharmaceutical companies. The interventions tested were psychedelic‑assisted therapy using classic psychedelics (psilocybin or LSD) or MDMA, each compared with an active placebo or a low‑dose psychedelic control. No studies examined other psychedelic agents or people without a life‑threatening disease.\n\nMain results: Anxiety and mood effects\nThe evidence suggests that psychedelic‑assisted therapy with classic psychedelics (psilocybin or LSD) probably reduces anxiety in people with life‑threatening illnesses and may also produce a small reduction in depression. The effect on existential distress is uncertain because the evidence is very limited. The therapy appears to be well tolerated; no serious adverse events were reported, and side‑effects were mild and temporary, such as brief rises in blood pressure, nausea, or short‑lasting anxiety.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024 of search.",

This makes the structure less reader‑friendly. Additionally, the draft contains many clarity problems that would confuse patients, such as unexplained jargon, overly long sentences, and a typo. The PLS evaluation also shows excessive passive voice (30 instances, beyond the 90th percentile) and a very high noun count (217, beyond the 90th percentile), contributing to the dense, noun‑heavy prose.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Heading format – Quote: \"Methods\". Problem: Not a question, violating the style guide. Rewrite: \"How did we find the evidence?\".\n2. Heading format – Quote: \"Results\". Problem: Not a question. Rewrite: \"What did we find?\".\n3. Heading format – Quote: \"Limitations\". Problem: Not a question. Rewrite: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\".\n4. Heading format – Quote: \"Currency\". Problem: Not a question. Rewrite: \"How up to date is this review?\".\n5. Clarity – jargon – Quote: \"existential distress (deep fear about meaning and dying)\". Problem: The term is introduced but the definition is clunky and may still be confusing. Rewrite: \"existential distress – strong worries about the meaning of life and fear of dying\".\n6.

No serious side effects were reported. Mild effects such as a temporary rise in blood pressure, nausea, anxiety, or emotional upset were common. The evidence is low‑certainty because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.\"\n\nSupporting evidence: The PLS evaluation shows 30 passive‑voice constructions (well beyond the typical range of 9‑23) and 217 nouns (beyond the typical 83‑202), indicating a noun‑heavy, passive style that hampers readability. The high SMOG index (15.9) and Dale‑Chall score (8.4) also reflect the need to simplify language and reduce complex words.
