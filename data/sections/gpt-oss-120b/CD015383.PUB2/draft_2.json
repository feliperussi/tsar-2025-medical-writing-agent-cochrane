  "draft": "Is psychedelic‑assisted therapy (using drugs such as psilocybin or LSD) effective for reducing anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with serious illnesses?\n\nKey messages:\n- Psychedelic‑assisted therapy with classic psychedelics (psilocybin or LSD) probably reduces anxiety and may lower depression in people with life‑threatening diseases; the evidence is low‑certainty because the studies were small.\n- The therapy appears safe in the short term: no serious adverse events were reported, but mild effects such as a temporary rise in blood pressure, nausea, anxiety, or emotional upset were common.\n- Evidence for psychedelic‑assisted therapy with MDMA is very uncertain, and we need larger, well‑designed trials to confirm any benefits and clarify risks.\n\nWhy do people with life‑threatening illnesses often experience anxiety, depression, and existential distress?\nWe know that a diagnosis such as cancer brings uncertainty about the future, physical symptoms, and disruption to daily life. These factors can trigger strong worry (anxiety), sadness (depression), and existential distress – strong worries about the meaning of life and fear of dying. These emotional problems are common and can lower quality of life. Standard care usually includes medicines, counselling, and support groups, but many patients continue to struggle.\n\nWhat is psychedelic‑assisted therapy and how might it help?\nPsychedelic‑assisted therapy combines a supervised dose of a psychedelic drug – such as psilocybin (the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms”), LSD, or MDMA (sometimes called “Ecstasy”) – with therapeutic support. The process includes preparation sessions, a guided experience while the drug is active, and follow‑up meetings to help the person make sense of what they felt. Researchers think the intense, often spiritual experience can shift thinking patterns and emotions, potentially easing anxiety, depression, and existential distress. The drugs are illegal in most countries and can cause short‑term side‑effects such as a temporary rise in blood pressure, nausea, or mild anxiety.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether psychedelic‑assisted therapy is effective and safe for people with life‑threatening diseases. Specifically, we compared the therapy with placebo or other active treatments (for example, antidepressants) to see if it reduces anxiety, depression, and existential distress, and we recorded any harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two trial registers, and reference lists up to 30 March 2024. We included randomised controlled trials that compared psychedelic‑assisted therapy with placebo or other treatments in adults with life‑threatening illnesses. Two reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six trials that enrolled 149 participants (data from 140 were analysed). Participants were aged 36–64 years and most had cancer. The trials were conducted in outpatient settings in the United States and Switzerland and were funded by organisations that support psychedelic research.\n\n- Classic psychedelics (psilocybin or LSD) probably reduced anxiety and may have produced a small reduction in depression. The effect on existential distress remains uncertain because only one small study measured it.\n- No serious adverse events occurred in any trial. Common mild effects included a temporary rise in blood pressure, nausea, anxiety, or emotional upset.\n- Evidence for MDMA was very uncertain: the single small trial did not show a clear benefit for anxiety or depression, and side‑effects such as anxiety, dry mouth, jaw clenching, and headache were reported.\nOverall, the certainty of the evidence was low to very low due to small sample sizes, risk of bias from possible unblinding, and imprecision.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe cannot be confident in the results because many studies were small and participants may have known which treatment they received, which can influence outcomes. The follow‑up periods were short, and the trials did not include all possible psychedelic agents or a wide range of serious illnesses.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to 30 March 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.\n",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical clarity checks: (1) It uses the term “classic psychedelics” without defining it for a lay audience, leaving readers unsure what drugs are included. (2) Numerous sentences are written in passive voice (e.g., “No serious adverse events were reported”, “Data from 140 were analysed”), which obscures who performed the actions and reduces readability – the PLS metrics show 24 passive constructions (beyond P90). (3) A key sentence combines several facts and is overly long: “We identified six trials that enrolled 149 participants (data from 140 were analysed). Participants were aged 36–64 years and most had cancer.” This can be split for clarity. (4) The statement about certainty is vague: “the evidence is low‑certainty because the studies were small.” It should explain that low certainty reflects both small sample size and methodological limitations. (5) Inconsistent terminology (“serious illnesses” vs. “life‑threatening diseases”) may confuse readers. These issues together constitute more than three significant clarity problems that would likely frustrate a patient reader. The draft should be revised to address these points before approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and includes all required sections with question‑style headings. However, linguistic metrics reveal major deviations: passive_voice = 24 (BEYOND_P90), nouns = 192 (P90), smog_index = 15.2 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words_dc = 299 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words = 169 (BEYOND_P90), long_words = 222 (BEYOND_P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy phrasing, and high lexical complexity, supporting the need for the suggested clarity improvements."
