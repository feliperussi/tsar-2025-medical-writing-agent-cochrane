  "draft": "Do oral medicines (drugs taken by mouth) improve dizziness, hearing loss and ringing in the ears (symptoms of Ménière’s disease) compared with no treatment?\n\nKey messages\n- We could not determine whether oral medicines (drugs taken by mouth that affect the whole body) improve dizziness (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, or ringing in the ears (tinnitus) because the studies were few and the evidence is very uncertain; serious unwanted effects were not reported.\n- Several types of oral medicines – betahistine, diuretics (drugs that help the body remove excess fluid), antivirals (drugs that fight viruses), and corticosteroids (drugs that reduce inflammation) – have been studied, but each study measured outcomes differently and provided limited data, so no clear pattern of benefit or harm emerged.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that use consistent ways to assess dizziness, hearing and tinnitus, and that also monitor any potential side effects.\n\nWhat is Ménière’s disease and why is it a problem?\nMénière’s disease is a disorder of the inner ear. It causes repeated episodes of vertigo (spinning dizziness), a gradual loss of hearing and ringing in the ears (tinnitus). These symptoms can be frightening and can make everyday activities such as driving, working or enjoying hobbies very difficult. The exact cause is unknown, so doctors do not have a single cure. Instead, they often try medicines taken by mouth that affect the whole body (systemic medicines) to try to reduce the number and severity of vertigo attacks. Common medicines include betahistine, diuretics, antivirals and corticosteroids.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether these systemic medicines actually help people with Ménière’s disease. Specifically, we compared each medicine with a placebo (a harmless pill that looks the same but has no active ingredient) or with no treatment. We asked three questions: 1) Do the medicines reduce the number of vertigo attacks or make the attacks less severe? 2) Do they cause serious side‑effects? 3) How do they affect hearing loss, tinnitus, quality of life and other harms?\n\nHow did we find and assess the studies?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared systemic medicines with placebo or no treatment in adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease. We included studies that followed participants for at least three months. Two reviewers extracted the data and we used standard Cochrane methods to assess the certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified ten trials that together involved 848 adults with Ménière’s disease. The trials compared betahistine (seven trials, 548 participants), diuretics (two trials, 300 participants), an antiviral (one trial, 24 participants) and systemic corticosteroids (one trial, 16 participants) with placebo or no treatment. No study reported participants’ ages, gender, disease severity, country or funding source.\nWe are very uncertain whether any of these medicines reduce vertigo attacks, improve hearing, lessen tinnitus or boost quality of life. Serious side‑effects were rarely reported, so we cannot tell whether the medicines cause harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies involved small numbers of participants, used different ways of delivering the medicines and measured outcomes at different times. The evidence does not cover all people, interventions, comparisons or outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to September 2022, the date of our last search.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights five deviating features: nouns (171, P90), SMOG index (14.2, P90), complex words (DC 256, P90; total 133, P90), and long words (201, P90). These suggest the draft is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical Cochrane PLSs, reinforcing the need to simplify language, reduce noun density, and shorten sentences."
