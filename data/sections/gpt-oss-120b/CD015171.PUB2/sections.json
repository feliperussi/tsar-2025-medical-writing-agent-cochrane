  "key_messages": [
    "We could not determine whether oral medicines (drugs taken by mouth that affect the whole body) improve dizziness (a single episode of spinning sensation), hearing loss, or ringing in the ears (tinnitus) compared with no treatment because the available studies were few and the evidence is very uncertain; serious unwanted effects were not reported.",
    "Several types of oral medicines – including betahistine, diuretics (drugs that help the body remove excess fluid), antivirals (drugs that fight viruses), and corticosteroids (drugs that reduce inflammation) – have been studied, but each study used different ways to measure outcomes and provided limited data, so no clear pattern of benefit or harm emerged.",
    "Future research should involve larger, well‑designed studies that use consistent ways to assess dizziness, hearing, and tinnitus, and that also monitor any potential side effects."

      "subheading": "What is Ménière’s disease and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Ménière’s disease is a disorder of the inner ear that causes repeated episodes of spinning dizziness (called vertigo), a feeling that the world is moving around you. It is also linked with a gradual loss of hearing and ringing in the ears (tinnitus). These symptoms can be frightening and can make everyday activities – such as driving, working, or enjoying hobbies – very difficult. The exact cause of Ménière’s disease is still unknown, which means doctors do not have a single cure. Instead, they often try different medicines that are taken by mouth or injection (called systemic pharmacological interventions) to try to reduce the number and severity of vertigo attacks. Commonly used drugs include betahistine (a medicine thought to improve blood flow in the inner ear), diuretics (which help the body get rid of excess fluid), antiviral drugs (which target viruses that might be involved), and corticosteroids (anti‑inflammatory medicines)."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to discover whether these systemic medicines actually help people with Ménière’s disease. Specifically, they compared each drug with a placebo (a harmless pill that looks the same but has no active ingredient) or with no treatment at all. They looked at three main questions: 1) Do the medicines reduce the number of vertigo attacks or make the attacks less severe? 2) Are there any serious side‑effects from taking the medicines? 3) How do the treatments affect other problems such as hearing loss, tinnitus, quality of life, and any other harms? By answering these questions, the review aimed to give clear information about the benefits and risks of the drugs used for Ménière’s disease."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified ten randomised controlled trials that together involved 848 adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease. The studies each followed participants for at least three months, with some continuing for more than a year. The trials compared systemic medicines – betahistine (seven trials, 548 participants), diuretics (two trials, 300 participants), an antiviral (one trial, 24 participants) and systemic corticosteroids (one trial, 16 participants) – against placebo or no treatment. No information was given about the participants’ ages, gender, disease severity, the countries where the studies were done, or who funded the research.\n\nThe review found that the evidence is very uncertain whether any of these systemic medicines improve the frequency or severity of vertigo attacks, hearing loss, tinnitus, or quality of life in Ménière’s disease. Serious side‑effects were rarely reported, so it is also unclear whether these treatments cause harm."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparisons or outcomes we are interested in, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search."
