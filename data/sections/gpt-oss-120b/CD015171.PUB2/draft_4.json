  "draft": "Do oral medicines (drugs taken by mouth) improve dizziness, hearing loss and ringing in the ears (symptoms of Ménière’s disease) compared with no treatment?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We could not determine whether oral medicines (drugs taken by mouth) improve dizziness (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, or ringing in the ears (tinnitus) because only a few small studies exist and the evidence is very uncertain. Serious side‑effects were rarely reported.\n- Several types of oral medicines – betahistine, diuretics (drugs that help the body remove excess fluid), antivirals (drugs that fight viruses) and corticosteroids (drugs that reduce inflammation) – have been studied, but each study measured outcomes in different ways, so no clear pattern of benefit or harm emerged.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that use the same methods to assess dizziness, hearing and tinnitus, and that also monitor any potential side‑effects.\n\nWhat is Ménière’s disease and why does it matter?\nMénière’s disease is a disorder of the inner ear that causes repeated episodes of spinning dizziness (vertigo), a gradual loss of hearing and ringing in the ears (tinnitus). These symptoms can be frightening and can make everyday activities such as driving, working or enjoying hobbies very difficult. The exact cause is unknown, so doctors do not have a single cure. Instead, they often try medicines taken by mouth or injection that affect the whole body (systemic medicines) to try to reduce the number and severity of vertigo attacks. Common medicines include betahistine (thought to improve blood flow in the inner ear), diuretics (which help the body get rid of excess fluid), antiviral drugs (which target viruses that might be involved) and corticosteroids (anti‑inflammatory medicines).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether these systemic medicines actually help people with Ménière’s disease. We compared each medicine with a placebo (a harmless pill that looks the same but has no active ingredient) or with no treatment. We asked three questions: 1) Do the medicines reduce the number of vertigo attacks or make them less severe? 2) Do they cause serious side‑effects? 3) How do they affect hearing loss, tinnitus, quality of life and other harms?\n\nHow did we find and assess the studies?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to a medicine or a placebo) that compared systemic medicines with placebo or no treatment in adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease. We only included studies that followed participants for at least three months. Two reviewers extracted the data and we used standard Cochrane methods to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified ten trials that together involved 848 adults with Ménière’s disease. The trials compared betahistine, diuretics, an antiviral and systemic corticosteroids with placebo or no treatment. Betahistine was tested in seven trials (548 participants). Diuretics were tested in two trials (300 participants). The antiviral was tested in one trial (24 participants). Corticosteroids were tested in one trial (16 participants). No study reported participants’ ages, gender, disease severity, country or funding source.\nWe are very uncertain whether any of these medicines reduce how often vertigo attacks happen, make them less severe, improve hearing, lessen tinnitus or improve quality of life. Serious side‑effects were rarely reported, so we cannot tell whether the medicines cause harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies were small, used different ways of delivering the medicines and measured outcomes at different times. This makes the evidence less reliable and less applicable to all people with Ménière’s disease.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to September 2022, the date of our last search.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, title format, factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but three significant clarity problems could confuse readers:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – the term “systemic medicines” is used without a simple definition. Readers may not understand that it means medicines taken by mouth or injection that affect the whole body. \n   *Problematic sentence*: \"Instead, they often try medicines taken by mouth or injection that affect the whole body (systemic medicines) to try to reduce the number and severity of vertigo attacks.\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"Instead, they often try medicines taken by mouth or injection that work throughout the whole body – called systemic medicines – to try to reduce the number and severity of vertigo attacks.\"\n2. **Overly long, clause‑heavy sentence** in the Methods section makes the information hard to follow.\n   *Problematic sentence*: \"We searched several databases for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to a medicine or a placebo) that compared systemic medicines with placebo or no treatment in adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease.\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"We searched several databases for randomised controlled trials – studies that randomly assign participants to a medicine or a placebo – that compared systemic medicines with placebo or no treatment in adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease.\"\n3. **Excessive passive voice** obscures who performed actions and reduces readability (the draft contains 20 passive constructions, P90). For example, the Results paragraph begins with a passive construction.\n   *Problematic sentence*: \"The review found that the evidence is very uncertain whether any of these systemic medicines improve the frequency or severity of vertigo attacks, hearing loss, tinnitus or quality of life.\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"We found that the evidence is very uncertain about whether any of these systemic medicines improve the frequency or severity of vertigo attacks, hearing loss, tinnitus, or quality of life.\"\nAdditional minor tweaks (e.g., reducing parentheses, breaking up long bullet‑point sentences) would further improve flow. Addressing these points will bring the draft in line with the Master Style Guide and lower the high passive‑voice, noun‑heavy, and complex‑word metrics that currently deviate from typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights six metric deviations: passive_voice (20, P90), nouns (175, P90), smog_index (14.2, P90), complex_words_dc (268, P90), complex_words (136, P90) and long_words (203, P90). These indicate the draft is unusually passive, noun‑dense, and uses many long or complex words, supporting the need to rewrite passive sentences, simplify vocabulary, and reduce noun‑heavy constructions."
