  "draft": "Do oral medicines (drugs taken by mouth) improve dizziness, hearing loss and ringing in the ears (symptoms of Ménière’s disease) compared with no treatment?\n\nKey messages\n- We could not tell whether oral medicines (drugs taken by mouth that work throughout the whole body) improve dizziness (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, or ringing in the ears (tinnitus) because only a few small studies exist and the evidence is very uncertain; serious side‑effects were rarely reported.\n- Several types of oral medicines – betahistine, diuretics (drugs that help the body remove excess fluid), antivirals (drugs that fight viruses) and corticosteroids (drugs that reduce inflammation) – have been studied, but each study measured outcomes in different ways, so no clear pattern of benefit or harm emerged.\n- Future research should involve larger, well‑designed trials that use the same methods to assess dizziness, hearing and tinnitus, and that also monitor any potential side‑effects.\n\nWhat is Ménière’s disease and why does it matter?\nMénière’s disease is a disorder of the inner ear. It causes repeated episodes of vertigo (spinning dizziness), a gradual loss of hearing and ringing in the ears (tinnitus). These symptoms can be frightening and can make everyday activities such as driving, working or enjoying hobbies very difficult. The exact cause is unknown, so doctors do not have a single cure. Instead, they often try medicines taken by mouth or by injection (called systemic pharmacological interventions) to try to reduce the number and severity of vertigo attacks. Common medicines include betahistine, diuretics, antivirals and corticosteroids.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether these systemic medicines actually help people with Ménière’s disease. We compared each medicine with a placebo (a harmless pill that looks the same but has no active ingredient) or with no treatment. We asked three questions: 1) Do the medicines reduce the number of vertigo attacks or make the attacks less severe? 2) Do they cause serious side‑effects? 3) How do they affect hearing loss, tinnitus, quality of life and other harms?\n\nHow did we find and assess the studies?\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared systemic medicines with placebo or no treatment in adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease. We only included studies that followed participants for at least three months. Two reviewers extracted the data and we used standard Cochrane methods to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified ten trials that together involved 848 adults with Ménière’s disease. The trials compared betahistine (seven trials, 548 participants), diuretics (two trials, 300 participants), an antiviral (one trial, 24 participants) and systemic corticosteroids (one trial, 16 participants) with placebo or no treatment. No study reported participants’ ages, gender, disease severity, country or funding source.\nWe are very uncertain whether any of these medicines reduce the frequency or severity of vertigo attacks, improve hearing, lessen tinnitus or improve quality of life. Serious side‑effects were rarely reported, so we cannot tell whether the medicines cause harm.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies were small, used different ways of delivering the medicines and measured outcomes at different times. This makes the evidence less reliable and less applicable to all people with Ménière’s disease.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to September 2022, the date of our last search.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the required subheading format: the \"Key messages\" heading is not phrased as a question, which breaches the Master Style Guide. Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers: (1) the first key‑message sentence is long, contains multiple parentheses and a semicolon, making it hard to follow; (2) the term \"systemic pharmacological interventions\" is repeated without a simple definition, which may be unfamiliar to patients; (3) some sentences are noun‑heavy and use complex words (e.g., \"The review found that the evidence is very uncertain whether any of these systemic medicines improve the frequency or severity of vertigo?\" ) that could be rewritten more directly. These issues, together with the metric deviations (high noun count, high SMOG, many complex and long words), mean the PLS does not yet meet the approval criteria.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Subheading format – Change \"Key messages\" to a question, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. Long, complex key‑message sentence – Original: \"We could not tell whether oral medicines (drugs taken by mouth that work throughout the whole body) improve dizziness (a spinning sensation), hearing loss, or ringing in the ears (tinnitus) because only a few small studies exist and the evidence is very uncertain; serious side‑effects were rarely reported.\" Rewrite: \"We could not determine whether oral medicines (drugs taken by mouth) improve dizziness, hearing loss, or ringing in the ears because only a few small studies exist and the evidence is very uncertain. Serious side‑effects were rarely reported.\"\n3. Jargon without simple definition – Replace \"systemic pharmacological interventions\" with \"medicines taken by mouth or injection that affect the whole body (systemic medicines)\" and use the simpler term thereafter.\n4. Noun‑ heavy sentence – Original: \"The review found that the evidence is very uncertain whether any of these systemic medicines improve the frequency or severity of vertigo attacks, hearing loss, tinnitus, or quality of life in Ménière’s disease.\" Rewrite: \"We are very uncertain whether these medicines reduce how often vertigo attacks happen, make them less severe, improve hearing, lessen tinnitus, or improve quality of life.\"\n5. Complex word reduction – Throughout the text, replace long or technical words (e.g., \"pharmacological\", \"systemic\", \"interventions\") with simpler alternatives (e.g., \"medicine\", \"whole‑body\"). This will lower the SMOG and noun counts.\n\nMetrics support: the draft shows high noun count (165 vs typical <116), high SMOG (13.8 vs typical <12.1), and many complex/long words (complex_words = 129, long_words = 193). Reducing noun density and simplifying vocabulary will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights five deviations: noun count, SMOG index, complex words (Dale‑Chall), total complex words, and the long words are all above the median, indicating the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words. Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 50, grade 10.8), but the identified deviations suggest the text would benefit from fewer nouns and simpler vocabulary to match typical PLS patterns."
