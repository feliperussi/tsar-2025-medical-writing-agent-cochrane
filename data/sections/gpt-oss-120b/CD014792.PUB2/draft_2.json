  "draft": "Is tube feeding (enteral nutrition) better than IV nutrition (parenteral nutrition) or regular eating after Whipple surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy) for adults?\n\nKey messages:\n- Feeding through a tube placed in the small intestine (jejunal tube) probably shortens hospital stay compared with IV nutrition, and it does not clearly change the risk of common complications such as pancreatic leaks, slow stomach emptying, or bleeding.\n- Feeding through a tube that goes through the nose into the small intestine (naso‑jejunal tube) shows little or no difference in hospital stay or complications when compared with IV nutrition, and compared with normal eating, jejunal tube feeding also shows little or no difference.\n- The evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and varied; we need larger, well‑designed trials that also look at cost and quality of life.\n\nWhat health problems can occur after a Whipple operation?\nA Whipple operation (pancreaticoduodenectomy) removes the head of the pancreas to treat cancer, benign tumours, or chronic pancreatitis. The surgery offers the best chance of long‑term survival but dramatically changes the digestive system. Many patients become malnourished after the operation because the procedure is extensive and complications are common. Maintaining good nutrition is therefore a major challenge. Patients can receive nutrition in three ways:\n- Oral feeding – drinking fluids that are gradually advanced to solid foods, sometimes as much as the patient wants (ad libitum).\n- Enteral feeding – delivering food directly into the small intestine through a tube placed either through the nose into the jejunum (naso‑jejunal tube) or surgically attached to the jejunum (jejunal tube).\n- Parenteral nutrition (PN) – providing all or part of the nutritional needs through an intravenous line, either a central line (total parenteral nutrition, TPN) or a peripheral line (supplemental PN).\nDoctors need clear evidence about which approach helps patients recover faster and reduces complications such as pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, bleeding, or a longer hospital stay.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the different postoperative nutrition strategies used after a Whipple operation. Specifically, we examined how oral feeding, jejunal tube feeding, naso‑jejunal tube feeding, and IV nutrition each affect the length of hospital stay, the occurrence of pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, bleeding, and overall mortality.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL) and trial registers from their start dates to October 2022. We looked for randomised controlled trials that compared postoperative nutrition routes or timing after a Whipple operation. Two reviewers independently screened studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used the GRADE system to judge the certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 17 randomised trials that enrolled 1,897 adults who had undergone a Whipple operation. The trials compared:\n- Enteral feeding through a jejunal tube, a naso‑jejunal tube, or a gastro‑jejunostomy.\n- Parenteral nutrition (total or supplemental).\n- Unrestricted oral intake.\nFour trials compared jejunal tube feeding with total parenteral nutrition. Pooled results suggest that jejunal tube feeding probably reduces hospital stay by about 1–2 days. The same trials show little or no difference in pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, or bleeding, but the evidence is uncertain.\nTwo trials compared naso‑jejunal feeding with total parenteral nutrition. The evidence indicates little or no difference in hospital stay, delayed gastric emptying, or bleeding. There may be a small increase in pancreatic fistula with IV nutrition, but confidence is low.\nTwo trials compared jejunal tube feeding with unrestricted oral intake. The evidence shows little or no difference in hospital stay or complications, and the certainty is very low.\nNo trial found a difference in death rates between any of the feeding methods.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in these findings because the studies involved small numbers of participants, used different feeding protocols, and often omitted details about follow‑up, funding, study locations, and participants’ ages or genders. The small sample sizes mean we cannot be sure about rare but serious complications.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised is current up to the October 2022 search date. New trials may have been published since then.\n",

This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement that all section headings be written as questions. Additionally, the draft contains several clarity problems that would confuse readers:\n1. **Non‑question subheading** – \"Key messages:\" does not follow the required question format. *Rewrite*: \"What are the key messages?\"\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"Four trials compared jejunal tube feeding with total parenteral nutrition. Pooled results suggest that jejunal tube feeding probably reduces hospital stay by about 1–2 days. The same trials show little or no difference in pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, or bleeding, but the evidence is uncertain.\" This three‑sentence block is hard to follow. *Rewrite*: \"Four trials compared jejunal tube feeding with total parenteral nutrition. We found that jejunal feeding probably shortens hospital stay by 1–2 days, while showing little or no difference in pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, or bleeding. However, the evidence is uncertain.\"\n3. **Passive voice** – \"The evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and varied; we need larger, well‑designed trials that also look at cost and quality of life.\" Passive construction obscures who is uncertain. *Rewrite*: \"We are uncertain about the evidence because the studies were small and varied; therefore we need larger, well‑designed trials that also examine cost and quality of life.\"\n4. **Nominalisation and noun‑heavy sentences** – many sentences rely on noun forms (e.g., \"assessment\", \"evaluation\", \"comparison\"), contributing to a high noun count (205, beyond typical PLS range) and a high nominalisation count (40, beyond typical range). Re‑writing these as active verbs improves readability. Example rewrite: change \"The review assessed the certainty of the evidence\" to \"We assessed how certain the evidence is.\"\n5. **Complex vocabulary** – the draft contains many long and complex words (257 long words, 172 complex words, SMOG index 16), far above typical PLS levels, making it harder for patients. Replace words like “unrestricted” with “free‑choice”, “parenteral” with “IV”, and simplify phrases.\nThese issues, together with the metric analysis (passive_voice = 20 → P90, nominalisation = 40 → BEYOND_P90, nouns = 205 → BEYOND_P90, smog_index = 16 → BEYOND_P90, complex_words = 172 → BEYOND_P90, long_words = 257 → BEYOND_P90), indicate the draft does not meet the required readability and style standards.",
