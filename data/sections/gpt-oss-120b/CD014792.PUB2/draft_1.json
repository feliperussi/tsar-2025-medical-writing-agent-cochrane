  "draft": "Is tube feeding (enteral nutrition) better than IV nutrition (parenteral nutrition) or regular eating after Whipple surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy) for adults?\n\n- After Whipple surgery (a major operation to remove the head of the pancreas), feeding through a tube placed into the small intestine (jejunal tube feeding) probably shortens the time spent in hospital compared with nutrition given through an IV (parenteral nutrition), and there is no clear evidence that it increases or reduces common complications such as pancreatic leaks (post‑operative pancreatic fistula), slow stomach emptying (delayed gastric emptying), or bleeding (post‑pancreatectomy haemorrhage); feeding through a tube passed through the nose into the small intestine (nasojejunal tube) shows little or no difference in hospital stay or complications when compared with IV nutrition, and compared with normal oral eating, jejunal tube feeding shows little or no difference in stay or complications, but the evidence is very uncertain and harmful effects were not clearly reported.\n- The overall confidence in these findings is low because the studies were small, varied in how they used the feeding methods, and provided limited information on serious complications; no difference in death rates was observed.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that compare the different feeding approaches after Whipple surgery, assess longer‑term recovery and complications, and consider factors such as cost and patient quality of life.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat health problems can occur after a Whipple operation?\nA pancreaticoduodenectomy, also called a Whipple procedure, is the main surgery used to remove the head of the pancreas when cancer, a benign tumour, or chronic pancreatitis is present. While the operation can give the best chance of long‑term survival, it also dramatically changes the way the digestive system works. After such a major operation many patients become malnourished because the surgery is extensive and complications are common. Maintaining good nutrition after the operation is therefore a big challenge. Patients can receive nutrition in three ways: • Oral feeding – drinking fluids that are gradually advanced to solid foods, sometimes as much as the patient wants (ad libitum). • Enteral feeding – delivering food directly into the small intestine through a tube placed either through the nose into the jejunum (nasojejunal tube) or surgically attached to the jejunum (jejunostomy). • Parenteral nutrition (PN) – providing all or part of the nutritional needs through an intravenous line, either a central line (total parenteral nutrition, TPN) or a peripheral line (supplemental PN). Because each method has its own risks and benefits, doctors need clear evidence about which approach helps patients recover faster and reduces complications such as pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, bleeding, or a longer hospital stay.\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe authors of the review wanted to compare the different postoperative nutrition strategies used after pancreaticoduodenectomy. They aimed to see how each method (oral, enteral via jejunostomy or nasojejunal tube, and parenteral nutrition) influences the rate of complications and the speed of recovery. Outcomes they looked at included length of hospital stay, occurrence of pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, bleeding, and overall mortality.\n\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched databases for randomized trials comparing postoperative nutrition routes or timing after pancreaticoduodenectomy, combined the results where possible, and assessed confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 17 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,897 adult patients who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy (major pancreatic surgery). The trials compared different ways of giving nutrition after surgery: enteral feeding through a jejunostomy tube, a naso‑jejunal tube or a gastro‑jejunostomy; parenteral (intravenous) nutrition, either total or supplemental; and unrestricted oral intake. Specific head‑to‑head comparisons reported were jejunostomy versus total parenteral nutrition, naso‑jejunal feeding versus total parenteral nutrition, and jejunostomy versus oral intake. The abstract does not give details on follow‑up length, funding sources, countries where the studies were done, or participants’ age or gender.\nMain results: Length of hospital stay\nEnteral feeding by jejunostomy probably shortens the hospital stay by about one to two days compared with total parenteral nutrition. Feeding through a naso‑jejunal tube may make little or no difference to the length of stay when compared with total parenteral nutrition, and jejunostomy feeding may also make little or no difference when compared with unrestricted oral intake. Overall, the evidence about how nutritional approaches affect the length of stay is modest and uncertain.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the nutrition, and because the studies were very small and there were not enough participants to be sure about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical style checks: several top‑level subheadings (Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency) are not phrased as questions, which the Master Style Guide requires. The opening bullet point is a single, 70‑word run‑on that packs multiple technical terms and findings, making it hard for a patient to follow. The text contains excessive passive constructions and noun‑heavy phrasing (28 passive verbs, 43 nominalisations, 230 nouns) which drive the readability scores far below typical PLS levels (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 28.9, FK‑grade 15.2). Paragraphs are long and lack clear breaks, reducing white‑space and readability.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – change headings to questions, e.g., replace \"Methods\" with \"How did we find the evidence?\"; \"Results\" with \"What did we find?\"; \"Limitations\" with \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"; \"Currency\" with \"How up to date is this review?\".\n2. **Opening bullet sentence** – split the long sentence and simplify jargon. Example rewrite: \"We found that feeding through a jejunal tube probably shortens hospital stay compared with IV nutrition. There is no clear evidence that tube feeding changes the risk of common complications such as pancreatic leaks, slow stomach emptying, or bleeding. Feeding through a naso‑jejunal tube shows little or no difference in stay or complications compared with IV nutrition, and compared with normal eating, jejunal tube feeding also shows little or no difference. However, the evidence is very uncertain and harms were not well reported.\"\n3. **Reduce passive voice and nominalisations** – rewrite sentences in active voice. Example: change \"The abstract does not give details on follow‑up length…\" to \"The abstract omits details about follow‑up length, funding sources, study locations, and participants’ age or gender.\"\n4. **Break up long paragraphs** – insert blank lines between distinct ideas, especially after each sub‑section and after the long background paragraph, to improve white‑space.\n5. **Simplify vocabulary** – replace complex words (e.g., \"unrestricted\" → \"free\", \"modestly\" → \"a little\") and use everyday terms where possible.\n\nThese changes address the most confusing structural and readability problems and bring the draft into alignment with the style guide and typical PLS readability metrics.",
