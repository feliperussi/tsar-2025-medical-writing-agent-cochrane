  "draft": "Are steroid medicines and new biologic drugs (lab‑made immune‑targeting proteins) effective for treating eosinophilic esophagitis (a chronic allergic inflammation of the esophagus)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Steroid medicines may improve symptoms a little and clearly reduce tissue inflammation; treating three people with steroids leads to one extra person achieving remission of inflammation, and they may cause fewer people to stop treatment because of side effects (high‑certainty evidence for inflammation, low‑certainty for symptoms and side‑effects).\n- Biologic drugs probably reduce tissue inflammation – treating two people with a biologic leads to one extra person achieving remission – but the benefit for symptoms is modest and uncertain, and stopping treatment because of side effects appears similar to placebo.\n- Both steroids and biologics have uncertain effects on what doctors see when they look inside the esophagus with a camera (endoscopic improvement), because studies used different measures and gave mixed results. More large, long‑term trials are needed to show who benefits most.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis and why does it matter?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic disease where a type of white‑blood cell called an eosinophil builds up in the lining of the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach). The excess eosinophils cause inflammation, leading to difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, chest pain, or vomiting. Doctors confirm EoE by taking a tiny piece of esophageal tissue (a biopsy) and counting eosinophils under a microscope; 15 or more eosinophils per high‑power field indicates disease. Because EoE does not go away on its own, people need long‑term treatment to avoid complications such as narrowing of the esophagus (strictures) and repeated food blockages.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well steroid medicines and biologic drugs work compared with placebo (no active drug) and how safe they are. Specifically, we examined whether the treatments improve symptoms, lower the eosinophil count in tissue (histological improvement), improve the visual appearance of the esophagus during an endoscopy (endoscopic improvement), and reduce the number of people who stop treatment because of adverse‑event side effects.\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?\nWe searched major bibliographic databases and identified 41 randomised controlled trials that enrolled a total of 3,253 participants with EoE. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled results for symptoms, tissue eosinophil counts, endoscopic findings and safety, and we rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\n**Steroid medicines**\n- Histological remission: Treating three people with steroids leads to one extra person achieving remission of tissue inflammation; this finding is supported by high‑certainty evidence.\n- Symptoms: About 20% more people report feeling better when they take steroids compared with placebo (low‑certainty evidence), which we describe as a small improvement.\n- Endoscopic appearance: Simple yes‑or‑no measures show little or no difference, while more detailed scoring suggests a possible large benefit (low certainty). Overall, the effect on what doctors see with a camera remains uncertain.\n- Side‑effect withdrawals: Steroids may slightly reduce the number of people who stop treatment because of side effects, but confidence in this result is low.\n\n**Biologic drugs of interest**\n- Histological remission: Treating two people with a biologic leads to one extra person achieving remission of tissue inflammation; this is supported by moderate‑certainty evidence.\n- Symptoms: Biologics may give a modest improvement in how patients feel, such as reduced difficulty swallowing (moderate certainty).\n- Endoscopic appearance: The evidence suggests little or no difference in what doctors see during an endoscopy, and the certainty is low.\n- Side‑effect withdrawals: Stopping treatment because of side effects appears similar to placebo, with low certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany trials were small, and some participants may have known which treatment they received, which can bias results. The studies varied in the types of patients, ages and ways the medicines were given. The evidence does not cover all patient groups or long‑term outcomes, so our confidence in the findings is limited.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nOur searches covered the literature up to March 2023, so the review reflects evidence available at that time.",

The most important issues are:\n1. **Overly long, dense sentence in the first key‑message bullet** – it packs three ideas, uses semicolons and technical phrasing, making it hard to follow.\n   *Problematic text*: \"Steroid medicines may improve symptoms a little and clearly reduce tissue inflammation; treating three people with steroids leads to one extra person achieving remission of inflammation, and they may cause fewer people to stop treatment because of side effects (high‑certainty evidence for inflammation, low‑certainty for symptoms and side‑effects).\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"Steroid medicines may give a small improvement in symptoms and clearly reduce tissue inflammation. Treating three people with steroids results in one extra person achieving remission. They may also reduce the number of people who stop treatment because of side effects. (We are very sure about the inflammation benefit, but less sure about symptoms and side‑effects.)\"\n2. **Unexplained jargon \"high‑certainty evidence\" / \"low‑certainty evidence\"** – patients are unlikely to understand what “certainty” means.\n   *Problematic text*: \"(high‑certainty evidence for inflammation, low‑certainty for symptoms and side‑effects)\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"(we have strong confidence that steroids reduce inflammation, but we are less confident about the effect on symptoms and side‑effects)\"\n3. **Sub‑heading not phrased as a question** – violates the Master Style Guide.\n   *Problematic heading*: \"**Biologic drugs of interest**\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"**What did we find about biologic drugs?**\"\n4. **Complex sentence about endoscopic improvement** – mixes cause and result, uses technical term without clear definition.\n   *Problematic text*: \"Both steroids and biologics have uncertain effects on what doctors see when they look inside the esophagus with a camera (endoscopic improvement), because studies used different measures and gave mixed results.\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"We are not sure how steroids or biologics change what doctors see during an endoscopy, because the studies measured this in different ways and gave mixed results.\"\n5. **Nominalised, noun‑heavy phrasing** – contributes to high reading grade and long sentences (e.g., \"The evidence does not cover all patient groups or long‑term outcomes, so our confidence in the findings is limited.\")\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"The studies did not include every type of patient or look at long‑term outcomes, so we cannot be very confident in the results.\"\nThese changes address the three priority clarity issues (long sentences, unexplained jargon, missing question‑style sub‑heading) and also reduce the high nominalisation and noun density highlighted by the metrics.\n\n**Metric support**: The evaluation shows a high words‑per‑sentence score (27.1, P90) and excessive nominalisations (38, BEYOND_P90) and nouns (219, BEYOND_P90), confirming that the draft is more complex than typical PLS texts. Reducing sentence length and noun‑heavy constructions will improve readability.",
