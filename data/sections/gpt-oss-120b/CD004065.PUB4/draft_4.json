  "draft": "Are steroid medicines and new biologic drugs (lab‑made immune‑targeting proteins) effective for treating eosinophilic esophagitis (a chronic allergic inflammation of the esophagus)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Steroid medicines may give a small improvement in symptoms and clearly reduce tissue inflammation. Treating three people with steroids leads to one extra person achieving remission of inflammation. We are very confident about the inflammation benefit, but less confident about the symptom benefit and about whether steroids reduce side‑effect withdrawals.\n- Biologic drugs probably reduce tissue inflammation – treating two people with a biologic leads to one extra person achieving remission. They may give a modest improvement in symptoms, but the evidence is less certain. Stopping treatment because of side effects appears similar to placebo.\n- We are not sure how steroids or biologics change what doctors see during an endoscopy, because the studies measured this in different ways and gave mixed results.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis and why does it matter?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic disease where a type of white‑blood cell called an eosinophil builds up in the lining of the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach). The excess eosinophils cause inflammation, leading to difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, chest pain, or vomiting. Doctors confirm EoE by taking a tiny piece of esophageal tissue (a biopsy) and counting eosinophils under a microscope; 15 or more eosinophils per high‑power field indicates disease. Because EoE does not go away on its own, people need long‑term treatment to avoid complications such as narrowing of the esophagus (strictures) and repeated food blockages.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well steroid medicines and biologic drugs work compared with placebo and how safe they are. Specifically, we looked at whether the treatments improve symptoms, lower the eosinophil count in tissue (histological improvement), improve the visual appearance of the esophagus during an endoscopy (endoscopic improvement), and reduce the number of people who stop treatment because of adverse‑event side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched major bibliographic databases for randomised controlled trials that compared these medicines with placebo. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled results for symptoms, tissue eosinophil counts, endoscopic findings and safety, and we rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 41 trials that enrolled a total of 3,253 participants with EoE. Most trials compared oral or topical corticosteroids with placebo, and a separate group compared biologic agents with placebo.\n\nSteroid medicines:\n- Histological remission: Treating three people with steroids results in one extra person achieving remission of tissue inflammation; the evidence is high certainty.\n- Symptoms: About 20% more people feel better on steroids than on placebo; the evidence is low certainty, which we describe as a small improvement.\n- Endoscopic appearance: Simple yes‑or‑no measures show little or no difference, while detailed scores suggest a possible benefit; overall the effect is uncertain.\n- Side‑effect withdrawals: Steroids may slightly reduce the number of people who stop treatment because of side effects, but confidence in this result is low.\n\nBiologic drugs:\n- Histological remission: Treating two people with a biologic leads to one extra person achieving remission; the evidence is moderate certainty.\n- Symptoms: Biologics may give a modest improvement in how patients feel, such as reduced difficulty swallowing; the evidence is moderate certainty.\n- Endoscopic appearance: The evidence suggests little or no difference in what doctors see during an endoscopy; certainty is low.\n- Side‑effect withdrawals: Stopping treatment because of side effects appears similar to placebo; certainty is low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany trials were small, and some participants may have known which treatment they received, which can bias results. The studies varied in the types of patients, ages and ways the medicines were given. The evidence does not cover all patient groups or long‑term outcomes, so we cannot be very confident in the findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nOur searches covered the literature up to March 2023, so the review reflects evidence available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the mandatory style check: the subheading \"Key messages:\" is not phrased as a question (the style guide requires all subheadings to be questions). This alone prevents approval. In addition, the text contains several clarity and readability problems that would confuse patients:\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Key messages:\" should be rewritten as a question, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. **Heavy noun‑heavy, nominalised language** – many sentences rely on abstract nouns (e.g., \"remission of inflammation\", \"histological improvement\"), making the text feel dense. Re‑write to use active verbs: \"Steroids reduce inflammation\" instead of \"remission of inflammation\".\n3. **Complex vocabulary** – words such as \"biologic agents\", \"histological\", \"endoscopic\" are not explained at first use, which can leave readers unsure. Replace with plain terms and add brief definitions: \"biologic drugs (lab‑made proteins that target the immune system)\", \"tissue inflammation (the number of eosinophils in the lining)\", \"what doctors see with a camera during an endoscopy\".\n4. **Long sentences** – some sentences exceed 30 words. Break them into shorter sentences for easier reading.\n5. **Passive constructions** – a few passive phrases reduce clarity. Rewrite actively, e.g., \"Our search covered studies up to March 2023\" instead of \"The evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search\".\nThese changes will also address the metric deviations (high nominalisation, noun count, SMOG index, and complex‑word counts) and improve overall readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall (61% of features in best quartile) but deviates markedly on six metrics: nominalisation (36 vs <13), noun count (219 vs <116), SMOG index (15.6 vs <12.1), and high counts of complex and long words. These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical PLS, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
