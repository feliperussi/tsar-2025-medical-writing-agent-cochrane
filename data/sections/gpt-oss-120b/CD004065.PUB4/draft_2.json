  "draft": "Are steroid medicines and new biologic drugs (lab‑made immune‑targeting proteins) effective for treating eosinophilic esophagitis (a chronic allergic inflammation of the esophagus)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Steroid medicines probably improve symptoms and clearly reduce tissue inflammation; they may also lower the chance of stopping treatment because of side effects. Biologic drugs probably reduce tissue inflammation, but the evidence for symptom relief is uncertain and side‑effect withdrawals appear similar to placebo.\n- Both steroids and biologics show uncertain effects on the visual appearance of the esophagus during endoscopy because studies used different measures and gave mixed results.\n- Future research should test larger, longer trials and identify which patients benefit most from steroids or biologics.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis and why does it matter?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic condition where the esophagus – the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach – becomes filled with eosinophils (a type of white‑blood cell). The excess eosinophils cause inflammation, leading to difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, chest pain, or vomiting. Doctors confirm EoE by taking a small tissue sample (a biopsy) and counting eosinophils under a microscope; 15 or more eosinophils per high‑power field indicates disease. Because EoE does not resolve on its own, people need long‑term treatment. Untreated disease can cause narrowing of the esophagus (strictures) and repeated food blockages.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well steroid medicines and biologic drugs work compared with placebo, and how safe they are. Specifically, we looked at whether these treatments improve symptoms, lower eosinophil counts in tissue (histological improvement), improve what doctors see during endoscopy (endoscopic improvement), and reduce withdrawals because of adverse events.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched major databases for randomised controlled trials that compared steroids or biologics with placebo in people with EoE. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled results for symptoms, tissue eosinophil counts, endoscopic findings and safety, and we rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 41 trials involving 3,253 participants. Most trials compared oral or topical steroids with placebo; a separate set compared biologic agents with placebo. Eleven trials enrolled only children, the rest included both children and adults. Most participants had active disease.\n\nWhat are the main results for steroids?\nSteroids probably produce a large increase in histological remission – about three people need treatment for one extra person to achieve remission – and the evidence is of high certainty. Steroids may give a small improvement in symptoms, but the certainty is low. Results for endoscopic improvement are mixed: simple yes‑or‑no measures show little or no difference, while more detailed scores suggest a possible large benefit (low certainty). Steroids might slightly reduce withdrawals because of side effects, but confidence is low.\n\nWhat are the main results for biologics?\nBiologics probably give a small improvement in symptoms (moderate certainty) and a large increase in histological remission – about two people need treatment for one extra person to achieve remission – (moderate certainty). Biologics probably make little or no difference to endoscopic appearance and to withdrawals because of side effects (both low certainty).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence because many trials were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies varied in populations and delivery methods. The evidence does not cover all patient groups or long‑term outcomes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe searches were current to March 2023.",

Additionally, the high counts of nominalisations (27) and nouns (193) indicate a noun‑heavy style that can be made more active and verb‑focused.\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Original: “Steroids probably produce a large increase in histological remission – about three people need treatment for one extra person to achieve remission – and the evidence is of high certainty.”\n  Rewrite: “Treating three people with steroids leads to one additional person achieving remission of tissue inflammation, and this finding is supported by high‑certainty evidence.”\n- Original: “Both: “Both steroids and biologics show uncertain effects on the visual appearance of the esophagus during endoscopy (endoscopic improvement, meaning changes seen with a camera inside the throat).”\n  Rewrite: “Both steroids and biologics have uncertain effects on what doctors see when they look inside the esophagus with a camera (endoscopic improvement).”\n- Original: “Biologics probably give a small improvement in symptoms (moderate certainty).”\n  Rewrite: “Biologics may lead to a modest improvement in how patients feel, such as reduced difficulty swallowing (moderate certainty).”\n- Original: “We searched major databases for randomised controlled trials …”\n  Rewrite: “We searched major databases and identified 41 randomised trials …”\nThese changes address the three major clarity problems and also reduce nominalisation, improving overall readability.\n\nMetrics support the need for these edits: the draft shows a high number of nominalisations (27, beyond typical PLS range) and a high noun count (193, beyond typical range), indicating a noun‑heavy style. The readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 42, FK‑grade 11.8) are at the median but could be simplified as suggested.",
