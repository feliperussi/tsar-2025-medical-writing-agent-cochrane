  "key_messages": [
    "Steroid medicines may lead to better clinical symptom improvement (feeling better) and a clear reduction in tissue inflammation (histological improvement, meaning fewer eosinophils seen under the microscope), and they might cause fewer people to stop treatment because of side effects (withdrawals due to adverse events, meaning stopping the drug because of problems); biologic drugs also appear to reduce tissue inflammation but the evidence for symptom relief is uncertain, and stopping treatment because of side effects seems similar to placebo, although overall the evidence is limited.",
    "Both steroids and biologics show uncertain effects on the visual appearance of the esophagus during an endoscopy (endoscopic improvement, meaning changes seen with a camera inside the throat), because the studies measured this outcome in different ways and did not provide consistent results.",
    "Future research should clarify long‑term benefits and harms, include larger and better‑designed trials, and identify which patients are most likely to benefit from steroids or biologic drugs."

      "subheading": "What is eosinophilic esophagitis and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic disease in which the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach (the esophagus) a type of white‑blood cell called an eosinophil builds up in the lining of the esophagus.  The excess eosinophils cause inflammation, leading to symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, chest pain, or vomiting.  Doctors confirm EoE by taking a tiny piece of esophageal tissue (a biopsy) and counting eosinophils under a microscope; finding 15 or more eosinophils per high‑power field is considered diagnostic (this is called a histologic finding).  Because the condition does not resolve on its own, treatment must be continued over many years.  Current medical options include topical corticosteroids (which reduce inflammation), biologic drugs that target specific immune pathways, and proton‑pump inhibitors (which lower stomach acid).  Untreated EoE can lead to strictures (narrowing) and repeated food impactions, so effective and safe therapies are needed."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to evaluate how well the available medicines for EoE work and how safe they are.  Specifically, it compared steroid treatments and biologic agents with placebo (no active drug) to determine whether they improve patients’ symptoms, lower the eosinophil count in esophageal tissue, improve endoscopic appearance (what doctors see with a camera inside the esophagus), and reduce the number of people who stop treatment because of adverse events.  By gathering data from all relevant randomised controlled trials, the authors aimed to provide a clear, evidence‑based picture of which medical options are most effective and tolerable for people living with eosinophilic esophagitis."

      "subheading": "What Did We Do?",
      "content": "We searched bibliographic databases for randomized trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatments) that compared medical therapies for eosinophilic esophagitis with placebo or other interventions. We pooled the results on symptoms, tissue eosinophil counts, endoscopic findings, and safety, and we assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 41 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 3,253 people with eosinophilic oesophagitis. Most trials compared oral or topical corticosteroids with placebo, and a separate group compared biologic agents with placebo, giving a total of 19 different treatment comparisons. Eleven trials involved only children, while the remaining studies included both children and adults. Only four trials recruited participants whose disease was inactive; the rest focused on active disease. The abstract did not give details about how long participants were followed, the length of treatment, the countries where the studies were carried out, or the sources of funding."

      "content": "Corticosteroids probably lead to a large increase in histological remission – about three people need to be treated for one extra person to achieve remission – and this is supported by high‑certainty evidence. They may give a small improvement in symptoms, but the evidence is uncertain, and the impact on the visual appearance of the oesophagus is mixed, with simple yes‑or‑no measures showing little or no difference and more detailed assessments suggesting a possible large benefit (low certainty). Corticosteroids might also slightly reduce the number of people who stop treatment because of side‑effects, but confidence in this is low.\\n\\nBiologic agents probably give a small improvement in symptoms (moderate certainty) and a large increase in histological remission – about two people need to be treated for one extra person to achieve remission – with moderate certainty. They probably make little or no difference to the endoscopic appearance of the oesophagus and to treatment discontinuation because of side‑effects, both with low certainty."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were very small, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we are interested in.",
