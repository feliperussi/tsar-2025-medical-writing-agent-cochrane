  "draft": "Are steroid medicines and new biologic drugs (lab‑made immune‑targeting proteins) effective for treating eosinophilic esophagitis (a chronic allergic inflammation of the esophagus)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Steroids probably reduce tissue inflammation and may make people feel a little better. They might also lower the chance of stopping treatment because of side‑effects.\n- Biologic drugs probably reduce tissue inflammation, but we are less sure they improve symptoms. Stopping treatment because of side‑effects appears similar to placebo.\n- Both treatments show uncertain effects on what doctors see with a camera during an endoscopy, because studies measured this in different ways.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis and why does it matter?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic disease where a type of white‑blood cell called an eosinophil builds up in the lining of the esophagus – the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. The excess eosinophils cause inflammation, leading to difficulty swallowing, food getting stuck, chest pain, or vomiting. Doctors confirm EoE by taking a tiny piece of tissue (a biopsy) and counting eosinophils under a microscope; 15 or more eosinophils per high‑power field indicates disease. Because EoE does not go away on its own, people need long‑term treatment to avoid complications such as narrowing of the esophagus (strictures) and repeated food blockages.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well steroid medicines and biologic drugs work compared with placebo and how safe they are. Specifically, we looked at whether the treatments improve symptoms, lower the eosinophil count in tissue (tissue inflammation), improve the visual appearance of the esophagus during an endoscopy (what doctors see with a camera), and reduce the number of people who stop treatment because of adverse‑event side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched major bibliographic databases for randomised controlled trials that compared these medicines with placebo. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled results for symptoms, tissue eosinophil counts, endoscopic findings and safety, and we rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 41 trials that enrolled a total of 3,253 participants with EoE. Most trials compared oral or topical corticosteroids (steroid medicines that reduce inflammation) with placebo, and a separate group compared biologic agents (lab‑made proteins that target the immune system) with placebo.\n\nSteroid medicines:\n- Tissue inflammation: Treating three people with steroids leads to one extra person achieving remission of inflammation. The evidence is high certainty.\n- Symptoms: About 20% more people feel better on steroids than on placebo. The evidence is low certainty, which we describe as a small improvement.\n- Endoscopic appearance: Simple yes‑or‑no measures show little or no difference, while detailed scores suggest a possible benefit. Overall the effect is uncertain.\n- Side‑effect withdrawals: Steroids may slightly reduce the number of people who stop treatment because of side effects, but confidence in this result is low.\n\nBiologic drugs:\n- Tissue inflammation: Treating two people with a biologic leads to one extra person achieving remission. The evidence is moderate certainty.\n- Symptoms: Biologics may give a modest improvement in how patients feel, such as reduced difficulty swallowing. The evidence is moderate certainty.\n- Endoscopic appearance: The evidence suggests little or no difference in what doctors see during an endoscopy. Certainty is low.\n- Side‑effect withdrawals: Stopping treatment because of side effects appears similar to placebo. Certainty is low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany trials were small, and some participants may have known which treatment they received, which can bias results. The studies varied in the types of patients, ages and ways the medicines were given. The evidence does not cover all patient groups or long‑term outcomes, so we cannot be very confident in the findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nOur searches covered the literature up to March 2023, so the review reflects evidence available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical factual‑accuracy check: it states that the symptom‑improvement evidence for biologic drugs is of \"moderate certainty,\" whereas the source shows low certainty for the dichotomous outcome and only moderate certainty for the continuous outcome – the statement should be qualified. In addition, the text contains several clarity and style: (1) excessive nominalisation (e.g., \"The evidence is high certainty\") makes sentences noun‑heavy; (2) some sentences are still long or compound, reducing readability (e.g., the bullet on endoscopic appearance); (3) passive‑voice constructions and vague phrasing appear in a few places; (4) inconsistent terminology (\"biologic drugs\" vs \"biologic agents\"). Suggested rewrites include converting nominalisations to verbs, shortening sentences, using active voice, and aligning the certainty wording with the source. These issues, together with the factual error, prevent approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (word count 670, sentences 34, active voice 74, pronouns 39). However, several metrics deviate strongly: nominalizations (34, BEYOND_P90), nouns (208, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (14.96, BEYOND_P90), complex words (143, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (281, BEYOND_P90) and long words (220, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many complex, long words, supporting the editorial recommendation to the author to reduce nominalisations and simplify vocabulary."
