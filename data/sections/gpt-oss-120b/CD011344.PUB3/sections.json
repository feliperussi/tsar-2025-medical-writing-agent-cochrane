  "key_messages": [
    "Automated mandatory bolus (AMB) dosing seems to give better pain control during labour than a continuous basal infusion (BI) by reducing the need for extra pain relief (breakthrough pain) and using less local anaesthetic (the medicine that numbs the area), and it does not appear to increase the risk of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, longer labour, or affect (no harmful effects were reported).",
    "Some studies reported that women felt more satisfied with AMB, although the results were not consistent across all trials and were not combined into a single analysis.",
    "Because the current evidence is limited in size and detail, especially regarding outcomes such as caesarean and instrumental deliveries and overall maternal satisfaction, larger and better‑designed studies are needed to confirm these findings and to explore any additional benefits or risks."

      "subheading": "What is epidural analgesia and why is it used during labour?",
      "content": "During labour many women experience very strong pain in the abdomen, pelvis and the area around the baby. An epidural is a common way to relieve this pain: a thin tube is placed in the space just outside the spinal cord (the \"epidural space\") and medicines that numb the nerves – called local anaesthetics – are given through the tube. Often a small amount of opioid, an opioid (a pain‑relieving drug), is added to make the relief even better. The goal is to keep the mother comfortable while allowing her to stay awake and active during birth.\n\nThe medicines can be given in two main ways. A basal infusion (BI) delivers a steady, continuous drip of drug. An automated mandatory bolus (AMB) gives a larger dose at set time intervals (for example, every hour), even if the mother has not asked for extra medication. Many women also have the option to give themselves an extra dose when they need more relief – this is called patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). Researchers want to know which delivery method gives the best pain control with the fewest side‑effects, such as the need for the obstetrician to step in because the pain \"breaks through\" the epidural, or problems that could affect the baby’s health."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to compare the two delivery methods – automated mandatory bolus versus basal infusion – for maintaining epidural pain relief in women who are at term (full‑term pregnancy). Specifically, they wanted to see whether one method the method reduced the number of times a woman experienced breakthrough pain that required an anaesthesiologist’s help, and whether it changed other important outcomes such as the rates of Caesarean section, the need for forceps or vacuum delivery, the total amount of local anaesthetic used, the length of labour, the mother’s satisfaction after birth, and the baby’s Apgar scores (a quick test of the newborn’s health). In short, the review aimed to find out which technique is safer and more effective for both mother and baby."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 18 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 4,590 women at term who received labour epidural analgesia. Thirteen trials recruited only healthy first‑time mothers, while the remaining five included both first‑time and experienced mothers; all excluded pre‑term or otherwise complicated pregnancies. Every trial compared an automated mandatory bolus (AMB) delivery regimen with a continuous basal infusion (BI) regimen for epidural medication. The way the epidural was started varied: seven studies used a combined spinal‑epidural (CSE) technique, ten used a standard epidural, and one used a dural puncture epidural (DPE). The local anaesthetic and opioid mixtures also differed across studies, including ropivacaine‑fentanyl, ropivacaine‑sufentanil, levobupivacaine‑sufentanil, levobupivacaine‑fentanyl, and bupivacaine‑fentanyl. Some protocols added patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) to the scheduled dosing."

      "subheading": "Main results: Need for extra pain relief",
      "content": "Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the need for extra pain relief during labour. For about every 100 women, roughly 20 may need extra pain relief with this method compared with about 30 with continuous infusion. It also probably reduces the amount of local anaesthetic used, by about 0.8 mg per hour. The method probably makes little to no difference to the chance of having a caesarean section, needing forceps or vacuum assistance, or the overall duration that the epidural works (a change of about nine minutes)."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies provided data for the outcomes we care about, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to December 2022 of search."
