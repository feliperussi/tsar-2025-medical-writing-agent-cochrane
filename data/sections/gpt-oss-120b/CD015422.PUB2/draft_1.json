  "draft": "Do skin‑applied insect repellents (topical repellents) reduce the risk of malaria?\n\nKey messages\n- Topical insect repellents applied to the skin may provide a small reduction in the chance of getting malaria, plain language, especially for people in high‑risk groups (people who are more likely to be exposed to malaria, such as refugees, forest workers, or military troops), but the overall evidence is limited and not strong enough to be certain.\n- The repellents were generally safe, with only very few mild skin reactions (minor irritation or redness) reported and no serious side‑effects.\n- More large, well‑designed studies (trials that are carefully planned and executed to give reliable results) are needed, particularly in settings where other malaria control tools are not used, to determine whether topical repellents can reliably protect individuals and to understand any broader effects on malaria transmission.\n\nINTRODUCTION/AIMS\nWhat is the problem with malaria and current prevention methods?\nMalaria is a disease spread by mosquitoes that bite people and can cause fever, chills, and sometimes death. The main ways we try to stop malaria are by using insect‑treated bed nets (called long‑lasting insecticide‑treated nets or LLINs) and by spraying the inside walls of homes with insecticide (known as indoor residual spraying or IRS). These tools work well when mosquitoes bite people while they are sleeping indoors. However, they do less to protect people who are outdoors at night, work in the forest workers, or live in places where the usual measures are not available, such as refugee camps or military bases. Because malaria can still be transmitted in these situations, scientists are looking for extra ways to protect people, and one idea is to use topical repellents – creams, lotions, or sprays that are applied to the skin to keep mosquitoes away.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about topical repellents?\nThe review authors set out to see whether applying topical repellents, either by themselves or together with bed nets and indoor spraying, can lower the number of new malaria infections. They wanted to know if these repellents help both people who are at high risk (such as refugees, forest workers, or soldiers) and people who are not considered high‑risk, living in areas where malaria is common. In addition, they looked at whether the repellents caused any side‑effects and how certain the evidence was.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched databases for studies that evaluated topical repellents, alone or with other malaria control measures, combined their results on malaria infection and clinical incidence, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard certainty criteria.\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nThe review identified eight trials (reported in thirteen articles) that evaluated topical mosquito‑repellent products for malaria prevention. Together, the trials enrolled more than 60,000 participants (61,651 individuals in the meta‑analysis). The studies included both high‑risk groups—such as refugees, forest goers, and deployed military personnel—and broader community populations. Participants used topical repellents either alone or together with existing vector‑control measures (e.g., long‑lasting insecticidal nets or indoor residual spraying). The comparators were no repellent or standard care. The abstract did not provide details on participants’ age, gender, disease severity, trial duration, study locations, or funding sources.\n\nMain results: Effect on malaria infection\nTopical repellents may reduce malaria infection and malaria episodes slightly, but the evidence is uncertain. The likely benefit is small: for every 100 people who use repellents, a few fewer may become infected compared with not using them. Skin irritation from repellents is uncommon.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nCURRENCY\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the required subheading format: several section headings (Key messages, INTRODUCTION/AIMS, METHODS, RESULTS, LIMITATIONS, CURRENCY) are not phrased as questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. Additionally, the text contains clarity and style issues that would hinder patient understanding:\n1. **Passive‑voice heavy** – e.g., \"The review identified eight trials…\" (passive). This obscures who did the action and contributes to the high passive_voice count (19, P90).\n2. **Long, dense sentences** – e.g., \"The main ways we try to stop malaria are by using insect‑treated bed nets…\" (27 words). Average words per sentence is 24.9 (P90), exceeding the typical PLS range.\n3. **Noun‑heavy, nominalised phrasing** – e.g., \"The abstract did not provide details on participants’ age, gender, disease severity…\" (many nouns, nominalisation count 21, P90).\n4. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – headings such as \"Key messages\" and \"Methods\" should be re‑phrased as questions (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\", \"How did we conduct the review?\").\n5. **Bullet list formatting** – the key messages use hyphens but the style guide prefers dashes (‑) and consistent bullet formatting.\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Change \"Key messages\" to \"What are the key messages?\" and list each point as a dash‑started bullet.\n- Rewrite passive sentence: \"We identified eight trials that evaluated topical mosquito‑repellent products…\"\n- Split long sentences: \"We use insect‑treated bed nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) to stop malaria. These tools work well when mosquitoes bite people while they are sleeping indoors.\"\n- Replace noun‑heavy phrasing: \"The abstract does not tell us participants’ age, gender, or where the studies took place.\"\n- Re‑phrase headings: \"How did we search for studies?\" for Methods; \"What did we find?\" for Results; \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" for Limitations; \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\" for Currency.\nThese changes address the most impactful clarity problems and bring the draft into alignment with the style guide. Metrics support the need: passive_voice = 19 (P90), words_per_sentence = 24.9 (P90), nominalization = 21 (P90), nouns = 197 (P90), complex_words = 148 (BEYOND_P90), long_words = 214 (BEYOND_P90).

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate overall conformity but several metrics deviate strongly from typical PLS patterns: words per sentence (24.9, P90), passive voice (19, P90), nominalizations (21, P90), noun count (197, P90), and high lexical complexity (complex_words 148, long_words 214, both BEYOND_P90). These indicate the draft is overly dense, noun‑heavy, and uses many passive constructions, which aligns with the identified clarity and style issues."
