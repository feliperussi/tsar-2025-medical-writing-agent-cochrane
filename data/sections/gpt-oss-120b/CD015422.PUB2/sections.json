  "key_messages": [
    "Topical insect repellents applied to the skin may provide a small reduction in the chance of getting malaria, especially for people in high‑risk groups (people who are more likely to be exposed to malaria, such as refugees, forest workers, or military troops), but the overall evidence is limited and not strong enough to be certain.",
    "The repellents were generally safe, with only very few mild skin reactions (minor irritation or redness) reported and no serious side‑effects.",
    "More large, well‑designed studies (trials that are carefully planned and executed to give reliable results) are needed, particularly in settings where other malaria control tools are not used, to determine whether topical repellents can reliably protect individuals and to understand any broader effects on malaria transmission."

      "subheading": "What is the problem with malaria and current prevention methods?",
      "content": "Malaria is a disease spread by mosquitoes that bite people and can cause fever, chills, and sometimes death. The main ways we try to stop malaria are by using insect‑treated bed nets (called long‑lasting insecticide‑treated nets or LLINs) and by spraying the inside walls of homes with insecticide (known as indoor residual spraying or IRS). These tools work well when mosquitoes bite people while they are sleeping indoors. However, they do less to protect people who are outdoors at night, work in the forest, or live in places where the usual measures are not available, such as refugee camps or military bases. Because malaria can still be transmitted in these situations, scientists are looking for extra ways to protect people, and one idea is to use topical repellents – creams, lotions, or sprays that are applied to the skin to keep mosquitoes away."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out about topical repellents?",
      "content": "The review authors set out to see whether applying topical repellents, either by themselves or together with bed nets and indoor spraying, can lower the number of new malaria infections. They wanted to know if these repellents help both people who are at high risk (such as refugees, forest workers, or soldiers) and people who are not considered high‑risk, living in areas where malaria is common. In addition, they looked at whether the repellents caused any side‑effects and how certain the evidence was."

      "subheading": "Methods",

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review identified eight trials (reported in thirteen articles) that evaluated topical mosquito‑repellent products for malaria prevention. Together, the trials enrolled more than 60,000 participants (61,651 individuals in the meta‑analysis). The studies included both high‑risk groups—such as refugees, forest goers, and deployed military personnel—and broader community populations. Participants used topical repellents either alone or together with existing vector‑control measures (e.g., long‑lasting insecticidal nets or indoor residual spraying). The comparators were no repellent or standard care. The abstract did not provide details on participants’ age, gender, disease severity, trial duration, study locations, or funding sources."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Effect on malaria infection",
      "content": "Topical repellents may reduce malaria infection and malaria episodes slightly, but the evidence is uncertain. The likely benefit is small: for every 100 people who use repellents, a few fewer may become infected compared with not using them. Skin irritation from repellents is uncommon."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search."
