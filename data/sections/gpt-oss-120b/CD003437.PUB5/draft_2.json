  "draft": "Is medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation (a gentle brain treatment), or talking therapy (psychological intervention) effective for treating depression after a stroke?\n\nWhat are the main messages?\n- Medication (drugs) and talking therapy each appear to lower the number of people who remain depressed after a stroke, while non‑invasive brain stimulation shows little or no benefit. Medication, however, is linked to more side‑effects affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal system (stomach and intestines).\n- Adding non‑invasive brain stimulation to medication may give a small extra reduction in depression, but the evidence is limited and uncertain, and no studies have examined the other possible combinations.\n- Because the evidence is sparse and uncertain, we need larger, high‑quality trials with longer follow‑up, especially for brain‑stimulation and combination approaches.\n\nWhy does post‑stroke depression matter?\nA stroke can damage brain tissue and cause physical problems, but it also often leads to lasting sadness, loss of interest, and low energy – known as post‑stroke depression. This condition is common, frequently goes unnoticed, and can slow recovery, make daily tasks harder, and lower overall quality of life.\n\nWhat treatments are used for depression after stroke?\nWe consider four main approaches: medication (drugs that aim to balance brain chemicals), non‑invasive brain stimulation (a painless device placed on the scalp that gently activates brain areas), talking therapy (counselling or cognitive‑behavioural therapy that helps people manage thoughts and feelings), and combinations of these methods.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether medication, brain‑stimulation devices, talking therapies, or any mix of them safely reduce depression after a stroke, and whether any of these options cause harmful side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched databases up to February 2022 for randomised controlled trials that compared these treatments. We pooled the results, calculated effect sizes, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 65 trials involving 5,831 participants with post‑stroke depression. Medication reduced the number of people who remained depressed (risk ratio 0.70) and also reduced inadequate response to treatment (risk ratio 0.47). Talking therapy also lowered depression rates (risk ratio 0.77). Non‑invasive brain stimulation alone showed little or no effect (risk ratio 0.67). Combining medication with brain stimulation gave a modest additional benefit (risk ratio 0.77) compared with medication alone, but the evidence is still uncertain. Medication was associated with more central nervous system side‑effects (risk ratio 1.55) and gastrointestinal side‑effects (risk ratio 1.62).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the findings because most studies were very small and the overall certainty of the evidence is low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence we summarised is up to date to February 2022.",
