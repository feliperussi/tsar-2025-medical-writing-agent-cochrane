  "draft": "Is medication, non‑invasive brain treatment, or talking therapy (psychological intervention), alone or combined, effective for treating depression after a stroke?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Medication (drugs) and psychological therapy (talking therapy) each appear to lower the number of people who remain depressed after a stroke, whereas non‑invasive brain stimulation (a gentle brain treatment) shows little or no benefit; however, medication is associated with more unwanted side effects affecting the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and the stomach and intestines (gastro‑intestinal system).\n- Combining medication with non‑invasive brain stimulation may provide some additional reduction in post‑stroke depression, but the evidence is still limited and uncertain, and no studies have evaluated the other possible combinations.\n- Because the current evidence is limited and uncertain, further high‑quality research with larger numbers of participants and longer follow‑up is needed to clarify the true benefits and harms of these treatments, especially for brain stimulation and combination approaches.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nWhat is depression after stroke and why does it matter?\nA stroke can damage brain tissue and leave people with physical challenges, but it can also cause lasting sadness, loss of interest, and low energy – a condition called post‑stroke depression. This type of depression is common, often goes unnoticed, and can slow recovery, make daily tasks harder, and reduce overall quality of life.\n\nWhat treatments are used for depression after stroke?\nSeveral approaches are tried: Pharmacological interventions are the medicines (antidepressants) that aim to balance brain chemicals; Non‑invasive brain stimulation uses a painless device placed on the scalp to gently activate brain areas (for example, transcranial magnetic stimulation) without surgery; Psychological therapy includes talking‑based methods such as counselling or cognitive‑behavioural therapy that help people manage thoughts and feelings; and Combination therapies mix two or more of these methods to see if they work better together.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether medicines, brain‑stimulation devices, talking therapies, or any mix of them safely reduce depression after a stroke, and whether any of these options cause harmful side effects.\n\nMETHODS\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared pharmacological, non‑invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapies, or their combinations for treating depression after a stroke. We pooled the results of these trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to treatments), calculated effect sizes, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 65 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 5,831 people who were experiencing depression after a stroke. The studies examined three main types of treatment – medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation, and psychological therapy – as well as several combination approaches (medication + brain stimulation, medication + psychological therapy, and brain stimulation + psychological therapy). Comparators included placebo, sham stimulation, usual care, or attention‑control groups. The abstract does not give details about trial duration, funding sources, participant ages or genders, or study locations. No trials were found for three specific combination comparisons, and no primary‑outcome data were reported for the brain‑stimulation‑plus‑psychological‑therapy combination.\n\nMain results: Medication plus brain stimulation\nThe review suggests that combining medication with non‑invasive brain stimulation may reduce depression after stroke, whereas the evidence is unclear for medication alone, brain stimulation alone, or psychological therapy alone. It is also uncertain whether medication increases side‑effects such as nervous system or gastrointestinal problems.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe are not confident in the evidence because studies were very small.\n\nCURRENCY\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",

This contradicts the evidence and misleads readers. • Because of these violations the PLS cannot be approved. (Metrics also show high readability scores and many nominalisations, indicating the text is more complex than typical PLS, but the primary reason for rejection is the structural and factual issues.)",

These indicate the text is longer, more noun‑heavy, and harder to read than usual PLS, reinforcing the need for shorter sentences, active voice, and fewer complex words."
