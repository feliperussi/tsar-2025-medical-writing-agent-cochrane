  "draft": "Does checking doctors' performance and giving them feedback (audit and feedback) improve how they practice?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Audit and feedback (measuring doctors' performance and then giving them the results) can lead to modest improvements in clinical practice, and no harmful effects were reported; the overall evidence is of moderate quality.\n- The improvement tends to be greater when feedback is provided to individual clinicians, includes comparison with top‑performing peers, involves a local champion, uses interactive formats, and offers clear action plans, while repeated feedback may lessen the benefit.\n- Further high‑quality research is needed to identify the most effective ways to design audit and feedback, especially in varied healthcare settings and over longer time periods, and to address remaining uncertainties such as the impact of repeated feedback and outcomes in low‑ and middle‑income countries.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is improving healthcare professionals’ everyday practice important?\nClinicians make routine decisions such as prescribing medicines or ordering tests. When these decisions do not follow the best evidence, patients can receive unnecessary or harmful care, and health systems incur extra costs. Improving everyday practice therefore makes care safer, more effective, and more efficient. One common strategy is audit and feedback, where a clinician’s own performance data (the audit) are collected and then shared back with them (the feedback) so they can see how their care compares with recommended standards or with high‑performing peers.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe review sought to determine whether audit and feedback actually changes professional behaviour (e.g., prescribing, test ordering) and to identify which features of audit‑and‑feedback programmes (such as individual versus group feedback, use of a local champion, interactive formats, or clear action plans) influence their effectiveness.\n\n**Methods**\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that evaluated audit and feedback interventions on healthcare professionals' practice, combined their results in meta‑analyses, and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 292 randomised trials (including cluster, cross‑over and factorial designs) that tested audit‑and‑feedback (A&F) interventions aimed at changing health‑professional practice. These trials contributed 678 intervention arms. Most studies were carried out in high‑income settings; only 26 (9 %) were in low‑ or middle‑income countries. The professional groups targeted were mainly physicians (237 studies, 81 %), with other clinicians also represented. No demographic details of the providers (age, gender) were reported. The A&F interventions varied in audit component (individual‑recipient versus team‑level data, number of performance indicators) and feedback component (modalities, use of local champions, peer‑benchmark comparisons) and were often combined with co‑interventions such as clinician education (present in 377 arms, 56 %) and reminders (100 arms, 15 %). Comparators were usually usual care or no feedback, with some trials testing specific feedback design elements. Funding sources for the individual trials were not described.\n\nMain results: Impact of audit and feedback on clinician practice\nAudit and feedback probably increases the proportion of clinicians who follow best practice slightly – about six more clinicians per hundred achieve the desired practice. The benefit appears a little larger when feedback is given as individual‑level data, compared with top‑performing peers, includes a local champion, uses interactive (both verbal and written) formats, and provides facilitation and clear action plans. Repeated delivery of feedback may reduce the benefit slightly.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2020 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical check: subheadings are not phrased as questions, which the Master Style Guide requires. Additionally, the text contains several clarity and style problems that would confuse readers. Key issues include: (1) subheadings such as \"Key messages\" and \"Methods\" are statements, not questions; (2) many long, noun‑heavy sentences (e.g., \"The review included 292 randomised trials (including cluster, cross‑over and factorial designs) that tested audit‑and‑feedback (A&F) interventions aimed at changing health‑professional practice.\") are difficult to follow; (3) passive constructions and technical jargon are used without clear definitions (e.g., \"audit and feedback (A&F)\" is introduced only later); (4) the draft uses a high number of complex and long words, contributing to a SMOG index of 14.5 and a Dale‑Chall score beyond the typical range; (5) bullet points are correctly introduced with dashes, but the overall structure would benefit from more question‑style headings and shorter paragraphs. These issues are reflected in the metrics: passive_voice = 19 (P90), nouns = 195 (P90), complex_words = 154 (BEYOND_P90), long_words = 228 (BEYOND_P90). To meet the guidelines, the draft needs revised subheadings, shorter active sentences, simpler vocabulary, and clearer explanations of technical terms.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (643 words) and has a moderate overall conformity. However, several metrics deviate strongly from typical PLS patterns: passive_voice (19, P90), nouns (195, P90), SMOG index (14.5, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.73, BEYOND_P90), complex_words_dc (316, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (154, BEYOND_P90), and long_words (228, BEYOND_P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy phrasing, and high lexical complexity, which align with the identified clarity and style issues."
