  "plain_title": "Do counseling (psychosocial) and medication help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Brief counselling (short, structured support sessions) may increase the chance that pregnant women stop drinking completely during pregnancy, but the evidence is limited and uncertain; no studies examined medication and no information on side‑effects was reported.",
    "The same counselling did not show clear evidence of reducing the amount of alcohol among women who continue to drink, nor did it affect how many women stayed in the programme.",
    "More high‑quality research is needed, especially studies that test safe medications, monitor any harms, use consistent measures of alcohol use, and include women with different levels of alcohol‑related problems."

      "subheading": "Why is drinking alcohol during pregnancy a health problem?",
      "content": "Alcohol can cross the placenta and reach the developing baby, increasing the risk of birth defects, poor growth, and lifelong learning or behavioural difficulties. Despite these known harms, many pregnant women still drink. About 10 % of pregnant women worldwide – and up to one in four in some European countries – report drinking alcohol."

    {
      "subheading": "What ways are there to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking?",
      "content": "The main approaches studied are psychosocial interventions – short counselling or support sessions that give advice, motivation and strategies to change drinking habits. These are usually brief, lasting from 10 to 60 minutes, and may be delivered once or a few times during early pregnancy. Medicines that treat alcohol‑use disorder (AUD, a condition where a person cannot control their drinking) are used in the general population, but no trials have tested any medication in pregnant women."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review aimed to find out whether psychosocial interventions, and any medications, are effective at helping pregnant women stop drinking or reduce the amount they drink. Specifically, the authors looked at whether these approaches increase continuous abstinence (staying completely alcohol‑free), lower the number of drinks per day, improve completion of treatment programmes, and affect safety outcomes."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at eight randomised trials that together included 1,369 pregnant women. Six trials were done in the United States, one in Spain and one in the Netherlands. All trials tested brief psychosocial programmes – from a single 10‑ to 60‑minute session up to five 10‑minute sessions – given around the end of the first trimester, and the women were checked again 8 to 24 weeks later. The comparison groups received usual care, such as a thorough alcohol‑use assessment and advice to stop drinking. All participants had reported drinking alcohol while pregnant; in one study almost half had a current alcohol‑use disorder and in another 40 % had a lifetime diagnosis. The abstract gave no details about the women’s ages or other demographics, and it did not mention any funding sources. No medication trials were found."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Alcohol abstinence",
      "content": "Brief psychosocial programmes probably increase the chance that pregnant women stay completely abstinent from alcohol. About 34 more women per 100 who receive the programme remain abstinent compared with usual care. We do not know whether these programmes change the average number of drinks a day, and they probably make little or no difference to whether pregnant women complete treatment."

  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2024 of search."
