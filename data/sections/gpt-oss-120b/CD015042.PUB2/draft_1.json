  "draft": "Do counseling (psychosocial) and medication help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol?\n\nKey messages:\n- Brief counselling (short, structured support sessions) may increase the chance that pregnant women stop drinking completely during pregnancy, but the evidence is limited and uncertain; no studies examined medication and no information on side‑effects was reported.\n- The same counselling did not show clear evidence of reducing the amount of alcohol among women who continue to drink, nor did it affect how many women stayed in the programme.\n- More high‑quality research is needed, especially studies that test safe medications, monitor any harms, use consistent measures of alcohol use, and include women with different levels of alcohol‑related problems.\n\nIntroduction\nWhy is drinking alcohol during pregnancy a health problem?\nAlcohol can cross the placenta and reach the developing baby, increasing the risk of birth defects, poor growth, and lifelong learning or behavioural difficulties. Despite these known harms, many pregnant women still drink. About 10 % of pregnant women worldwide – and up to one in four in some European countries – report drinking alcohol.\n\nWhat ways are there to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking?\nThe main approaches studied are psychosocial interventions – short counselling or support sessions that give advice, motivation and strategies to change drinking habits. These are usually brief, lasting from 10 to 60 minutes, and may be delivered once or a few times during early pregnancy. Medicines that treat alcohol‑use disorder (AUD, a condition where a person cannot control their drinking) are used in the general population, but no trials have tested any medication in pregnant women.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review aimed to find out whether psychosocial interventions, and any medications, are effective at helping pregnant women stop drinking or reduce the amount they drink. Specifically, the authors looked at whether these approaches increase continuous abstinence (staying completely alcohol‑free), lower the number of drinks per day, improve completion of treatment programmes, and affect safety outcomes.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that evaluated psychosocial or medication approaches to help pregnant women stop or reduce alcohol use, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at eight randomised trials that together included 1,369 pregnant women. Six trials were done in the United States, one in Spain and one in the Netherlands. All trials tested brief psychosocial programmes – from a single 10‑ to 60‑minute session up to five 10‑minute sessions – given around the end of the first trimester, and the women were checked again 8 to 24 weeks later. The comparison groups received usual care, such as a thorough alcohol‑use assessment and advice to stop drinking. All participants had reported drinking alcohol while pregnant; in one study almost half had a current alcohol‑use disorder and in another 40 % had a lifetime diagnosis. The abstract gave no details about the women’s ages or other demographics, and it did not mention any funding sources. No medication trials were found.\n\nMain results: Alcohol abstinence\nBrief psychosocial programmes probably increase the chance that pregnant women stay completely abstinent from alcohol. About 34 more women per 100 who receive the programme remain abstinent compared with usual care. We do not know whether these programmes change the average number of drinks a day, and they probably make little or no difference to whether pregnant women complete treatment.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024 of search.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails to meet the mandatory style rule that **all subheadings must be phrased as questions**. Headings such as \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are statements, not questions, and therefore the critical check 2 is not satisfied. In addition, the draft contains several clarity and style problems that would confuse readers:\n\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Methods\".\n   - Problem: Readers expect a question that tells them what the section will answer.\n   - Rewrite: Change to \"**How did we find the evidence?**\".\n\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"All trials tested brief psychosocial programmes – from a single 10‑ to 60‑minute session up to five 10‑minute sessions – given around the end of the first trimester, and the women were checked again 8 to 24 weeks later.\"\n   - Problem: Over 30 words; mixes several ideas, making it hard to follow.\n   - Rewrite: \"All trials tested brief counselling programmes. These ranged from a single 10‑ to 60‑minute session to five 10‑minute sessions. The programmes were delivered around the end of 12 weeks of pregnancy, and we checked the women again 8 to 24 weeks later.\"\n\n3. **Excessive nominalisation / noun‑heavy phrasing** – \"The abstract gave no details about the women’s ages or other demographics, and it did not mention any funding sources.\"\n   - Problem: Uses abstract nouns that increase reading difficulty.\n   - Rewrite: \"The authors did not report the women’s ages, other demographics, or the study’s funding sources.\"\n\n4. **Technical jargon without definition** – \"psychosocial interventions\" appears many times without a simple explanation.\n   - Problem: Readers may not know what \"psychosocial\" means.\n   - Rewrite: First mention: \"short counselling or support sessions (called psychosocial interventions)\" and then use the simpler term \"counselling\" thereafter.\n\n5. **Passive voice** – \"The evidence is up to date to January 2024 of search.\"\n   - Problem: Passive construction obscures who performed the action.\n   - Rewrite: \"We searched the literature up to January 2024, so the evidence is current.\"\n\nMetric support: The PLS evaluation shows several deviations from typical PLS patterns that align with the issues above: nominalisations (26, P90), total nouns (171, P90), SMOG index (13.8, P90), complex words (116, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (253, P90) and long words (196, P90). These high counts explain why the text feels noun‑heavy and difficult to read. Reducing nominalisations and long words, and converting passive constructions to active voice, will bring the draft closer to the median ranges. To achieve approval, rewrite all section headings as questions, split long sentences, replace nominalisations with active verbs, simplify jargon, and convert passive statements to active voice.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but shows moderate overall conformity. Several metrics are in the P90 range (nominalisation, nouns, SMOG, complex words, long words), indicating higher than typical noun‑ and word‑complexity for PLS texts. Words per sentence (22.46) and passive voice (16) are within the P75 range, but the high noun and complexity scores support the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
