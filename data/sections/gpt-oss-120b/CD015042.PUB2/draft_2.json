  "draft": "Do counseling (psychosocial) and medication help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol?\n\nKey messages:\n- Brief counselling (short, structured support sessions) may increase the chance that pregnant women stop drinking completely, but the evidence is limited and uncertain; no studies examined medication and no side‑effects were reported.\n- The same counselling did not show clear evidence of reducing the amount of alcohol among women who continue to drink, nor did it affect how many women stayed in the programme.\n- More high‑quality research is needed, especially studies that test safe medications, monitor any harms, use consistent measures of alcohol use, and include women with different levels of alcohol‑related problems.\n\nWhy is drinking alcohol during pregnancy a health problem?\nAlcohol can cross the placenta and reach the developing baby. This raises the risk of birth defects, poor growth, and lifelong learning or behavioural difficulties. Despite these harms, many pregnant women still drink. About 10 % of pregnant women worldwide – and up to one in four in some European countries – report drinking alcohol.\n\nWhat ways are there to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking?\nThe main approaches studied are short counselling or support sessions (called psychosocial interventions). These give advice, motivation and strategies to change drinking habits. Sessions are usually brief, lasting from 10 to 60 minutes, and may be delivered once or a few times during early pregnancy. Medicines that treat alcohol‑use disorder (AUD, a condition where a person cannot control their drinking) are used in the general population, but no trials have tested any medication in pregnant women.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether psychosocial interventions, and any medications, help pregnant women stop drinking or reduce the amount they drink. Specifically, we looked at whether these approaches increase continuous abstinence (staying completely alcohol‑free), lower the number of drinks per day, improve completion of treatment programmes, and affect safety outcomes.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to January 2024 across multiple databases and trial registries. We included randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial or medication approaches with usual care, placebo or no intervention. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight trials involving 1,369 pregnant women. Six trials were conducted in the United States, one in Spain and one in the Netherlands. All trials tested brief counselling programmes. These ranged from a single 10‑ to 60‑minute session to five 10‑minute sessions. The programmes were delivered around the end of the first trimester, and we checked the women again 8 to 24 weeks later. The comparison groups received usual care, such as a thorough alcohol‑use assessment and advice to stop drinking. All participants had reported drinking alcohol while pregnant; in one study almost half had a current AUD and in another 40 % had a lifetime AUD. The authors did not report the women’s ages, other demographics, or the study’s funding sources. No medication trials were found.\n\nWhat are the main results for alcohol abstinence?\nBrief counselling probably increases the chance that pregnant women stay completely abstinent from alcohol. About 34 more women per 100 who receive the programme remain abstinent compared with usual care. We do not know whether these programmes change the average number of drinks per day, and they probably make little or no difference to whether pregnant women complete treatment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants likely knew which treatment they received, and the studies were very small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to January 2024, so the evidence is current.",

Reducing nominalisations and simplifying sentences, as suggested above, will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within word limit and has good active voice and pronoun use, but deviates on several complexity metrics: nominalisation, noun count, SMOG, complex words (both Dale‑Chall and general), and long words are all above the median (P90 range). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many complex words than typical PLS, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
