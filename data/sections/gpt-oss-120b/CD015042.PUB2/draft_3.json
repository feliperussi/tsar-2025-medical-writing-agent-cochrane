  "draft": "Do counseling (psychosocial) and medication help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol?\n\nKey messages:\n- Brief counselling (short, structured support sessions) may increase the chance that pregnant women remain completely abstinent from alcohol, but the evidence is limited and uncertain; no medication trials were found and the studies did not report information on side‑effects.\n- The same counselling did not show clear evidence of reducing the amount of alcohol among women who continue to drink, and it probably makes little or no difference to whether women stay in the programme.\n- More high‑quality research is needed, especially studies that test safe medications, monitor any harms, use consistent measures of alcohol use, and include women with different levels of alcohol‑related problems.\n\nWhy is drinking alcohol during pregnancy a health problem?\nAlcohol can cross the placenta and reach the developing baby. This raises the risk of birth defects, poor growth, and lifelong learning or behavioural difficulties. Despite these harms, many pregnant women still drink. About 10 % of pregnant women worldwide – and up to one in four in some European countries – report drinking alcohol.\n\nWhat ways are there to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking?\nThe main approaches studied are psychosocial interventions – short counselling or support sessions that give advice, motivation and strategies to change drinking habits. These sessions are usually brief, lasting from 10 to 60 minutes, and may be delivered once or a few times during early pregnancy. Medicines that treat alcohol‑use disorder (AUD, a condition where a person cannot control their drinking) are used in the general population, but no trials have tested any medication in pregnant women.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether psychosocial interventions, and any medications, help pregnant women stop drinking or reduce the amount they drink. Specifically, we looked at whether these approaches increase continuous abstinence (staying completely alcohol‑free), lower the number of drinks per day, improve completion of treatment programmes, and affect safety outcomes.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched studies published up to January 2024. We included randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial or medication approaches with usual care, placebo or no intervention. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at eight randomised trials that together included 1,369 pregnant women. Six trials were done in the United States, one in Spain and one in the Netherlands. All trials tested brief psychosocial programmes – from a single 10‑ to 60‑minute session up to five 10‑minute sessions – given around the end of the first trimester. We checked the women again 8 to 24 weeks later. The comparison groups received usual care, such as a thorough alcohol‑use assessment and advice to stop drinking. All participants had reported drinking alcohol while pregnant; in one study almost half had a current alcohol‑use disorder and in another 40 % had a lifetime diagnosis. The studies did not provide information about the women’s ages, other demographics, or funding sources. No medication trials were found.\n\nMain results: alcohol abstinence\nBrief psychosocial programmes probably increase the chance that pregnant women stay completely abstinent from alcohol. About 34 more women per 100 who receive the programme remain abstinent compared with usual care. We do not know whether these programmes change the average number of drinks per day. They probably make little or no difference to whether pregnant women complete treatment. The studies did not assess adverse events, so we have no information on side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants likely knew which treatment they received, and the studies were very small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched studies published up to January 2024, so the evidence is up to date.",

      "feedback": "The draft is missing a required subheading phrased as a question: \"Main results: alcohol abstinence\" should be re‑worded as a question (e.g., \"What were the main results for alcohol abstinence?\"). This violates the Master Style Guide (5.3 Structure). Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers: (1) a 38‑word sentence about the intervention duration is hard to follow; (2) passive constructions such as \"The studies did not provide information…\" obscure who did what; (3) the term \"continuous abstinence\" is used without definition, leaving readers unsure of its meaning. Suggested rewrites are provided below. Metrics support these observations: passive_voice count is 17 (P75, higher than typical), nominalization 31 (beyond P90), and long sentence length contributes to a high smog_index (14.3, P90). Reducing passive voice, nominalizations, and long sentences will improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits and has good readability scores (Flesch Reading Ease 53, words per sentence 17.6). However, several metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: passive_voice (17, P75), nominalization (31, beyond P90), nouns (177, P90), smog_index (14.3, P90), complex_words (130, P90), and long_words (203, P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy, uses many complex words, and contains many passive constructions, which can hinder plain‑language clarity. Reducing these will improve the plain‑language quality."
