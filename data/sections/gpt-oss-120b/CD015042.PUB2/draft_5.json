  "draft": "Do counselling (psychosocial) and medication help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking alcohol?\n\nKey messages:\n- Brief counselling sessions (short counselling sessions that give advice and support) may increase the chance that pregnant women stop drinking completely, but the evidence is limited and uncertain; no medication trials were found and side‑effects were not reported.\n- The same counselling did not show clear evidence of reducing the amount of alcohol among women who continue to drink, nor did it affect how many women stayed in the programme.\n- More high‑quality research is needed, especially studies that test safe medications, monitor any harms, use consistent measures of alcohol use, and include women with different levels of alcohol‑related problems.\n\nWhy is drinking alcohol during pregnancy a health problem?\nAlcohol crosses the placenta and reaches the developing baby. This raises the risk of birth defects, poor growth, and lifelong learning or behavioural difficulties. Despite these harms, many pregnant women still drink. About 10 % of pregnant women worldwide – and up to one in four in some European countries – report drinking alcohol.\n\nWhat ways are there to help pregnant women stop or reduce drinking?\nThe main approaches studied are psychosocial interventions – short counselling or support sessions that give advice, motivation and strategies to change drinking habits. These sessions are usually brief, lasting from 10 to 60 minutes, and may be delivered once or a few times during early pregnancy. Medicines that treat alcohol‑use disorder (AUD, a condition where a person cannot control their drinking) are used in the general population, but no trials have tested any medication in pregnant women.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether psychosocial interventions, and any medications, help pregnant women stop drinking or reduce the amount they drink. Specifically, we looked at whether these approaches increase continuous abstinence (staying completely alcohol‑free), lower the number of drinks per day, improve completion of treatment programmes, and affect safety outcomes.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials published up to January 2024 that compared psychosocial or medication approaches with usual care, placebo or no intervention. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight trials that together included 1,369 pregnant women. Six trials were done in the United States, one in Spain and one in the Netherlands. All trials tested brief counselling sessions – either a single session lasting 10 to 60 minutes or up to five 10‑minute sessions. The programmes were delivered around the end of the first trimester, and the women were followed up 8 to 24 weeks later. The comparison groups received usual care, such as a thorough alcohol‑use assessment and advice to stop drinking. All participants had reported drinking alcohol while pregnant; in one study almost half had a current AUD and in another 40 % had a lifetime AUD. No medication trials were found.\n\nMain results: Alcohol abstinence\nBrief counselling sessions probably increase the chance that pregnant women stay completely abstinent from alcohol. Roughly 34 out of every 100 women who received the counselling stayed completely abstinent, compared with about 0 out of 100 who received usual care. We do not know whether these sessions change the average number of drinks per day, and they probably make little or no difference to whether pregnant women complete treatment. The studies did not assess adverse events, so we have no information on side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants likely knew which treatment they received, and the studies were very small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched studies published up to January 2024, so the evidence is up to date.",

These metric deviations support the need to reduce nominalisations, simplify vocabulary, and increase active voice."
