  "draft": "Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to remove the gel inside the eye) better than other positions for people with macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (a retinal tear that pulls the central part of the retina away)?\n\nKey messages\n- Lying face‑down right after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to remove the gel inside the eye) for a macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (a tear that pulls the central part of the retina away) may lower the chance of retinal displacement (a shift of the retina that can cause visual distortion) and may reduce some eye complications such as outer retinal folds (wrinkles in the back layer of the eye) and double vision with both eyes (binocular diplopia), but it may increase the risk of higher pressure inside the eye (elevated intraocular pressure); the evidence for these effects is limited and uncertain.\n- The available studies did not show a clear difference in how well vision improves (best‑corrected visual acuity, a measure of sharpness of vision with the optimal glasses or contacts) or in patients’ reported visual distortion and overall well‑being (quality of life, how patients feel about their daily activities), when face‑down positioning is compared with other positions, and the certainty of this information is also low.\n- Because the current evidence comes from a small number of trials with methodological limitations, more well‑designed, larger studies are needed to determine the true benefits and harms of face‑down positioning after this eye surgery, including longer‑term outcomes and patients’ preferences.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhat is a macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and how is it treated?\nA rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is an eye emergency where a tear lets fluid slip behind the retina, causing it to pull away from the back of the eye. When the detachment includes the macula – the tiny central area of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision – a person can lose the ability to read, recognise faces, or drive. The usual surgery to repair this problem is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In PPV the surgeon removes the cloudy gel (vitreous) from the eye and replaces it with a gas bubble (gas tamponade) that presses the retina back into place while it heals. Some surgeons ask patients to stay face‑down after the operation, believing that gravity helps keep the retina correctly positioned and may prevent it from shifting later.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe review wanted to know whether face‑down positioning after PPV with a gas tamponade actually reduces retinal displacement – a shift of the retina after surgery that can cause visual distortions such as metamorphopsia (objects appearing wavy or bent) and binocular diplopia (double vision when both eyes are used). It examined randomised trials that compared face‑down positioning with other post‑surgical positions to see if the face‑down approach improves visual outcomes and whether it introduces any extra side‑effects.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared face‑down positioning after pars plana vitrectomy with other post‑operative positions for macula‑involving retinal detachments, combined their findings, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWe looked at three randomised trials that together included 368 people (369 eyes) who had pars plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade for a primary macula‑involving retinal detachment. Most participants were men (68‑72 %). The studies compared immediate face‑down positioning after surgery with other post‑operative positions, most often a support‑the‑break or face‑up position, and one trial also examined positioning with or without perfluorocarbon liquid. Follow‑up lasted from three to six months. Only one trial disclosed its funding source; the others gave no location or funding details. The evidence was very uncertain: we do not know whether face‑down positioning after surgery reduces retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, double vision, or raised intra‑ocular pressure, nor whether it makes any difference to visual acuity, postoperative distortion or quality‑of‑life scores.\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident in the evidence because studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people we were interested in.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check on subheading format: all section headings (Key messages, Introduction/Aims, Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency) are not phrased as questions, which the Master Style Guide requires. Additionally, several clarity and style issues make the summary hard for patients to follow.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading phrasing** – Change each heading into a question. Example: replace \"Key messages\" with \"What are the main findings?\"; \"Introduction/Aims\" with \"What is a macula‑involving retinal detachment and why is it treated?\"; \"Methods\" with \"How did we find and assess the studies?\"; \"Results\" with \"What did the studies show?\"; \"Limitations\" with \"Why is the evidence uncertain?\"; \"Currency\" with \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n2. **Long sentences** – The sentence \"Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to remove the gel inside the eye) better than other positions for people with macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (a retinal tear that pulls the central part of the retina away)?\" is 31 words and dense. Rewrite as two shorter sentences: \"Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery that removes the gel inside the eye) better for people with macula‑involving retinal detachment? A retinal detachment is a tear that pulls the central part of the retina away.\"\n3. **Passive voice / noun‑heavy phrasing** – Example: \"The evidence was very uncertain: we do not know whether face‑down positioning after surgery reduces retinal displacement...\" can be made more active: \"We are very uncertain about the evidence because we do not know whether face‑down positioning after surgery reduces retinal displacement...\"\n4. **Jargon without definition** – The term \"support‑the‑break positioning\" appears without explanation. Add a brief definition: \"support‑the‑break positioning (where the patient rests with the eye upright to support the retinal break)\".\n5. **Bullet formatting** – Ensure bullet points start with a dash (‑) and have a blank line before the list. The current list under Key messages uses a dash but is embedded in a paragraph; separate it into its own list with line breaks.\n\nMetrics support: The PLS evaluation shows a very high words‑per‑sentence score (31.3, beyond the P90 range) and high nominalisation (27, beyond P90), indicating the need to shorten sentences and use more verbs. The readability indices (Flesch‑Kincaid grade 15.9, Gunning Fog 22.9) confirm the text is at a college‑level, far above the typical PLS range. Reducing sentence length and noun density will bring these metrics closer to the median and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft deviates from typical PLS patterns on 13 metrics. Notably, words_per_sentence (31.3) is beyond the P90 range, and readability scores (Flesch‑Kincaid grade 15.9, Gunning Fog 22.9, SMOG 15.3) are much higher than the usual PLS range, indicating excessive complexity. Nominalisation (27) and noun count (201) are also far above typical levels. While passive voice is low (good), the overall pattern suggests the text is too dense and needs shorter, more active sentences and fewer noun‑heavy constructions."
