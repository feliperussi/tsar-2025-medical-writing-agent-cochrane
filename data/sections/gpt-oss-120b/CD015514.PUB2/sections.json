  "key_messages": [
    "Lying face‑down right after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to remove the gel inside the eye) for a macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (a tear that pulls the central part of the retina away) may lower the chance of retinal displacement (a shift of the retina that can cause visual distortion) and may reduce some eye complications such as outer retinal folds (wrinkles in the back layer of the eye) and double vision with both eyes (binocular diplopia), but it may increase the risk of higher pressure inside the eye (elevelf intraocular pressure); the evidence for these effects is limited and uncertain.",
    "The available studies did not show a clear difference in how well vision improves (best‑corrected visual acuity, a measure of sharpness of vision with the optimal glasses or contacts) or in patients’ reported visual distortion and overall well‑being (quality of life, how patients feel about their daily activities), when face‑down positioning is compared with other positions, and the certainty of this information is also low.",
    "Because the current evidence comes from a small number of trials with methodological limitations, more well‑designed, larger studies are needed to determine the true benefits and harms of face‑down positioning after this eye surgery, including longer‑term outcomes and patients’ preferences."

      "subheading": "What is a macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and how is it treated?",
      "content": "A rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is an eye emergency where a tear lets fluid slip behind the retina, causing it to pull away from the back of the eye. When the detachment includes the macula – the tiny central area of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision – a person can lose the ability to read, recognise faces, or drive. The usual surgery to repair this problem is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In PPV the surgeon removes the cloudy gel (vitreous) from the eye and replaces it with a gas bubble (gas tamponade) that presses the retina back into place while it heals. Some surgeons ask patients to stay face‑down after the operation, believing that gravity helps keep the retina correctly positioned and may prevent it from shifting later."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review wanted to know whether face‑down positioning after PPV with a gas tamponade actually reduces retinal displacement – a shift of the retina after surgery that can cause visual distortions such as metamorphopsia (objects appearing wavy or bent) and binocular diplopia (double vision when both eyes are used). It examined randomised trials that compared face‑down positioning with other post‑surgical positions to see if the face‑down approach improves visual outcomes and whether it introduces any extra side‑effects."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at three randomised trials that together included 368 people (369 eyes) who had pars plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade for a primary macula‑involving retinal detachment. Most participants were men (68‑72 %). The studies compared immediate face‑down positioning after surgery with other post‑operative positions, most often a support‑the‑break or face‑up position, and one trial also examined positioning with or without perfluorocarbon liquid. Follow‑up lasted from three to six months. Only one trial disclosed its funding source; the others gave no location or funding details. The evidence was very uncertain: we do not know whether face‑down positioning after surgery reduces retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, double vision, or raised intra‑ocular pressure, nor whether it makes any difference to visual acuity, postoperative distortion or quality‑of‑life scores."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people we were interested in.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to November 2022 of search."
