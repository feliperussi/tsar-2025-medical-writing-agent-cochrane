  "draft": "Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery that removes the gel inside the eye) better than other positions for people with macula‑involving retinal detachment? A retinal detachment is a tear that pulls the central part of the retina away.\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n\n- Lying face‑down right after pars plana vitrectomy may lower the chance of retinal displacement (a shift of the retina that can cause visual distortion) and may reduce outer retinal folds (wrinkles in the back layer of the eye) and binocular diplopia (double vision when both eyes are used). However, it may increase the risk of elevated intra‑ocular pressure (higher pressure inside the eye). The evidence for these effects is limited and uncertain.\n- The studies did not show a clear difference in best‑corrected visual acuity (sharpness of vision with the best glasses or contacts) or in patients’ reported visual distortion and quality of life when face‑down positioning is compared with other positions. The certainty of this information is also low.\n- Because the evidence comes from a small number of trials with methodological limitations, we need larger, well‑designed studies to determine the true benefits and harms of face‑down positioning, including longer‑term outcomes and patient preferences.\n\nWhat is a macula‑involving retinal detachment and why is it treated?\nA rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is an eye emergency where a tear lets fluid slip behind the retina, pulling it away from the back of the eye. When the detachment includes the macula – the tiny central area responsible for sharp, detailed vision – a person can lose the ability to read, recognise faces, or drive. The usual repair is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In PPV the surgeon removes the cloudy gel (vitreous) and replaces it with a gas bubble (gas tamponade) that presses the retina back into place while it heals. Some surgeons ask patients to stay face‑down after the operation, believing that gravity helps keep the retina correctly positioned.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether face‑down positioning after PPV with gas tamponade reduces retinal displacement and improves visual outcomes, and whether it introduces any extra side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find and assess the studies?\nWe searched multiple databases up to November 2022 for randomised trials that compared face‑down positioning with other post‑operative positions after PPV for primary macula‑involving retinal detachment. We combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did the studies show?\nWe identified three trials involving 368 participants (369 eyes). The trials compared immediate face‑down positioning with other positions, most often support‑the‑break positioning (where the eye is kept upright to support the retinal break) or face‑up positioning. Follow‑up lasted three to six months. The evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether face‑down positioning reduces retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, binocular diplopia, or raised intra‑ocular pressure, nor whether it changes visual acuity, distortion scores, or quality‑of‑life scores.\n\nWhy is the evidence uncertain?\nThe trials were small and had methodological limitations, and the evidence does not cover all people with this condition.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to the November 2022 search.",

      "feedback": "The draft contains several critical clarity problems that would confuse readers and a few style issues that reduce readability. \n1. **Contradictory statements** – The bullet points say face‑down \"may lower the chance of retinal displacement\" and \"may increase the risk of elevated intra‑ocular pressure\", but the later paragraph says \"we do not know whether face‑down positioning reduces retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, binocular diplopia, or raised intra‑ocular pressure\". This inconsistency makes it unclear what the evidence actually suggests.\n2. **Unexplained jargon** – Terms such as \"pars plana vitrectomy\", \"outer retinal folds\", \"binocular diplopia\", \"best‑corrected visual acuity\" and \"quality of life\" appear without simple definitions at the point of first use, leaving patients unsure of their meaning.\n3. **Long, dense sentences** – Example: \"The evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether face‑down positioning after surgery reduces retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, double vision, or raised intra‑ocular pressure, nor whether it makes any difference to visual acuity, postoperative distortion or quality‑of‑life scores.\" This 38‑word sentence packs many concepts and can overwhelm a lay reader.\n4. **Missing explicit “Key messages” heading** – While the bullet list conveys the key messages, the style guide expects a separate section titled as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\") to match the required structure.\n5. **High nominalisation** – The draft contains 24 nominalisations (metric shows P90 deviation). Re‑phrasing noun‑heavy phrases into active verbs will improve flow (e.g., change \"the evidence is very uncertain\" to \"we are very uncertain about the evidence\").\n\n**Suggested rewrites**:\n- Replace the contradictory paragraph with a single clear statement: \"Very low‑certainty evidence suggests that face‑down positioning may reduce retinal displacement, outer retinal folds and double vision, but it may also increase the chance of higher eye pressure. Because the evidence is uncertain, we cannot be sure of these effects.\"\n- Define jargon at first mention: \"pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) – a type of eye surgery that removes the gel‑like vitreous and replaces it with a gas bubble\"; \"outer retinal folds – tiny wrinkles in the back layer of the eye\"; \"binocular diplopia – double vision when both eyes are used\"; \"best‑corrected visual acuity – the sharpness of vision when wearing the best glasses or contacts\".\n- Break the long sentence into two: \"We are very uncertain about the evidence. We do not know whether face‑down positioning reduces retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, double vision, or raised eye pressure, nor whether it improves visual sharpness, distortion or quality of life.\"\n- Add a clear “Key messages” heading phrased as a question: \"What are the key messages?\" and place the bullet list under it.\n- Reduce nominalisations: change \"The evidence is very uncertain\" to \"We are very uncertain about the evidence\"; change \"the trials involved predominantly male participants\" to \"most participants were men\".\n\n**Metric support**: The draft scores well on readability (Flesch Reading Ease 52, Grade 10) and active voice (61 instances, P75), but shows high nominalisation (24, P90) and elevated SMOG (13.7, P90) and Dale‑Chall (8.24, P90) scores, confirming the need to simplify language and reduce noun‑heavy constructions.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns for most metrics (e.g., words per sentence 19.18, passive voice 6, active voice 61, readability 52). However, five features deviate: nominalisation (24, P90), SMOG index (13.7, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.24, P90), complex words (137, P90) and complex Dale‑Chall words (248, P90). These indicate the text uses more complex nouns and words than typical PLS, supporting the recommendation to simplify language and reduce noun‑heavy phrasing."
