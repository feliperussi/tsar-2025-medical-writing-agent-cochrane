  "draft": "Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery that removes the gel inside the eye) better than other positions for people with macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (a retinal tear that pulls the central part of the retina away)?\n\nKey messages\n- Lying face‑down right after pars plana vitrectomy may lower the chance of the retina shifting, and may reduce some eye problems such as tiny wrinkles in the back layer of the eye (outer retinal folds) and double vision when both eyes are used (binocular diplopia). It may also raise the risk of higher eye pressure. The evidence for these effects is very limited and uncertain.\n- The studies we found did not show a clear difference in how sharp vision becomes (best‑corrected visual acuity) or in patients’ reports of visual distortion and overall well‑being (quality of life) when face‑down positioning is compared with other positions.\n- Because the evidence comes from only a few small trials with several limitations, we need larger, well‑designed studies to determine the true benefits and harms of face‑down positioning and to explore patients’ preferences.\n\nWhat is a macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and how is it treated?\nA rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is an eye emergency where a tear lets fluid slip behind the retina, pulling it away from the back of the eye. When the detachment includes the macula – the tiny central area of the retina that provides sharp, detailed vision – a person can lose the ability to read, recognise faces, or drive. The usual surgery to repair this problem is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In PPV the surgeon removes the cloudy gel (vitreous) from the eye and replaces it with a gas bubble (gas tamponade) that presses the retina back into place while it heals. Some surgeons ask patients to stay face‑down after the operation because they think gravity helps keep the retina correctly positioned.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether face‑down positioning after PPV with gas tamponade reduces retinal displacement – a shift of the retina that can cause visual distortion – and whether it improves visual outcomes or adds any side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find and assess the studies?\nWe searched several databases up to November 2022 for randomised trials that compared face‑down positioning with other post‑operative positions after PPV for primary macula‑involving retinal detachment. We combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three randomised trials that together included 368 participants (369 eyes). Most participants were men (68‑72 %). The trials compared immediate face‑down positioning with other positions, most often a support‑the‑break (eye kept upright) or face‑up position. Follow‑up lasted three to six months.\nVery low‑certainty evidence suggests that face‑down positioning may reduce retinal displacement, outer retinal folds and binocular diplopia. It may also increase the risk of higher eye pressure. The same evidence does not show a clear benefit for visual acuity, distortion scores or quality‑of‑life measures.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the trials were very small, had methodological limitations, and did not include all types of patients with this condition.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to the November 2022 search.",

Minor clarity improvements are recommended: (1) split the long first key‑message bullet into two shorter sentences; (2) define “support‑the‑break positioning” more clearly when first mentioned; (3) replace a passive construction (“The evidence is current to the November 2022 search”) with an active one; (4) reduce nominalised noun‑heavy phrasing (e.g., “The evidence is very uncertain” → “We are very uncertain about the evidence”); (5) integrate parenthetical definitions into the flow to lower complex‑word density. These edits will address the high nominalisation (23 instances, P90) and high complex‑word counts (complex_words = 137, complex_words_dc = 244, both P90) highlighted by the metrics, further improving readability without altering content.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows strong overall conformity (66.7% of features in best quartile). Readability scores are good (Flesch Reading Ease 54.35, Grade 10.65). However, four metrics deviate: nominalisation (23, P90), SMOG index (13.7, P90), complex words (137, P90) and Dale‑Chall complex words (244, P90). Reducing noun‑heavy phrasing and simplifying complex terms will bring these metrics closer to typical PLS ranges."
