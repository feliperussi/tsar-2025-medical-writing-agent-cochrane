  "draft": "Does organized (coordinated) care for adults with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) reduce death compared with usual care?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Organised (coordinated) care that brings together several types of health professionals (multidisciplinary care) probably lowers the chance of dying from any cause compared with the usual way care is delivered (usual care), and there is no evidence that it increases serious bleeding (major bleeding events) or stroke (a type of thromboembolic complication). The evidence is reasonably reliable but not without limitations.\n- Organised care also appears to reduce the number of people who need to be admitted to hospital for heart‑related problems (cardiovascular hospitalisation), while it does not seem to change overall hospital admissions (all‑cause hospitalisation) or the risk of stroke.\n- The existing studies have some limitations, such as unclear blinding (keeping participants and researchers unaware of group allocation) and a limited number of trials, so more well‑designed research—especially comparing different models like nurse‑led teams versus mobile‑health (using smartphones or other devices for care)—is needed to confirm these findings and to examine long‑term effects.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is atrial fibrillation a health problem that needs better care?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm disorder where the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly and often very fast. This can make the heart work less efficiently and raises the risk of serious problems such as stroke, heart failure, and death. The condition is becoming more common as people get older, and many adults with AF also have other health issues, making its management complex. Traditional \"usual care\" often involves a single doctor seeing the patient, but because AF requires careful monitoring, medication management, lifestyle advice, and sometimes procedures, a more coordinated approach may be needed. New models of care that bring together doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other specialists (multidisciplinary care) and that use digital tools like apps or remote monitoring (eHealth/mHealth) are being proposed to improve how patients with AF are treated.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about organised care for atrial fibrillation?\nThe review authors set out to compare organised clinical services – such as collaborative, multidisciplinary teams or virtual/e‑health programmes – with the standard \"usual care\" that patients typically receive. Their goal was to see whether these organised approaches could reduce the risk of death, hospital admissions, and other important outcomes for adults with any type of AF.\n\n**Methods**\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared organised, multidisciplinary or virtual clinical services for adults with atrial fibrillation to usual care, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included eight randomised controlled trials with a total of 8,205 adults who have atrial fibrillation. Participants were on average between 60 and 73 years old; the abstract did not report gender distribution or details of disease severity. The trials were carried out in three countries – China, the Netherlands and Australia. Two types of organised care were studied: a nurse‑led, multidisciplinary care model (four studies) and a mobile‑health (mHealth) virtual care model (two studies). All interventions were compared with usual care. Information on the length of follow‑up and on funding sources was not provided, and no study reported minor cerebrovascular events.\n\nMain results: Effect on overall death\nOrganised clinical services for atrial fibrillation probably cause a large reduction in overall death. For roughly every 100 people receiving this organised care, about three fewer will die over six years compared with usual care. Organised services probably make little or no difference to overall hospital admissions. In a group of 100 people, the number of admissions is likely to be almost the same as with usual care. Organised services may make little or no difference to deaths from cardiovascular causes. Organised services reduce hospital admissions for cardiovascular reasons; for about every 100 people, roughly four fewer will be admitted for heart‑related problems over six years. Organised services may make little or no difference to stroke or other clot‑related complications, and may make little or no difference to serious bleeding events in the brain.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search.",

Additionally, several clarity issues would confuse readers: (1) very long, convoluted sentences (e.g., the Limitations paragraph) make the text hard to follow; (2) excessive passive constructions and nominalisations obscure who did what (e.g., \"Organised clinical services probably cause a large reduction\" and \"The evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search\"); (3) noun‑heavy phrasing reduces readability (e.g., \"The review included eight randomised controlled trials with a total of 8,205 adults who have atrial fibrillation\"). These issues are reflected in the metrics – passive voice (34, BEYOND_P90), nominalisation (31, BEYOND_P90), nouns (218, BEYOND_P90), and high SMOG/complex‑word counts – indicating the text is more dense than typical PLS. Rewriting the subheadings as questions, shortening sentences, converting passive to active voice, and using more verbs instead of nouns will bring the summary in line with the Master Style Guide and improve patient‑readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 39, grade‑level ~13). However, it deviates strongly from typical PLS patterns in seven metrics: passive voice (34 instances, BEYOND_P90), nominalisation (31, BEYOND_P90), noun count (218, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15.8, BEYOND_P90), and high counts of complex and long words. These deviations suggest the text is overly dense and passive, which aligns with the identified clarity and style issues."
