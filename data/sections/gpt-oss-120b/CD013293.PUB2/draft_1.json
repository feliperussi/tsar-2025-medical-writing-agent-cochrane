  "draft": "Which treatment (surgery, clot‑removal, or clot‑dissolving) works best for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- We do not have clear evidence to show whether surgery, clot‑removal (thrombectomy – a procedure that removes a clot) or clot‑dissolving (thrombolysis – a treatment that uses medicine to dissolve a clot) works best for a blocked dialysis access (AVF – a direct artery‑to‑vein connection, or AVG – a tube that links an artery and a vein); the available studies did not demonstrate a consistent advantage for any approach, and information on unwanted side effects (adverse events) was limited.\n- Some small studies suggested that surgery might keep the access open a little longer (primary patency – the access staying open without another blockage) compared with mechanical clot‑removal, but because the research was limited and uncertain, this possible benefit cannot be relied upon.\n- Because most trials were small, had design problems, and did not report important outcomes such as death or long‑term access function, larger, well‑designed studies are needed to determine which method, if any, provides the best balance of benefits and harms for patients with blocked dialysis access.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is a blocked dialysis access a problem?\nPeople who need regular haemodialysis (a treatment that cleans the blood when kidneys can’t) rely on a special blood‑vessel connection called an arterioven. An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is created by joining a vein and an artery, while an arteriovenous graft (AVG) uses a synthetic tube to link them. Over time these connections can become clogged with a blood clot – a condition called thrombosis. When this happens the patient often has to use a temporary tube called a catheter to get dialysis. Using a catheter is riskier because it can lead to infections, blockages in the large veins near the heart, and more hospital stays. Doctors try to clear the clot using different methods: • Thrombectomy – mechanically pulling the clot out, • Thrombolysis – using medicines to dissolve the clot, or • Surgery – repairing or re‑connecting the blood vessels. Deciding which method works best and is safest is important for keeping the dialysis access open (called \"primary patency\") and for the patient’s overall health.\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover?\nThe review authors wanted to find out which of the available treatments – different types of thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or surgical repair – are most effective and safest for restoring blocked AVFs and AVGs in people receiving haemodialysis. Specifically, they looked at outcomes such as how often the access stayed open after 30 days, the success of the procedure, and any serious or minor complications.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies evaluating any intervention to treat thrombosed arteriovenous fistulas or grafts in haemodialysis patients, pooled their results, and assessed our confidence in the evidence using standard grading criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWe looked at 14 randomised (or quasi‑randomised) trials that together included 1,176 people who had a blocked arteriovenous fistula or graft used for haemodialysis. All participants had used their access at least once before and then showed clinical or haemodynamic signs of a clot. The studies compared three kinds of treatments – mechanical clot‑removal devices, drugs that dissolve clots, and surgical procedures – against each other. Most of the trials were small, had a high risk of bias, and many were funded or supported by industry. The overall evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether any of these clot‑removing methods, clot‑dissolving drugs, or surgeries improve the chance that the dialysis access stays open, works for at least a month, is technically successful, or reduces major or minor complications. There is a hint that surgery might keep the access open a little longer than a purely mechanical technique, but the certainty of this finding is very low, so we cannot be sure of any benefit.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "Critical checks failed: • Subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). The style guide requires question‑style headings. • The draft contains several long, complex sentences that exceed 30 words, making them hard for patients to follow (e.g., the sentence in the Results section describing the uncertainty of evidence). • Passive voice is high (22 instances) and noun‑heavy phrasing reduces clarity; metrics show words_per_sentence (25.9, P90), passive_voice (22, P90), nouns (185, P90), and high counts of complex and long words, all deviating from typical PLS patterns. • Bullet points use “•” instead of the required dash (‑). These issues together mean the PLS does not meet the required readability and style standards. Suggested top improvements: 1) Rewrite all subheadings as questions (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\", \"Why is a blocked dialysis access a problem?\", \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"). 2) Shorten long sentences, especially in the Results paragraph, by breaking them into two or more sentences and using active voice. 3) Reduce passive constructions and replace noun‑heavy phrases with active verbs (e.g., change \"The evidence is up to date to January 2024 of search\" to \"We searched up to January 2024\"). 4) Replace bullet symbols with dashes and ensure a blank line before each list. 5) Simplify terminology by defining technical words inline and using fewer complex/long words (e.g., replace \"primary patency – the access staying open without another blockage\" with \"primary patency (how long the access stays open without another clot)\"), which will lower the complex_words and long_words counts. These changes will bring the draft into the typical PLS percentile ranges (words_per_sentence <22, passive_voice <13, nouns <116, complex_words <84, long_words <122) and satisfy the style guide.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity but several metrics are outside typical PLS ranges: words_per_sentence (25.9, P90), passive_voice (22, P90), nouns (185, P90), smog_index (14.66, P90), dale_chall_readability (8.5, P90), complex_words_dc (319, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (147, BEYOND_P90), and long_words (206, BEYOND_P90). These indicate sentences are too long, too many passive constructions, excessive noun density, and high lexical complexity, all of which reduce readability for patients."
