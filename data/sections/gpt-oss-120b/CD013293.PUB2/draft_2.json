  "draft": "Which treatment (surgery, clot‑removal, or clot‑dissolving) works best for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We do not have clear evidence that surgery, clot‑removal (thrombectomy – a procedure that pulls out a clot) or clot‑dissolving (thrombolysis – medicine that dissolves a clot) is best for a blocked dialysis access (AVF – a direct artery‑to‑vein connection, or AVG – a synthetic tube linking an artery and a vein). The studies did not show a consistent advantage for any approach, and data on side effects were limited.\n- Small studies hinted that surgery might keep the access open a little longer (primary patency – how long the access stays open without another clot) compared with mechanical clot‑removal, but the evidence is very uncertain and cannot be relied upon.\n- Most trials were small and had design problems. Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to determine which method, if any, offers the best balance of benefits and harms.\n\nWhy is a blocked dialysis access a problem?\nPeople who need regular haemodialysis (a treatment that cleans the blood when kidneys fail) rely on a special blood‑vessel connection called an arteriovenous access. An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) joins a vein and an artery; an arteriovenous graft (AVG) uses a synthetic tube to link them. Over time the access can become clogged with a blood clot (thrombosis). When this happens the patient often must use a temporary catheter. Catheters increase the risk of infection, blockages in large veins near the heart, and hospital stays.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover?\nWe wanted to find out which treatment – different types of thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or surgical repair – works best and is safest for restoring blocked AVFs and AVGs in people receiving haemodialysis. We focused on outcomes such as the proportion of accesses that stay open after 30 days, technical success of the procedure, and serious or minor complications.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register and related databases up to 28 January 2024. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared any of the three treatments in adults on haemodialysis with a thrombosed AVF or AVG.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 14 trials involving 1,176 participants. The studies compared mechanical clot‑removal devices, clot‑dissolving drugs, and surgical procedures. Most trials were small, had a high risk of bias, and many were funded by industry.\nThe overall evidence is very uncertain. We cannot say that any of the three methods improves the chance that the access stays open for at least a month, achieves technical success, or reduces major or minor complications. There is a hint that surgery may improve primary patency compared with mechanical thrombectomy, but the certainty of this finding is low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the results because participants often knew which treatment they received, many studies did not report all outcomes we were interested in, and the sample sizes were small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to 28 January 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical clarity checks: (1) Important jargon such as “technical success” and “high risk of bias” is not explained for a lay audience, leaving readers unsure what these outcomes mean. (2) The first key‑message bullet is a long, parenthesis‑heavy sentence that overloads the reader with multiple terms at once (e.g., “We do not have clear evidence that surgery, clot‑removal (thrombectomy – a procedure that pulls out a clot) or clot‑dissolving (thrombolysis – medicine that dissolves a clot) is best for a blocked dialysis access (AVF – a direct artery‑to‑vein connection, or AVG – a synthetic tube linking an artery and a vein).”). (3) Several sentences exceed 30 words, notably the sentence about uncertainty and outcomes (31 words), making them hard to follow. These issues combine with metric evidence of high lexical complexity (complex_words_dc = 231, complex_words = 116, both in the P90 range) indicating the text is unusually difficult for a plain‑language summary. To meet Cochrane PLS standards the draft needs clearer definitions, shorter sentences, and reduced technical vocabulary.",
