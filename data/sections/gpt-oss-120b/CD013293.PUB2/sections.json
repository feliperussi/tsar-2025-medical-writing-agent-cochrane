  "key_messages": [
    "We do not have clear evidence to show whether surgery, clot‑removal (thrombectomy – a procedure that removes a clot) or clot‑dissolving (thrombolysis – a treatment that uses medicine to dissolve a clot) works best for a blocked dialysis access (AVF – a direct artery‑to‑vein connection, or AVG – a tube that links an artery and a vein); the available studies did not demonstrate a consistent advantage for any approach, and information on unwanted side effects (adverse events) was limited.",
    "Some small studies suggested that surgery might keep the access open a little longer (primary patency – the access staying open without another blockage) compared with mechanical clot‑removal, but because the research was limited and uncertain, this possible benefit cannot be relied upon.",
    "Because most trials were small, had design problems, and did not report important outcomes such as death or long‑term access function, larger, well‑designed studies are needed to determine which method, if any, provides the best balance of benefits and harms for patients with blocked dialysis access."

      "subheading": "Why is a blocked dialysis access a problem?",
      "content": "People who need regular haemodialysis (a treatment that cleans the blood when kidneys can’t) rely on a special blood‑vessel connection called an arterioven. An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is created by joining a vein and an artery, while an arteriovenous graft (AVG) uses a synthetic tube to link them. Over time these connections can become clogged with a blood clot – a condition called thrombosis. When this happens the patient often has to use a temporary tube called a catheter to get dialysis. Using a catheter is riskier because it can lead to infections, blockages in the large veins near the heart, and more hospital stays. Doctors try to clear the clot using different methods: • Thrombectomy – mechanically pulling the clot out, • Thrombolysis – using medicines to dissolve the clot, or • Surgery – repairing or re‑connecting the blood vessels. Deciding which method works best and is safest is important for keeping the dialysis access open (called \"primary patency\") and for the patient’s overall health."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers aim to discover?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out which of the available treatments – different types of thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or surgical repair – are most effective and safest for restoring blocked AVFs and AVGs in people receiving haemodialysis. Specifically, they looked at outcomes such as how often the access stayed open after 30 days, the success of the procedure, and any serious or minor complications."

      "subheading": "Methods",

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at 14 randomised (or quasi‑randomised) trials that together included 1,176 people who had a blocked arteriovenous fistula or graft used for haemodialysis. All participants had used their access at least once before and then showed clinical or haemodynamic signs of a clot. The studies compared three kinds of treatments – mechanical clot‑removal devices, drugs that dissolve clots, and surgical procedures – against each other. Most of the trials were small, had a high risk of bias, and many were funded or supported by industry. The overall evidence is very uncertain: we do not know whether any of these clot‑removing methods, clot‑dissolving drugs, or surgeries improve the chance that the dialysis access stays open, works for at least a month, is technically successful, or reduces major or minor complications. There is a hint that surgery might keep the access open a little longer than a purely mechanical technique, but the certainty of this finding is very low, so we cannot be sure of any benefit."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2024 of search."
