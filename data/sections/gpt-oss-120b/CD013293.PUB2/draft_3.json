  "draft": "Which treatment (surgery, clot‑removal, or clot‑dissolving) works best for blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft)?\n\nKey messages\n- We do not have clear evidence that surgery, clot‑removal (thrombectomy – a procedure that pulls out a clot) or clot‑dissolving (thrombolysis – medicine that dissolves a clot) is best for a blocked dialysis access (AVF – a direct artery‑to‑vein connection, or AVG – a synthetic tube linking an artery and a vein). The studies did not show a consistent advantage for any approach, and information on side effects (adverse events) was limited.\n- Small studies hinted that surgery might keep the access open a little longer (primary patency – the access staying open without another clot) compared with mechanical clot‑removal, but the evidence is very uncertain and cannot be relied upon.\n- Most trials were small and had design problems (high risk of bias – meaning the studies were poorly designed or conducted). Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to find out which method, if any, offers the best balance of benefits and harms.\n\nWhy is a blocked dialysis access a problem?\nPeople who need regular haemodialysis (a treatment that cleans the blood when kidneys fail) rely on a special blood‑vessel connection called an arteriovenous access. An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) joins a vein and an artery, while an arteriovenous graft (AVG) uses a synthetic tube to link them. Over time the access can become clogged with a blood clot (thrombosis). When this happens the patient often has to use a temporary tube called a catheter. Catheters increase the risk of infection, blockages in large veins near the heart, and extra hospital stays.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover?\nWe wanted to find out which treatment – different types of thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or surgical repair – works best and is safest for restoring blocked AVFs and AVGs in people receiving haemodialysis. We focused on outcomes such as the proportion of accesses that stay open after 30 days, the success of the procedure (technical success – the procedure being completed as intended), and serious or minor complications.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register and related databases up to 28 January 2024. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared any of the three treatments in adults on haemodialysis with a thrombosed AVF or AVG.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 14 trials involving 1,176 participants. The studies compared mechanical clot‑removal devices, clot‑dissolving drugs, and surgical procedures. Most trials were small, had a high risk of bias, and many were funded by industry. The overall evidence is very uncertain. We cannot say that any of the three methods improves the chance that the access stays open for at least a month, achieves technical success, or reduces major or minor complications. There is a hint that surgery may improve primary patency compared with mechanical thrombectomy, but the certainty of this finding is low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the results because participants often knew which treatment they received, many studies did not report all outcomes we were interested in, and the sample sizes were small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to 28 January 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets all mandatory checks – it includes every required section, each sub‑heading is phrased as a question, the numbers (14 studies, 1,176 participants, search date 28 January 2024) match the source, and the word count is well under the 850‑word limit. Readability metrics show the text is already in a good range, but three areas could be tightened to improve patient‑facing clarity: 1) **Passive voice** – the draft contains 20 passive constructions (P90). Example: “information on side effects (adverse events) was limited.” Rewrite as “we had limited information on side effects (adverse events).” 2) **Very long sentences** – some sentences exceed 30 words, e.g., “We wanted to find out which treatment – different types of thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or surgical repair – works best and is safest for restoring blocked AVFs and AVGs in people receiving haemodialysis.” Split into two sentences: “We wanted to find out which treatment works best and is safest for restoring blocked AVFs and AVGs. The treatments we examined were different types of thrombectomy, thrombolysis, and surgical repair.” 3) **Jargon that could be clearer** – “technical success” is only briefly mentioned. Add a short definition: “technical success – the procedure being completed as intended.” 4) **Awkward phrasing** – the currency statement “The evidence is up to date to January 2024 of search.” can be simplified to “We searched the literature up to 28 January 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.” Implementing these small edits will lower the passive‑voice count, reduce complex‑word density (currently 248 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words, P90), and keep sentences under 30 words, further aligning the summary with typical PLS patterns while preserving all factual content.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows strong overall conformity (72% of features in the best quartile). Readability scores are good (Flesch Reading Ease 51.8, Grade 11.4). However, three metrics deviate: passive_voice (20, P90), complex_words_dc (248, P90) and complex_words (121, P90). These indicate higher than typical use of passive constructions and complex vocabulary, supporting the suggested edits to improve clarity."
