  "key_messages": [
    "Giving prophylactic antibiotics (antibiotics given to prevent infection) before uterine evacuation (surgical removal of pregnancy tissue) may lower the chance of a uterine infection (infection of the uterus), but the overall evidence is uncertain; higher‑quality studies suggest a clearer benefit. The medicines do not appear to increase common side effects such as vomiting or diarrhoea, and any increase in allergic reactions (immune system reactions that can cause rash, breathing problems, etc.) is unclear.",
    "The review could not determine whether preventive antibiotics reduce the need for later antibiotic treatment, hospital admission (staying in hospital for treatment), or serious side effects, because the available data were very limited and uncertain.",
    "More well‑designed trials with good follow‑up (checking patients after treatment) are needed to confirm the benefit of preventive antibiotics, to clarify their possible harms, and to assess longer‑term outcomes such as hospitalisation and allergic reactions."

      "subheading": "Why might antibiotics be considered after a miscarriage procedure?",
      "content": "When a woman experiences an early pregnancy loss (also called a miscarriage), doctors often remove any remaining tissue from the uterus in a procedure called uterine evacuation. This helps prevent ongoing bleeding and reduces the chance of infection. While it is clear that women who show signs of infection (such as fever or foul‑smelling discharge) should receive antibiotics, it is less clear whether giving antibiotics to every woman before the procedure – even when there are no infection signs – is helpful. Giving antibiotics in this preventive way is called \"prophylactic\" use. The question is whether routine prophylactic antibiotics can lower the risk of a uterine infection after the evacuation, without causing unnecessary side‑effects."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the researchers aim to discover?",
      "content": "The review authors set out to find out whether giving routine prophylactic antibiotics to women undergoing uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss reduces the chance of developing a uterine infection compared with giving a placebo or no antibiotic at all. They also wanted to see if the antibiotics affect other outcomes such as the need for later antibiotic treatment, hospital admission, and any side‑effects like vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified six randomised controlled trials that together included 4,371 women who had an early‑pregnancy loss and needed a uterine evacuation. All participants were women without any signs or symptoms of infection. The studies compared giving a prophylactic antibiotic regimen with giving a placebo or no treatment. The abstract did not provide details about how long the participants were followed, where the studies were carried out, or who funded the research."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Risk of uterine infection",
      "content": "Overall, giving antibiotics before the procedure probably makes little or no difference to the chance of developing a uterine infection, and we are uncertain about how big any benefit might be. However, in the higher‑quality studies, antibiotics probably reduce the risk of infection – roughly 43 fewer infections per 100 women treated. Antibiotics probably make little or no difference to the chances of vomiting or diarrhoea, may increase the risk of allergic reactions (the evidence is uncertain), and we are very uncertain whether they affect the need for additional antibiotics or the chance of being hospitalised for infection."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people/used different ways of delivering intervention, and studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to October 2023 of search."
