  "draft": "Do preventive antibiotics lower the risk of infection after uterine evacuation (surgical removal of pregnancy tissue) for miscarriage?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving prophylactic antibiotics (antibiotics given before surgery to prevent infection) before uterine evacuation may lower the chance of a uterine infection, but the overall evidence is uncertain; higher‑quality studies suggest a clearer benefit.\n- The medicines do not appear to increase common side effects such as vomiting or diarrhoea, and any increase in allergic reactions (rashes, breathing problems, etc.) is unclear.\n- More well‑designed trials with good follow‑up are needed to confirm the benefit, clarify possible harms, and assess longer‑term outcomes such as hospital admission and serious allergic reactions.\n\nWhy might antibiotics be considered after a miscarriage procedure?\nWhen a woman experiences an early pregnancy loss (miscarriage), doctors often remove any remaining tissue from the uterus in a procedure called uterine evacuation (surgical removal of pregnancy tissue). This helps stop bleeding and reduces the chance of infection. We know that women who show signs of infection (fever, foul‑smelling discharge) need antibiotics. It is less clear whether giving antibiotics to every woman before the procedure – even when there are no infection signs – is helpful. This preventive use is called prophylactic antibiotics.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover?\nWe wanted to find out whether routine prophylactic antibiotics given to women undergoing uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss reduce the risk of a uterine infection compared with a placebo or no antibiotic. We also looked at whether the antibiotics affect other outcomes such as the need for later antibiotic treatment, hospital admission, vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment in women undergoing uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six trials that together included 4,371 women without any signs of infection. Overall, the pooled results suggest that giving antibiotics before the procedure probably makes little or no difference to the chance of a uterine infection, and we remain uncertain about the size of any benefit. However, when we looked only at the three higher‑quality trials (covering 85% of participants), antibiotics reduced the risk of infection by about 43% (roughly 43 fewer infections per 100 women treated). The studies were very consistent (no statistical heterogeneity).\n\nWe also found that antibiotics probably make little or no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea. The evidence on allergic reactions is uncertain; one study suggested a possible increase, but the data are very limited. We could not determine whether antibiotics lower the need for later antibiotic treatment or hospital admission because the available data were sparse and uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the overall evidence. Some studies may have been unblinded, meaning participants and staff knew which treatment was given. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in. The trials varied in participants and how the antibiotics were given, and many were small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised is current to October 2023, the date of our most recent search.",

Minor clarity improvements are recommended: 1) Split the long sentence in the ‘What did we find?’ section – e.g., “Overall, the pooled results suggest that giving antibiotics before the procedure probably makes little or no difference to the chance of a uterine infection. We are still uncertain about how large any benefit might be.” 2) Explain the GRADE approach when first mentioned – e.g., “We rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE system, which assesses how confident we can be in the results.” 3) Re‑phrase the clause about higher‑quality trials for readability – e.g., “When we looked only at the three higher‑quality trials, which together included 85% of the participants, antibiotics reduced the risk of infection by about 43% (roughly 43 fewer infections per 100 women treated).” 4) Simplify the statement on consistency – e.g., “The studies were very consistent, showing no statistical heterogeneity.” 5) Reduce nominalisations by using more verbs (e.g., replace “assessment of risk” with “we assessed the risk”). These edits will lower the already‑acceptable readability scores and further align the output with typical plain‑language summary patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on most metrics (words per sentence 19.45, Flesch reading ease 37.1, active voice 57). However, nominalisations (29), complex words (164), long words (200) and readability indices (Gunning Fog 19.4, SMOG 15.3, Dale‑Chall 8.2) are beyond the typical plain‑language summary range, indicating room for simplification. Reducing noun‑heavy phrasing and replacing complex words with simpler alternatives will improve readability."
