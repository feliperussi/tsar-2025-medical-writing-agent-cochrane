  "draft": "Do preventive antibiotics lower the risk of infection after uterine evacuation (surgical removal of pregnancy tissue) for miscarriage?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Giving prophylactic antibiotics (antibiotics given to prevent infection) before uterine evacuation (surgical removal of pregnancy tissue) may lower the chance of a uterine infection (infection of the uterus), but the overall evidence is uncertain; higher‑quality studies suggest a clearer benefit. The medicines do not appear to increase common side effects such as vomiting or diarrhoea, and any increase in allergic reactions (immune system reactions that can cause rash, breathing problems, etc.) is unclear.\n- The review could not determine whether preventive antibiotics reduce the need for later antibiotic treatment, hospital admission (staying in hospital for treatment), or serious side effects, because the available data were very limited and uncertain.\n- More well‑designed trials with good follow‑up (checking patients after treatment) are needed to confirm the benefit of preventive antibiotics, to clarify their possible harms, and to assess longer‑term outcomes such as hospitalisation and allergic reactions.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nWhy might antibiotics be considered after a miscarriage procedure?\nWhen a woman experiences an early pregnancy loss (also called a miscarriage), doctors often remove any remaining tissue from the uterus in a procedure called uterine evacuation. This helps prevent ongoing bleeding and reduces the chance of infection. While it is clear that women who show signs of infection (such as fever or foul‑smelling discharge) should receive antibiotics, it is less clear whether giving antibiotics to every woman before the procedure – even when there are no infection signs – is helpful. Giving antibiotics in this preventive way is called \"prophylactic\" use. The question is whether routine prophylactic antibiotics can lower the risk of a uterine infection after the evacuation, without causing unnecessary side‑effects.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover?\nThe review authors set out to find out whether giving routine prophylactic antibiotics to women undergoing uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss reduces the chance of developing a uterine infection compared with giving a placebo or no antibiotic at all. They also wanted to see if the antibiotics affect other outcomes such as the need for later antibiotic treatment, hospital admission, and any side‑effects like vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched for studies that compared prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment in women undergoing uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence (using the GRADE approach).\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six randomised controlled trials that together included 4,371 women who had an early‑pregnancy loss and needed a uterine evacuation. All participants were women without any signs or symptoms of infection. The studies compared giving a prophylactic antibiotic regimen with giving a placebo or no treatment. The abstract did not provide details about how long the participants were followed, where the studies were carried out, or who funded the research.\n\nMain results: Risk of uterine infection\nOverall, giving antibiotics before the procedure probably makes little or no difference to the chance of developing a uterine infection, and we are uncertain about how big any benefit might be. However, in the higher‑quality studies, antibiotics probably reduce the risk of infection – roughly 43 fewer infections per 100 women treated. Antibiotics probably make little or no difference to the chances of vomiting or diarrhoea, may increase the risk of allergic reactions (the evidence is uncertain), and we are very uncertain whether they affect the need for additional antibiotics or the chance of being hospitalised for infection.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people/used different ways of delivering intervention, and studies were very small.\n\nCURRENCY\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that all section subheadings must be phrased as questions. Headings such as INTRODUCTION, METHODS, RESULTS, LIMITATIONS and CURRENCY are not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide requirement. In addition, the text contains several clarity problems that would confuse readers: (1) long, complex sentences that exceed 30 words, (2) frequent passive‑voice constructions (14 instances per the evaluation), and (3) unexplained technical jargon (e.g., \"uterine evacuation\", \"RR\", \"I²\"). These issues, together with the high noun‑heavy style (41 nominalisations) and low readability scores (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 29, Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 16), make the summary difficult for a lay audience. The most important improvements are: rewrite subheadings as questions, break long sentences into shorter ones, replace passive voice with active voice, and simplify technical terms. Below are concrete suggestions for the three‑to‑five most impactful changes.\n\n**Top improvements**\n1. **Subheadings not phrased as questions**\n   - *Problem*: \"INTRODUCTION\", \"METHODS\", \"RESULTS\", \"LIMITATIONS\", \"CURRENCY\" are nouns, not questions.\n   - *Rewrite*: Change to \"Why might antibiotics be considered after a miscarriage procedure?\", \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n2. **Long, hard‑to‑follow sentence**\n   - *Quote*: \"Overall, giving antibiotics before the procedure probably makes little or no difference to the chance of developing a uterine infection, and we are uncertain about how big any benefit might be.\"\n   - *Problem*: 33 words; combines two ideas, making it dense for readers.\n   - *Rewrite*: \"Overall, giving antibiotics before the procedure probably does not change the chance of a uterine infection. We are still unsure how large any benefit could be.\"\n3. **Passive voice**\n   - *Quote*: \"The abstract did not provide details about how long the participants were followed, where the studies were carried out, or who funded the research.\"\n   - *Problem*: Passive construction obscures who is missing the information.\n   - *Rewrite*: \"The abstract does not tell us how long participants were followed, where the studies took place, or who funded the research.\"\n4. **Unexplained jargon**\n   - *Quote*: \"RR 0.57, I² = 0%\"\n   - *Problem*: Readers may not know that RR means risk ratio and I² measures study heterogeneity.\n   - *Rewrite*: \"The risk of infection was reduced by about 43% (risk ratio 0.57). The studies were very consistent (I² = 0%).\"\n5. **Nominalisation / noun‑heavy phrasing**\n   - *Quote*: \"The review could not determine whether preventive antibiotics reduce the need for later antibiotic treatment, hospital admission (staying in hospital for treatment), or serious side effects, because the available data were very limited and uncertain.\"\n   - *Problem*: Long noun‑heavy sentence; mixes several ideas.\n   - *Rewrite*: \"We could not tell if preventive antibiotics lower the need for later antibiotics, hospital stays, or serious side effects because the data are limited and uncertain.\"\n\n**Metric support**: The evaluation shows 14 passive‑voice instances, 41 nominalisations, 191 nouns, and a very low Flesch‑Reading‑Ease (29) with a high Flesch‑Kincaid Grade (16). These numbers confirm the editorial observations of overly complex, noun‑heavy, and passive language, justifying the suggested rewrites.\n\n**PLS evaluation summary**: The draft deviates from typical PLS patterns on 14 metrics, especially sentence length (average 28 words, beyond the typical range), readability (FRE 29, far below the typical 32‑48), and complexity measures (high counts, high grade‑level scores). Reducing sentence length, simplifying vocabulary, and using more active verbs will bring the summary closer to the median PLS profile.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is outside typical PLS patterns on 14 features, notably very long sentences (27.96 words avg, BEYOND_P90), high nominalisation (41, BEYOND_P90), many nouns (191, P90), low readability (FRE 29, P10) and high grade‑level scores (FKGL 16, GFI 21.7, etc.). These metrics confirm the need to shorten sentences, cut noun‑heavy phrasing, reduce passive voice, and simplify vocabulary."
