  "draft": "Is giving water pills (loop diuretics) as a steady drip (continuous infusion) better than giving them as a single dose (bolus injection) for people with sudden worsening of heart failure (acute heart failure)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- For people with acute heart failure (a sudden worsening of the heart’s ability to pump), the evidence shows that giving loop diuretics (water pills that help remove excess fluid) as a continuous infusion (steady drip) does not show a clear advantage over giving them as a bolus injection (single dose) in terms of fluid loss, survival, or kidney harm, and no distinct harmful effects were identified.\n- Other important outcomes, such as how long patients stay in the hospital, the likelihood of being readmitted, and heart‑related death, also showed no clear difference between the continuous drip and single‑dose approaches.\n- Because the existing studies are limited and not of high quality, further well‑designed research is needed to determine whether one method is truly better, especially regarding long‑term benefits, side‑effects, and outcomes that matter to patients.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is acute heart failure and how is it usually treated?\nAcute heart failure (AHF) is a sudden worsening of the heart’s ability to pump blood. In most cases (about 95%) this leads to a build‑up of fluid in the lungs and other parts of the body, causing symptoms such as shortness of breath, swelling of the legs and rapid weight gain. A smaller number of patients (about 5%) experience poor blood flow to vital organs. Because the excess fluid can be life‑threatening, doctors often need to act quickly, usually by giving medicines that help the body get rid of the extra fluid. The most common medicines are called \"loop diuretics\" – drugs that make the kidneys excrete more urine, thereby reducing fluid overload. These medicines can be given through an IV (intravenous) line either as a rapid, single dose (a \"bolus injection\") or as a steady, slow drip over several hours (a \"continuous infusion\").\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review authors set out to compare the two ways of delivering IV loop diuretics – continuous infusion versus bolus injection – in adults with severe acute heart failure (people classified as NYHA class III or IV, meaning they have marked limitation of physical activity). They wanted to know whether one method leads to better outcomes, such as more weight loss (a sign of fluid removal), lower risk of death, shorter hospital stays, fewer readmissions, or less kidney damage (acute kidney injury). In short, the goal was to determine if giving the diuretic as a steady drip is more effective or safer than giving it in quick, separate doses.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies comparing continuous infusion, versus bolus injection of loop diuretics in adults with acute heart failure, combined their results where possible, and assessed our confidence in the evidence based on study quality and consistency.\n\n**Results**\nWe looked at seven randomised trials that together included 681 adults with severe acute heart failure (NYHA class III–IV) from 32 hospitals in North America, Europe and Asia. All trials compared giving loop diuretics as a continuous intravenous infusion with giving the same drugs as separate bolus injections, and no other treatments were added. The studies were carried out in real‑world hospital settings over periods ranging from eight months to six years.\n\nThe evidence shows that using a continuous infusion does not clearly improve outcomes. It may lead to a small reduction in body weight, but the effect is uncertain. Continuous infusion probably makes little or no difference to the chance of dying, how long patients stay in hospital, the risk of being readmitted after discharge, or the risk of developing acute kidney injury.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies or used different ways of delivering the treatment.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement (5.3 Structure). Additionally, the text contains several clarity and readability problems that would confuse patients: long sentences, passive constructions, and unexplained jargon. The PLS evaluation shows high values for words per sentence (25.25 → P90), nouns (211 → BEYOND_P90), and complex‑word metrics, confirming the need to simplify and shorten the prose.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Change all section headings to questions. Example: replace \"Key messages\" with \"What are the main findings?\".\n2. **Sentence length** – Break long sentences into shorter ones (<20 words). Example: original \"We looked at seven randomised trials that together included 681 adults with severe acute heart failure (NYHA class III–IV) from 32 hospitals in North America, Europe and Asia.\" Rewrite to \"We looked at seven randomised trials. They included 681 adults with severe acute heart failure (NYHA class III–IV) from 32 hospitals in North America, Europe and Asia.\"\n3. **Passive voice** – Convert passive phrasing to active voice. Example: original \"The evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search.\" Rewrite to \"We searched up to February 2024.\"\n4. **Jargon simplification** – Define or replace technical terms that may be unfamiliar. Example: replace \"acute kidney injury\" with \"kidney damage\" and add a brief explanation.\n5. **Reduce noun‑heavy sentences** – Use more verbs. Example: original \"The studies were carried out in real‑world hospital settings over periods ranging from eight months to six years.\" Rewrite to \"Hospitals carried out the studies over periods ranging from eight months to six years.\"\n\nThese changes address the most impactful clarity issues and bring the draft into alignment with the style guide and typical PLS readability patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but deviates on several readability metrics: words per sentence (25.25 → P90), nouns (211 → BEYOND_P90), complex words (127 → P90), long words (178 → P90), and Dale‑Chall complex words (296 → BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is more dense and noun‑heavy than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need to shorten sentences, use more active verbs, and simplify vocabulary."
