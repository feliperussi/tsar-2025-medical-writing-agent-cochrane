  "key_messages": [
    "For people with acute heart failure (a sudden worsening of the heart’s ability to pump), giving loop diuretics (water pills that help remove excess fluid) as a continuous infusion (steady drip) does not show a clear advantage over giving them as a bolus injection (single dose) in terms of fluid loss, survival, or kidney harm, and no distinct harmful effects were identified.",
    "Other important outcomes, such as how long patients stay in the hospital, the likelihood of being readmitted, and heart‑related death, also showed no clear difference between the continuous drip and single‑dose approaches.",
    "Because the existing studies are limited and not of high quality, further well‑designed research is needed to determine whether one method is truly better, especially regarding long‑term benefits, side‑effects, and outcomes that matter to patients."

      "subheading": "What is acute heart failure and how is it usually treated?",
      "content": "Acute heart failure (AHF) is a sudden worsening of the heart’s ability to pump blood. In most cases (about 95%) this leads to a build‑up of fluid in the lungs and other parts of the body, causing symptoms such as shortness of breath, swelling of the legs and rapid weight gain. A smaller number of patients (about 5%) experience poor blood flow to vital organs. Because the excess fluid can be life‑threatening, doctors often need to act quickly, usually by giving medicines that help the body get rid of the extra fluid. The most common medicines are called \"loop diuretics\" – drugs that make the kidneys excrete more urine, thereby reducing fluid overload. These medicines can be given through an IV (intravenous) line either as a rapid, single dose (a \"bolus injection\") or as a steady, slow drip over several hours (a \"continuous infusion\")."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors set out to compare the two ways of delivering IV loop diuretics – continuous infusion versus bolus injection – in adults with severe acute heart failure (people classified as NYHA class III or IV, meaning they have marked limitation of physical activity). They wanted to know whether one method leads to better outcomes, such as more weight loss (a sign of fluid removal), lower risk of death, shorter hospital stays, fewer readmissions, or less kidney damage (acute kidney injury). In short, the goal was to determine if giving the diuretic as a steady drip is more effective or safer than giving it in quick, separate doses."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at seven randomised trials that together included 681 adults with severe acute heart failure (NYHA class III–IV) from 32 hospitals in North America, Europe and Asia. All trials compared giving loop diuretics as a continuous intravenous infusion with giving the same drugs as separate bolus injections, and no other treatments were added. The studies were carried out in real‑world hospital settings over periods ranging from eight months to six years.\\n\\nThe evidence shows that using a continuous infusion does not clearly improve outcomes. It may lead to a small reduction in body weight, but the effect is uncertain. Continuous infusion probably makes little or no difference to the chance of dying, how long patients stay in hospital, the risk of being readmitted after discharge, or the risk of developing acute kidney injury."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search."
