  "draft": "What do patients, doctors, and health planners think influences how comprehensive health screenings (general health checks) are planned (commissioned), delivered, and used?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Patients, doctors and health planners see several factors that shape how general health checks (comprehensive health screenings) are planned, delivered and used: clients value the checks for motivation to improve lifestyle and for reassurance, but fear of bad results, cost concerns and reliance on symptom‑based care can discourage attendance; providers stress the need for skilled, culturally competent staff and note that time pressures, staff shortages, limited resources and reimbursement issues hinder delivery; broader cultural, social and political contexts (such as norms, religion, language and political support) also influence whether checks are commissioned and taken up, and no specific harmful effects of the checks were reported.\n- Even though quantitative studies have shown little impact of general health checks on mortality, stakeholders across many countries still consider them popular and valuable, especially where they have been long‑standing parts of the health system; this suggests that any move to reduce or stop these checks would need to offer acceptable alternatives and address the perceived benefits that users and providers attach to them.\n- Future work should explore in more depth why health planners choose to commission general health checks and how cultural and systemic factors affect uptake, using higher‑quality qualitative and mixed‑methods research, so that any decisions about continuing, modifying or replacing these checks are based on a clearer understanding of stakeholder values and system constraints.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat are general health checks and why are they offered?\nGeneral health checks are routine screening appointments for people who feel healthy and have no symptoms. During a check‑up, a health professional may run several tests – for example, measuring blood pressure, checking blood sugar, or looking for early signs of heart disease or cancer. The idea is to spot problems early, give advice on lifestyle, and ultimately keep people from getting sick or dying (this is called reducing \"morbidity\" – illness – and \"mortality\" – death). Many health systems run these checks as part of preventive care, either through national programmes or private providers.\n\nWhy is it important to understand how people feel about these checks?\nA 2019 Cochrane review that looked at the numbers (quantitative studies) found that general health checks have little or no effect on overall death rates or on preventing heart disease and cancer. Even though the hard data show limited benefit, the checks are still popular with patients, doctors, managers and policy makers. To decide whether to keep, change or stop offering them, we need to know what the different groups think and experience – their values, worries, and the practical factors that help or hinder the checks. This is especially important because stopping a service that people value can cause public concern unless good alternatives are offered.\n\nWhat did the reviewers want to find out?\nThe authors set out to explore the views and experiences of four key groups – health‑care managers or policy makers, health‑care providers (such as doctors and nurses), people who attend the checks, and people who choose not to attend. They asked: How do these stakeholders perceive general health checks? What factors influence the decision to fund (\"commission\"), deliver, and use these checks? By gathering and analysing qualitative studies (research that uses interviews, focus groups, or observations rather than numbers), the review aimed to add depth to the earlier effectiveness review and to highlight what matters to people on the ground.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies on stakeholder views of general health checks, combined their findings using a framework synthesis, and rated our confidence in each finding with the GRADE‑CERQual approach.\n\n**Results**\nThe review identified 146 primary qualitative studies on stakeholder views of general health checks, and a purposive sample of 36 of these studies was examined in detail. The sampled studies were mainly carried out in high‑income European countries, with about one‑third (11 of 36) from culturally diverse middle‑income settings in Eastern and South‑East Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Settings included primary and community health‑care centres (16 studies), workplaces (4 studies) and community venues (4 studies). The research focused on general health checks that screened for at least two diseases or risk factors. Stakeholder groups studied were clients (25 studies), health‑care providers (15 studies) and managers or commissioners (9 studies). \n\nThe findings suggest that general health checks probably increase clients' motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles and give them reassurance about their health. They probably reduce attendance among clients who fear receiving negative results. When clients perceive a risk of disease and value prevention, health checks probably lead to a moderate increase in uptake, and when providers are skilled and culturally competent, acceptance may increase substantially. Delivery of health checks may be reduced when services face time competition, staff shortages, or limited resources. Clients may experience a slight increase in satisfaction when checks offer a comprehensive range of tests. Finally, the impact on uptake may vary according to cultural background, social norms, religion, gender and language.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.",

These issues are reflected in the PLS evaluation (24 passive constructions – BEYOND_P90; 298 nouns – BEYOND_P90; 26.2 words per sentence – P90; 182 complex words – BEYOND_P90). The following concrete improvements are needed: - Change subheadings to question format (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\", \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"). - Reduce overall length to ≤850 words by trimming redundant phrasing and merging overlapping points. - Shorten long sentences and replace passive voice with active constructions (e.g., \"We identified 146 studies\" instead of \"The review identified 146 primary qualitative studies\"). - Replace noun‑heavy phrases with verb‑focused language (e.g., \"We sampled 36 studies\" rather than \"a purposive sample of 36 of these studies was examined\"). - Simplify vocabulary by swapping complex/long words for everyday alternatives (e.g., \"help\" instead of \"facilitate\", \"use\" instead of \"utilise\"). These changes will bring the summary within the word limit, align it with the style guide, and improve readability for a lay audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft exceeds typical PLS patterns on several metrics: word count 916 (over limit), 24 passive voice instances (BEYOND_P90), 298 nouns (BEYOND_P90), 26.2 words per sentence (P90), high nominalisation (23, P90), and very high counts of complex, long, and Dale‑Chall words. Readability scores are borderline (Flesch‑Reading Ease 42.9, FKGL 13.8) but the excessive sentence length and jargon reduce accessibility. Reducing sentence length, passive voice, and complex vocabulary is needed to align with typical PLS ranges."
