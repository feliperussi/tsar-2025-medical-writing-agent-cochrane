  "draft": "What do patients, doctors, and health planners think influences how comprehensive health screenings (general health checks) are planned, delivered, and used?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Patients, doctors and health planners say checks can motivate better diet, more exercise and give reassurance, but fear of bad results, cost worries and a preference for symptom‑based care can stop people attending.\n- Providers stress that skilled, culturally‑aware staff are essential, yet time pressures, staff shortages, limited resources and unclear payment rules often make delivery difficult.\n- Wider cultural, social and political factors – such as community norms, religion, language and government support – also shape whether checks are funded and taken up, and we found no evidence that the checks cause harm.\n\nWhat are general health checks and why are they offered?\nGeneral health checks are routine screening appointments for people who feel healthy and have no symptoms. During a check‑up a health professional may measure blood pressure, test blood sugar or look for early signs of heart disease or cancer. The idea is to spot problems early, give lifestyle advice and help keep people from getting sick or dying (this is called reducing \"morbidity\" – illness – and \"mortality\" – death). Many health systems include these checks in preventive care, either through national programmes or private providers.\n\nWhy is it important to understand how people feel about these checks?\nA 2019 Cochrane review of numbers (quantitative studies) found that general health checks have little or no effect on overall death rates or on preventing heart disease and cancer. Even though the hard data show limited benefit, the checks remain popular with patients, doctors, managers and policy makers. We need to know what different groups think and feel. Their values, worries and practical factors can help or block the checks. Stopping a valued service can upset the public unless we provide clear alternatives.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies that explored stakeholder views of general health checks. We grouped similar ideas together – a method called a “framework synthesis” (grouping similar ideas) – to see what the studies had in common. We also checked how sure we are about each finding using a rating system for qualitative research (the GRADE‑CERQual approach).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 146 primary qualitative studies and carefully selected 36 that gave the richest information for detailed analysis. Most studies were from high‑income European countries; about one‑third were from culturally diverse middle‑income settings in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The studies looked at three stakeholder groups: clients (people who attend or consider attending checks), health‑care providers (doctors, nurses, etc.) and policy makers (those who decide whether to fund checks).\n\nClients said the checks often motivate them to improve diet, exercise and other habits, and that professional confirmation gives them peace of mind. Some clients avoid checks because they fear bad news, worry about costs or prefer to seek care only when symptoms appear.\n\nProviders highlighted that skilled, culturally‑competent staff make a big difference to attendance. They also reported that when doctors have to focus on treating people who are already sick (curative care), when staff leave, when there is not enough space or equipment, and when it is unclear how the service will be paid for, it becomes harder to offer the checks.\n\nPolicy makers noted that political climate, stakeholder support and broader social norms influence whether programmes are funded. Cultural background, religion, gender and language also affect how people perceive prevention and whether they attend.\n\nWe found no evidence that the checks harmed participants.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because many studies involved small, diverse groups, participants often knew which tests they received, and there were few studies overall to confirm the findings.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nOur search covered evidence up to August 2022. New studies published after that date are not included.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?\nEven though hard data show limited impact on mortality, stakeholders still value general health checks for the motivation and reassurance they provide. Any plan to reduce or stop these checks should offer acceptable alternatives and address the benefits that users and providers attach to them. Future research should use high‑quality qualitative and mixed‑methods designs to explore why policy makers commission checks and how cultural and system factors shape uptake.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical clarity standards despite meeting structural and factual requirements. Three major reader‑confusing issues were identified: (1) unexplained technical terms – “framework synthesis” and “GRADE‑CERQual” are mentioned without plain‑language definitions; (2) noun‑heavy, nominalised sentences that obscure who is doing what (e.g., “We grouped similar ideas together – a method called a ‘framework synthesis’ (grouping similar ideas) – to see what the studies had in common.”); (3) inconsistent terminology – the title uses “health planners” while the body switches to “policy makers”, which can confuse readers. These issues, combined with the metric analysis showing unusually high counts of nominalisations (21, beyond the typical P90), nouns (232, beyond P90), complex words (134, beyond P90) and long words (219, beyond P90), indicate the text is more noun‑dense and complex than typical Cochrane PLSs. Suggested improvements: 1. Define jargon: replace “framework synthesis” with “a way of grouping similar ideas from many studies” and explain GRADE‑CERQual as “a system that tells us how confident we are in each finding”. 2. Rewrite noun‑heavy sentences into active voice, e.g., “We grouped similar ideas using a framework synthesis, which means we grouped the studies’ main points together.” 3. Use the same term throughout – choose either “health planners” or “policy makers” and stick with it. 4. Reduce nominalisations: change “The evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.” to “We searched up to August 2022.” 5. Simplify long sentences, e.g., “We found 146 studies and chose the 36 that gave the most detailed information.” These changes will lower the counts of nominalisations, complex and long words, bringing the draft into the typical PLS range and improving readability for patients. Overall, the draft needs these key revisions before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits and has good active‑voice usage, but deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in several metrics: nominalisations (21, beyond P90), total nouns (232, beyond P90), complex words (134, beyond P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (312, beyond P90), long words (219, beyond P90) and smog index (14.3, beyond P90). These indicate excessive noun‑density and lexical complexity, supporting the need to rewrite noun‑heavy sentences and simplify terminology."
