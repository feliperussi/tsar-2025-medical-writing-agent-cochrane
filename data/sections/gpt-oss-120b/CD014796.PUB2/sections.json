  "key_messages": [
    "Patients, doctors and health planners see several factors that shape how general health checks (comprehensive health screenings) are planned, delivered and used: clients value the checks for motivation to improve lifestyle and for reassurance, but fear of bad results, cost concerns and reliance on symptom‑based care can discourage attendance; providers stress the need for skilled, culturally competent staff and note that time pressures, staff shortages, limited resources and reimbursement issues hinder delivery; broader cultural, social and political contexts (such as norms, religion, language and political support) also influence whether checks are commissioned and taken up, and no specific harmful effects of the checks were reported.",
    "Even though quantitative studies have shown little impact of general health checks on mortality, stakeholders across many countries still consider them popular and valuable, especially where they have been long‑standing parts of the health system; this suggests that any move to reduce or stop these checks would need to offer acceptable alternatives and address the perceived benefits that users and providers attach to them.",
    "Future work should explore in more depth why health planners choose to commission general health checks and how cultural and systemic factors affect uptake, using higher‑quality qualitative and mixed‑methods research, so that any decisions about continuing, modifying or replacing these checks are based on a clearer understanding of stakeholder values and system constraints."

      "subheading": "What are general health checks and why are they offered?",
      "content": "General health checks are routine screening appointments for people who feel healthy and have no symptoms. During a check‑up, a health professional may run several tests – for example, measuring blood pressure, checking blood sugar, or looking for early signs of heart disease or cancer. The idea is to spot problems early, give advice on lifestyle, and ultimately keep people from getting sick or dying (this is called reducing \"morbidity\" – illness – and \"mortality\" – death). Many health systems run these checks as part of preventive care, either through national programmes or private providers."

      "subheading": "Why is it important to understand how people feel about these checks?",
      "content": "A 2019 Cochrane review that looked at the numbers (quantitative studies) found that general health checks have little or no effect on overall death rates or on preventing heart disease and cancer. Even though the hard data show limited benefit, the checks are still popular with patients, doctors, managers and policy makers. To decide whether to keep, change or stop offering them, we need to know what the different groups think and experience – their values, worries, and the practical factors that help or hinder the checks. This is especially important because stopping a service that people value can cause public concern unless good alternatives are offered."

      "subheading": "What did the reviewers want to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to explore the views and experiences of four key groups – health‑care managers or policy makers, health‑care providers (such as doctors and nurses), people who attend the checks, and people who choose not to attend. They asked: How do these stakeholders perceive general health checks? What factors influence the decision to fund (\"commission\"), deliver, and use these checks? By gathering and analysing qualitative studies (research that uses interviews, focus groups, or observations rather than numbers), the review aimed to add depth to the earlier effectiveness review and to highlight what matters to people on the ground."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review identified 146 primary qualitative studies on stakeholder views of general health checks, and a purposive sample of 36 of these studies was examined in detail. The sampled studies were mainly carried out in high‑income European countries, with about one‑third (11 of 36) from culturally diverse middle‑income settings in Eastern and South‑East Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Settings included primary and community health‑care centres (16 studies), workplaces (4 studies) and community venues (4 studies). The research focused on general health checks that screened for at least two diseases or risk factors. Stakeholder groups studied were clients (25 studies), health‑care providers (15 studies) and managers or commissioners (9 studies). \n\nThe findings suggest that general health checks probably increase clients' motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles and give them reassurance about their health. They probably reduce attendance among clients who fear receiving negative results. When clients perceive a risk of disease and value prevention, health checks probably lead to a moderate increase in uptake, and when providers are skilled and culturally competent, acceptance may increase substantially. Delivery of health checks may be reduced when services face time competition, staff shortages, or limited resources. Clients may experience a slight increase in satisfaction when checks offer a comprehensive range of tests. Finally, the impact on uptake may vary according to cultural background, social norms, religion, gender and language."
