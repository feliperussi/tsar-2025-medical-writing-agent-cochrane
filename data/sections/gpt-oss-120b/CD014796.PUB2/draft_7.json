  "draft": "What do patients, doctors, and policy makers think influences how comprehensive health screenings (general health checks) are planned, delivered, and used?\n\nKey messages\n- Patients, doctors and policy makers say health checks can motivate people to eat better, exercise more and feel reassured.\n- Fear of bad results, worries about cost and a preference for symptom‑based care can stop people attending.\n- Policy makers and providers stress that skilled, culturally‑aware staff are essential, but time pressures, staff shortages, limited resources and unclear payment rules often make delivery difficult.\n- Wider cultural, social and political factors – such as community norms, religion, language and government support – also shape whether health checks are funded and taken up, and we found no evidence that the checks cause harm.\n\nWhat are general health checks and why are they offered?\nGeneral health checks are routine screening appointments for people who feel healthy and have no symptoms. During a check‑up a health professional may measure blood pressure, test blood sugar or look for early signs of heart disease or cancer. The idea is to spot problems early, give lifestyle advice and help keep people from getting sick or dying (reducing \"morbidity\" – illness – and \"mortality\" – death). Many health systems include these checks in preventive care, either through national programmes or private providers.\n\nWhy is it important to understand how people feel about these checks?\nA 2019 Cochrane review of numbers (quantitative studies) found that general health checks have little or no effect on overall death rates or on preventing heart disease and cancer. Even though the hard data show limited benefit, the checks remain popular with patients, doctors, managers and policy makers. To decide whether to keep, change or stop offering them, we need to know what different groups think and feel – their values, worries and the practical factors that help or block the checks. Stopping a service that people value can cause public concern unless good alternatives are offered.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies that explored stakeholder views of general health checks. We combined the study findings using a simple method that looks for common patterns (called a “framework synthesis”, which means we grouped similar ideas together). We also checked how sure we are about each finding using a rating system for qualitative research (the GRADE‑CERQual approach, which tells us how much confidence we have in the results).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 146 primary qualitative studies and carefully selected 36 of them that gave the richest information for detailed analysis. Most studies were from high‑income European countries; about one‑third were from culturally diverse middle‑income settings in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The studies looked at three stakeholder groups: clients (people who attend or consider attending checks), health‑care providers (doctors, nurses, etc.) and policy makers (those who decide whether to fund checks).\n\nClients said the checks often motivate them to improve diet, exercise and other habits, and that professional confirmation gives them peace of mind. Some clients avoid checks because they fear bad news, worry about costs or prefer to seek care only when symptoms appear.\n\nProviders highlighted that skilled, culturally‑competent staff make a big difference to attendance. They also reported that when doctors have to focus on treating people who are already sick (curative care), when staff leave, when there is not enough space or equipment, and when it is unclear how the service will be paid for, it becomes harder to offer the checks.\n\nPolicy makers noted that political climate, stakeholder support and broader social norms influence whether programmes are funded. Cultural background, religion, gender and language also affect how people perceive prevention and whether they attend.\n\nWe found no evidence that the checks harmed participants.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because many studies involved small, diverse groups, participants often knew which tests they received, and there were few studies overall to confirm the findings.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nOur search covered literature up to August 2022. New studies published after that date are not included.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?\nEven though hard data show limited impact on mortality, stakeholders still value general health checks for the motivation and reassurance they provide. Any plan to reduce or stop these checks should offer acceptable alternatives and address the benefits that users and providers attach to them. Future research should use high‑quality qualitative and mixed‑methods designs to explore why policy makers commission checks and how cultural and system factors shape uptake.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check: the subheading **\"Key messages\"** is not phrased as a question, whereas the Master Style Guide requires all section subheadings to be questions. In addition, several clarity problems would likely confuse readers:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – the term *framework synthesis* is introduced without a plain‑language definition. Rewrite to: \"We grouped similar ideas together – a method called a ‘framework synthesis’ – to see what the studies had in common.\"\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"To decide whether to keep, change or stop offering them, we need to know what different groups think and feel – their values, worries and the practical factors that help or block the checks.\" This exceeds 30 words and packs several ideas. Split into two sentences: \"We need to know what different groups think and feel. Their values, worries, and practical factors can help or block the checks.\"\n3. **Passive construction** – \"The evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.\" This is awkward and passive. Rewrite to active: \"Our search covered evidence up to August 2022.\"\n4. **Wordy phrase** – \"Stopping a service that people value can cause public concern unless good alternatives are offered.\" Simplify to: \"Stopping a valued service can upset the public unless we provide clear alternatives.\"\n5. **Complex vocabulary** – terms like *GRADE‑CERQual* and *framework synthesis* increase the complex‑word count (140 complex words, 321 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words, 222 long words) and push the SMOG index to 14.5, well above the typical PLS range. Provide brief plain‑language explanations or replace with simpler wording where possible.\nThese issues, together with the subheading problem, mean the PLS does not meet the required standards.",

However, it deviates markedly on noun density (237 nouns, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.5, beyond P90), and counts of complex words (140), complex Dale‑Chall words (321) and long words (222), all well above typical PLS ranges, indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and lexically complex than usual."
