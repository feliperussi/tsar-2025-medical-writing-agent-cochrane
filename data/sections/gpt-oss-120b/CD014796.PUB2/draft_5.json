  "draft": "What do patients, doctors, and health planners think influences how comprehensive health screenings (general health checks) are planned, delivered, and used?\n\nKey messages\n- Patients, doctors and health planners say that general health checks motivate many people to adopt healthier lifestyles and give reassurance, but fear of bad results, cost worries and a preference for symptom‑based care can discourage attendance.\n- Providers stress that skilled, culturally competent staff are essential and note that time pressures, staff shortages, limited resources and unclear payment arrangements often hinder delivery.\n- Wider cultural, social and political factors – such as norms, religion, language and political support – also shape whether checks are commissioned (planned and funded) and taken up, and the studies we reviewed found no evidence that the checks caused harm.\n\nWhat are general health checks and why are they offered?\nGeneral health checks are routine screening appointments for people who feel healthy and have no symptoms. During a check‑up a health professional may measure blood pressure, test blood sugar, or look for early signs of heart disease or cancer. The idea is to spot problems early, give lifestyle advice, and ultimately keep people from getting sick or dying (this is called reducing \"morbidity\" – illness – and \"mortality\" – death). Many health systems include these checks in preventive care, either through national programmes or private providers.\n\nWhy is it important to understand how people feel about these checks?\nA 2019 Cochrane review of numbers (quantitative studies) found that general health checks have little or no effect on overall death rates or on preventing heart disease and cancer. Even though the hard data show limited benefit, the checks remain popular with patients, doctors, managers and policy makers. We need to know what different groups think and feel about the checks – their values, worries, and what helps or blocks them – before deciding to keep, change, or stop them. Stopping a service that people value can cause public concern unless good alternatives are offered.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies that explored stakeholder views of general health checks. We grouped and compared the themes from the studies using a simple method called a framework synthesis, which helps us see common ideas across research. We assessed how much we can trust each finding using a tool called GRADE‑CERQual, which rates confidence in qualitative evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 146 primary qualitative studies and carefully selected 36 of them that gave the richest information for detailed analysis. Most studies were from high‑income European countries; about one‑third were from culturally diverse middle‑income settings in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The studies looked at three stakeholder groups: clients (people who attend or consider attending checks), health‑care providers (doctors, nurses, etc.) and managers or commissioners (policy makers).\n\nClients said the checks often motivate them to improve diet, exercise and other habits, and that professional confirmation gives them peace of mind. Some clients avoid checks because they fear bad news, worry about costs or prefer to seek care only when symptoms appear.\n\nProviders highlighted that skilled, culturally competent staff make a big difference to attendance. They also reported that when doctors have to focus on treating people who are already sick (curative care), when staff leave, when there is not enough space or equipment, and when it is unclear how the service will be paid for (reimbursement policies), it becomes harder to offer the checks.\n\nManagers and policy makers noted that political climate, stakeholder support and broader social norms influence whether programmes are funded. Cultural background, religion, gender and language also affect how people perceive prevention and whether they attend.\n\nThe studies we looked at did not find any evidence that the checks caused harm to participants.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies relied on participants’ self‑reports, which can be influenced by personal bias. The studies were conducted in varied settings and populations, making it hard to draw firm conclusions for every context. Confidence in some findings is low because few studies examined why managers choose to commission checks.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nOur search covered literature up to August 2022. New studies published after that date are not included.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?\nEven though hard data show limited impact on mortality, stakeholders still value general health checks for the motivation and reassurance they provide. Any plan to reduce or stop these checks should offer acceptable alternatives and address the benefits that users and providers attach to them. Future research should use high‑quality qualitative and mixed‑methods designs to explore why planners commission checks and how cultural and system factors shape uptake.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, word‑count and factual accuracy, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a patient‑focused audience. \n\n1. **Unexplained technical terms** – \"framework synthesis\" and \"GRADE‑CERQual\" appear without any plain‑language definition. Readers may not understand what these methods involve. \n   - *Quote*: \"We grouped and compared the themes from the studies using a simple method called a framework synthesis, which helps us see common ideas across research. We assessed how much we can trust each finding using a tool called GRADE‑CERQual, which rates confidence in qualitative evidence.\"\n   - *Problem*: The terms are introduced but not explained in everyday language; the sentence is still dense. \n   - *Rewrite*: \"We grouped the ideas from the studies using a simple method that looks for common patterns (called a framework synthesis). We then checked how confident we are in each finding with a rating system for qualitative research (called GRADE‑CERQual).\"\n\n2. **Overly long, complex sentence in the limitations section** – the sentence packs several ideas and uses abstract wording, making it hard to follow. \n   - *Quote*: \"We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\"\n   - *Problem*: >30 words, multiple clauses, and vague phrasing (\"different types of people\"). \n   - *Rewrite*: \"We are not very confident in the evidence. In many studies, participants knew what treatment they received, the groups studied were very different, and there were too few studies to be sure of the results.\"\n\n3. **Passive‑voice and noun‑heavy wording** – the draft uses passive constructions and many nouns, which the metrics flag (20 passive instances, 22 nominalisations, 243 nouns). This makes the text feel dense. \n   - *Quote*: \"The studies we looked at did not find any evidence that the checks caused harm to participants.\"\n   - *Problem*: Passive‑voice obscures who did the checking and adds to noun load. \n   - *Rewrite*: \"We found no evidence that the checks harmed participants.\"\n\n4. **Title is long and includes parentheses** – while phrased as a question, the title could be clearer and shorter for patients. \n   - *Quote*: \"What do patients, doctors, and health planners think influences how comprehensive health screenings (general health checks) are planned, delivered, and used?\"\n   - *Problem*: The parentheses break the flow and the title is wordy. \n   - *Rewrite*: \"What do patients, doctors and planners think influences how health checks are planned, delivered and used?\"\n\nThese issues reduce readability despite the overall good metric scores for readability indices. Addressing them will bring the draft in line with Cochrane plain‑language standards and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count (796 words) and most readability indices are within typical PLS ranges (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 48.8, FK‑grade 11.7). However, several metrics deviate strongly: passive_voice (20, P90), nominalisation (22, P90), nouns (243, beyond P90), SMOG (15.1, beyond P90), complex_words_dc (334, beyond P90), complex_words (152, beyond P90) and long_words (239, beyond P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy sentences and many complex/long words, supporting the editorial recommendation to simplify language, use active voice and reduce noun density."
