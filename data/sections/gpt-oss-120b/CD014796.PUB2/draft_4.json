  "draft": "What do patients, doctors, and health planners think influences how comprehensive health screenings (general health checks) are planned, delivered, and used?\n\nKey messages\n- Patients, doctors and health planners say that general health checks motivate many people to adopt healthier lifestyles and give reassurance, but fear of bad results, cost worries and a preference for symptom‑based care can discourage attendance.\n- Providers stress that skilled, culturally competent staff are essential and note that time pressures, staff shortages, limited resources and unclear payment arrangements often hinder delivery.\n- Wider cultural, social and political factors – such as norms, religion, language and political support – also shape whether checks are commissioned (planned and funded) and taken up, and the studies we reviewed found no evidence that the checks caused harm.\n\nWhat are general health checks and why are they offered?\nGeneral health checks are routine screening appointments for people who feel healthy and have no symptoms. During a check‑up a health professional may measure blood pressure, test blood sugar, or look for early signs of heart disease or cancer. The aim is to spot problems early, give lifestyle advice, and ultimately keep people from getting sick or dying (reducing \"morbidity\" – illness – and \"mortality\" – death). Many health systems include these checks in preventive care, either through national programmes or private providers.\n\nWhy is it important to understand how people feel about these checks?\nA 2019 Cochrane review of numbers (quantitative studies) found that general health checks have little or no effect on overall death rates or on preventing heart disease and cancer. Even though the hard data show limited benefit, the checks remain popular with patients, doctors, managers and policy makers. To decide whether to keep, change or stop offering them, we need to know what different groups think and experience – their values, worries and the practical factors that help or hinder the checks. Stopping a service that people value can cause public concern unless good alternatives are offered.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies that explored stakeholder views of general health checks. We combined the findings using a framework synthesis (a method that groups and compares themes across studies) and we rated our confidence in each finding with the GRADE‑CERQual approach (an established system for judging how much trust we can place in qualitative evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 146 primary qualitative studies and examined a purposive sample of 36 studies in detail. Most studies were from high‑income European countries; about one‑third were from culturally diverse middle‑income settings in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The studies looked at three stakeholder groups: clients (people who attend or consider attending checks), health‑care providers (doctors, nurses, etc.) and managers or commissioners (policy makers).\n\nClients said the checks often motivate them to improve diet, exercise and other habits, and that professional confirmation gives them peace of mind. Some clients avoid checks because they fear bad news, worry about costs or prefer to seek care only when symptoms appear.\n\nProviders highlighted that skilled, culturally competent staff make a big difference to attendance. They also reported that when doctors have to focus on treating people who are already sick (curative care), when staff leave, when there is not enough space or equipment, and when it is unclear how the service will be paid for (reimbursement policies), it becomes harder to offer the checks.\n\nManagers and policy makers noted that political climate, stakeholder support and broader social norms influence whether programmes are funded. Cultural background, religion, gender and language also affect how people perceive prevention and whether they attend.\n\nThe studies we looked at did not find any evidence that the checks caused harm to participants.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies relied on participants’ self‑reports, which can be influenced by personal bias. The studies were conducted in varied settings and populations, making it hard to draw firm conclusions for every context. Confidence in some findings is low because few studies examined why managers choose to commission checks.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nOur search covered literature up to August 2022. New studies published after that date are not included.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?\nEven though hard data show limited impact on mortality, stakeholders still value general health checks for the motivation and reassurance they provide. Any plan to reduce or stop these checks should offer acceptable alternatives and address the benefits that users and providers attach to them. Future research should use high‑quality qualitative and mixed‑methods designs to explore why planners commission checks and how cultural and system factors shape uptake.",

Problem: The phrase “framework synthesis” is jargon; readers may not understand what the method does. Rewrite: “We grouped and compared the themes from the studies using a simple method called a framework synthesis, which helps us see common ideas across research.”\n2. **Unexplained technical term – “GRADE‑CERQual”.** Quote: “we rated our confidence in each finding with the GRADE‑CERQual approach (an established... )”. Problem: Even with the brief parenthesis, the acronym remains opaque. Rewrite: “We assessed how much we can trust each finding using a tool called GRADE‑CERQual, which rates the confidence in qualitative evidence.”\n3. **Jargon – “purposive sample”.** Quote: “We identified 146 primary qualitative studies and examined a purposive sample of 36 studies in detail.” Problem: “Purposive sample” is a research term that may be unclear. Rewrite: “We identified 146 studies and carefully selected 36 of them that gave the richest information for detailed analysis.”\n4. **Long, dense sentence in the “Why is it important…” section.** Quote: “To decide whether to keep, change or stop offering them, we need to know what the different groups think and experience – their values, worries, and the practical factors that help or hinder the checks.” Problem: 33 words; combines several ideas, making it hard to follow. Rewrite: “We need to know what different groups think and feel about the checks – their values, worries, and what helps or blocks them – before deciding to keep, change, or stop them.”\n5. **Heavy noun‑laden sentences (e.g., “The evidence suggests that clients appreciated a comprehensive approach, with various tests.”).** Problem: Noun‑heavy phrasing reduces readability and contributes to high noun count (248, beyond typical range). Rewrite: “Clients liked that the checks looked at many health areas and included several tests.”\nThese changes address the most confusing jargon, overly technical language, and long sentences, bringing the text closer to plain‑language standards. The PLS evaluation shows high scores for nominalisation, noun count, SMOG, complex‑word and long‑word metrics, confirming the need to simplify wording and use more verbs. Overall, while the structure and factual content are sound, the identified clarity issues are significant enough to require revision before the summary can be considered patient‑friendly.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count (790 words) and most readability indices are within typical PLS ranges, but it deviates strongly on several complexity metrics: nominalisation (22 vs median <13), noun count (248 vs median <116), SMOG (15.1 vs median <12.1), complex words (152 vs median <84), complex Dale‑Chall words (332 vs median <160) and long words (242 vs median <122). These indicate excessive noun‑heavy, technical language that hampers plain‑language readability."
