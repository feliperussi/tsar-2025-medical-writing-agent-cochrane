  "draft": "What do patients, doctors and planners think influences how health checks are planned, delivered and used?\n\nKey messages\n- Patients, doctors and planners say that health checks can motivate people to eat better, exercise more and feel reassured, but fear of bad results, worries about cost and a preference for symptom‑based care can stop people attending.\n- Providers stress that skilled, culturally‑aware staff are essential, while time pressures, staff shortages, limited resources and unclear payment rules often make delivery difficult.\n- Wider cultural, social and political factors – such as community norms, religion, language and government support – also shape whether health checks are funded and taken up, and the studies we reviewed found no evidence that the checks cause harm.\n\nWhat are general health checks and why are they offered?\nGeneral health checks are routine screening appointments for people who feel healthy and have no symptoms. During a check‑up a health professional may measure blood pressure, test blood sugar or look for early signs of heart disease or cancer. The aim is to spot problems early, give lifestyle advice and help keep people from getting sick or dying (reducing \"morbidity\" – illness – and \"mortality\" – death). Many health systems include these checks in preventive care, either through national programmes or private providers.\n\nWhy is it important to understand how people feel about these checks?\nA 2019 Cochrane review of numbers (quantitative studies) found that general health checks have little or no effect on overall death rates or on preventing heart disease and cancer. Even though the hard data show limited benefit, the checks remain popular with patients, doctors, managers and policy makers. To decide whether to keep, change or stop offering them, we need to know what different groups think and feel – their values, worries and the practical factors that help or block the checks. Stopping a service that people value can cause public concern unless good alternatives are offered.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies that explored stakeholder views of general health checks. We combined the ideas from the studies using a simple method that looks for common patterns (called a framework synthesis). We then checked how confident we are in each finding with a rating system for qualitative research (called GRADE‑CERQual).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 146 primary qualitative studies and carefully selected 36 of them that gave the richest information for detailed analysis. Most studies were from high‑income European countries; about one‑third were from culturally diverse middle‑income settings in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The studies looked at three stakeholder groups: clients (people who attend or consider attending checks), health‑care providers (doctors, nurses, etc.) and managers or commissioners (policy makers).\n\nClients said the checks often motivate them to improve diet, exercise and other habits, and that professional confirmation gives them peace of mind. Some clients avoid checks because they fear bad news, worry about costs or prefer to seek care only when symptoms appear.\n\nProviders highlighted that skilled, culturally competent staff make a big difference to attendance. They also reported that when doctors have to focus on treating people who are already sick (curative care), when staff leave, when there is not enough space or equipment, and when it is unclear how the service will be paid for, it becomes harder to offer the checks.\n\nManagers and policy makers noted that political climate, stakeholder support and broader social norms influence whether programmes are funded. Cultural background, religion, gender and language also affect how people perceive prevention and whether they attend.\n\nThe studies we looked at found no evidence that the checks harmed participants.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not very confident in the evidence. In many studies participants knew what treatment they received, the groups studied were very different, and there were too few studies to be sure of the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nOur search covered literature up to August 2022. New studies published after that date are not included.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?\nEven though hard data show limited impact on mortality, stakeholders still value general health checks for the motivation and reassurance they provide. Any plan to reduce or stop these checks should offer acceptable alternatives and address the benefits that users and providers attach to them. Future research should use high‑quality qualitative and mixed‑methods designs to explore why planners commission checks and how cultural and system factors shape uptake.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several passages that would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained technical terms** – the methods paragraph mentions “framework synthesis” and “GRADE‑CERQual” without any plain‑language definition, leaving readers unsure what was actually done.\n2. **Overly long bullet points** – the three key‑message bullets each contain more than 30 words and pack several ideas together, making them hard to scan.\n3. **Vague statement of confidence** – “We are not very confident in the evidence” is vague and does not explain why confidence is low, which is important for readers to understand the strength of the findings.\n4. **Inconsistent terminology** – the draft switches between “policy makers”, “planners” and “managers”, which can confuse readers about who is being referred to.\n5. **Noun‑heavy sentences** – the text uses many abstract nouns (e.g., “implementation”, “assessment”, “evaluation”), contributing to a high noun count (231) and reducing readability.\n\nSuggested concrete rewrites:\n- **Technical terms:** Replace the original sentence with: “We combined the study findings using a simple method that looks for common patterns (called a ‘framework synthesis’, which means we grouped similar ideas together). We also checked how sure we are about each finding using a rating system for qualitative research (the GRADE‑CERQual approach, which tells us how much confidence we have in the results).”\n- **Key‑message bullets:** Split each bullet into two shorter points. For example, the first bullet could become:\n  - “Patients, doctors and planners say health checks can motivate people to eat better, exercise more and feel reassured.”\n  - “However, fear of bad results, worries about cost and a preference for symptom‑based care can stop people attending.”\n- **Confidence statement:** Rewrite as: “We have low confidence in the evidence because many studies involved small, diverse groups, participants often knew which tests they received, and there were few studies overall to confirm the findings.”\n- **Consistent terminology:** Choose one term (e.g., “policy makers”) and use it throughout. Change “planners” in the title to “policy makers” and replace “managers” with “policy makers” in the relevant paragraph.\n- **Reduce noun density:** Turn noun‑heavy phrases into active verbs. For instance, change “The studies we looked at found no evidence that the checks harmed participants.” to “We found no evidence that the checks harmed participants.”\n\nThese changes address the three priority clarity issues and also improve the style metrics (reducing passive voice, noun count, and complex words).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights deviations in noun count (231, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.4, beyond P90), complex words (136, beyond P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (307, beyond P90) and long words (222, beyond P90). These indicate the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many long or complex words, supporting the need to simplify language, shorten sentences, and replace abstract nouns with active verbs."
