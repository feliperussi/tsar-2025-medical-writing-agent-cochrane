  "draft": "What do patients, doctors, and health planners think influences how comprehensive health screenings (general health checks) are planned, delivered, and used?\n\nKey messages\n- Patients, doctors and health planners say that general health checks motivate many people to adopt healthier lifestyles and give reassurance, but fear of bad results, cost worries and a preference for symptom‑based care can discourage attendance.\n- Providers highlight the need for skilled, culturally competent staff and note that time pressures, staff shortages, limited resources and unclear payment arrangements often hinder delivery.\n- Wider cultural, social and political factors – such as norms, religion, language and political support – also shape whether checks are commissioned and taken up, and the studies we reviewed did not find any evidence that the checks caused harm.\n\nWhat are general health checks and why are they offered?\nGeneral health checks are routine screening appointments for people who feel healthy and have no symptoms. During a check‑up a health professional may measure blood pressure, test blood sugar, or look for early signs of heart disease or cancer. The idea is to spot problems early, give advice on lifestyle, and ultimately keep people from getting sick or dying (this is called reducing \"morbidity\" – illness – and \"mortality\" – death). Many health systems include these checks in preventive care, either through national programmes or private providers.\n\nWhy is it important to understand how people feel about these checks?\nA 2019 Cochrane review of numbers (quantitative studies) found that general health checks have little or no effect on overall death rates or on preventing heart disease and cancer. Even though the hard data show limited benefit, the checks remain popular with patients, doctors, managers and policy makers. To decide whether to keep, change or stop offering them, we need to know what different groups think and experience – their values, worries and the practical factors that help or hinder the checks. Stopping a service that people value can cause public concern unless good alternatives are offered.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies that explored stakeholder views of general health checks. We combined the findings using a framework synthesis and rated our confidence in each finding with the GRADE‑CERQual approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 146 primary qualitative studies and examined a purposive sample of 36 studies in detail. Most studies were from high‑income European countries; about one‑third were from culturally diverse middle‑income settings in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The studies looked at three stakeholder groups: clients (people who attend or consider attending checks), health‑care providers (doctors, nurses, etc.) and managers or commissioners (policy makers).\n\nClients said the checks often motivate them to improve diet, exercise and other habits, and that professional confirmation gives them peace of mind. Some clients avoid checks because they fear bad news, worry about costs or prefer to seek care only when symptoms appear.\n\nProviders stressed that skilled, culturally competent staff make a big difference to attendance. They also reported that when doctors have to focus on treating people who are already sick (curative care), when staff leave, when there is not enough space or equipment, and when it is unclear how the service will be paid for (reimbursement policies), it becomes harder to offer the checks.\n\nManagers and policy makers noted that political climate, stakeholder support and broader social norms influence whether programmes are funded. Cultural background, religion, gender and language also affect how people perceive prevention and whether they attend.\n\nThe studies we looked at did not find any evidence that the checks caused harm to participants.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies relied on participants’ self‑reports, which can be influenced by personal bias. The studies were conducted in varied settings and populations, making it hard to draw firm conclusions for every context. Confidence in some findings is low because few studies examined why managers choose to commission checks.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nOur search covered literature up to August 2022. New studies published after that date are not included.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?\nEven though hard data show limited impact on mortality, stakeholders still value general health checks for the motivation and reassurance they provide. Any plan to reduce or stop these checks should offer acceptable alternatives and address the benefits that users and providers attach to them. Future research should use high‑quality qualitative and mixed‑methods designs to explore why planners commission checks and how cultural and system factors shape uptake.",

These issues reduce readability despite acceptable word count and factual accuracy. The top improvements needed are: define jargon, split long sentences, and simplify wording while reducing noun‑heavy constructions.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits and has good active voice (104) and pronoun use (42). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in several vocabulary‑complexity metrics: nominalizations (21, beyond P90), nouns (241, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.8, beyond P90), complex words (145, beyond P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (319, beyond P90) and long words (235, beyond P90). These indicate the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many complex words, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalizations."
