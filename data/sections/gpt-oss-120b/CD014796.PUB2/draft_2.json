  "draft": "What do patients, doctors, and health planners think influences how comprehensive health screenings (general health checks) are planned, delivered, and used?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Patients, doctors and health planners say that general health checks motivate many people to adopt healthier lifestyles and give reassurance, but fear of bad results, cost worries and a preference for symptom‑based care can discourage attendance.\n- Providers highlight the need for skilled, culturally competent staff and note that time pressures, staff shortages, limited resources and reimbursement issues often hinder delivery.\n- Wider cultural, social and political factors – such as norms, religion, language and political support – also shape whether checks are commissioned and taken up, and no specific harmful effects were reported.\n\nWhy did we do this review?\nWe know that a 2019 Cochrane review of quantitative studies found little or no effect of general health checks on overall death rates or on preventing heart disease and cancer. Yet the checks remain popular with patients, clinicians, managers and policy makers. To decide whether to keep, change or stop these checks, we need to understand what different groups value, fear and experience.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies that explored stakeholder views of general health checks. We purposefully selected a diverse set of 36 studies from the 146 that met our criteria. The studies came mainly from high‑income European countries, with about one‑third from culturally diverse middle‑income settings in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. Participants included clients (people who attend or consider attending checks), health‑care providers (doctors, nurses, etc.) and managers or commissioners (policy makers).\n\nWhat did we find?\nClients often said that checks motivated them to improve diet, exercise and other habits, and that receiving professional confirmation gave them peace of mind. However, some avoided checks because they feared bad news, worried about costs or preferred to seek care only when symptoms appeared.\nProviders stressed that skilled, culturally competent staff make a big difference to attendance. They also reported that competing demands from curative care, staff turnover, limited space, equipment problems and unclear reimbursement policies reduced their ability to deliver checks.\nManagers and policy makers noted that political climate, stakeholder support and broader social norms influence whether programmes are funded. Cultural background, religion, gender and language also affect how people perceive prevention and whether they attend.\nOverall, no specific harmful effects of the checks were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies relied on participants’ self‑reports, which can be influenced by personal bias. The studies were conducted in varied settings and populations, making it hard to draw firm conclusions for every context. Confidence in some findings is low because few studies examined certain aspects, such as why managers choose to commission checks.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nOur search covered literature up to August 2022. New studies published after that date are not included.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?\nEven though hard data show limited impact on mortality, stakeholders still value general health checks for the motivation and reassurance they provide. Any plan to reduce or stop these checks should offer acceptable alternatives and address the benefits that users and providers attach to them. Future research should use high‑quality qualitative and mixed‑methods designs to explore why planners commission checks and how cultural and system factors shape uptake.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical clarity check because it uses several technical terms without explanation and includes ambiguous statements that could confuse a lay reader. Specifically:\n\n1. **Undefined term** – \"general health checks\" (or \"comprehensive health screenings\") is used repeatedly without a plain-language definition. Readers may not know what these checks involve. *Rewrite*: \"General health checks are routine screening appointments for people who feel healthy and have no symptoms. During a check‑up a health professional may measure blood pressure, test blood sugar, or look for early signs of heart disease or cancer.\"\n\n2. **Jargon** – phrases like \"curative care\" and \"reimbursement policies\" are not explained. This can leave readers unsure about what barriers providers face. *Rewrite*: \"They also reported that when doctors have to focus on treating people who are already sick (curative care), when staff leave, when there is not enough space or equipment, and when it is unclear how the service will be paid for, it becomes harder to offer the checks.\"\n\n3. **Ambiguous statement** – \"no specific harmful effects were reported\" may be read as \"we did not look for harms\" rather than \"the studies did not find any harms.\" Clarify the meaning. *Rewrite*: \"The studies we looked at did not find any evidence that the checks caused harm to participants.\"\n\nThese issues are supported by the metric analysis, which shows unusually high lexical complexity (nouns = 181, complex_words = 127, complex_words_dc = 254, smog_index = 14.2, long_words = 196). The high noun and complex-word counts reflect the use of technical language that should be simplified for a patient audience. Reducing jargon and adding clear definitions will bring the draft into better alignment with typical PLS readability patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights five deviations: noun count (181 > median ≈ 116), smog index (14.2 > median ≈ 12.1), complex_words_dc (254 > median ≈ 160), complex_words (127 > median ≈ 84), and long_words (196 > median ≈ 122). These indicate the draft is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex, long words than typical Cochrane PLS texts, supporting the need to simplify language and define technical terms."
