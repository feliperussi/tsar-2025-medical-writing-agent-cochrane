  "key_messages": [
    "Using a combination of nicotine replacement products (for example, a fast‑acting form such as gum together with a patch) appears to increase the chances of quitting smoking compared with using a single product, and higher‑dose patches may work better than lower‑dose patches; starting nicotine replacement before the quit day (preloading) may also improve quit rates, while fast‑acting forms alone give similar results to patches. Unwanted side effects were reported only occasionally, with overall low rates, though one study found more people stopped treatment when using a nasal spray compared with a patch, and safety data across studies were limited.",
    "The length of time people use nicotine patches or combination therapy, and the specific type of fast‑acting product (gum, lozenge, spray, etc.) did not show clear differences in quitting success, indicating that current evidence does not identify an optimal duration or specific fast‑acting form.",
    "More high‑quality research is needed to determine the best dose, duration, and specific form of nicotine replacement therapy, especially studies that carefully track side effects and treatment withdrawals, to provide clearer guidance for people trying to quit smoking."

      "subheading": "Why is quitting smoking a health priority and how is nicotine replacement therapy used?",
      "content": "Smoking causes many serious illnesses such as heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic lung problems. Because of this, helping people stop smoking is a major public‑health goal. When a person stops smoking, they experience cravings and withdrawal symptoms caused by nicotine, the addictive substance in cigarettes. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a group of medicines that provide a small, controlled amount of nicotine without the harmful smoke. By easing cravings, NRT makes it easier for people to move from smoking to staying completely smoke‑free. NRT comes in several forms—patches that stick to the skin, gum, lozenges, sprays, or inhalers—and can be used at different strengths (doses) and for different lengths of time. While overall evidence shows that NRT helps people quit, it is not clear which form, dose, duration, or timing (for example, starting NRT before the quit day, known as “preloading”) works best."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to discover about nicotine replacement? (NRT)",
      "content": "The authors wanted to find out which specific ways of using NRT are most effective and safe for helping people stay quit for at least six months. They compared different forms of NRT (fast‑acting products like gum or spray versus a patch), different doses (how much nicotine each product delivers), different durations (how long the treatment is continued), and different schedules, including whether starting NRT before the quit day (preloading) improves success. Their goal was to determine which combinations give the best chance of long‑term quitting and whether any of these approaches cause more side effects or lead to people stopping the treatment early."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 68 randomised trials that together included 43,327 motivated adult smokers who wanted to quit. All trials measured smoking abstinence at least six months after treatment began. Participants were adults recruited from community settings or health clinics in many different countries. The studies compared a range of nicotine‑replacement therapy (NRT) approaches, including single‑form NRT, a combination of a fast‑acting product (gum, lozenge, or nasal spray) plus a patch, different patch doses, and starting NRT before the quit day versus on the quit day."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Combination fast‑acting nicotine product plus patch improves quit rates",
      "content": "High‑certainty evidence shows that using a fast‑acting nicotine product together with a nicotine patch increases the chance of quitting compared with using a single form of NRT. Roughly, if about 10 out of 100 people quit with a single form, about 13 out of 100 quit when the combination is used."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
