  "draft": "What are the benefits and drawbacks of healthcare workers using their own cell phones and other personal devices (such as smartphones or tablets) to support their work?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Using personal phones makes staff more flexible, efficient and responsive, and can help them personalise care while keeping some patient information out of formal systems.\n- Personal device use can cost workers money, create pressure to work out‑of‑hours, and raise the risk of sharing private health information without proper protection.\n- The practice can increase differences between staff who can afford devices and those who cannot, and it creates an unofficial “shadow IT” system that is not recorded in the formal health‑information system.\n\nWhy do healthcare workers sometimes use their own mobile phones at work?\nIn many facilities the official ways to talk to colleagues, share patient information or organise care are weak, missing or hard to use. To keep patients safe and get their jobs done, we turn to the phones and tablets we already own. By calling, texting or using apps on personal devices we can quickly get advice, arrange appointments or share urgent information. This makes care more flexible, personal and responsive – for example, a nurse can call a doctor directly instead of waiting for a slow pager.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to explore what healthcare workers, managers and other professionals think and do when they use personal mobile phones or other devices to support their work. We wanted to gather qualitative evidence about experiences, motivations, benefits and challenges of these informal, innovative uses of mobile technology across different countries and health‑care settings.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus for studies published since 2008. We also performed citation searches and contacted authors for additional data. We included qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that examined workers’ views, experiences and practices of informal mobile device use. We extracted the data, performed a thematic synthesis and rated our confidence in each finding using the GRADE‑CERQual approach, a method that helps us judge how reliable the evidence is.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 30 qualitative or mixed‑methods studies published between 2013 and 2022. The studies came from high‑, middle‑ and low‑income countries and covered many health‑care settings and worker cadres.\nThe evidence suggests that using personal phones makes work more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs. Staff also say it strengthens relationships with patients and colleagues. At the same time, personal device use adds personal costs for workers – especially those with lower pay – and can increase the risk of breaching patient confidentiality. It may also create inequities because some staff can afford devices and airtime while others cannot. The practice also creates a parallel “shadow IT” system (technology used unofficially that is not recorded in the formal health‑information system).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings because all the included work was qualitative and varied in setting and quality. The review does not give detailed information about the number, age or gender of participants, nor about funding or study duration.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022, the date of our most recent database search.\n\nWhat does this mean for us?\nWe see that informal use of personal devices can help healthcare workers deliver care that is more human‑centred and timely. However, the practice can place financial burdens on staff, threaten patient privacy and reinforce existing inequalities. Future research should explore how formal health‑system solutions can keep the advantages while reducing costs, privacy risks and distractions. Policies should support safe, equitable integration of personal technology into routine care. The term “street‑level bureaucrat” refers to front‑line staff who must deliver services despite limited resources and who often create their own solutions to fill gaps in the system.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is missing a required sub‑heading that states how up‑to‑date the review is, which should be phrased as a question (e.g., “How up to date is this review?”). This fails the critical completeness check. In addition, several clarity issues could confuse readers: (1) technical terms such as “shadow IT” and “street‑level bureaucrat” are used without explanation; (2) a few sentences are long and dense, making them hard to follow; (3) the text contains many complex and long words, contributing to a high SMOG (14.05) and very high counts of complex words (134) and unfamiliar Dale‑Chall words (300), which reduce readability. Suggested rewrites and simplifications are provided below. Addressing these points and adding the missing currency sub‑heading will bring the PLS into full compliance with the style guide and improve readability.\n\n**Top improvements needed:**\n1. **Missing currency sub‑heading** – Add a question‑style heading:\n   - *Current:* (none)\n   - *Rewrite:* **How up to date is this review?**\n   - *Why:* Required section is absent; the style guide mandates a question‑framed sub‑heading.\n2. **Unexplained jargon – “shadow IT”**\n   - *Current:* “It also creates an unofficial “shadow IT” system that is not recorded in the formal health‑information system.”\n   - *Rewrite:* “It also creates an unofficial ‘shadow IT’ system – technology that is used outside the official health‑information system and therefore isn’t recorded.”\n   - *Why:* Readers may not know what “shadow IT” means; a brief definition clarifies the term.\n3. **Unexplained jargon – “street‑level bureaucrat”**\n   - *Current:* “The term “street‑level bureaucrat” refers to front‑line staff who must deliver services despite limited resources and who often create their own solutions to fill gaps in the system.”\n   - *Rewrite:* “We use the term ‘street‑level bureaucrat’ to describe front‑line staff who must deliver services with limited resources and often create their own solutions to fill gaps.”\n   - *Why:* The definition is split across two sentences and uses complex wording; a concise definition improves clarity.\n4. **Long, dense sentence in Methods**\n   - *Current:* “We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus for studies published since 2008. We also performed citation searches and contacted authors for additional data. We included qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that examined workers’ views, experiences and practices of informal mobile device use. We extracted the data, performed a thematic synthesis and rated our confidence in each finding using the GRADE‑CERQual approach, a method that helps us judge how reliable the evidence is.”\n   - *Rewrite:* “We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus for studies published since 2008, and we also did citation searches and contacted authors for extra data. We included qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that looked at workers’ views, experiences and practices of informal mobile‑device use. We then extracted the data, performed a thematic synthesis, and used the GRADE‑CERQual approach to judge how reliable each finding is.”\n   - *Why:* Breaking the paragraph into shorter sentences reduces cognitive load.\n5. **Reduce complex and long words** – Replace high‑syllable terms such as “informal”, “implementation”, “confidentiality”, “inequities” with simpler alternatives where possible (e.g., “unofficial”, “use”, “privacy”, “unfair differences”). This will lower the SMOG index and the count of complex/unfamiliar words (currently SMOG 14.05, complex 134, unfamiliar 300), bringing the text closer to typical PLS ranges.\n\n**Metrics support:** The evaluation shows unusually high counts of nouns (184 → P90), SMOG index (14.05 → P90), complex words (134 → P90) and especially unfamiliar Dale‑Chall words (300 → BEYOND P90). These numbers confirm the need to simplify wording and reduce noun‑heavy sentences. The draft’s passive voice count (8 → P25) and active voice (87 → P75) are acceptable, but the identified clarity issues stem mainly from jargon and sentence length rather than voice. By adding the missing “How up to date is this review?” heading, defining technical terms, shortening long sentences, and simplifying vocabulary, the PLS will meet all critical checks and align better with typical readability metrics.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets most metric norms (low passive voice, good active voice, acceptable readability scores) but deviates strongly on noun count (184 → P90), SMOG (14.05 → P90), complex words (134 → P90) and especially unfamiliar Dale‑Chall words (300 → BEYOND P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long or technical words, suggesting a need to simplify language. The missing “How up to date is this review?” sub‑heading also fails a critical completeness check."
