  "draft": "What are the benefits and drawbacks of healthcare workers using their own cell phones and other personal devices (such as smartphones or tablets) to support their work?\n\nKey messages\n- Healthcare workers who use their own phones or other personal devices can be more flexible, efficient and responsive, helping them to personalise care and keep some patient information out of formal systems, but this practice also brings several drawbacks such as personal cost (money they have to spend, especially for low‑paid staff), pressure to work outside normal hours (out‑of‑hours), risk of breaking patient confidentiality (sharing private health information without proper protection), and the potential to increase inequities (unfair differences) among staff.\n- In many settings this informal use has become routine and workers feel pressure from colleagues or managers to rely on their own devices, which can reinforce existing social hierarchies (differences in status or power) and create a parallel ‘shadow IT’ system (technology used unofficially that is not recorded in the formal health‑information system).\n- Future work should explore how formal health‑system solutions can keep the advantages of personal device use while reducing the costs, privacy risks and distractions they cause, and more research is needed on long‑term effects, equity impacts and safe ways to integrate personal technology into routine care.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhy do healthcare workers sometimes use their own mobile phones at work?\nIn many health facilities, the official systems for talking to colleagues, sharing patient information, or organising care are weak, missing, or hard to use. To keep patients safe and get their jobs done, staff often turn to the phones and tablets they already own. By calling, texting, or using apps on their personal devices, they can quickly get advice, arrange appointments, or share urgent information. This can make care more flexible, personal and responsive – for example, a nurse can call a doctor directly instead of waiting for a slow pager system. However, because these practices are not part of the workplace rules, they can also create problems: workers may have to pay for calls or data themselves, especially those on low salaries; patient privacy can be at risk if personal phones store health details; and reliance on informal “shadow IT” (technology that operates outside the official system) can lead to missing records and unequal care. The term “street‑level bureaucrat” describes frontline staff who must deliver services despite limited resources, often inventing their own solutions to fill gaps in the system.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors set out to explore what health‑care workers, their managers and other professionals think and do when they use personal mobile phones or other devices to support their work. Specifically, they wanted to gather and synthesize qualitative evidence about the experiences, motivations, benefits and challenges of these informal, innovative uses of mobile technology across different countries and health‑care settings.\n\nMethods\nMethods\nWe searched databases for studies that examined healthcare workers’ views, experiences and practices of informal mobile device use, extracted and thematically synthesized their findings, and rated our confidence in each finding using the GRADE‑CERQual approach.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 30 qualitative or mixed‑methods studies published between 2013 and 2022 that explored healthcare workers’ informal use of personal mobile phones and other devices. All of the work was qualitative in nature, and the studies were carried out in a wide range of settings across high‑, middle‑ and low‑income countries, involving many different types of healthcare environments and worker cadres. The abstract does not give the total number of participants, their ages, genders, professional roles, or details about funding, study duration, or specific countries.\n\nThe evidence suggests that when healthcare workers use their own mobile phones and personal networks, it probably makes their work more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs, and they often feel it strengthens relationships with patients and colleagues. At the same time, this informal use probably adds personal costs for workers—especially those with lower pay—and can increase the risk of breaching patient confidentiality and creating inequities in care. Overall, informal mobile phone use appears to bring both important benefits and notable drawbacks for health services.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because...\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence and search are up to date to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical style checks: subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\"), which breaches the Master Style Guide. Additionally, the text contains several clarity problems that would confuse readers: (1) unexplained jargon such as “shadow IT” and “street‑level bureaucrat” is used without definition; (2) many sentences exceed 30 words, making them hard to follow (e.g., the first bullet in the Key messages section); (3) the writing is noun‑heavy and includes long, complex sentences, reflected in the metrics (words per sentence 33.2, nouns 215, Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 32.6, Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 16.97). These issues reduce readability (metrics show the draft is beyond the 90th percentile for most readability indices). To meet Cochrane PLS standards, the draft needs to (a) rewrite all subheadings as questions; (b) introduce brief plain‑language definitions for technical terms; (c) split long sentences into shorter ones (target 15‑20 words); and (d) replace noun‑heavy phrasing with active verbs and simpler words. Addressing these points will bring the draft into the typical PLS pattern range and improve patient‑facing clarity.",
