  "draft": "What are the benefits and drawbacks of healthcare workers using their own cell phones and other personal devices (such as smartphones or tablets) to support their work?\n\nKey messages\n- Using personal phones makes staff more flexible, efficient and responsive, and can help them personalise care and keep some patient information out of formal systems.\n- Personal device use can cost workers money, create pressure to work out‑of‑hours, and raise the risk of breaking patient confidentiality (sharing private health information without proper protection).\n- The practice can widen inequities between staff who can afford devices and those who cannot, and it often creates an unofficial technology system that is not recorded in the formal health‑information system.\n\nWhy do healthcare workers sometimes use their own mobile phones at work?\nIn many facilities the official ways to talk to colleagues, share patient information or organise care are weak, missing or hard to use. To keep patients safe and get their jobs done, we turn to the phones and tablets we already own. By calling, texting or using apps on personal devices we can quickly get advice, arrange appointments or share urgent information. This makes care more flexible, personal and responsive – for example, a nurse can call a doctor directly instead of waiting for a slow pager.\nBecause these practices are not part of workplace rules, they can also create problems. Workers may have to pay for calls or data themselves, especially those on low salaries. Patient privacy can be at risk if personal phones store health details. Relying on unofficial technology that is not recorded in the formal health‑information system can lead to missing records and unequal care. The term “street‑level bureaucrat” describes front‑line staff who must deliver services despite limited resources and who often create their own solutions.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to explore what healthcare workers, managers and other professionals think and do when they use personal mobile phones or other devices to support their work. Specifically, we wanted to gather qualitative evidence about the experiences, motivations, benefits and challenges of these informal, innovative uses of mobile technology across different countries and health‑care settings.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus for studies published since 2008. We also performed citation searches and contacted authors for additional data. We included qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that examined workers’ views, experiences and practices of informal mobile device use. We extracted the data, performed a thematic synthesis and rated our confidence in each finding using the GRADE‑CERQual approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 30 qualitative or mixed‑methods studies published between 2013 and 2022. The studies came from high‑, middle‑ and low‑income countries and covered many health‑care settings and worker cadres.\nThe evidence suggests that using personal phones makes work more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs. Staff also say it strengthens their relationships with patients and colleagues. At the same time, personal device use adds personal costs for workers – especially those with lower pay – and can increase the risk of breaching patient confidentiality. It may also create inequities because some staff can afford devices and airtime while others cannot.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings because all the included work was qualitative and varied in setting and quality. The review does not provide detailed information about the number, age or gender of participants, nor about funding or study duration.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022, the date of our most recent database search.\n\nWhat does this mean for us?\nWe see that informal use of personal devices can help healthcare workers deliver care that is more human‑centred and timely. However, the practice can place financial burdens on staff, threaten patient privacy and reinforce existing inequalities. Future research should explore how formal health‑system solutions can keep the advantages while reducing costs, privacy risks and distractions. We need policies that support safe, equitable integration of personal technology into routine care.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\"). In addition, several clarity issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – the term “GRADE‑CERQual” appears in the methods section without a plain‑language explanation, and “shadow IT” is used without definition. Readers may not understand these concepts.\n2. **Noun‑heavy, complex wording** – sentences such as \"The practice can widen inequities between staff who can afford devices and those who cannot, and it often creates an unofficial technology system that is not recorded in the formal health‑information system\" contain many long, technical nouns, making the text harder to follow.\n3. **Long, dense sentence** – \"Personal device use can cost workers money, create pressure to work out‑of‑hours, and raise the risk of breaking patient confidentiality (sharing private health information without proper protection)\" packs three ideas together and uses the abstract phrase “breaking patient confidentiality”. Splitting it into shorter sentences would improve readability.\n4. **Missing simple definition for “street‑level bureaucrat”** – the term is introduced but not explained in everyday language, leaving some readers unsure of its meaning.\n5. **Bullet‑point formatting** – the key messages list uses hyphens correctly, but the overall layout would benefit from a blank line before the list to improve visual separation.\n\nSuggested concrete rewrites:\n- Change subheading to: **\"What are the key messages?\"**\n- Add a brief definition: \"We rated our confidence in each finding using the GRADE‑CERQual approach, a method that helps us judge how reliable the evidence is.\" and \"‘Shadow IT’ means technology that is used unofficially and isn’t recorded in the official health‑information system.\"\n- Rewrite the noun‑heavy sentence as: \"The practice can increase differences between staff who can afford devices and those who cannot. It also creates an unofficial technology system that isn’t captured in the formal health‑information system.\"\n- Split the dense sentence: \"Personal device use can cost workers money. It can also create pressure to work out‑of‑hours. Finally, it raises the risk of sharing private health information without proper protection.\"\n- Add a short definition after the first mention of “street‑level bureaucrat”: \"Front‑line staff who must deliver services despite limited resources and who often create their own solutions.\"\nThese changes address the critical subheading issue and improve clarity, reducing jargon, noun‑heavy language, and overly long sentences, aligning the summary with Cochrane plain‑language standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well overall (66.7% of features in the best quartile). However, it deviates on five metrics: high noun count (195, P90), SMOG index (14.45, P90), complex words (142, P90), Dale‑Chall complex words (311, BEYOND_P90) and long words (219, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many long, complex words than typical PLS, supporting the need to simplify wording and reduce noun density."
