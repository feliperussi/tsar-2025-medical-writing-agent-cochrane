  "draft": "What are the benefits and drawbacks of healthcare workers using their own cell phones and other personal devices (such as smartphones or tablets) to support their work?\n\nKey messages\n- Using their own phones makes healthcare workers more flexible, efficient and responsive. It can help them personalise care and keep some patient information out of formal systems, but it also means they may have to pay for calls or data themselves.\n- Personal device use can create pressure to work out‑of‑hours and can increase the risk of breaching patient confidentiality. It may also widen inequities between staff who can afford devices and those who cannot.\n- In many settings this practice has become routine, reinforcing existing social hierarchies and creating a parallel “shadow IT” system – technology that operates unofficially and is not recorded in the formal health‑information system. We need formal solutions that keep the benefits while reducing costs, privacy risks and distractions.\n\nWhy do healthcare workers sometimes use their own mobile phones at work?\nIn many facilities the official systems for talking to colleagues, sharing patient information or organising care are weak, missing or hard to use. To keep patients safe and get their jobs done, we turn to the phones and tablets we already own. By calling, texting or using apps on personal devices we can quickly get advice, arrange appointments or share urgent information. This makes care more flexible, personal and responsive – for example, a nurse can call a doctor directly instead of waiting for a slow pager. However, because these practices are not part of workplace rules, they can create problems. Workers may have to pay for calls or data themselves, especially those on low salaries. Patient privacy can be at risk if personal phones store health details. Reliance on informal “shadow IT” (technology used unofficially and not recorded in the formal system) can lead to missing records and unequal care. The term “street‑level bureaucrat” describes frontline staff who must deliver services despite limited resources and who often invent their own solutions to fill gaps.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to explore what healthcare workers, managers and other professionals think and do when they use personal mobile phones or other devices to support their work. Specifically, we wanted to gather qualitative evidence about the experiences, motivations, benefits and challenges of these informal, innovative uses of mobile technology across different countries and health‑care settings.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus for studies published since 2008. We also performed citation searches and contacted authors for additional data. We included qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that examined healthcare workers’ views, experiences and practices of informal mobile device use. We extracted the data, performed a thematic synthesis and rated our confidence in each finding using the GRADE‑CERQual approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 30 qualitative or mixed‑methods studies published between 2013 and 2022. The studies came from high‑, middle‑ and low‑income countries and covered many health‑care settings and worker cadres.\nThe evidence suggests that using personal phones probably makes work more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs. Workers often feel that it strengthens relationships with patients and colleagues. At the same time, personal device use probably adds personal costs for workers – especially those with lower pay – and can increase the risk of breaching patient confidentiality. It may also create inequities, because some staff can afford devices and airtime while others cannot.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings because all the included work was qualitative and varied in setting and quality. The review does not provide detailed information about the number, age or gender of participants.\n\nWhat does this mean for us?\nWe see that informal use of personal devices can help healthcare workers deliver care that is more human‑centred and timely. At the same time, the practice can place financial burdens on staff, threaten patient privacy and reinforce existing inequalities. Future research should explore how formal health‑system solutions can keep the advantages while reducing costs, privacy risks and distractions. We need policies that support safe, equitable integration of personal technology into routine care.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failed: the draft does not include a currency sub‑heading (e.g., \"How up to date is this review?\") as required by the style guide. In addition, several clarity issues would confuse readers:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – the term “street‑level bureaucrat” appears without a plain‑language definition. Rewrite as: \"Front‑line staff who have to deliver services despite limited resources and who often create their own solutions.\"\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"The evidence suggests that using personal phones probably makes work more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs, and they often feel it strengthens relationships with patients and colleagues.\" Split into two sentences: \"The evidence suggests that using personal phones makes work more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs. Staff also say it strengthens their relationships with patients and colleagues.\"\n3. **Jargon “shadow IT”** – while briefly defined, the phrase remains technical. Replace with a simpler description: \"unofficial technology that is not recorded in the formal health‑information system.\"\n4. **High noun density** – many noun‑heavy sentences (e.g., \"personal device use can create pressure to work out‑of‑hours and can increase the risk of breaching patient confidentiality.\") can be made more verb‑focused: \"Using personal devices can pressure staff to work out‑of‑hours and can increase the risk of breaching patient confidentiality.\"\n5. **Missing paragraph breaks** – the sections are presented as large blocks of text; add a blank line before each sub‑heading and between paragraphs to improve readability.\nThese issues, together with the missing currency section, prevent the PLS from meeting the required standards.\n\nMetrics support the editorial judgment: the draft shows unusually high counts of complex words (150, BEYOND_P90), long words (233, BEYOND_P90) and Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (327, BEYOND_P90), indicating the language is more technical than typical PLS texts. The noun count (197) is also far above the median, contributing to the dense, noun‑heavy style.",
