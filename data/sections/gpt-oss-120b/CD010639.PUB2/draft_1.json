  "draft": "Do changes to shift work schedules (the timing and length of work shifts) improve sleep quality, increase sleep duration, or reduce sleepiness in shift workers?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Changing shift schedules can sometimes make workers feel less sleepy during their shifts, especially when shifts rotate forward (moving from morning to evening to night) or rotate more quickly, but the evidence is uncertain and there is no clear benefit for overall sleep quality; no harmful effects were reported.\n- Limiting daily shift length to no more than 16 hours (the maximum number of hours worked in one day) appears to allow workers to get more sleep when off work and to feel less sleepy while on duty, although confidence in this finding is limited and other changes such as shorter shifts or more spread-out schedules did not show clear effects.\n- More well-designed, larger studies are needed to determine which schedule changes reliably improve sleep and reduce sleepiness, and to assess any possible negative effects over longer periods.\n\n**Introduction**\nWhy does working in shifts affect sleep and safety?\nMany jobs require people to work at times that do not match the normal day‑night cycle – for example night shifts, early‑morning shifts, or rotating schedules that change every few days. This “shift work” often leads to not getting enough sleep or getting poor‑quality sleep. When workers are sleepy, they are less alert, which can increase the risk of mistakes, accidents, and long‑term health problems. Employers sometimes try to improve the situation by changing how shifts are organised – for example by altering the length of a shift, the direction in which shifts rotate (\"forward\" rotation moves from morning to evening to night, while \"backward\" rotation goes the opposite way), how quickly the rotation changes (\"faster\" vs. \"slower\" rotation), or how much time is given between shifts.\nWhat did the review aim to discover?\nThe authors wanted to find out whether changing the way shift schedules are set up can improve three key outcomes for shift workers: (1) how good their sleep feels (sleep quality), (2) how many hours they actually sleep when they are off‑work (sleep duration), and (3) how sleepy they feel while they are on the job (sleepiness). They examined many studies that compared different schedule designs – such as forward versus backward rotation, faster versus slower rotation, limits on daily shift length, shorter versus longer shifts, and more compressed versus spread‑out workweeks – to see which changes, if any, help workers sleep better and stay more alert.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that examined how adapting shift schedules influences sleep quality, sleep duration, or sleepiness in shift workers; we combined and summarized the results across these studies; and we rated our confidence in the evidence using established criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review incorporated 11 studies involving 2,125 shift‑workers. The included trials were randomized controlled trials, controlled before‑after studies, and non‑randomized cross‑over designs. They examined a range of shift‑schedule adaptations, including forward versus backward rotation, faster versus slower rotation, limiting daily shift length to 16 hours versus no limit, shorter (8–10 h) versus longer shifts, and more compressed versus more spread‑out schedules. One laboratory study was identified but excluded from effectiveness conclusions. The abstract does not provide details on the duration of the individual studies, funding sources, participant demographics (age, gender, health status), or the countries where the studies were conducted.\nMain results: Limiting daily shift length to 16 hours\nLimiting the daily shift length to 16 hours probably increases the amount of sleep workers obtain and probably reduces sleepiness a little, although the certainty about the increase in sleep is low. The evidence for this finding is based on low‑certainty data.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the treatments, because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators or outcomes we were interested in, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022 of search.",

Subheadings such as \"Key messages\", \"Introduction\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are statements, not questions, which violates the MASTER_STYLE_GUIDE. Additionally, several clarity and readability issues would likely confuse readers:\n1. **Long, dense sentences** – e.g., \"The review incorporated 11 studies involving 2,125 shift‑workers...\" (27 words) makes it hard to follow. Shorter sentences are needed.\n2. **Heavy use of nominalisations and noun‑heavy phrasing** – e.g., \"Limiting the daily shift length to 16 hours probably increases the amount of sleep workers obtain...\" (noun‑heavy, passive‑like). This contributes to the high noun count (226) and nominalisation score (26) far beyond typical PLS patterns.\n3. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as \"forward rotation\", \"faster rotation\", \"low‑certainty evidence\" appear without simple definitions, which can leave a lay audience confused.\n4. **Passive voice** – the draft contains 18 passive constructions (P75), reducing clarity about who performed actions.\n5. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – as noted, subheadings should be re‑phrased as questions (e.g., \"What did we find?\" instead of \"Results\").\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Change subheading \"Results\" to \"What did we find?\" and similarly re‑phrase all other headings as questions.\n- Break the long sentence in the Results section into two: \"The review included 11 studies with 2,125 shift‑workers. These trials were randomised controlled trials, controlled before‑after studies, and non‑randomised cross‑over designs.\"\n- Replace nominalisations: \"Limiting the daily shift length to 16 hours probably increases the amount of sleep workers obtain…\" → \"When we limit daily shifts to 16 hours, workers probably sleep more and feel less sleepy.\"\n- Define jargon: add a brief explanation after first use, e.g., \"forward rotation (shifts move from morning to evening to night)\".\n- Convert passive to active: \"The evidence is based on low‑certainty data\" → \"We based this finding on low‑certainty data.\"\nThese changes address the critical style breach and improve readability, aligning the draft with the style guide and typical PLS metrics (target words per sentence <22, nominalisations <13, nouns <116).",

These metric alerts support the identified clarity and style issues."
