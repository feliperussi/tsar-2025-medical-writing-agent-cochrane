  "draft": "Do changes to shift work schedules (the timing and length of work shifts) improve sleep quality, increase sleep duration, or reduce sleepiness in shift workers?\n\nKey messages\n- Changing shift schedules can sometimes make workers feel less sleepy during their shifts, especially when shifts rotate forward (moving from morning to evening to night) or rotate more quickly, but the evidence is uncertain and there is no clear benefit for overall sleep quality; no harmful effects were reported.\n- Limiting daily shift length to no more than 16 hours (the maximum number of hours worked in one day) probably lets workers get more sleep when off work and feel less sleepy while on duty, although confidence in this finding is limited and other changes such as shorter shifts or more spread‑out schedules did not show clear effects.\n- More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to determine which schedule changes reliably improve sleep and reduce sleepiness, and to assess any possible negative effects over longer periods.\n\nWhy does working in shifts affect sleep and safety?\nMany jobs require people to work at times that do not match the normal day‑night cycle – for example night shifts, early‑morning shifts, or rotating schedules that change every few days. This “shift work” often leads to not getting enough sleep or getting poor‑quality sleep. When workers are sleepy they are less alert. This can increase the risk of mistakes, accidents, and long‑term health problems. Employers sometimes try to improve the situation by changing how shifts are organised – for example by altering the length of a shift, the direction of shift rotation (forward rotation moves from morning to evening to night, while backward rotation goes the opposite way), the speed of rotation (faster vs slower rotation), or the amount of time between shifts.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover?\nWe wanted to find out whether changing shift schedules can improve three outcomes for shift workers: (1) how good their sleep feels (sleep quality), (2) how many hours they actually sleep when they are off‑work (sleep duration), and (3) how sleepy they feel while they are on the job (sleepiness). We looked at studies that compared different schedule designs – such as forward vs backward rotation, faster vs slower rotation, limits on daily shift length, shorter vs longer shifts, and more compressed vs more spread‑out workweeks.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases up to April 2022 for studies that examined how adapting shift schedules influences sleep quality, sleep duration, or sleepiness in shift workers. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We combined results where studies were similar and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 11 studies with a total of 2,125 shift‑workers. The studies were randomised controlled trials, controlled before‑after studies, and non‑randomised cross‑over designs. They examined a range of schedule changes, including forward vs backward rotation, faster vs slower rotation, limiting daily shift length to 16 hours, shorter (8–10 h) vs longer shifts, and more compressed vs more spread‑out schedules. We identified one laboratory study, but we excluded it from the effectiveness conclusions.\nLimiting daily shift length to 16 hours probably increases the amount of sleep workers obtain and probably reduces sleepiness a little, although the certainty about the increase in sleep is low. The evidence for this finding is based on low‑certainty data.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because many studies did not randomly assign workers of different groups to the schedule changes. This means differences between groups could be due to differences between people rather than the schedule changes. Some studies were small, used different methods, or did not report all outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failed: not all subheadings are phrased as questions – the \"Key messages\" heading is a plain label, which breaches the style guide requirement. Additionally, several clarity problems would likely confuse readers:\n1. **Long, dense bullet point** – \"Changing shift schedules can sometimes make workers feel less sleepy during their shifts, especially when shifts rotate forward (moving from morning to evening to night) or rotate more quickly, but the evidence is uncertain and there is no clear benefit for overall sleep quality; no harmful effects were reported.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words, mixes several ideas, and uses a semicolon that hampers flow. *Rewrite*: \"Changing shift schedules can sometimes make workers feel less sleepy, especially when shifts rotate forward (morning → evening → night) or rotate quickly. However, the evidence is uncertain and we did not find a clear benefit for overall sleep quality, and no harmful effects were reported.\"\n2. **Technical jargon without immediate definition** – terms like \"forward rotation\" and \"backward rotation\" appear in the key messages before the reader has seen the explanatory paragraph. This can leave readers puzzled. *Rewrite*: add a brief definition in the bullet, e.g., \"forward rotation (moving from morning to evening to night)\".\n3. **Ambiguous wording about certainty** – \"Limiting daily shift length to 16 hours probably increases the amount of sleep workers obtain and probably reduces sleepiness a little, although the certainty about the increase in sleep is low.\" The double use of \"probably\" and the phrase \"a little\" are vague. *Rewrite*: \"Limiting daily shift length to 16 hours probably increases sleep and may reduce sleepiness, but the evidence is of low certainty.\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy sentences** – the draft contains many noun‑heavy constructions (e.g., \"the amount of sleep workers obtain\"). Metrics show a very high noun count (203, beyond the P90 range) and many nominalisations (24, also beyond P90). Re‑phrasing to use more verbs improves readability, e.g., change to \"workers probably sleep more\".\n5. **Missing question‑style subheading for key messages** – to meet the style guide, rename the heading to a question such as \"What are the main findings?\".\n\nThese issues, together with the metric deviations (high nominalisation, noun count, complex words, and long words), indicate the draft does not yet meet the required clarity and style standards.\n\n**Suggested actions**:\n- Rename \"Key messages\" to a question‑style heading.\n- Break long sentences into shorter ones (target 15‑20 words).\n- Replace nominalised nouns with active verbs.\n- Reduce complex and long words where possible (e.g., use \"use\" instead of \"utilize\").\n- Ensure technical terms are defined at first use.\n\nBy addressing these points, the PLS will align with the Master Style Guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and scores well on readability indices (Flesch‑Reading Ease 56, FK‑grade 11). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in five metrics: nominalisation (24, beyond P90), noun count (203, beyond P90), complex words (117, beyond P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (288, beyond P90), and long words (190, beyond P90). These indicate a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style that should be simplified."
