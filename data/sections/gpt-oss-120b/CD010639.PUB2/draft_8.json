  "draft": "Do changes to shift work schedules (the timing and length of work shifts) improve sleep quality, increase sleep duration, or reduce sleepiness in shift workers?\n\nKey messages:\n- Changing shift schedules can sometimes make workers feel less sleepy, especially when the rotation goes forward (morning → evening → night) or changes quickly, but the evidence is uncertain and we saw no clear benefit for overall sleep quality. No harms were reported.\n- Limiting a daily shift to no more than 16 hours probably lets workers sleep about 0.7 hours more per night and probably reduces sleepiness a little, but confidence in this finding is low because the studies were small.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to confirm which schedule changes reliably improve sleep and reduce sleepiness and to check for any long‑term harms.\n\nWhy does working in shifts affect sleep and safety?\nMany jobs require people to work at times that do not match the normal day‑night cycle – for example night shifts, early‑morning shifts, or rotating schedules that change every few days. This “shift work” often leads to not getting enough sleep or getting poor‑quality sleep. When workers are sleepy they are less alert, which can increase the risk of mistakes, accidents, and long‑term health problems. Employers may try to help workers by changing the shift pattern. For example, they can change how long a shift lasts, whether the rotation goes forward (morning → evening → night) or backward, how quickly the rotation changes, or how much rest time is given between shifts.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether changing shift schedules improves three outcomes for shift workers: (1) how good their sleep feels (sleep quality), (2) how many hours they actually sleep when off‑work (sleep duration), and (3) how sleepy they feel while on the job (sleepiness). We looked at studies that compared different schedule designs – forward vs. backward rotation, faster vs. slower rotation, limits on daily shift length, shorter vs. longer shifts, and more compressed vs. more spread‑out workweeks.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases up to April 2022 for studies that examined shift‑schedule changes and their effects on sleep quality, sleep duration, or sleepiness. Two reviewers independently screened each record, extracted data, and checked each study for problems that might affect the findings (called risk of bias). We combined results when studies were similar. We judged how confident we could be in the results using a system called GRADE, which rates the quality of evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 11 studies with a total of 2,125 shift‑workers. The studies used three types of designs: some randomly assigned workers to new schedules, some compared results before and after a change while also having a comparison group, and some let the same workers try several schedules in a row. Limiting daily shift length to 16 hours probably increased sleep by about 0.7 hours per night and probably reduced sleepiness a little, but the certainty of this evidence is low. Other schedule changes – forward vs. backward rotation, faster vs. slower rotation, shorter vs. longer shifts, and more compressed vs. spread‑out schedules – did not show clear benefits for sleep quality, sleep duration, or sleepiness.\n\nHow certain are we about the evidence?\nWe are not confident in many findings because several studies did not randomly assign workers to different schedules, some were small, and methods varied. This means differences between groups might be due to who was in each group rather than the schedule change itself.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, title format, factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but it contains several clarity problems that could confuse a lay reader. 1) Technical jargon is used without explanation (e.g., “GRADE”, “risk of bias”). 2) Some sentences are noun‑heavy, making them harder to follow (e.g., “The review incorporated 11 studies involving 2,125 shift‑workers.”). 3) The description of study designs is long and complex, using terms like “controlled before‑after” and “cross‑over” that are not defined. These issues reduce readability despite the overall good metric scores. Suggested rewrites are provided below. The PLS evaluation shows the draft is generally well‑aligned with typical PLS patterns, but nouns (185 vs median ≈ 116), complex Dale‑Chall words (265 vs median ≈ 160) and long words (171 vs median ≈ 122) are above the median, confirming the need to simplify language and reduce noun density.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation indicates the draft conforms well overall (66.7% of features in best quartile). Readability scores are strong (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 62.5, FKGL 10.3). However, three metrics deviate: nouns (185, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (265, P90) and long words (171, P90). These suggest the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex/long words than typical PLS, supporting the recommended simplifications."
