  "draft": "Do changes to shift work schedules (the timing and length of work shifts) improve sleep quality, increase sleep duration, or reduce sleepiness in shift workers?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- Changing shift schedules can sometimes make workers feel less sleepy, especially when shifts rotate forward (morning → evening → night) or rotate quickly. However, the evidence is uncertain, we did not find a clear benefit for overall sleep quality, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Limiting daily shift length to no more than 16 hours probably helps workers sleep more when off work and may reduce sleepiness (feeling drowsy) while on duty, but the evidence is of low certainty. Other changes such as shorter shifts or more spread‑out schedules did not show clear effects.\n- More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to confirm which schedule changes reliably improve sleep and reduce sleepiness, and to check for any long‑term harms.\n\nWhy does working in shifts affect sleep and safety?\nMany jobs require people to work at times that do not match the normal day‑night cycle – for example night shifts, early‑morning shifts, or rotating schedules that change every few days. This “shift work” often leads to not getting enough sleep or getting poor‑quality sleep. When workers are sleepy they are less alert, which can increase the risk of mistakes, accidents, and long‑term health problems.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover?\nWe wanted to know whether changing the way shift schedules are set up can improve three outcomes for shift workers: (1) sleep quality (how good sleep feels), (2) sleep duration (how many hours they actually sleep when off work), and (3) sleepiness during work (how drowsy they feel on the job). We examined studies that compared different schedule designs – such as forward versus backward rotation, faster versus slower rotation, limits on daily shift length, shorter versus longer shifts, and more compressed versus more spread‑out workweeks.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases up to April 2022 for studies that looked at shift‑schedule changes and their effects on sleep quality, sleep duration, or sleepiness. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Where studies were similar we combined their results and rated our confidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 11 studies with a total of 2,125 shift‑workers. The studies were randomised trials, controlled before‑after studies, and non‑randomised cross‑over designs. They examined forward versus backward rotation, faster versus slower rotation, limiting daily shift length to 16 hours, shorter (8–10 h) versus longer shifts, and more compressed versus more spread‑out schedules. Limiting daily shift length to 16 hours probably increased sleep (about 0.7 hours more per night) and probably reduced sleepiness a little, but the certainty of this evidence was low. Other schedule changes did not show clear benefits for sleep quality, sleep duration, or sleepiness.\n\nHow certain are we about the evidence?\nWe are not confident in many of the findings because several studies did not randomly assign workers to different schedules, some were small, and methods varied. This means differences between groups might be due to who was in each group rather than the schedule change itself.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

Re‑phrasing with more verbs improves readability.\n   *Rewrite*: \"Limiting daily shifts to 16 hours probably lets workers sleep more when they are off work and may make them feel less drowsy while on duty.\"\nThese changes address the most significant clarity issues and align the text with the master style guide while keeping the factual content accurate.\n\n**Metrics support**: The draft has a low passive‑voice count (8, good) but shows high noun count (167, P90) and many complex Dale‑Chall words (246, P90), confirming the need to reduce noun‑heavy phrasing and simplify vocabulary.",

Readability scores are strong (Flesch Reading Ease 63, Grade 9.9). However, noun count (167) and complex Dale‑Chall words (246) are higher than typical (P90), indicating the text is noun‑heavy and uses many unfamiliar words. These metric flags support the suggested reductions in noun‑heavy sentences and simplification of terminology."
