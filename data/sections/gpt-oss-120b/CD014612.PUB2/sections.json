  "key_messages": [
    "Closing the tissue gaps (mesenteric defects) during weight‑loss stomach surgery (Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass) may lower the chance of developing an internal hernia (a serious bowel problem where part of the intestine slips into a space), and there is no clear evidence that it increases early complications (problems within 30 days after surgery) or death, although the overall certainty of the evidence is limited.",
    "The review found little or no difference between closing and not closing the defects in terms of early overall complications (problems within 30 days after surgery), early death, or problems during the operation (intra‑operative complications), but the data on how long patients stay in hospital after the procedure are uncertain.",
    "Because the available trials are few and the evidence is uncertain, more large, high‑quality studies with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm any benefit and to clarify possible harms such as longer hospital stays."

      "subheading": "Why can internal hernia be a serious problem after gastric bypass surgery?",
      "content": "Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a common weight‑loss operation where the stomach is made smaller and the small intestine is rerouted. This creates small openings, called mesenteric defects, in the tissue that holds the intestines in place. If a loop of intestine slips through one of these openings, it can cause an internal hernia – a painful blockage that may cut off blood flow and become life‑threatening. Because internal hernias can develop months or years after the operation, surgeons look for ways to prevent them."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out about closing the surgical gaps?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether stitching (closing) the mesenteric defects during RYGB reduces the chance of internal hernia without causing other problems, such as a small‑bowel obstruction (where the intestine gets kinked or blocked). They examined randomised trials that compared patients whose defects were closed with those whose defects were left open, looking at long‑term hernia rates, short‑term complications, death after surgery, and how long patients stayed in hospital."

      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies comparing closure versus non‑closure of mesenteric defects in people with obesity undergoing Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass, combined their results in a meta‑analysis, and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified three randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 3,010 adults with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) who were undergoing laparoscopic or robotic Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass. The trials compared closing the mesenteric defects after surgery with leaving them open. One trial used non‑absorbable interrupted sutures for the closure, while the other two used non‑absorbable running sutures. The abstract does not give details about how long participants were followed, the countries or centres where the studies were done, the ages or gender balance of the participants, or the funding sources for the individual trials."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Reduction in internal hernia risk",
      "content": "Closing the mesenteric defects during gastric bypass probably leads to a large reduction in the risk of internal hernia with bowel obstruction. The evidence suggests that this closure makes little or no difference to the overall complication rate after surgery, and it is unclear whether it affects postoperative mortality, intra‑operative complications, or the length of hospital stay."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to August 2024 of search."
