  "key_messages": [
    "Giving anti‑VEGF (a medicine that blocks abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before or during vitrectomy (eye surgery that removes the gel inside the eye) for advanced diabetic eye disease (proliferative diabetic retinopathy) seems to lead to better vision after surgery and reduces the chances of bleeding inside the eye and of retinal tears during the operation, with few reported side‑effects, although the overall certainty of the evidence is limited.",
    "The review did not find data on how these treatments affect patients' quality of life or on the risk of severe visual loss, and the impact on the need for silicone oil tamponade (silicone oil used to hold the retina in place) remains unclear.",
    "More high‑quality, larger studies that follow patients for a longer time and use standardised outcome measures are needed to confirm the benefits, clarify any potential harms, and guide future practice."

      "subheading": "What is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced stage of eye disease that can develop in people with diabetes. In PDR, the retina—the light‑sensing layer at the back of the eye—starts to grow abnormal, fragile blood vessels. These new vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, and lead to serious complications such as persistent vitreous haemorrhage (bleeding into the gel‑like substance inside the eye) and retinal detachment (where the retina separates from its normal position). When vision is threatened, eye surgeons often perform a procedure called pars plana vitrectomy. Vitrectomy removes the cloudy vitreous gel and any blood, allowing the surgeon to clear the view and repair the retina. However, the surgery itself can cause problems: bleeding during the operation, creation of tiny holes in the retina, and post‑operative bleeding or scar tissue that may require additional surgery and delay visual recovery."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether giving anti‑vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‑VEGF) medicines—drugs that block a protein (VEGF) that makes the abnormal blood vessels grow—around the time of vitrectomy could improve outcomes. Specifically, they examined if peri‑operative anti‑VEGF injections reduced surgical complications (such as bleeding during or after surgery, retinal holes, and the need for repeat operations) and whether they led to better visual acuity (sharpness of vision) and quality of life for people undergoing vitrectomy for PDR."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 28 randomised controlled trials that together involved 1,914 eyes of people undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The studies were carried out in many countries – most commonly China (11 trials) – and also in Iran, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the United States, Indonesia and Pakistan. All participants had recognised PDR complications such as non‑clearing vitreous haemorrhage, macula‑involving tractional retinal detachment, or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment. The trials compared giving an anti‑VEGF injection into the eye around the time of surgery (before or during the operation) together with the standard vitrectomy, versus vitrectomy alone. Details on participants’ age, gender or other demographics, the length of follow‑up, and funding sources were not reported in the abstract."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Anti‑VEGF reduces bleeding and retinal tears",
      "content": "Adding an anti‑VEGF injection around the time of vitrectomy probably greatly reduces early bleeding inside the eye after surgery – about 12 out of 100 eyes have early bleeding with the injection compared with about 31 out of 100 without it. It also probably cuts late bleeding roughly in half – about 10 out of 100 eyes experience late bleeding with anti‑VEGF versus about 23 out of 100 without it. Giving anti‑VEGF before surgery probably reduces the chance of creating retinal tears during the operation, with about 12 tears per 100 surgeries versus 31 per 100 without the drug. Anti‑VEGF probably lowers the need for extra surgery to treat early bleeding and may also reduce the need for further surgery for retinal detachment. Vision may be better six months after surgery when anti‑VEGF is used, but the evidence is uncertain, and it is unclear whether anti‑VEGF reduces the need for silicone oil during surgery."

  "limitations": "Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and the studies were very small.",
