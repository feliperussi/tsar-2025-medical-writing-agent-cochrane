  "draft": "Does giving anti‑VEGF eye injections (medicine that blocks abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before or during vitrectomy (eye surgery to remove the gel inside the eye) improve vision and reduce bleeding in people with advanced diabetic eye disease (proliferative diabetic retinopathy)?\n\n- Giving anti‑VEGF (a medicine that blocks abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before or during vitrectomy (eye surgery that removes the gel inside the eye) for advanced diabetic eye disease (proliferative diabetic retinopathy) seems to lead to better vision after surgery and reduces the chances of bleeding inside the eye and of retinal tears during the operation, with few reported side‑effects, although the overall certainty of the evidence is limited.\n- The review did not find data on how these treatments affect patients' quality of life or on the risk of severe visual loss, and the impact on the need for silicone oil tamponade (silicone oil used to hold the retina in place) remains unclear.\n- More high‑quality, larger studies that follow patients for a longer time and use standardised outcome measures are needed to confirm the benefits, clarify any potential harms, and guide future practice.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced stage of eye disease that can develop in people with diabetes. In PDR, the retina—the light‑sensing layer at the back of the eye—starts to grow abnormal, fragile blood vessels. These new vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, and lead to serious complications such as persistent vitreous haemorrhage (bleeding into the gel‑like substance inside the eye) and retinal detachment (where the retina separates from its normal position). When vision is threatened, eye surgeons often perform a procedure called pars plana vitrectomy. Vitrectomy removes the cloudy vitreous gel and any blood, allowing the surgeon to clear the view and repair the retina. However, the surgery itself can cause problems: bleeding during the operation, creation of tiny holes in the retina, and post‑operative bleeding or scar tissue that may require additional surgery and delay visual recovery.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether giving anti‑vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‑VEGF) medicines—drugs that block a protein (VEGF) that makes the abnormal blood vessels grow—around the time of vitrectomy could improve outcomes. Specifically, they examined if peri‑operative anti‑VEGF injections reduced surgical complications (such as bleeding during or after surgery, retinal holes, and the need for repeat operations) and whether they led to better visual acuity (sharpness of vision) and quality of life for people undergoing vitrectomy for PDR.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched databases for studies evaluating peri‑operative anti‑VEGF use in vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 28 randomised controlled trials that together involved 1,914 eyes of people undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The studies were carried out in many countries – most commonly China (11 trials) – and also in Iran, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the United States, Indonesia and Pakistan. All participants had recognised PDR complications such as non‑clearing vitreous haemorrhage, macula‑involving tractional retinal detachment, or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment. The trials compared giving an anti‑VEGF injection into the eye around the time of surgery (before or during the operation) together with the standard vitrectomy, versus vitrectomy alone. Details on participants’ age, gender or other demographics, the length of follow‑up, and funding sources were not reported in the abstract.\nMain results: Anti‑VEGF reduces bleeding and retinal tears\nAdding an anti‑VEGF injection around the time of vitrectomy probably greatly reduces early bleeding inside the eye after surgery – about 12 out of 100 eyes have early bleeding with the injection compared with about 31 out of 100 without it. It also probably cuts late bleeding roughly in half – about 10 out of 100 eyes experience late bleeding with anti‑VEGF versus about 23 out of 100 without it. Giving anti‑VEGF before surgery probably reduces the chance of creating retinal tears during the operation, with about 12 tears per 100 surgeries versus 31 per 100 without the drug. Anti‑VEGF probably lowers the need for extra surgery to treat early bleeding and may also reduce the need for further surgery for retinal detachment. Vision may be better six months after surgery when anti‑VEGF is used, but the evidence is uncertain, and it is unclear whether anti‑VEGF reduces the need for silicone oil during surgery.\n\n**Limitations**\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.",

This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement that all section headings be questions. In addition, the text contains a number of clarity problems that would confuse patients: (1) very long sentences – the sentence \"Adding an anti‑VEGF injection around the time of vitrectomy probably greatly reduces early bleeding inside the eye after surgery – about 12 out of 100 eyes have early bleeding with the injection compared with about 31 out of 100 without it\" is 38 words and hard to follow; (2) unexplained technical terms such as \"silicone oil tamponade\" are used without lay definitions; (3) the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many nominalisations, making sentences dense (e.g., \"The evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search\"). These issues are reflected in the metrics: words per sentence = 26.4 (P90), nominalisations = 24 (P90), total nouns = 224 (BEYOND_P90), and complex‑word counts far above typical PLS ranges. To meet Cochrane PLS standards the draft needs to re‑write headings as questions, break long sentences into shorter ones, add brief explanations for specialist terms, and replace the noun‑heavy constructions with active verbs.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets the word‑count limit but deviates on several readability metrics: words per sentence (26.4, P90), nominalisations (24, P90), total nouns (224, beyond P90), and complex‑word counts (complex_words 186, complex_words_dc 354, long_words 244) are all well above typical PLS ranges, indicating overly dense, long, and technical language. Active voice and pronoun use are good, but the high noun and complexity scores confirm the need for simplification and shorter sentences."
