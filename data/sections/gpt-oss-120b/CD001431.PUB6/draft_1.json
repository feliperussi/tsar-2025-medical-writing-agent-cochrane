  "draft": "Do decision aids (tools that explain health options and help you weigh benefits and harms) help adults make better treatment or screening choices?\n\nKey messages\n- Decision aids (tools that explain health options and help weigh benefits and harms) probably help adults make better treatment or screening choices by increasing the match between what matters to them (informed values‑congruent choices), boosting knowledge, improving understanding of risks, and reducing uncertainty about decisions (decisional conflict); they do not appear to increase feelings of regret (decision regret) or cause other harms.\n- Using decision aids does not noticeably change the length of medical appointments (consultations); when used before a visit they may slightly shorten the time, and when used during the visit they may add about a minute, but overall the impact on appointment length is minimal.\n- Further research is needed to examine long‑term outcomes such as staying with the chosen option (adherence), health costs (expenses for care), and effects in different patient groups, and to provide higher‑quality evidence to address these unanswered questions.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhy do people need help making health decisions?\nEvery day adults face choices about medical treatments or screening tests – for example, whether to start a blood‑pressure medicine, get a colon‑cancer screening, or have joint‑replacement surgery. These decisions can be confusing because there are usually several options, each with its own benefits, possible harms, and chances of success. Most people are not given clear, easy‑to‑understand information, and they may not know how the different outcomes match their own values and preferences. Patient decision aids are tools (often booklets, videos, or interactive websites) that make the choice explicit, give evidence‑based facts about each option, and help people think about what matters most to them. By doing so, they aim to support patients in making informed, values‑congruent choices – that is, choices that line up with what they personally consider important.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review authors set out to see whether using patient decision aids actually improves the decision‑making process compared with the usual care people receive (such as generic pamphlets or no extra information). Specifically, they wanted to know if decision aids help adults:\n* understand the options better (increase knowledge);\n* have a more accurate sense of the risks and benefits (accurate risk perception);\n* feel clearer about their own values and preferences (values‑congruent choice);\n* take a more active role in discussions with their clinician (less passive, clinician‑controlled decisions);\n* experience less uncertainty or conflict about the decision (lower decisional conflict);\n* avoid feeling regret after the choice is made.\nThey also examined whether decision aids affect other outcomes such as how long doctor‑patient consultations last, how well people stick to the chosen treatment, and any impact on the health‑care system.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared patient decision aids with usual care for adults facing treatment or screening choices, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWe examined 209 randomised controlled trials that together involved 107,698 adults facing a wide range of health‑related treatment or screening decisions. All of the trials compared patient decision aids – tools that make the decision explicit, give evidence‑based information about the options and help people clarify what matters most to them – with usual care, which could be general information, risk assessments, consumer‑friendly guideline summaries, unrelated placebo information or no intervention at all. The abstracts did not give details about how long the individual trials lasted, who funded them, the participants’ ages, genders or the countries where the studies were carried out.\nThe evidence suggests that patient decision aids probably increase the chance that people choose options that match their informed values. They produce a large increase in knowledge (about 12 points on a 0‑100 scale) and a large improvement in how accurately people understand their risks. They also lead to a large reduction in feeling uninformed and in uncertainty about personal values, and they reduce the proportion of people who remain passive in decision‑making. Decision aids make little or no difference to decision regret or to the length of a consultation when used beforehand, and when used during a consultation they probably add only about one to two minutes to the visit.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.",

Because of this structural issue, the summary does not meet the mandatory format for a Cochrane Plain Language Summary.\n\nKey clarity and style improvements needed:\n1. Long, dense sentence – \"The evidence suggests that patient decision aids probably increase the chance that people choose options that match their informed values. They produce a large increase in knowledge (about 12 points on a 0‑100 scale) and a large improvement in how accurately people understand their risks.\" This combines two ideas and exceeds 30 words, making it hard to follow. Rewrite: \"The evidence suggests that patient decision aids probably help people choose options that match their values. They increase knowledge by about 12 points on a 0‑100 scale and improve how accurately people understand their risks.\"\n2. Passive voice – \"Decision aids make little or no difference to decision regret or to the length of a consultation when used beforehand, and when used during a consultation they probably add only about one to two minutes to the visit.\" Passive construction obscures who is doing the action. Rewrite: \"Decision aids do not change decision regret or consultation length when used beforehand, and they add only about one to two minutes when used during a visit.\"\n3. Unexplained jargon – The term \"decisional conflict\" appears without definition. Readers may not know what it means. Rewrite: \"decisional conflict (feeling uncertain or uneasy about the decision)\".\n4. Missing question‑style subheadings – All section headings should be phrased as questions to guide readers. Rewrite examples:\n   - \"Key messages\" → \"What are the main findings?\"\n   - \"Introduction/Aims\" → \"Why do people need help making health decisions?\"\n   - \"Methods\" → \"How did we find and evaluate the studies?\"\n   - \"Results\" → \"What did we find?\"\n   - \"Limitations\" → \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n   - \"Currency\" → \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"\n5. Wordy phrase – \"The abstracts did not give details about how long the individual trials lasted, who funded them, the participants’ ages, genders or the countries where the studies were carried out.\" This can be tightened. Rewrite: \"The abstracts did not report trial duration, funding, participants’ ages, genders, or study locations.\"\n\nSupporting metrics: The PLS evaluation shows high complexity – words per sentence = 29.9 (BEYOND_P90), passive voice = 20 (P90), nominalizations = 32 (BEYOND_P90), and many complex/long words. These metrics confirm the readability issues identified above and explain why the draft is harder to read than typical PLS texts.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (778 words) but deviates from typical PLS patterns on many metrics: sentences are too long (29.9 words, BEYOND_P90), passive voice is high (20, P90), nominalizations (32, BEYOND_P90), and noun/complex‑word counts far exceed median values. Readability indices (FKGL 14.7, ARI 16.8, GFI 19.8) are above the usual PLS range, indicating a need to simplify language and shorten sentences."
