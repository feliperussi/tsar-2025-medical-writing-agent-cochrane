  "draft": "analysisWe need to output final plain language summary with formatting: Title as Heading (maybe just plain line?), main sections as **Bold Headings**, key messages as list with dashes, introduction sections with subheadings. No markdown? It says no markdown, but they mention using **Bold Headings** which is markdown style. However they say no markdown. Possibly they want plain text with bold indicated by uppercase? But they said formatting rules: Title as `Heading`. Main sections as `**Bold Headings**`. That is markdown syntax. But final output must be only final validated plain language summary in a single block of text with no markdown. Contradiction. Probably they want plain text without markdown tags, but still indicate headings maybe by uppercase. However they explicitly said Title as Heading, Main sections as **Bold Headings**. I think they want the markdown syntax but then they say no markdown. Might be they consider the formatting tags as part of plain text, not markdown? The instruction says \"no markdown\". So we should strip markdown symbols. Use plain text headings: Title on its own line, then sections with headings maybe all caps. Let's interpret: Title as heading (just line). Main sections as bold headings but without markdown, maybe just uppercase. Key messages as list with dashes (that's plain). Introduction subheadings maybe as separate lines.\n\nThus produce:\n\nIs dexmedetomidine (a calming and pain‑relief medicine) safe and effective for newborns on a breathing machine compared with other pain‑relief drugs or no medication?\n\nKey messages:\n- We could not find any studies...\n- There are four ongoing trials...\n- Because of the current lack of evidence...\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhy is keeping newborns comfortable and calm a challenge when they need a breathing machine?\nSome newborn babies...\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about dexmedetomidine?\nThe review set out...\n\nMethods\nWe searched databases...\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible studies...\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident...\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023 of search.\n\nMake sure no markdown. Use bold headings maybe by uppercase. Let's produce.Is dexmedetomidine (a calming and pain‑relief medicine) safe and effective for newborns on a breathing machine compared with other pain‑relief drugs or no medication?\n\nKey messages\n- We could not find any studies that compared dexmedetomidine (a calming and pain‑relief medicine) with other drugs or no medication in newborns (infants under four weeks old) who are on a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation), so we cannot say whether it is safe or effective for sedation or pain relief, and we have no information on possible harmful effects.\n- There are four ongoing trials that plan to enrol between 40 and 200 newborns and will compare dexmedetomidine with drugs such as fentanyl, morphine, or a combination of ketamine and dexmedetomidine; these studies may soon provide data on how well the medicine works and its safety.\n- Because of the current lack of evidence, future research needs well‑designed randomised trials that look at both short‑term benefits (sedation and analgesia) and potential harms (including low blood pressure and long‑term neurodevelopment) to determine whether dexmedetomidine should be used routinely in this vulnerable population.\n\nINTRODUCTION/AIMS\nWhy is keeping newborns comfortable and calm a challenge when they need a breathing machine?\nSome newborn babies need help breathing with a machine called a ventilator. While they are on the ventilator they often feel pain or become restless, so doctors give medicines to keep them calm (sedation) and free from pain (analgesia). The most common medicines are opioids such as morphine, but these can affect the baby's heart rate, blood pressure and breathing. Dexmedetomidine is a different type of drug that works by activating a specific part of the nervous system called the \"alpha‑2\" receptor (think of it as a special switch that reduces stress without strongly affecting the heart). It is being used more and more in babies, even though it is not officially approved for this purpose. Researchers want to know whether dexmedetomidine is actually effective and safe for these tiny patients.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about dexmedetomidine?\nThe review set out to discover whether dexmedetomidine works better, the same, or worse than other medicines (including other non‑opioid drugs, opioids, or no drug at all) for keeping newborns on ventilators comfortable and calm. Specifically, they aimed to assess how well the drug provides sedation and pain relief, and to evaluate any safety concerns such as low blood pressure, death, or long‑term developmental effects.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched databases for studies comparing dexmedetomidine with other analgesia or sedation options (or placebo) in newborns receiving mechanical ventilation. We combined any results we found and rated the certainty of the evidence using standard methods.\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible studies, so no participants were enrolled and there is no information on study duration, funding sources, population characteristics (such as age, gender, or severity), study settings, or the specific interventions and comparators. Although four ongoing trials were identified, they were not yet eligible for inclusion, and therefore no data on these characteristics are available. Consequently, we could not answer our research question.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\nCURRENCY\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023 of search.",

Problem: heading is not a question, violating the style guide. Rewrite as: \"How did we look for evidence?\". Apply similarly to \"Limitations\" → \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and \"Currency\" → \"How up‑to‑date is the evidence?\".\n2. **Reduce length** – Quote: the entire draft (932 words). Problem: exceeds the 850‑word limit, forcing readers to wade through unnecessary detail. Rewrite by removing redundant phrases, merging short sentences, and cutting repetitive information to bring the total below 850 words.\n3. **Simplify jargon** – Quote: \"Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha‑2 agonist with minimal impact on the haemodynamic profile.\" Problem: technical terms (alpha‑2 agonist, haemodynamic) are not explained, confusing patients. Rewrite: \"Dexmedetomidine is a medicine that works on a special part of the nervous system and does not usually change the baby's heart rate or blood pressure.\"\n4. **Break long sentences** – Quote: \"We found no eligible studies, so no participants were enrolled and there is no information on study duration, funding sources, population characteristics (such as age, gender, or severity), study settings, or the specific interventions and comparators.\" Problem: 38‑word sentence is dense and hard to follow. Rewrite into two sentences: \"We found no eligible studies, so no participants were enrolled. Because of this we have no information about how long the studies would have run, who funded them, the babies’ ages or health status, where the studies would have taken place, or which medicines were compared.\"\n5. **Reduce nominalisations and noun‑heavy language** – Quote: \"The review set out to discover whether dexmedetomidine works better, the same, or worse than other medicines…\" Problem: uses noun‑heavy phrasing and nominalisations (\"the review set out to discover\"). Rewrite in active voice: \"We wanted to find out if dexmedetomidine works better, the same, or worse than other medicines…\".\n\nThese changes address the most impactful clarity and style issues and also bring the metrics closer to typical PLS patterns (e.g., reducing nominalisations from 31 to <13, nouns from 248 to <116, SMOG index from 15.4 to <12, complex words from 154 to <84, long words from 286 to <122).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft exceeds the word limit (932 words) and has several metrics far beyond typical ranges: nominalisations (31 vs <13 median), noun count (248 vs <116), SMOG index (15.4 vs <12), complex words (154 vs <84) and long words (286 vs <122). While readability scores are good, the high lexical complexity and noun‑heavy style reduce overall accessibility."
