  "key_messages": [
    "Immune‑checkpoint drugs (anti‑PD‑1/PD‑L1 antibodies, which are medicines that help the immune system recognise cancer cells) have not been shown to improve overall survival (how long patients live) or progression‑free survival (time before the tumour gets worse) in adults with aggressive glioma, and they do not clearly reduce serious adverse events (serious side effects); the evidence is limited and of low quality.",
    "A very small study suggested that giving pembrolizumab before and after surgery might improve survival, but this finding is based on few participants and the certainty is low; other combinations, such as adding bevacizumab, also did not show clear benefit and may increase side effects.",
    "Future research needs larger, well‑designed trials to determine whether these drugs can help people with glioma, to clarify any potential harms, and to identify which patients, if any, might benefit."

      "subheading": "What is glioblastoma and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive adult brain tumour. Median survival after diagnosis is about 16 months even with optimal therapy. The tumour grows rapidly, infiltrates surrounding brain tissue, and creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment that hinders the body’s natural anti‑cancer response. Standard treatment includes maximal surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy and the chemotherapy drug temozolomide; some patients also receive bevacizumab, an anti‑angiogenic agent. Despite these measures, outcomes remain poor, prompting investigation of new therapeutic strategies."

      "subheading": "What are anti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies and how might they help?",
      "content": "Anti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies are immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). PD‑1 is a protein on T‑cells (a type of immune cell) that, when engaged by its partner PD‑L1 on tumour cells, tells the T‑cell to stop attacking. Many gliomas express PD‑L1 to evade immune detection. By blocking either PD‑1 or PD‑L1, these antibodies release the “brakes” on the immune system, potentially allowing T‑cells to recognise and destroy cancer cells more effectively."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The systematic review sought to determine whether anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 therapies improve clinical outcomes for adults with diffuse glioma. Primary outcomes of interest were overall survival (OS – length of time patients remain alive after treatment) and progression‑free survival (PFS – time before the tumour worsens). Secondary outcomes included tumour response rates, quality‑of‑life measures, serious adverse events (SAE – life‑threatening or disabling side‑effects), and less serious adverse events. The goal was to assess both efficacy and safety of these immune‑based treatments in this patient population."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified seven randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,953 adults with diffuse grade 4 glioma (glioblastoma), either newly diagnosed or recurrent. In these trials participants received anti‑PD‑1 antibodies (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) alone or combined with other treatments such as bevacizumab, radiotherapy, and temozolomide, and were compared with standard therapies like bevacizumab alone, temozolomide‑based regimens, radiotherapy alone, lower doses of bevacizumab, or placebo.\n\nAcross the different settings – recurrent glioblastoma, newly diagnosed unmethylated glioblastoma, newly diagnosed methylated glioblastoma, and older patients – the anti‑PD‑1 drugs probably make little to no difference to overall survival and progression‑free survival. They also probably make little to no difference to tumour response rates and to less serious side effects. In one combination (nivolumab with radiotherapy and temozolomide for newly diagnosed methylated glioblastoma) there may be a large increase in serious side effects, while the benefit in survival remains minimal. Overall, the evidence suggests that adding anti‑PD‑1 therapy does not meaningfully improve survival outcomes for people with glioblastoma."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and because the studies were very small and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2024 of search."
