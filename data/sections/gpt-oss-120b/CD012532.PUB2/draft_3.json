  "draft": "Do immune‑checkpoint drugs (anti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies) improve survival in adults with aggressive brain tumours (glioma)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Immune‑checkpoint drugs (anti‑PD‑1/PD‑L1 antibodies, medicines that help the immune system recognise cancer cells) do not improve overall survival (how long patients live) or progression‑free survival (time before the tumour gets worse) in adults with aggressive glioma, and they do not clearly reduce serious side effects; the evidence is limited and of low quality.\n- A very small study suggested that giving pembrolizumab before and after surgery might improve survival, but this finding is based on few participants and the certainty is low; other combinations, such as adding bevacizumab, also did not show clear benefit and may increase side effects.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether these drugs can help people with glioma, to clarify any harms, and to identify which patients, if any, might benefit.\n\nWhat is glioblastoma and why is it a problem?\nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive adult brain tumour. Even with optimal treatment, the median survival after diagnosis is about 16 months. The tumour grows quickly, spreads into surrounding brain tissue, and creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment that blocks the body’s natural anti‑cancer response. Standard care includes maximal surgical removal, followed by radiotherapy and the chemotherapy drug temozolomide; some patients also receive bevacizumab, an anti‑angiogenic agent. Outcomes remain poor, which is why we explore new therapies.\n\nWhat are anti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies and how might they help?\nAnti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies are immune‑checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). PD‑1 is a protein on T‑cells (a type of immune cell) that tells the cell to stop attacking when it binds PD‑L1 on tumour cells. Many gliomas express PD‑L1 to evade detection. By blocking PD‑1 or PD‑L1, these antibodies release the “brakes” on the immune system, potentially allowing T‑cells to recognise and destroy cancer cells.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe aimed to determine whether anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 therapies improve clinical outcomes for adults with diffuse glioma. Our primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression‑free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes included tumour response rates, quality‑of‑life, serious adverse events (SAE – life‑threatening or disabling side‑effects), and less serious adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registers up to March 2024 for randomised controlled trials that compared anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies with placebo or other treatments in adults with diffuse glioma. We combined reported outcomes and judged our confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified seven randomised controlled trials involving 1 953 adults with grade 4 glioma (glioblastoma), either newly diagnosed or recurrent. Participants received anti‑PD‑1 antibodies (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) alone or with other treatments such as bevacizumab, radiotherapy or temozolomide, and were compared with standard therapies.\nAcross all settings, the anti‑PD‑1 drugs probably do not improve overall survival or progression‑free survival. They also probably do not change tumour response rates or less serious side effects. In one combination (nivolumab with radiotherapy and temozolomide for newly diagnosed methylated glioblastoma) we observed a possible large increase in serious side effects, while survival benefit remained minimal. Overall, adding anti‑PD‑1 therapy does not meaningfully improve survival outcomes for people with glioblastoma.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, because the studies included different types of patients and used varied delivery methods, and because the trials were small and few in number.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to March 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",
