  "draft": "How accurate are the HINTS (head impulse, eye movement, and eye alignment) and HINTS Plus (adds a hearing test) examinations for identifying a brain (central) cause of sudden severe dizziness?\n\n**Key messages**\n- HINTS (head impulse — quick head‑turn test, nystagmus — involuntary eye movement, test of skew — checking eye alignment) and HINTS Plus (adds a hearing test) examinations performed by trained clinicians in emergency settings can usually identify when sudden severe dizziness is caused by a brain problem (central cause) rather than an inner‑ear problem (peripheral cause); no harmful effects of the examinations were reported.\n- When the same examinations are performed with video assistance (using video goggles or recordings), only a few studies have examined this approach and the results are uncertain, so it is less clear whether video assistance improves accuracy.\n- Because the existing evidence is limited and the studies are few, more high‑quality research is needed to confirm how well these tests work in different clinical settings, with different providers, and to compare them directly with imaging such as MRI.\n\n**Introduction**\nWhy is figuring out the cause of sudden dizziness important?\nSudden, severe dizziness – called acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) – brings symptoms such as spinning (vertigo), nausea, vomiting, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and feeling unsteady. AVS can arise from problems in the inner ear (peripheral causes) or from the brain (central causes). Knowing whether the problem is peripheral or central matters because the treatments and the risk of serious outcomes differ: peripheral problems often improve with medication or vestibular therapy, while central problems may be strokes or other brain injuries that need urgent medical intervention. Doctors usually rely on the patient’s history, risk‑factor check‑lists, and sometimes expensive brain scans (MRI) to decide the cause.\nWhat is the HINTS (Head impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) examination?\narray\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations identify a central (brain‑related) cause of acute vestibular syndrome. Specifically, they looked at the accuracy of these tests – how often they correctly spot a central problem (sensitivity) and how often they correctly rule it out (specificity) – when performed by clinicians in real‑world settings, with and without video assistance.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched databases for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations for identifying central causes of acute vestibular syndrome, combined their results into pooled accuracy estimates, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 16 diagnostic‑test‑accuracy studies that together enrolled 2,024 participants (981 women, 1,043 men) with a mean age of about 60 years. All had an acute vestibular syndrome. Each study compared bedside HINTS or HINTS‑Plus examinations (head‑imp: impulse, nystagmus, test of skew, with or without an auditory test) – sometimes with video assistance – against a reference standard such as MRI or a final neurologist diagnosis. Thirteen studies were conducted in emergency‑department settings; the remainder were in outpatient or inpatient settings. About half of the examinations were performed by neurologists. No details on study duration or funding were provided.\nMain results: HINTS test improves detection of a central cause\nThe standard HINTS test probably greatly improves clinicians’ ability to identify a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome, correctly detecting roughly 94 out of every 100 patients, although confidence in this estimate is limited. Adding the skew test (HINTS Plus) probably also greatly improves detection, correctly identifying about 95 out of 100 patients, with similarly limited confidence. Using video assistance with the basic HINTS test yields very uncertain results, so its benefit is unclear. Using video assistance with HINTS Plus probably greatly improves detection, correctly identifying around 86–94 out of 100 patients, and we have moderate confidence in this finding.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we care about, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical style checks: several section subheadings are not phrased as questions (Methods, Limitations, Currency) and one subheading contains a placeholder \"array\" instead of explanatory text. These issues break the required structure and would confuse readers. Additionally, the text includes long, noun‑heavy sentences and passive constructions that reduce readability (e.g., a 35‑word sentence about the HINTS test’s accuracy, and passive phrasing \"No harmful effects of the examinations were reported\"). The metrics confirm these problems – words per sentence (24.8, P90), nominalizations (31, BEYOND_P90) and noun count (212, BEYOND_P90) are far above typical PLS ranges, indicating the draft is more complex than needed. To meet the Master Style Guide and improve patient‑facing clarity, the draft should:\n1. Re‑write all subheadings as questions (e.g., \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up to date is this review?\").\n2. Replace the placeholder \"array\" with a brief, plain‑language description of the HINTS examination.\n3. Shorten long sentences and convert passive voice to active voice (e.g., change \"No harmful effects of the examinations were reported\" to a active form).\n4. Reduce nominalizations and noun‑heavy phrasing by using more verbs (e.g., \"We compared\" instead of \"diagnostic‑test‑accuracy studies\").\n5. Break up dense paragraphs and ensure bullet points start with a dash. Implementing these changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients.",

These metric outliers align with the identified issues of long sentences, noun‑heavy language, and excessive nominalization."
