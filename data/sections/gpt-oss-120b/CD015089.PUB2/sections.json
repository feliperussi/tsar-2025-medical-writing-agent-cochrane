  "key_messages": [
    "HINTS (head impulse — quick head‑turn test, nystagmus — involuntary eye movement, test of skew — checking eye alignment) and HINTS Plus (adds a hearing test) examinations performed by trained clinicians in emergency settings can usually identify when sudden severe dizziness is caused by a brain problem (central cause) rather than an inner‑ear problem (peripheral cause); no harmful effects of the examinations were reported.",
    "When the same examinations are performed with video assistance (using video goggles or recordings), only a few studies have examined this approach and the results are uncertain, so it is less clear whether video assistance improves accuracy.",
    "Because the existing evidence is limited and the studies are few, more high‑quality research is needed to confirm how well these tests work in different clinical settings, with different providers, and to compare them directly with imaging such as MRI."

      "subheading": "Why is figuring out the cause of sudden dizziness important?",
      "content": "Sudden, severe dizziness – called acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) – brings symptoms such as spinning (vertigo), nausea, vomiting, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and feeling unsteady. AVS can arise from problems in the inner ear (peripheral causes) or from the brain (central causes). Knowing whether the problem is peripheral or central matters because the treatments and the risk of serious outcomes differ: peripheral problems often improve with medication or vestibular therapy, while central problems may be strokes or other brain injuries that need urgent medical intervention. Doctors usually rely on the patient’s history, risk‑factor check‑lists, and sometimes expensive brain scans (MRI) to decide the cause."

      "content": "The authors wanted to know how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus examinations identify a central (brain‑related) cause of acute vestibular syndrome. Specifically, they looked at the accuracy of these tests – how often they correctly spot a central problem (sensitivity) and how often they correctly rule it out (specificity) – when performed by clinicians in real‑world settings, with and without video assistance."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We examined 16 diagnostic‑test‑accuracy studies that together enrolled 2,024 participants (981 women, 1,043 men) with a mean age of about 60 years. All had an acute vestibular syndrome. Each study compared bedside HINTS or HINTS‑Plus examinations (head‑imp: impulse, nystagmus, test of skew, with or without an auditory test) – sometimes with video assistance – against a reference standard such as MRI or a final neurologist diagnosis. Thirteen studies were conducted in emergency‑department settings; the remainder were in outpatient or inpatient settings. About half of the examinations were performed by neurologists. No details on study duration or funding were provided."

      "subheading": "Main results: HINTS test improves detection of a central cause",
      "content": "The standard HINTS test probably greatly improves clinicians’ ability to identify a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome, correctly detecting roughly 94 out of every 100 patients, although confidence in this estimate is limited. Adding the skew test (HINTS Plus) probably also greatly improves detection, correctly identifying about 95 out of 100 patients, with similarly limited confidence. Using video assistance with the basic HINTS test yields very uncertain results, so its benefit is unclear. Using video assistance with HINTS Plus probably greatly improves detection, correctly identifying around 86–94 out of 100 patients, and we have moderate confidence in this finding."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we care about, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search."
