  "draft": "Is home‑based heart‑rehab (exercise program done at home, sometimes using video or phone support) as effective as centre‑based heart‑rehab for people after a heart attack, heart surgery or heart failure?\n\nKey messages:\n- Home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised exercise and education program done at home, often with video or phone support) works about as well as centre‑based programmes for people after a heart attack, heart surgery (revascularisation – a procedure that restores blood flow to the heart) or heart failure. It gives similar benefits for survival (death rates), ability to exercise, and overall health‑related quality of life (how health affects daily wellbeing), and no extra harms were reported.\n- The proportion of people who finish the programme and the cost per patient were similar for home‑based and centre‑based programmes, so when both options are offered, choosing the one the individual prefers may be reasonable.\n- More research is needed to see whether these short‑term results continue over longer periods, to test home‑based programmes in other heart conditions, and to evaluate hybrid models that combine home and centre delivery.\n\nWhy is heart disease a major health problem and what is cardiac rehabilitation?\nHeart disease, which includes heart attacks, heart failure and problems with the heart’s blood vessels, is the leading cause of death worldwide. After a heart event, doctors usually recommend cardiac rehabilitation – a supervised set of exercises, education and lifestyle advice designed to help people recover, improve fitness and lower the chance of another heart problem. Traditionally these programmes run in hospitals, gyms or community centres where patients attend regular sessions. More recently, programmes that can be done at home – sometimes using video calls or apps (called telehealth or digital support) – have been created to make rehabilitation easier to access, especially when face‑to‑face visits are limited, such as during the COVID‑19 pandemic.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (including any digital or telehealth tools) with traditional centre‑based programmes. We wanted to know whether the two approaches differ in:\n- total mortality (the number of people who die);\n- morbidity (the number of people who experience further heart problems);\n- exercise capacity (how well a person can physically perform, often measured by a walking or cycling test);\n- health‑related quality of life (how a person feels about their overall health and daily activities);\n- modifiable cardiac risk factors (behaviours or conditions that can be changed, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking or weight).\nIn short, we wanted to find out if doing cardiac rehab at home works just as well as doing it in a centre.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to groups) that compared home‑based (including digital/telehealth) with supervised centre‑based cardiac rehabilitation in adults with heart disease. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 24 trials that enrolled a total of 3,046 participants who had a heart attack, had undergone revascularisation, or were living with heart failure. Most trials reported outcomes up to 12 months; only three provided data beyond one year. We found that the chance of death, exercise capacity (up to one year and beyond), health‑related quality of life, programme completion rates and cost per patient were all very similar for home‑based and centre‑based programmes. The certainty of the evidence varied across outcomes, but overall the findings suggest comparable benefits.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany participants knew which programme they were receiving, and most trials were small, which reduces our confidence in the results. Some studies did not report enough detail to fully assess risk of bias.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to September 2022.",

No extra harms were reported.\"\n2. **Technical jargon without plain‑language equivalents** – terms such as \"mortality\", \"morbidity\", \"exercise capacity\" and \"modifiable cardiac risk factors\" appear in the \"What did the researchers want to find out?\" section. Even though they are listed, many readers may not retain the definitions. *Rewrite:* replace with everyday words, e.g., \"death rates\" for mortality, \"new heart problems\" for morbidity, \"how far a person can walk or cycle\" for exercise capacity, and \"things that can be changed, like blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking or weight\" for modifiable risk factors.\n3. **Passive‑voice construction** – \"The proportion of people who finish the programme and the cost per patient were similar for home‑based and centre‑based programmes, so when both options are offered, choosing the one the individual prefers may be reasonable.\" Passive phrasing hides who is doing the action. *Rewrite:* \"People finished the programme at similar rates and the cost per patient was about the same for home‑based and centre‑based programmes. When both options are available, patients can choose the one they prefer.\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy sentence** – \"The evidence suggests that home‑based cardiac rehabilitation probably provides similar benefits to centre‑based programmes.\" The sentence is noun‑laden and vague. *Rewrite:* \"Our evidence shows that home‑based rehab works as well as centre‑based rehab.\"\n5. **Missing simple summary of key numbers** – The draft never states the exact number of participants (3,046) or trials (24) in a stand‑alone sentence, which makes the scale of the evidence less clear. *Add sentence:* \"We analysed data from 24 trials involving a total of 3,046 people.\"\nThese issues are supported by the metric analysis, which shows the draft is far outside typical PLS patterns for several readability indicators: 34 passive‑voice constructions (well beyond the typical 9‑23 range, marked BEYOND_P90), 215 nouns (BEYOND_P90), high Gunning Fog (19.66, P90) and SMOG (14.45, P90) scores, and a large number of complex and long words (complex_words = 163, long_words = 203, both BEYOND_P90). Reducing passive voice, simplifying vocabulary, and shortening sentences will bring the text into the normal PLS range and improve patient comprehension.",
