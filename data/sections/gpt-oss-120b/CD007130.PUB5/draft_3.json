  "draft": "Is home‑based heart‑rehab (exercise program done at home, sometimes using video or phone support) as effective as centre‑based heart‑rehab for people after a heart attack, heart surgery or heart failure?\n\nKey messages:\n- Home‑based cardiac rehabilitation – a supervised exercise, education and lifestyle programme that can be done at home with video or phone support – works about as well as centre‑based programmes for people after a heart attack, heart surgery or heart failure. It provides similar benefits for survival (death rates), for the ability to exercise (measured by walking or cycling tests), and for overall quality of life, and no extra harms were reported.\n- The proportion of people who finish the programme and the cost per patient were similar for home‑based and centre‑based programmes, so when both options are offered, choosing the one the individual prefers may be reasonable.\n- More research is needed to see whether these short‑term results continue over longer periods, to test home‑based programmes in other heart conditions, and to evaluate hybrid models that combine home and centre delivery.\n\nWhy is heart disease a major health problem and what is cardiac rehabilitation?\nHeart disease, which includes heart attacks, heart failure and problems with the heart’s blood vessels, is the leading cause of death worldwide. After a heart event, doctors usually recommend cardiac rehabilitation – a supervised set of exercises, education and lifestyle advice – to help people recover, improve fitness and lower the chance of another heart problem. Traditionally these programmes run in hospitals, gyms or community centres where patients attend regular sessions. More recently, programmes that can be done at home – sometimes using video calls or apps (called telehealth or digital support) – have been created to make rehabilitation easier to access, especially when face‑to‑face visits are limited, such as during the COVID‑19 pandemic.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (including any digital or telehealth tools) with traditional centre‑based programmes. We examined whether the two approaches differ in:\n- total mortality – the number of people who die;\n- morbidity – the number who have another heart problem;\n- exercise capacity – how far a person can walk or cycle;\n- health‑related quality of life – how they feel about their health day‑to‑day;\n- risk factors that can be changed, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking or weight.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared home‑based (including digital/telehealth) with supervised centre‑based cardiac rehabilitation in adults with heart‑disease. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 24 trials that enrolled 3,046 participants who had a heart attack, had undergone revascularisation, or were living with heart failure. Most trials reported outcomes up to 12 months; only three provided data beyond one year. The evidence suggests that home‑based cardiac rehabilitation probably provides similar benefits to centre‑based programmes. The chance of death, exercise capacity (both up to one year and beyond), health‑related quality of life, programme completion rates and cost per patient were all little or no different between the two approaches. The certainty of the evidence varied across outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence because participants often knew which programme they received, and many trials were small. Some studies did not report enough detail to fully assess risk of bias.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to September 2022.",
