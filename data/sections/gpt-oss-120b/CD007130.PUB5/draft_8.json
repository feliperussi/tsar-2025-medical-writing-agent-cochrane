  "draft": "Is home‑based heart‑rehab (exercise program done at home, sometimes using video or phone support) as effective as centre‑based heart‑rehab for people after a heart attack, heart surgery or heart failure?\n\nKey messages:\n- Home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised exercise and education program done at home, often with video or phone support) works about as well as centre‑based programmes for people after a heart attack, heart surgery (revascularisation) or heart failure. It gives similar benefits for survival (death rates), ability to exercise, and overall health‑related quality of life, and it does not cause extra harms.\n- The proportion of people who finish the programme and the cost per patient are similar for home‑based and centre‑based programmes, so when both options are offered patients can choose the one they prefer.\n- More research is needed to see whether these short‑term results continue over longer periods, to test home‑based programmes in other heart conditions, and to evaluate hybrid models that combine home and centre delivery.\n\nWhy is heart disease a major health problem and what is cardiac rehabilitation?\nHeart disease, which includes heart attacks, heart failure and problems with the heart’s blood vessels, is the leading cause of death worldwide. After a heart event, doctors usually recommend cardiac rehabilitation – a supervised set of exercises, education and lifestyle advice designed to help people recover, improve fitness and lower the chance of another heart problem. Traditionally these programmes run in hospitals, gyms or community centres where patients attend regular sessions. More recently, programmes that can be done at home – sometimes using video calls or apps (called telehealth or digital support) – have been created to make rehabilitation easier to access, especially when face‑to‑face visits are limited, such as during the COVID‑19 pandemic.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (including any digital or telehealth tools) with traditional centre‑based programmes. We wanted to know whether the two approaches differ in:\n- total mortality (the number of people who die);\n- morbidity (the number of people who experience further heart problems);\n- exercise capacity (how well a person can perform physical tests, such as walking or cycling);\n- health‑related quality of life (how a person feels about their overall health and daily activities);\n- modifiable cardiac risk factors (behaviours or conditions that can be changed, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking or weight).\nIn short, we wanted to find out if doing cardiac rehab at home works just as well as doing it in a centre.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials – studies that randomly assign participants to groups – that compared home‑based (including digital/telehealth) with supervised centre‑based cardiac rehabilitation in adults with heart disease. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system, a method that grades how certain we are about the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 24 trials that enrolled a total of 3,046 people who had a heart attack, had undergone revascularisation, or were living with heart failure. Most trials reported outcomes up to 12 months; only three provided data beyond one year. The chance of death, exercise capacity (up to one year and beyond), health‑related quality of life, programme completion rates and cost per patient were all very similar for home‑based and centre‑based programmes. The certainty of the evidence varied across outcomes, but overall the findings suggest comparable benefits.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany participants knew which programme they were receiving, and most trials were small, which reduces our confidence in the results. Some studies did not report enough detail to fully assess risk of bias.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several statements that would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – the term “revascularisation” appears in the first key‑message bullet without any definition, and the “GRADE system” is mentioned in the methods paragraph with no explanation. Readers may not know what these mean.\n2. **Ambiguous wording** – the phrase “does not cause extra harms” is vague; the source says no extra harms were reported, so the wording should reflect that.\n3. **Overly long sentence** – the sentence in the Results section (\"The chance of death, exercise capacity (up to one year and beyond), health‑related quality of life, programme completion rates and cost per patient were all very similar for home‑based and centre‑based programmes.\") packs five different outcomes into a single 30‑word sentence, making it hard to follow.\nThese issues reduce readability and could mislead patients. The draft also shows a high number of passive constructions (32, well beyond the typical range) and a very high noun count (212) and complex‑word count, which further hampers plain‑language clarity.\n**Suggested rewrites:**\n- Replace “revascularisation” with “heart surgery to restore blood flow”.\n- Explain GRADE: “We rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system, which assesses how certain we are about the findings.”\n- Rephrase the harms statement to: “No additional harms were reported.”\n- Split the long results sentence into two shorter ones, e.g.:\n  \"The risk of death, ability to exercise, and quality of life were all very similar for home‑based and centre‑based programmes. Completion rates and cost per patient were also alike.\"\nAddressing these points will bring the PLS into line with the Master Style Guide and improve patient comprehension.",

These metric spikes reflect the identified clarity issues and suggest the text is more complex than usual for a plain‑language summary."
