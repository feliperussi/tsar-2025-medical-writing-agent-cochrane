  "draft": "Is home-based heart-rehab (exercise program done at home, sometimes using video or phone support) as effective as centre-based heart-rehab for people after a heart attack, heart surgery or heart failure?\n\nKey messages:\n- Home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised exercise and education program done at home, often with video or phone support) seems to work about as well as centre‑based programmes for people after a heart attack, heart surgery or heart failure, showing similar effects on survival (death rates), ability to exercise, and overall health‑related quality of life (how health impacts daily wellbeing); no extra harms were reported.\n- The proportion of people who finish the programme and the cost per patient were similar for home‑based and centre‑based programmes, so when both options are offered, choosing the one the individual prefers may be reasonable.\n- Further research is needed to find out whether these comparable short‑term results continue over longer periods, to test home‑based programmes in other heart conditions, and to evaluate hybrid models (programmes that combine elements of both home and centre delivery).\n\nIntroduction\nWhy is heart disease a major health problem and what is cardiac rehabilitation?\nHeart disease, which includes heart attacks, heart failure and problems with the heart’s blood vessels, is the leading cause of death worldwide. After a heart event, doctors usually recommend a programme called cardiac rehabilitation. This is a supervised set of exercises, education and lifestyle advice designed to help people recover, improve their fitness and reduce the chance of another heart problem. Traditionally, these programmes are run in hospitals, gyms or community centres where patients attend regular sessions. More recently, programmes that can be done at home – sometimes using video calls or apps (called telehealth or digital support) – have been created to make rehabilitation easier to access, especially when face‑to‑face visits are limited, such as during the COVID‑19 pandemic.\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review authors set out to compare home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (including any digital or telehealth tools) with the traditional centre‑based programmes. They wanted to see whether the two approaches differ in terms of:\n- total mortality (the number of people who die),\n- morbidity (the number of people who experience further heart problems),\n- exercise capacity (how well a person can physically perform, often measured by a walking or cycling test),\n- health‑related quality of life (how a person feels about their overall health and daily activities), and\n- modifiable cardiac risk factors (behaviours or conditions that can be changed, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking or weight).\nIn short, the goal was to find out if doing cardiac rehab at home works just as well as doing it in a centre, and whether one method might be better for any of these important health outcomes.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to groups) that compared home‑based (including digital/telehealth) with supervised centre‑based cardiac rehabilitation in adults with heart disease, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 24 randomised controlled trials that enrolled a total of 3,046 people who had experienced a heart attack, had undergone revascularisation, or were living with heart failure. The trials compared home‑based cardiac rehabilitation programmes – many of which used digital or telehealth tools – with supervised centre‑based programmes delivered in hospitals, sports facilities or community centres. Most of the studies were short, usually reporting outcomes up to 12 months, and only three provided data beyond one year. The abstract did not give details about participants’ ages, gender balance, the countries where the studies were carried out, or the sources of funding.\n\nThe evidence suggests that home‑based cardiac rehabilitation probably provides similar benefits to centre‑based programmes. The chance of death, physical fitness (exercise capacity) up to one year and after one year, health‑related quality of life, completion of the rehabilitation programme and the cost per patient are all probably make little or no difference between the two approaches, although the certainty of the evidence varies across outcomes.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.",

Sections titled “Methods”, “Results”, “Limitations” and “Currency” are not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, several clarity issues would confuse readers: (1) very long, compound sentences that are hard to follow; (2) excessive passive constructions that hide who performed actions; (3) noun‑heavy phrasing that reduces readability. Suggested rewrites are provided below. These changes, together with reducing sentence length and passive voice, will also address the metric deviations (e.g., words_per_sentence = 31.1 → <22, passive_voice = 40 → <13, nouns = 244 → <116).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit but deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns: words per sentence (31.1) and passive voice (40) are far beyond the usual range, and noun count (244) is excessively high. Readability indices (Flesch‑Kincaid grade 15.8, Gunning Fog 22.1) indicate a high reading level. Reducing sentence length, passive constructions, and noun density will bring the text closer to the median values for PLSs."
