  "draft": "Is home‑based heart‑rehab (exercise program done at home, sometimes using video or phone support) as effective as centre‑based heart‑rehab for people after a heart attack, heart surgery or heart failure?\n\nKey messages:\n- Home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised exercise, education and lifestyle programme done at home, often with video or phone support) works about as well as centre‑based programmes for people after a heart attack, heart surgery or heart failure. It gives similar benefits for survival (death rates), exercise capacity (how well a person can physically perform, measured by walking or cycling tests) and health‑related quality of life (how health affects daily wellbeing); no extra harms were reported.\n- The proportion of people who finish the programme and the cost per patient are similar for home‑based and centre‑based programmes, so offering both options and letting the individual choose is reasonable.\n- More research is needed to see whether these short‑term results continue over longer periods, to test home‑based programmes in other heart conditions, and to evaluate hybrid models (programmes that combine home and centre delivery).\n\nWhy is heart disease a major health problem and what is cardiac rehabilitation?\nWe explain that heart disease (including heart attacks, heart failure and blood‑vessel problems) is the leading cause of death worldwide. After a heart event, doctors recommend cardiac rehabilitation – a supervised set of exercises, education and lifestyle advice – to help people recover, improve fitness and lower the risk of another heart problem. Traditionally these programmes run in hospitals, gyms or community centres. More recently, home‑based programmes that use video calls or apps (telehealth) have been created to make rehabilitation easier to access, especially when face‑to‑face visits are limited.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (including any digital or telehealth tools) with traditional centre‑based programmes. We looked at whether the two approaches differ in total mortality (death rates), morbidity (further heart problems), exercise capacity, health‑related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors (things like blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking or weight that can be changed).\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched databases for randomised controlled trials that compared home‑based with supervised centre‑based cardiac rehabilitation in adults with heart disease. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 24 trials that enrolled 3,046 participants who had a heart attack, revascularisation or heart failure. Most trials reported outcomes up to 12 months; only three provided data beyond one year. The evidence suggests that home‑based cardiac rehabilitation probably provides similar benefits to centre‑based programmes. The chance of death, exercise capacity up to one year and after one year, health‑related quality of life, programme completion and cost per patient all show little or no difference between the two approaches. The certainty of the evidence varies across outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence because participants often knew which programme they received, and many trials were small. Some studies did not report enough detail to assess risk of bias fully.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to September 2022.\n",
