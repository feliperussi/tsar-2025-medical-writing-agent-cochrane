  "key_messages": [
    "Infliximab (a medicine that blocks inflammation) probably helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission by reducing the chance that symptoms return, compared with no active treatment, and the evidence supporting this is reasonably reliable; however, the review could not determine whether infliximab increases or reduces serious side‑effects because the safety data were very uncertain.",
    "When infliximab is given together with purine analogues (drugs that suppress the immune system), it probably works better at preventing symptom return than purine analogues alone, but information on possible harms remains unclear; comparisons with biosimilars (drugs that are very similar to an existing biologic medicine) suggest little difference in effectiveness, although the evidence is less certain.",
    "More high‑quality studies are needed to clarify the long‑term safety of infliximab, to compare it directly with other active treatments, and to provide clearer information for patients and clinicians."

      "subheading": "What is Crohn's disease and why is it a challenge?",
      "content": "Crohn's disease is a long‑lasting (chronic) condition that causes inflammation (swelling and irritation) in the digestive tract. People with Crohn's can have pain, diarrhoea, weight loss, and fatigue, and the disease‑related inflammation can lead to complications such as strictures (narrowing) or fistulas (abnormal connections between organs). Because the disease can flare up and then settle down, it often requires ongoing treatment to keep symptoms under control. Even when medicines bring the disease into a quiet phase called \"remission,\" many patients later experience a return of symptoms, known as a clinical relapse. Preventing these relapses is a major goal of treatment."

      "subheading": "What is infliximab and how is it used in Crohn's disease?",
      "content": "Infliximab is a type of biologic medicine called a monoclonal antibody. It works by attaching to a protein in the body called tumour necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑α) and neutralising it. TNF‑α is a key driver of the inflammation seen in Crohn's disease, and it is found at high levels in the blood, gut lining, and stool of affected people. By blocking this protein, infliximab can reduce inflammation and help keep the disease in remission. The drug is given by infusion (slow injection into a vein) or, in some versions, as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin). It can be used alone or together with other medicines such as purine analogues, which are another class of drugs that suppress the immune system."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to determine whether infliximab is effective and safe for keeping Crohn's disease in remission after the initial treatment phase. Specifically, they looked at whether infliximab reduces the chance of a clinical relapse compared with placebo (no active drug) or other active treatments, and whether it influences other outcomes such as loss of clinical response, endoscopic relapse (return of disease seen during a scope examination), and withdrawals because of serious or any adverse events."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified nine randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,257 people with Crohn's disease, aged 18 to 69 years. Seven trials involved biologically‑naïve patients and two included a mix of naïve and non‑naïve patients. At the start of the studies, three trials enrolled patients in remission, five enrolled patients with mixed disease activity, one enrolled biologic responders with active disease, and one enrolled only patients with fistulating disease. All but one trial were multicentre; the single‑centre study’s location was not specified. Funding sources varied: four trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies, two received mixed commercial and public funding, two were publicly funded, and one trial’s funding was not reported. The interventions compared infliximab with placebo, with purine analogues, with biosimilar infliximab (both intravenous and subcutaneous formulations), and with other biologics such as adalimumab. No information on the length of follow‑up was provided."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Infliximab reduces clinical relapse",
      "content": "Infliximab probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo (moderate certainty), with roughly one fewer relapse for every five people treated. When infliximab is combined with purine analogues, it probably produces a large reduction in clinical relapse compared with purine analogues alone (moderate certainty), preventing relapse in about half of the patients. Compared with a biosimilar infliximab, infliximab may make little or no difference in preventing relapse (low certainty) and may slightly increase loss of clinical response (low certainty). Infliximab may also cause a large increase in withdrawals due to adverse events versus a biosimilar (low certainty). Evidence for many safety outcomes, including serious adverse events, is very uncertain, so we cannot determine the effect of infliximab on these outcomes."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies knew which treatment they were receiving and not all studies reported all the information we wanted, and because the studies were very small with few events, making the results uncertain.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search."
