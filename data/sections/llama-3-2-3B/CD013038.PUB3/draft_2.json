  "draft": "**Does adding the smell and taste of milk to preterm babies' tube feeds help them start eating solid foods sooner?**\n\nWe looked at whether giving preterm babies the smell and taste of milk while they are being fed through a tube can help them start eating solid foods sooner.\n\n**What is the health problem?**\n\nPreterm babies (born before 37 weeks' gestation) often have trouble with oral feeding because of their immaturity. This means they may need to be fed through a tube for a while. However, many preterm babies have trouble with feeding and may need to stay in the hospital for a longer time.\n\n**What are the common treatments?**\n\nCommon treatments for preterm babies include feeding them through a tube. Smell and taste play an important role in helping our bodies digest food. However, when milk is fed through a tube, it bypasses the nose and mouth, so the baby doesn't get to smell and taste the milk.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to see if giving preterm babies the smell and taste of milk while they are being fed through a tube can help them start eating solid foods sooner.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nOur study found that giving preterm babies the smell and taste of milk while they are being fed through a tube probably has little to no effect on whether they can start eating solid foods sooner. We also found that there was no clear difference between giving them the smell and taste of milk and not giving them the smell and taste of milk on safety outcomes such as adverse effects, necrotising enterocolitis, and late infection.\n\n**What are the limitations of our study?**\n\nOur study had some limitations. The studies we looked at were small, and some of them didn't have clear randomization or blinding. This means that we can't be sure that the results are accurate.\n\n**What does this mean for preterm babies?**\n\nOur study suggests that giving preterm babies the smell and taste of milk while they are being fed through a tube may not be helpful in getting them to start eating solid foods sooner. However, more research is needed to confirm this. We also need to find ways to help preterm babies who have trouble with feeding and staying in the hospital for a longer time.\n\n**Key messages:**\n\n- Giving preterm babies the smell and taste of milk while they are being fed through a tube probably has little to no effect on whether they can start eating solid foods sooner.\n- There was no clear difference between giving them the smell and taste of milk and not giving them the smell and taste of milk on safety outcomes.\n- More research is needed to confirm these findings and to find ways to help preterm babies who have trouble with feeding and staying in the hospital for a longer time.",

Unexplained jargon (e.g., \"pre-absorptive processes\"), overly long sentences, and abrupt transitions reduce clarity for a lay audience. The metrics show a high use of passive voice and complex words, which further hampers comprehension. Revisions should focus on adding a concise conclusion, defining technical terms, breaking long sentences into shorter ones, and using more active voice and simpler language.",
