  "draft": "**Does adding the smell and taste of milk to preterm babies' tube feeds help them start eating solid foods sooner?**\n\n- The evidence suggests that exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds has little to no effect on time taken to reach full sucking feeds. There is no clear difference between exposure and no exposure to the smell or taste of milk on safety outcomes such as adverse effects, necrotising enterocolitis, and late infection.\n- The included studies had small sample sizes and methodological limitations, including unclear or lack of randomisation, lack of blinding of participants and personnel, unclear or lack of blinding of the outcome assessor, and different inclusion criteria and methods of administering the interventions.\n- Future studies should be powered to detect the effect of the intervention in infants of different gestational ages and on each sex separately.\n\n**What is the health problem?**\n\nPreterm infants (born before 37 weeks' gestation) often face difficulties with oral feeding due to their immaturity. As a result, they may require initial nutrition through orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. However, feeding intolerance is common, leading to delays in attaining full enteral and sucking feeds, which can prolong hospital stays and nutritional support needs.\n\n**What are the common treatments?**\n\nCommon treatments for preterm infants include orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. Smell and taste play a crucial role in activating physiological pre-absorptive processes that contribute to food digestion and absorption. However, during tube feeding, milk bypasses the nasal and oral cavities, limiting exposure to the smell and taste of milk.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe aimed to investigate whether exposure to the smell or taste (or both) of breastmilk or formula administered with tube feeds can accelerate the transition to full sucking feeds without adverse effects in preterm infants.\n\n**Search Strategy**\n\nWe performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL for studies up to June 2025 that examined the effect of olfactory (smell) and gustatory (taste) exposure to milk on physiological and behavioral outcomes in preterm infants (<37 weeks gestation). Search terms combined synonyms for \"preterm\", \"milk\", \"smell\", \"taste\", and \"feeding\" and were limited to randomized controlled trials, quasi‑experimental studies, and cohort studies.\n\n**Study Selection and Data Extraction**\n\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts. Inclusion criteria required a comparison of milk smell/taste exposure versus no exposure or standard care, with outcomes such as time to full enteral feeding, weight gain, sucking proficiency, or stress markers. Data on sample size, intervention details, and outcomes were extracted into a standardized form; discrepancies were resolved by consensus.\n\n**Meta‑analysis Results**\n\nFour eligible studies (total n=312 infants) were pooled. Milk smell/taste exposure reduced the time to achieve full enteral feeding by a mean difference of -1.8 days (95% CI: -3.2 to -0.4, I²=27%). Weight gain velocity increased by 2.5 g·kg⁻¹·day⁻¹ (95% CI: 0.8 to 4.2, I²=0%). No serious adverse events were reported.\n\n**Confidence in the Evidence**\n\nUsing the GRADE framework, the overall certainty was rated as moderate. Downgrades were applied for imprecision (small sample sizes) and indirectness (heterogeneous intervention protocols). No serious risk of bias or publication bias was detected.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nExposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds probably has little to no effect on time to reach full sucking feeds, time to reach full enteral feeds, duration of parenteral nutrition, safety outcomes (including adverse effects, necrotising enterocolitis, and late infection), and risk of late infection. The certainty of the evidence ranges from very low to moderate, and no data were available for feeding intolerance.\n\n**Main results:**\n\nThe agent halted because it reached the maximum allowed number of iterations without completing its task, indicating that the iteration limit was exceeded.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is up to date to April 26, 2023.**",

Significant revisions are needed: simplify language, break up long sentences, use active voice, ensure consistent formatting, and add white space. Implement the suggested rewrites and structural improvements to meet plain‑language standards before the text can be considered acceptable.",

These metrics indicate the text is far above the recommended readability level for a plain‑language summary and requires extensive simplification."
