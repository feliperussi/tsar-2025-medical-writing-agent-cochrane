    "The review found that sealant use may reduce the time to hemostasis and the rate of hemostatic intervention failure in vascular surgery patients, but the evidence is very uncertain due to a high risk of bias in all studies.",
    "No significant differences were found between sealant and control groups for intraoperative blood loss, operating time, postoperative bleeding, or unplanned return to the operating room for bleeding complications.",
    "Future trials are needed to provide unbiased data and address other considerations such as cost-effectiveness and adverse events with sealant use."

      "content": "Bleeding can occur at the site where blood vessels are joined (anastomosis) during vascular surgery. Sealants are products that can be applied to help stop this bleeding, but it is not clear how well they work in patients undergoing these procedures."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The agent halted because it exceeded the configured maximum number of iterations. This usually indicates that the task could not converge within the allowed steps, suggesting a potential infinite loop, overly complex logic, or insufficient termination conditions."

      "content": "Sealant use may reduce mean time to hemostasis (MD −230.09 s, 95% CI −329.24 to −130.94; p<0.00001; low‑certainty evidence, 7 studies, 498 participants). It may also reduce failure rate (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35‑0.61; very low‑certainty evidence, 17 studies, 2120 participants). No clear differences were found for intra‑operative blood loss, operating time, postoperative bleeding up to 30 days, or unplanned return to OR for bleeding. No data on death from bleeding or quality‑of‑life outcomes were reported."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
