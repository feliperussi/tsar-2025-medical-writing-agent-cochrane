Sealants are products that can be applied to help stop this bleeding, but it's not clear how well they work in patients undergoing these procedures.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe aimed to assess whether using sealants as an additional measure during vascular surgery reduces bleeding and improves outcomes, and to identify any potential harms associated with their use.\n\n**Search Strategy**\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that compare sealant use with standard care controls in patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\n**Data Synthesis**\nEligible studies were pooled using meta-analysis techniques to combine results on the benefits and harms of sealants as adjuncts for achieving anastomotic site hemostasis.\n\n**Evidence Assessment**\nThe confidence in the body of evidence was graded using a standardized rating system (e.g., GRADE) to evaluate the overall certainty of the findings.\n\n**What did we find?**\nSealant use may reduce mean time to hemostasis (MD −230.09 s, 95% CI −329.24 to −130.94; p<0.00001; low‑certainty evidence, 7 studies, 498 participants). It may also reduce failure rate (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35 and 0.61; very low‑certainty evidence, 17 studies, 2120 participants). No clear differences were found for intra‑operative blood loss, operating time, postoperative bleeding up to 30 days, or unplanned return to the operating room for bleeding. No data on death from bleeding or quality‑of‑life outcomes were reported.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is up to date to 6 March 2023 of search.**\n\n**Key messages:**\n- Sealant use may reduce the time to hemostasis and the rate of hemostatic intervention failure in vascular surgery patients, but the evidence is very uncertain due to a high risk of bias in all studies.\n- No significant differences were found between sealant and control groups for intra‑operative blood loss, operating time, postoperative bleeding, or unplanned return to the operating room for bleeding.\n- Future trials are needed to provide unbiased data and address other considerations such as cost‑effectiveness and adverse events with sealant use.\n\n**Introduction/Aims:**\n- What is the health problem?\n  - Bleeding can occur at the site where blood vessels are joined (anastomosis) during vascular surgery. Sealants are products that can be applied to help stop this bleeding, but it is not clear how well they work in patients undergoing these procedures.\n- What did we want to find out?\n  - We aimed to assess whether using sealants as an additional measure during vascular surgery reduces bleeding and improves outcomes, and to identify any potential harms associated with their use.\n\n**Methods:**\n- Search Strategy\n  - We performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies that compare sealant use with standard care controls in patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n- Data Synthesis\n  - Eligible studies were pooled using meta‑analysis techniques to combine results on the benefits and harms of sealants as adjuncts for achieving anastomotic site hemostasis.\n- Evidence Assessment\n  - The confidence in the body of evidence was graded using a standardized rating system (e.g., GRADE) to evaluate the overall certainty of the findings.\n\n**Results:**\n- What did we find?\n  - Sealant use may reduce mean time to hemostasis (MD −230.09 s, 95% CI −329.24 to −130.94; p<0.00001; low‑certainty evidence, 7 studies, 498 participants).
