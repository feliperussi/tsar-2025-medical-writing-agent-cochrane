  "draft": "**What do people think about general health checks?**\n\n**Key Messages**\n- General health checks remain popular despite limited effectiveness; they meet specific wants and need alternative de-implementation strategies before changes.\n- Evidence on factors influencing commissioning, delivery, and uptake is insufficient; policymakers see a favorable political climate and stakeholder support as needed.\n- Future research should address decision-maker priorities: improving uptake in various settings and assessing unwanted effects and costs.\n\n**What is a general health check?**\nGeneral health checks are preventive services offered by national programmes or commercial providers. They involve a set of screening tests for asymptomatic individuals to assess overall health and aim to reduce morbidity and mortality.\n\n**Why are general health checks important?**\nThese checks enable early identification of health issues, allowing timely interventions that can prevent complications and improve population health outcomes.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe sought to understand how healthcare managers, policymakers, providers, and clients perceive and experience general health checks, and to identify the factors that affect their commissioning, delivery, and uptake.\n\n**Summary**\nThis review examines stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences of general health checks, and the factors influencing their commissioning, delivery, and uptake, to complement findings from a previous Cochrane review on effectiveness.\n\n**What did we find?**\nGeneral health checks remain popular with patients, providers, and policymakers despite limited evidence of reducing death or disease. People view them as motivation and reassurance, but fear of bad news, cost, time, and cultural factors can deter attendance. Access, awareness, and supportive policies influence uptake, and providers’ encouragement is key. Any move to reduce or replace these checks will need viable alternatives and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search**",

It uses unexplained jargon, contains several sentences longer than 30 words, and includes passive‑voice constructions that obscure who is performing actions. Wordy phrases and missing paragraph breaks make the text hard to read, and there are no bullet points to highlight key points. While the factual content matches the source, the clarity, style, and structure issues need to be addressed before the document can be considered acceptable.",
