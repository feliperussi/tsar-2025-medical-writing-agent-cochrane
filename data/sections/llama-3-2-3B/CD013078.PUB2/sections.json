      "content": "Patellar tendinopathy is a common condition that affects the tendon at the front of the knee, causing pain. The main treatment for patellar tendinopathy involves different types of exercise, including strengthening and stretching exercises. Strengthening exercises can be land-based or water-based, weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing, or both. Other treatments include surgery and glucocorticoid injections."

      "content": "We included seven trials involving 211 participants with chronic patellar tendinopathy. The trials compared strengthening exercises with no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, surgery, stretching exercise, or pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction. All trials included athletes, mostly males, with a mean age of 26 years and a mean duration of symptoms of 41.6 months. Most trials were susceptible to bias, particularly selection bias and attrition bias. We did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. The studies were conducted in various settings, but no specific countries were mentioned. The funding sources of the studies were not reported. The trials lasted for different durations, but no specific information was provided. The studies reported no adverse events. The population of interest was athletes, and the findings may not be generalizable to the general public."
