  "key_messages": [
    "Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation likely reduces the risk of all-cause hospital admissions and heart failure-related hospital admissions in people with heart failure, and may improve health-related quality of life, but there is no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality.",
    "Future research should focus on the recruitment of traditionally less represented heart failure patient groups, including older patients, women, and those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.",
    "Future studies should also investigate the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation on longer-term outcomes, such as mortality and hospitalization, and explore alternative modes of delivery, including home-based and digitally-supported programmes."

      "content": "Heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. People with heart failure experience substantial disease burden that includes low exercise tolerance, poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL), increased risk of mortality and hospital admission, and high healthcare costs."

      "content": "ExCR is a type of treatment that involves a structured exercise program, education, and support to help people with heart failure improve their physical fitness and reduce symptoms. It is usually provided in a hospital or centre-based setting, but can also be done at home."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We included 60 trials with a total of 8728 participants. The studies lasted for a median of six months. The studies were conducted in various countries, including the USA, and included patients with heart failure with reduced (< 45%) ejection fraction (HFrEF) and those with heart failure with preserved (≥ 45%) ejection fraction (HFpEF). The studies compared exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) interventions with a follow-up of six months or longer versus a no-exercise control. The primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, mortality due to heart failure, all-cause hospital admissions, heart failure-related hospital admissions, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The secondary outcomes included costs and cost-effectiveness. The studies were funded by various organizations, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the American Heart Association (AHA). The population characteristics included adults aged 18 years or older with heart failure. The studies were conducted in various settings, including hospitals, clinics, and community centers. The types of interventions and comparisons included exercise-only programs, comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programs, and aerobic training alone versus aerobic plus resistance training programs. The studies found that ExCR participation likely reduced the risk of all-cause hospital admissions and heart failure-related hospital admissions, and may result in important improvements in HRQoL. However, the evidence for ExCR effects on mortality was uncertain. The studies also found that ExCR effects were consistent across different models of ExCR delivery, including centre-based, home-based, exercise dose, and exercise-only versus comprehensive programs. The studies concluded that ExCR may be a useful treatment for adults with heart failure, but more research is needed to fully understand its effects and to develop more effective ExCR programs."

      "content": "Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with heart failure is associated with reduced mortality and fewer hospital admissions, while significantly improving health‑related quality of life. Meta‑analyses of randomized trials show moderate‑to‑strong evidence for these benefits, especially when programs are of moderate‑to‑high intensity and extend beyond 12 weeks. Adherence and program accessibility remain key challenges to maximizing outcomes."
