  "key_messages": [
    "Using a video camera to see a baby's vocal cords may increase the success of intubation on the first attempt and may result in fewer intubation attempts, but may not reduce the time required for successful intubation (low-certainty evidence). Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a reduced incidence of airway-related adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence). Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of videolaryngoscopy in neonatal intubation.",
    "Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: videolaryngoscopy devices that enhance visualization of the glottis and intubation success in neonates; and unwanted effects and costs associated with videolaryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy.",

      "subheading": "What is the health problem?",
      "content": "Establishing a secure airway is a critical part of neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room and the neonatal intensive care unit. Neonates who have difficulty establishing a secure airway are at risk of desaturation, bradycardia, and other complications. Current methods for establishing a secure airway, such as direct laryngoscopy and bag-valve-mask ventilation, can be associated with adverse effects like airway trauma and desaturation."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The researchers aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy in neonates (0 to 28 days of age). Specifically, they wanted to determine whether videolaryngoscopy can reduce the time and attempts required for endotracheal intubation, increase the success rate of intubation on the first attempt, and minimize adverse effects like desaturation and airway trauma."
