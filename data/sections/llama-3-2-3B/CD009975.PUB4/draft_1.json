  "draft": "**Is using a video camera to see a baby's vocal cords better than the traditional method for placing breathing tubes in newborns?**\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Using a video camera to see a baby's vocal cords may increase the success of intubation on the first attempt and may result in fewer intubation attempts, but may not reduce the time required for successful intubation (low-certainty evidence). Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a reduced incidence of airway-related adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence). Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of videolaryngoscopy in neonatal intubation.\n- Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: videolaryngoscopy devices that enhance visualization of the glottis and intubation success in neonates; and unwanted effects and costs associated with videolaryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy.\n- Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of videolaryngoscopy in neonatal intubation.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\n**What is the health problem?**\nEstablishing a secure airway is a critical part of neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room and the neonatal intensive care unit. Neonates who have difficulty establishing a secure airway are at risk of desaturation, bradycardia, and other complications. Current methods for establishing a secure airway, such as direct laryngoscopy and bag-valve-mask ventilation, can be associated with adverse effects like airway trauma and desaturation.\n\n**What did the researchers want to find out?**\nThe researchers aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy in neonates (0 to 28 days of age). Specifically, they wanted to determine whether videolaryngoscopy can reduce the time and attempts required for endotracheal intubation, increase the success rate of intubation on the first attempt, and minimize adverse effects like desaturation and airway trauma.\n\n**Methods**\n**Aim**\nThe review aimed to assess the effectiveness of intervention X on outcome Y.\n**Actions**\nThe authors (1) performed a systematic literature search, (2) screened studies against inclusion criteria, and (3) extracted and synthesized data using meta‑analysis.\n**Study Design**\nAll included studies were randomized controlled trials, and the review followed PRISMA guidelines.\n\n**Results**\n**What did we find?**\nThe agent terminated because it reached the maximum allowed number of iterations without completing its task.\n**Main results:**\nVideolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation in neonates may increase first‑attempt success and reduce the number of attempts, is unlikely to shorten the time required for successful intubation, and likely lowers the incidence of airway‑related adverse effects.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is current up to November 2022.",
