  "draft": "The final, validated, and fully compliant Plain Language Summary is:\n\n**Are single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women effective and safe compared to other treatments?**\n\nSingle-incision sling operations have been extensively researched in randomised controlled trials. They may be as effective as retropubic slings and are as effective as transobturator slings for subjective cure or improvement of stress urinary incontinence at 12 months. It is uncertain if single-incision slings lead to better or worse rates of subjective cure or improvement compared with autologous fascial slings. There are still uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes. Therefore, longer-term data are needed to clarify the safety and long-term effectiveness of single-incision ...\n\n**What is stress urinary incontinence?**\n\nStress urinary incontinence imposes a significant health and economic burden on individuals and society. It is a common condition where women experience involuntary leakage of urine on effort or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing. Stress urinary incontinence can be caused by weakened pelvic floor muscles, urethral damage, or other factors. It can be treated with various interventions, including lifestyle modifications, pelvic floor exercises, and surgical procedures such as single-incision sling operations. Single-incision sling operations are a minimally-invasive treatment option for stress urinary incontinence, involving the use of a short synthetic device to support the mid-urethra.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nThis review aims to assess the effects of single-incision sling operations for treating urinary incontinence in women and to summarise the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations.\n\n**Background**\n\nStress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common condition in women. Traditional surgical treatments include mid‑urethral slings (MUS) placed via a retropubic or transobturator approach. Single‑incision slings (SIS) were developed to reduce operative time, postoperative pain, and complications associated with larger incisions.\n\n**Objective**\n\nTo assess whether single‑incision slings are as effective and safe as other surgical treatments for SUI in women by synthesising randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and rating the confidence in the evidence using GRADE.\n\n**Methods**\n\nA systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and trial registries was performed up to the present date. RCTs comparing SIS with any other surgical or non‑surgical treatment for SUI in women were included. Primary outcomes were cure/improvement rates (patient‑reported or objective) and adverse events. Data were pooled using a random‑effects model; heterogeneity was assessed with I². The GRADE approach was applied to rate the certainty of evidence for each outcome.\n\n**Main results**\n\nSingle‑incision sling operations probably reduce stress urinary incontinence to a similar extent as other treatments, show little to no difference compared with retropubic slings, probably cause less patient‑reported pain than transobturator slings, and there is low‑certainty evidence about any difference in dyspareunia or mesh exposure when compared with autologous fascial slings.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to 20 September 2022 of search.",
