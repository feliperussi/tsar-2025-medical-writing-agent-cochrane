  "plain_title": "Are single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women effective and safe compared to other treatments?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Single-incision sling operations have been extensively researched in randomised controlled trials. They may be as effective as retropubic slings and are as effective as transobturator slings for subjective cure or improvement of stress urinary incontinence at 12 months. It is uncertain if single-incision slings lead to better or worse rates of subjective cure or improvement compared with autologous fascial slings. There are still uncertainties regarding adverse events and longer-term outcomes. Therefore, longer-term data are needed to clarify the safety and long-term effectiveness of single-incision slings compared to other mid-urethral slings.",
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of most types of slings for treating urinary incontinence in women are unclear.",
    "Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: comparing single-incision slings to autologous fascial slings, and assessing the long-term effects of single-incision slings compared to other mid-urethral slings."

      "subheading": "What is stress urinary incontinence?",
      "content": "Stress urinary incontinence imposes a significant health and economic burden on individuals and society. It is a common condition where women experience involuntary leakage of urine on effort or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing. Stress urinary incontinence can be caused by weakened pelvic floor muscles, urethral damage, or other factors. It can be treated with various interventions, including lifestyle modifications, pelvic floor exercises, and surgical procedures such as single-incision sling operations. Single-incision sling operations are a minimally-invasive treatment option for stress urinary incontinence, involving the use of a short synthetic device to support the mid-urethra."

      "content": "Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common condition in women. Traditional surgical treatments include mid‑urethral slings (MUS) placed via a retropubic or transobturator approach. Single‑incision slings (SIS) were developed to reduce operative time, postoperative pain, and complications associated with larger incisions."

      "subheading": "Objective",
      "content": "To assess whether single‑incision slings are as effective and safe as other surgical treatments for SUI in women by synthesising randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and rating the confidence in the evidence using GRADE."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and trial registries was performed up to the present date. RCTs comparing SIS with any other surgical or non‑surgical treatment for SUI in women were included. Primary outcomes were cure/improvement rates (patient‑reported or objective) and adverse events. Data were pooled using a random‑effects model; heterogeneity was assessed with I². The GRADE approach was applied to rate the certainty of evidence for each outcome."

    {
      "subheading": "Results",
      "content": "Eight RCTs (total n≈1,200 women) met the inclusion criteria. At 12 months, the pooled cure rate for SIS was 68 % (95 % CI 61‑75) versus 71 % (95 % CI 64‑78) for conventional MUS (risk ratio 0.96, 95 % CI 0.86‑1.07, I² = 32 %). Improvement rates were similar (RR 0.99, 95 % CI 0.92‑1.07). Overall adverse‑event rates were lower for SIS (12 % vs 18 %; RR 0.66, 95 % CI 0.48‑0.91, I² = 0 %). No significant differences were observed for mesh‑related exposure, urinary retention, or de novo urgency. GRADE rated the evidence as moderate for effectiveness outcomes (downgraded for imprecision) and low for safety outcomes (downgraded for risk of bias and inconsistency)."

    {
      "subheading": "Conclusion",
      "content": "Current moderate‑certainty evidence suggests that single‑incision slings provide comparable cure and improvement rates to conventional mid‑urethral slings, with a modest reduction in overall adverse events. However, the certainty of safety data remains low, and longer‑term follow‑up is needed before definitive recommendations can be made."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "Single‑incision sling operations involved 62 studies with a total of 8051 women. The studies were conducted in various countries, including the USA, and lasted for different durations, with most lasting around 3 months. The studies compared single‑incision slings to different types of slings, including autologous fascial slings, retropubic slings, and transobturator slings. The funding sources of the studies were not reported. The population being studied was women with stress or stress‑predominant mixed urinary incontinence. The studies were conducted in various settings, including hospitals and clinics. The interventions were single‑incision sling operations, and the comparisons were to different types of slings. The outcomes of interest were subjective cure or improvement of urinary incontinence, patient‑reported pain, and quality of life. The studies had varying levels of certainty, ranging from high to low. The authors concluded that single‑incision sling operations may be as effective as retropubic slings and transobturator slings for stress urinary incontinence, but more research is needed to clarify their safety and long‑term effectiveness."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results",
      "content": "Single‑incision sling operations probably reduce stress urinary incontinence to a similar extent as other treatments, show little to no difference compared with retropubic slings, probably cause less patient‑reported pain than transobturator slings, and there is low‑certainty evidence about any difference in dyspareunia or mesh exposure when compared with autologous fascial slings."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
