  "draft": "I apologize for the confusion earlier. It seems that I provided a response in a format that is not suitable for the task.\n\nTo provide a revised Plain Language Summary, I will follow the steps outlined in the task description.\n\nHere is the revised summary:\n\nIs precision nutrition-based intervention (using computerized decision support tools to provide personalized diet recommendations) effective for managing obesity in children and adolescents?\n\nKey messages:\n- The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of precision nutrition-based interventions on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to inform practice.\n- Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as foam or air-filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body; and unwanted effects and costs.\n- Precision nutrition-based interventions may be better than one-size-fits-all interventions or standard of care for children and adolescents with overweight or obesity, but the evidence is very uncertain and more research is needed.\n\nWhat is precision nutrition-based intervention?\nPrecision nutrition-based methods develop tailored interventions and recommendations: they consider determinants of intra- and inter-individual variation (e.g., genetics, current dietary habits, circadian rhythms, health status, gut microbiome, socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics, and physical activity) rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nPrecision–nutrition interventions for obesity in children and adolescents show very uncertain effects on body weight and BMI. Only two small studies were identified, and the confidence intervals are extremely wide, so it is unclear whether these interventions produce large, moderate, small, or trivial changes in weight or BMI.\n\nWhy is this review important?\nThis review was limited by the number of available randomised controlled trials in this relatively nascent field. Given these limitations, the two studies do not provide sufficient evidence to adequately inform practice. Future research should report participant outcome data, including outcomes related to mental, emotional, and functional well-being, in addition to biochemical and physical measures, stratified by World Health Organization-defined age groups (children (0 to 9 years), and children and adolescents (10 to 19 years)). Future studies should also report methods related to randomisation, blinding, and compliance, as well as include prespecified analysis of plans.\n\nLimitations of the evidence:\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nConclusion:\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of precision nutrition-based interventions on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to inform practice. Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as foam or air-filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body; and unwanted effects and costs. Precision nutrition-based interventions may be better than one-size-fits-all interventions or standard of care for children and adolescents with overweight or obesity, but the evidence is very uncertain and more research is needed.",
