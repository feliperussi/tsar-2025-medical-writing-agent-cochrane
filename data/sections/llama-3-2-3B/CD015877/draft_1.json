  "draft": "**Is precision nutrition-based intervention (using computerized decision support tools to provide personalized diet recommendations) effective for managing obesity in children and adolescents?**\n\n- The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of precision nutrition-based interventions on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to inform practice. Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: foam or air-filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body; and unwanted effects and costs.\n- Precision nutrition-based interventions may be better than one-size-fits-all interventions or standard of care for children and adolescents with overweight or obesity, but the evidence is very uncertain and more research is needed.\n\n**Definition of precision nutrition-based interventions**\n\nPrecision nutrition-based methods develop tailored interventions and recommendations that consider determinants of intra‑ and inter‑individual variation (e.g., genetics, current dietary habits, circadian rhythms, health status, gut microbiome, socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics, and physical activity) rather than a one‑size‑fits‑all approach. This systematic review examined their effect on overweight and obesity in children and adolescents.\n\n**Research question**\n\nThe review aimed to assess the impact of precision nutrition-based interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents across their diverse characteristics.\n\n**Implications of findings**\n\nThe findings suggest that precision nutrition can inform more effective, individualized obesity‑management strategies for youth and highlight the need for further research to fully understand its potential and to guide future global guidelines.\n\n**Scope of Review**\n\nWe identified studies that compared precision nutrition interventions with standard or no interventions in children and adolescents (0‑19 years).\n\n**Evidence Synthesis and Confidence**\n\nTwo small trials were pooled; confidence in the evidence was judged using study methods, size, and relevance to inform practice and global guidelines.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nPrecision–nutrition interventions for obesity in children and adolescents show very uncertain effects on body weight and BMI. Only two small studies were identified, and the confidence intervals are extremely wide, so it is unclear whether these interventions produce large, moderate, small, or trivial changes in weight or BMI.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**The evidence provided is current as of the latest available data up to October 2025.**",
