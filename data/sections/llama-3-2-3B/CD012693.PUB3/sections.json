    "The use of markers of ovarian reserve (e.g. anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), and basal FSH (bFSH)) to guide gonadotropin dose selection in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may or may not improve clinical outcomes, such as live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates, due to low-certainty evidence.",
    "There is insufficient evidence to determine whether individualised gonadotropin dose selection using markers of ovarian reserve leads to an increase in live birth/ongoing pregnancy rates compared to a policy of giving all women a standard dose of 150 IU.",

      "content": "Individualised gonadotropin dose selection using markers of ovarian reserve for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) is a complex process. Women who undergo IVF/ICSI receive daily doses of gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to induce multifollicular development in the ovaries. A normal response to stimulation (e.g. retrieval of 5 to 15 oocytes) is considered desirable. Generally, the number of eggs retrieved is associated with the dose of FSH. Both hyper-response and poor response are associated with an increased chance of cycle cancellation. In hyper-response, this is due to increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), while poor response cycles are cancelled because the quantity and quality of oocytes is expected to be low. Clinicians often individualise the FSH dose using patient characteristics predictive of ovarian response. Traditionally, this meant women's age, but increasingly, clinicians use various ovarian reserve tests (ORTs). These include basal FSH (bFSH), antral follicle count (AFC), and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). It is unclear whether individualising FSH dose improves clinical outcomes. This review updates the 2018 version."

Severe OHSS was rare; the pooled estimate favoured individualised dosing but was imprecise (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.30–1.55, very low certainty). Heterogeneity was low (I²<25%)."
