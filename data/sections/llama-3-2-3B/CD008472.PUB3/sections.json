      "content": "The 14 included studies involved 1295 participants, with an age range of 64.5 to 76 years and 84% male. The studies were conducted in various countries, with no specific country mentioned. The studies lasted for a total of 16 years, from 2003 to 2019. The studies were funded by various organizations, but no specific funding sources were mentioned. The studies compared remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) with no RIPC in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery. The studies found no clear difference in perioperative mortality, myocardial infarction, renal impairment, stroke, hospital stay, and operating time, and may lead to little or no difference in limb loss. The studies were at low to unclear risk of bias for most risk of bias domains. The certainty of evidence of main outcomes was moderate due to imprecision of results, moderate heterogeneity, or possible publication bias."
