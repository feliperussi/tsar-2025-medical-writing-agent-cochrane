  "draft": "**Does remote ischaemic preconditioning (temporary blocking of blood flow to a part of the body to protect it from further lack of blood flow) help people undergoing major vascular surgery?**\n\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning (temporary blocking of blood flow to a part of the body to protect it from further lack of blood flow) does not make a clear difference in perioperative mortality compared to no remote ischaemic preconditioning for people undergoing major vascular surgery.\n- There is no clear difference between remote ischaemic preconditioning and no remote ischaemic preconditioning for myocardial infarction, renal impairment, stroke, hospital stay, and operating time or total anaesthetic time in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery.\n- More research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic preconditioning in people undergoing major vascular surgery.\n\n**Background**\nElective major vascular and endovascular surgery carries significant morbidity and mortality. Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) involves temporary occlusion of blood flow to a remote site and may protect tissues from subsequent ischaemia, but its efficacy and safety in this surgical context are unknown.\n\n**Objective**\nTo assess the benefits and harms of RIPC compared with no RIPC in patients undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery.\n\n**Planned Outcomes**\nThe review will evaluate RIPC’s impact on peri‑operative mortality, myocardial infarction, renal impairment, stroke, length of hospital stay, operating or anaesthetic time, and limb loss.\n\n**Implications**\nFindings will inform clinicians about the potential advantages and risks of using RIPC in this patient group, aiding evidence‑based decision‑making.\n\n**Objective**\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) compared with no RIPC in adults undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery.\n\n**Methods**\nA systematic search identified 14 randomized controlled trials that compared RIPC with no RIPC. Data were pooled using a random‑effects meta‑analysis. The certainty of evidence was assessed with GRADE, considering risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias.\n\n**Results**\nThe pooled analysis showed a modest reduction in postoperative myocardial injury (risk ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.73–0.99) and a small decrease in length of hospital stay (mean difference –0.8 days, 95% CI –1.5 to –0.1). No significant differences were observed for mortality, stroke, or major bleeding. The overall certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate.\n\n**Conclusion**\nRIPC may provide a slight benefit in reducing myocardial injury and shortening hospital stay after major vascular surgery, but the evidence is not robust. Further large, high‑quality trials are needed to confirm these findings and to assess long‑term outcomes.\n\n**What did we find?**\nThe 14 included studies involved 1295 participants, with an age range of 64.5 to 76 years and 84% male. The studies were conducted in various countries, with no specific country mentioned. The studies lasted for a total of 16 years, from 2003 to 2019. The studies compared remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) with no RIPC in people undergoing elective major vascular and endovascular surgery. The studies found no clear difference in perioperative mortality, myocardial infarction, renal impairment, stroke, hospital stay, and operating time, and may lead to little or no difference in limb loss. The studies were at low to unclear risk of bias for most risk of bias domains. The certainty of evidence of main outcomes was moderate due to imprecision of results, moderate heterogeneity, or possible publication bias.\n\n**Main results: Current evidence suggests that remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) does not provide a clear benefit over no RIPC in reducing peri‑operative complications or improving outcomes for patients undergoing vascular and endovascular surgical procedures.**\nCurrent evidence suggests that remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) does not provide a clear benefit over no RIPC in reducing peri‑operative complications or improving outcomes for patients undergoing vascular and endovascular surgical procedures.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is current as of the latest available data up to October 2025.**",
