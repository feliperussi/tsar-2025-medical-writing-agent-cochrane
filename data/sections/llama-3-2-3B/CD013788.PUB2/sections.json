  "key_messages": [
    "Is early removal of urinary catheter after kidney transplantation better than late removal in terms of urinary tract infections and complications? There is insufficient evidence to suggest any difference between early and late catheter removal post-transplant, and the studies investigating this were generally of poor quality. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to answer this question. Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of early removal of urinary catheter after kidney transplantation are unclear.",
    "Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: the impact of catheter removal timing on the incidence of urinary tract infections and postoperative complications in patients following a kidney transplant.",
    "A high-quality, well-designed RCT is required to compare the effectiveness of early catheter removal versus late catheter removal in patients following a kidney transplant."

      "subheading": "What is the health problem?",
      "content": "Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease. However, urinary catheters can pose an infection risk to patients, potentially resulting in a urinary tract infection (UTI). The longer the catheter remains in place, the greater the risk of developing a UTI. There is no consensus approach to the time a catheter should remain in place post-transplant, and the different timings of catheter removal are thought to be associated with different incidences of UTI and postoperative complications."

      "content": "This review aimed to compare patients who had their catheter removed within 5 days post-transplant surgery to those patients who had their catheter removed 5 days or later following their kidney transplant. The primary outcome measures between the two groups included the incidence of symptomatic UTIs, the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and the incidence of major urological complications requiring intervention and treatment."

      "content": "Pooled risk ratio (RR) for any UTI was 0.68 (95 % CI 0.45–1.03; I² = 12 %). Early removal showed a non‑significant trend toward fewer infections. No significant differences were observed for graft function (mean difference in creatinine at 3 months = ‑0.02 mg/dL; 95 % CI ‑0.08 to 0.04) or catheter‑related complications (RR = 0.91; 95 % CI 0.55–1.51)."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We included 2 studies that involved 197 participants. The studies were conducted in the kidney transplant setting. The studies compared early versus late removal of urinary catheter. The outcomes of interest were incidence of symptomatic UTIs, incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, incidence of major urological complications requiring intervention and treatment. The review found that early versus late removal of the urinary catheter made no difference to the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients following a kidney transplant."
