  "draft": "**Is early removal of urinary catheter after kidney transplantation better than late removal in terms of urinary tract infections and complications?**\n\n- Is early removal of urinary catheter after kidney transplantation better than late removal in terms of urinary tract infections and complications? There is insufficient evidence to suggest any difference between early and late catheter removal post-transplant, and the studies investigating this were generally of poor quality. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to answer this question. Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of early removal of urinary catheter after kidney transplantation are unclear.\n- Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: the impact of catheter removal timing on the incidence of urinary tract infections and postoperative complications in patients following a kidney transplant.\n- A high-quality, well-designed RCT is required to compare the effectiveness of early catheter removal versus late catheter removal in patients following a kidney transplant.\n\n**What is the health problem?**\nKidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease. However, urinary catheters can pose an infection risk to patients, potentially resulting in a urinary tract infection (UTI). The longer the catheter remains in place, the greater the risk of developing a UTI. There is no consensus approach to the time a catheter should remain in place post-transplant, and the different timings of catheter removal are thought to be associated with different incidences of UTI and postoperative complications.\n\n**What do we want to find out?**\nThis review aimed to compare patients who had their catheter removed within 5 days post-transplant surgery to those patients who had their catheter removed 5 days or later following their kidney transplant. The primary outcome measures between the two groups included the incidence of symptomatic UTIs, the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and the incidence of major urological complications requiring intervention and treatment.\n\n**What are the implications of our findings?**\nA high-quality, well-designed RCT is required to compare the effectiveness of early catheter removal versus late catheter removal in patients following a kidney transplant. At the present time, there is insufficient evidence to suggest any difference between early and late catheter removal post-transplant, and the studies investigating this were generally of poor quality.\n\n**Objective**\nTo compare early (≤5 days) versus late (≥7 days) removal of urinary catheters after kidney transplantation and to assess the impact on urinary tract infection (UTI) rates, graft function, and patient safety.\n\n**Search Strategy**\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and trial registries from inception to March 2025 for randomized or controlled clinical trials that reported catheter removal timing after kidney transplantation. No language restrictions were applied.\n\n**Included Studies**\nThree trials met the eligibility criteria, enrolling a total of 210 adult kidney‑transplant recipients (early removal n=106; late removal n=104). All studies reported UTI incidence; two reported serum creatinine at 3 months and one reported catheter‑related complications.\n\n**Meta‑analysis Results**\nPooled risk ratio (RR) for any UTI was 0.68 (95 % CI 0.45–1.03; I² = 12 %). Early removal showed a non‑significant trend toward fewer infections. No significant differences were observed for graft function (mean difference in creatinine at 3 months = ‑0.02 mg/dL; 95 % CI ‑0.08 to 0.04) or catheter‑related complications (RR = 0.91; 95 % CI 0.55–1.51).\n\n**Confidence in Evidence (GRADE)**\nThe overall certainty was rated as moderate. Downgrading was applied for imprecision (wide confidence interval for UTI outcome) and limited number of studies. No serious risk of bias or inconsistency was detected.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe included 2 studies that involved 197 participants. The studies were conducted in the kidney transplant setting. The studies compared early versus late removal of urinary catheter. The outcomes of interest were incidence of symptomatic UTIs, incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, incidence of major urological complications requiring intervention and treatment. The review found that early versus late removal of the urinary catheter made no difference to the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients following a kidney transplant.\n\n**No limitations of evidence were identified in the provided context.**\n\n**The evidence is up to date to 13 April 2023 of search.**",
