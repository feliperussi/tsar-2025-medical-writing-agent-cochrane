  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of physical exercise in people with non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency are unclear.",
    "There is currently insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of physical exercise in people with chronic venous disease.",
    "Future research into the effect of physical exercise should consider types of exercise protocols (intensity, frequency, and time), sample size, blinding, and homogeneity according to the severity of disease."

      "content": "Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition related to chronic venous disease that may progress to venous leg ulceration and impair quality of life of those affected. Treatments such as physical exercise may be useful to reduce CVI symptoms."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review included 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 146 participants, all investigating physical exercise programmes versus no structured exercise in people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). The trials were conducted in unspecified countries and settings, lasted six months, and did not report participant ages, disease severity, or funding sources. No data were available on outcomes such as incidence of venous leg ulcers, surgical interventions, quality of life, ankle joint mobility, plantar flexion, muscle strength, exercise capacity, venous refilling time, ejection fraction, venous clinical severity score, disease sign intensity, or health‑related quality of life."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Physical exercise probably makes little to no difference to disease signs and symptoms, ejection fraction, venous refilling time, health‑related quality of life, exercise capacity, ankle mobility, and may make little to no difference to muscle strength and plantar flexion in the short term.",
      "content": "Very low‑certainty evidence suggests physical exercise probably makes little to no difference to disease signs and symptoms, ejection fraction, venous refilling time, health‑related quality of life, exercise capacity, ankle mobility, and may make little to no difference to muscle strength and plantar flexion in the short term. Review 2 (Intervention review) reported no studies provided data on the incidence of venous leg ulcers."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "Despite the breadth of data collected, the evidence is limited by its reliance on self‑reported measures, a relatively short follow‑up period, and a sample that may not be representative of the broader population, which together constrain the generalizability and causal inference of the findings.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to 28 March 2022 of search."
