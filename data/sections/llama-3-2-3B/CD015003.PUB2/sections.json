    "The review found that colchicine may reduce all-cause mortality compared to placebo in primary prevention, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.91; 6 studies, 463 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, the review could not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether colchicine has any other benefits or harms for primary prevention.",
    "The review found that colchicine may increase the incidence of diarrhoea compared to placebo, usual care, or no treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 3.99, 95% CI 1.44 to 11.06; 8 studies, 605 participants; very low-certainty evidence).",
    "Due to the very low certainty of the evidence and the limitations of the included studies, it is unclear whether colchicine is effective for preventing cardiovascular events in the general population, and more robust clinical trials are needed to bridge this evidence gap effectively."

      "content": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ACVDs), a condition characterised by lipid accumulation in arterial walls, which is often exacerbated by chronic inflammation disorders, is the major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Colchicine, with its first medicinal use in ancient Egypt, is an inexpensive drug with anti‐inflammatory properties. However, its role in primary prevention of ACVDs in the general population remains unknown."

      "content": "Current evidence on colchicine for primary prevention of cardiovascular events is very uncertain. It may lower all‑cause mortality compared with placebo, but the data are inconclusive. There is little to no clear effect on non‑fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, and the certainty is low. Colchicine appears to increase the risk of diarrhea, though this also rests on uncertain evidence. When compared with methotrexate, colchicine shows little to no difference in mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Overall, the existing studies are limited, and robust trials are needed to determine whether colchicine is beneficial or harmful for primary cardiovascular prevention."
