Organisational interventions probably reduce the number of residents with at least one physical restraint (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.94; 3849 participants, 4 studies) and probably largely reduce the number of residents with at least one belt (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.73; 2711 participants, 3 studies). However, the quality of evidence for simple educational interventions and interventions providing information about residents' fall risk is low or very low.\n- Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: simple educational interventions and interventions providing information about residents' fall risk; and unwanted effects and costs of these interventions in long-term care institutions.\n\n**What is the problem with physical restraints in long-term care settings?**\n\nPhysical restraints, such as bedrails and belts in chairs or beds, are commonly used for older people receiving long-term care. However, despite clear evidence for the lack of effectiveness and safety, and widespread recommendations that their use should be avoided, physical restraints are still widely used. This can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including increased risk of falls, injuries, and even death.\n\n**What do we want to find out about interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints?**\n\nWe wanted to evaluate the effects of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who require long-term care (either at home or in residential care facilities). Specifically, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of different types of interventions, including organisational interventions and simple educational interventions, in reducing the use of physical restraints and improving the quality of care for older people in long-term care settings.\n\n**Search Strategy**\n\nWe systematically searched multiple databases for studies that evaluated interventions designed to prevent or reduce the use of physical restraints in older adults receiving long‑term care.\n\n**Combined Results**\n\nA meta‑analysis of 11 eligible studies was conducted, summarising the impact of various interventions on restraint prevalence, resident safety, and related outcomes.\n\n**Confidence in Evidence**\n\nThe overall confidence in the pooled evidence was appraised using the GRADE framework, yielding a moderate confidence rating due to heterogeneity among studies and some methodological limitations.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe included 11 studies with 19,003 participants in this review update. All studies were conducted in long‑term residential care facilities. Ten studies were RCTs and one study a CCT. All studies included people with dementia. The mean age of the participants was approximately 85 years. Four studies investigated organisational interventions aiming to implement a least‑restraint policy; six studies investigated simple educational interventions; and one study tested an intervention that provided staff with information about residents’ fall risk. The control groups received usual care only in most studies although, in two studies, additional information materials about physical restraint reduction were provided. We judged the risk of selection bias to be high or unclear in eight studies. Risk of reporting bias was high in one study and unclear in eight studies. Organisational interventions intended to promote a least‑restraint policy included a variety of components, such as education of staff, training of “campions” of low‑restraint practice, and components which aimed to facilitate a change in institutional policies and culture of care.\n\n**Main results**\n\nOrganisational interventions that aim to implement a least‑restraint policy probably reduce the number of residents with at least one physical restraint and largely reduce the number with a belt. Simple educational interventions have uncertain effects and may have little or no impact on restraint use, falls, or psychotropic medication prescribing. Providing information about residents' fall risk shows low‑certainty evidence of little or no difference in restraint use. Implications: adopt organisational least‑restraint policies; simple education alone is unlikely to be effective; information about fall risk alone is unlikely to change restraint use.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.**",
