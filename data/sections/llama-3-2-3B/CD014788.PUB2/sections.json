  "plain_title": "Is GnRH analogues (gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues) effective and safe for treating endometriosis pain and bone mineral density in women?",
  "key_messages": [
    "GnRH analogues may be slightly effective in reducing overall pain in women with endometriosis, but the evidence is very low to low quality due to serious risk of bias and imprecision. There may be a slight decrease in bone mineral density when women are treated with GnRHas, compared to gestrinone. However, the review found no studies that compared GnRHas to other treatments, and the evidence for the benefits and harms of GnRHas is limited.",
    "Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision‑makers, such as the effects of GnRHas on bone mineral density and the potential harms of long‑term treatment.",
    "Due to the limited and low‑quality evidence, the results of this review should be interpreted with caution."
