    "Psychological interventions in adults are likely to improve the quality of life, depression and anxiety slightly. Psychotherapy is probably also effective for improving the quality of life in children and adolescents. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may have little to no effect on disease activity.",
    "Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: psychotherapy and patient education may have small positive short-term effects on quality of life, depression and anxiety in adults, but the evidence for children and adolescents is very low-certainty.",
    "The interpretation of these results presents a challenge due to the clinical heterogeneity of the included trials, particularly concerning the type and various components of the common multimodular interventions."

      "content": "Persons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of suffering from psychological problems. The association is assumed to be bi‚Äêdirectional. Psychological treatment is expected to improve quality of life (QoL), psychological issues and, possibly, disease activity. Many trials have tested various psychotherapy approaches, often in combination with educational modules or relaxation techniques, with inconsistent results. Psychological interventions for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease aim to address the psychological problems experienced by individuals with IBD, with the goal of improving their quality of life and managing disease activity."
