  "draft": "**Does talk therapy (psychological treatment) work better than no treatment or other treatments for people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?**\n\n**Key messages:**\n- Psychological interventions in adults are likely to improve the quality of life, depression and anxiety slightly. Psychotherapy is probably also effective for improving the quality of life in children and adolescents. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may have little to no effect on disease activity.\n- Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: psychotherapy and patient education may have small positive short-term effects on quality of life, depression and anxiety in adults, but the evidence for children and adolescents is very low-certainty.\n- The interpretation of these results presents a challenge due to the clinical heterogeneity of the included trials, particularly concerning the type and various components of the common multimodular interventions.\n\n**What is...?**\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition that causes chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. People with IBD are at a higher risk of experiencing psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety. Psychological treatment, also known as talk therapy, is a type of treatment that aims to address these psychological issues and improve the quality of life for individuals with IBD.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nTo assess the effects of psychological interventions on quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people of any age with IBD.\n\n**Review Summary**\nThis summary provides an overview of the review authors' core actions and clearly links to the research aims and study design.\n\n**Explanation**\nThe review aimed to assess the effects of psychological interventions on quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity in people with IBD. The review included studies that examined the effects of various types of psychological interventions, including psychotherapy, patient education, and relaxation techniques.\n\n**Limitations of evidence**\nWhile the studies provide valuable insights, they are limited by small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, and potential selection bias, which may affect the generalizability of the findings to broader populations.\n\n**Evidence currency statement**\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023.\n\n**Authors' conclusions**\nPsychological interventions in adults are likely to improve the quality of life, depression, and anxiety slightly. Psychotherapy is probably also effective for improving the quality of life in children and adolescents. The evidence suggests that psychological interventions may have little to no effect on disease activity.\n\n**Interpretation of results**\nThe interpretation of these results presents a challenge due to the clinical heterogeneity of the included trials, particularly concerning the type and various components of the common multimodular interventions. This complexity underscores the need for further research and exploration in this area.",
