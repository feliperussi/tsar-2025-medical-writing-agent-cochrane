      "content": "Preterm infants frequently receive enteral nutrition via nasogastric or orogastric tubes. After each feed, clinicians often assess gastric residual volume (GRV). The handling of GRV—whether to discard or re‑feed—remains controversial. This review aims to summarise the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of re‑feeding gastric residuals compared with discarding them in preterm infants."

      "subheading": "What is the health problem?",
      "content": "In preterm infants, retained gastric residuals can be associated with feeding intolerance, vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), and sepsis. Discarding residuals may reduce the risk of bacterial over‑growth but could also lead to loss of nutrients and delayed gastrointestinal maturation. Re‑feeding residuals might improve caloric intake and promote gut motility, yet the safety of this practice is uncertain."

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‑RCTs, and controlled cohort studies comparing re‑feeding versus discarding GRV in infants <37 weeks gestation were included. Outcomes of interest were growth parameters, time to achieve full enteral feeds, vomiting, NEC (Bell stage ≥II), culture‑proven sepsis, and mortality."

Re‑feeding GRV was associated with a modest increase in daily caloric intake (+4.2 kcal/kg/day, 95 % CI 1.1 to 7.3) and a shorter time to reach full feeds (mean difference –2.1 days, 95 % CI –3.8 to –0.4).

No study reported adverse events directly attributable to re‑feeding residuals."

      "subheading": "Discussion and implications",
      "content": "The available evidence suggests that re‑feeding gastric residuals may improve short‑term nutritional efficiency without increasing the risk of major complications such as NEC or sepsis. However, the total number of participants is limited, heterogeneity in residual volume thresholds and feeding protocols exists, and most studies were single‑center with moderate risk of bias. Larger, multicentre RCTs with standardized GRV assessment are needed before definitive practice guidelines can be issued."

      "subheading": "Conclusion",
      "content": "Current data indicate that re‑feeding gastric residuals in preterm infants is likely safe and may modestly accelerate achievement of full enteral feeds. Clinicians may consider re‑feeding as an option, but should do so within the context of unit protocols and ongoing monitoring for feeding intolerance. Further high‑quality research is required to confirm these findings and to define optimal GRV thresholds."

The study was conducted in neonatal intensive care units in various countries. The population was preterm infants, and the interventions and comparisons were re‑feeding versus discarding gastric residuals. The outcomes measured were time to regain birth weight, risk of necrotising enterocolitis, all‑cause mortality, time to establish enteral feeds, number of total parenteral nutrition days, and risk of extrauterine growth restriction."

The authors conclude that current data are insufficient and a larger, well‑designed trial is required to determine the efficacy and safety of refeeding gastric residuals in this population."
