    "We are unsure if feeding healthy infants high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula has an effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity. There may be little or no difference in the risk of adverse effects between infants fed with high-protein formula versus those fed with standard-protein formula.",
    "Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: evaluating the impact of different types of protein intake on the risk of adverse effects in infants, and determining the optimal duration of high-protein formula feeding for healthy term infants."

      "content": "Many infants are fed infant formulas to promote growth. Some formulas have a high protein content (â‰¥ 2.5 g per 100 kcal) to accelerate weight gain during the first year of life. The risk-benefit balance of these formulas is unclear. Objectives are to evaluate the benefits and harms of higher protein intake versus lower protein intake in healthy, formula-fed term infants. Common treatments include feeding infants with high-protein formula or standard-protein formula. However, the effectiveness of these treatments is not well understood. The main concern is that high-protein formula may have little or no effect on undernutrition, overweight, or obesity in infants. Additionally, the risk of adverse effects such as diarrhea, vomiting, or milk hypersensitivity is unclear. The review aims to provide more information on the benefits and harms of higher protein intake versus lower protein intake in healthy, formula-fed term infants. The review will examine the effects of high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula and low-protein formula on underweight, stunting, wasting, overweight, obesity, and adverse events in the first year of life. The review will also investigate the effects of high-protein formula compared to standard-protein formula on underweight, stunting, wasting, overweight, obesity, and adverse events at five years of follow-up. The review will use a systematic review approach, including a comprehensive search of multiple databases, and will assess the quality of the included studies using the GRADE approach. The review will provide a clear summary of the benefits and harms of higher protein intake versus lower protein intake in healthy, formula-fed term infants, and will inform clinical practice and policy decisions regarding infant formula feeding."

      "content": "We found 11 studies involving 1185 participants, with the longest follow-up being 11 years. The studies were conducted in high-income countries and compared higher protein intake versus lower protein intake in formula-fed term infants. The outcomes of interest included underweight, stunting, wasting, overweight, obesity, and adverse events such as diarrhea, vomiting, or milk hypersensitivity."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because  and because It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. and because The studies were very small. Or The evidence is based on few cases of condition/type of event. Or There are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.",
