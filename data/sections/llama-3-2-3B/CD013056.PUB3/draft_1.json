  "draft": "**Topical antibiotics are usually more effective than antiseptics for chronic ear infections**\n\n- Topical antibiotics are usually more effective than antiseptics for chronic ear infections, but the evidence is limited and the quality of the studies is generally low. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to say whether topical antibiotics are better or worse than antiseptics for people with chronic ear infections. Harmful effects were not well reported. More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of using topical antibiotics versus antiseptics for treating chronic ear infections. Future studies should focus on comparing different types of topical antibiotics and antiseptics, as well as investigating the effects of these treatments on different age groups and populations with chronic ear infections.\n\n**What is chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)?**\n\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. It is characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss.\n\n**What are antibiotics and antiseptics used for?**\n\nAntibiotics and antiseptics kill or inhibit the micro‑organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be applied topically or administered systemically via the oral or injection route. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically).\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).\n\n**Methods**\n\n- Background: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a persistent ear infection that can lead to hearing loss. Treatment options include systemic or topical antibiotics and antseptic agents. Determining which approach provides greater benefit with fewer harms is essential for clinical decision‑making.\n- Methods: We searched major biomedical databases for randomized controlled trials that directly compared antibiotics (systemic or topical) with antseptic agents in people diagnosed with CSOM. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Meta‑analysis was performed using a random‑effects model, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated with the GRADE framework, considering study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\n- Results: Three trials (total n=312 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis showed no statistically significant difference in clinical cure rates between antibiotics and antiseptics (Risk Ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.89–1.31). Adverse events were rare in both groups, with a slightly higher incidence of mild local irritation in the antseptic arm (Risk Ratio 1.45, 95% CI 0.78–2.70). The overall certainty of the evidence was rated as low due to small sample sizes, risk of bias in allocation concealment, and heterogeneity in outcome definitions.\n- Conclusion: Current low‑certainty evidence does not demonstrate a clear advantage of antibiotics over antseptic agents for treating CSOM. Clinicians may consider antiseptics as a reasonable alternative, especially when aiming to reduce systemic antibiotic exposure. Further large, well‑designed trials are needed to clarify comparative effectiveness and safety.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nAcetic acid may slightly increase the chance of ear discharge drying up compared with aminoglycoside within 1–2 weeks, but the evidence is very uncertain, and it is also very uncertain whether it causes more discomfort. Topical quinolones likely slightly increase the chance of discharge drying up and may slightly reduce discomfort compared with boric acid (moderate certainty). Evidence for quinolones versus povidone‑iodine is very uncertain, with no clear effect on discharge, hearing or ototoxicity (very low certainty). There is limited information comparing topical antibiotics with aluminium acetate (very low certainty).\n\n**Main results: Ear discharge**\n\nTopical quinolones likely slightly increase the chance of discharge drying up and may slightly reduce discomfort compared with boric acid (moderate certainty).\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe evidence is limited by a small sample size, short follow-up period, and reliance on self-reported outcomes, which may introduce bias and reduce the generalizability of the findings.\n\n**The evidence is up to date to 15 June 2022.**",
