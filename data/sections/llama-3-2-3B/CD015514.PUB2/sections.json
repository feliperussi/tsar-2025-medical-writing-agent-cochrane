    "Face-down positioning after eye surgery may lower retinal displacement, but its overall advantage over other positions varies by procedure. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to say whether face-down positioning reduces the risk of retinal displacement following pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving retinal detachments. Immediate face-down positioning may result in a lower proportion of participants with postoperative retinal displacement compared with support-the-break positioning at six months, but the quality of the evidence is very low. Immediate face-down positioning appears to have little to no effect on postoperative distortion scores and quality of life assessment scores. Immediate face-down positioning may reduce the ocular adverse event of postoperative outer retinal folds and binocular diplopia, but may increase the chance of postoperative raised intraocular pressure compared with support-the-break positioning at six months. Future trials should be rigorously designed to provide evidence of high certainty, and should examine quality of life and patient preferences in addition to clinical and adverse event outcomes."

      "content": "A macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is one of the most common ophthalmic surgical emergencies and causes significant visual morbidity. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with gas tamponade is often performed to repair primary macula-involving RRDs with a high rate of anatomical retinal reattachment. It has been advocated by some ophthalmologists that face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade helps reduce postoperative retinal displacement. Retinal displacement can cause metamorphopsia and binocular diplopia. Face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade has been suggested as a potential method to reduce postoperative retinal displacement, but the evidence is unclear. The primary objective of this review is to determine whether face-down positioning reduces the risk of retinal displacement following PPV and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving RRDs."

      "content": "Immediate face‑down positioning after pars plana vitrectomy may reduce the risk of postoperative retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia at six months compared with a support‑the‑break position, but it may increase the risk of elevated intraocular pressure. There is no evidence that face‑down positioning influences visual acuity at three months, distortion scores at week 26, or quality of life at week 26. All of these conclusions are based on very low‑certainty evidence, so further research is needed to confirm them."
