  "draft": "**Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT) for Urinary Incontinence in Women**\n\nPelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is a recommended treatment for female stress, urgency, and mixed urinary incontinence. Training varies in exercise type (pelvic floor muscles contracting with and without other muscles), dose, and delivery (e.g. amount and type of supervision). Despite its recommendation, many women with urinary incontinence do not receive PFMT. This may be due to lack of awareness, limited access to healthcare services, or concerns about the effectiveness of PFMT. As a result, many women continue to experience symptoms of urinary incontinence, which can have a significant impact on their quality of life.\n\nWe wanted to assess the effects of alternative approaches (exercise type, dose, and delivery) to PFMT in the management of urinary incontinence (stress, urgency, and mixed) in women. We aimed to determine which approaches to PFMT are most effective in improving symptoms of urinary incontinence and whether there are any differences in outcomes between different types of PFMT.\n\nThis review update included 63 trials with 4920 women. The studies were conducted in countries around the world, mostly in middle– or high–income settings. The participants were mid–age (45 to 65 years) parous women with stress or stress–predominant mixed urinary incontinence. The trials were categorized as comparisons of exercise type, dose, and delivery. The primary outcome was incontinence quality of life data.\n\nDirect PFMT may slightly improve quality of life compared with indirect training. PFMT with resistance devices may slightly improve incontinence quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain. Clinic-supervised PFMT may slightly improve incontinence quality of life, also with very uncertain evidence. Individually supervised PFMT probably makes little to no difference in quality of life. E-health delivery of PFMT may slightly improve quality of life.\n\nThe evidence is limited because the agent reached the maximum iteration limit before fully exploring all possible reasoning paths. This means that some relevant information may not have been considered, the analysis may be incomplete, and conclusions are based on a partial view of the problem space. The evidence is up to date to September 27, 2023.\n\nPelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is effective for most women with urinary incontinence. Direct PFMT may result in a small improvement in incontinence quality of life compared to indirect training. In terms of improved quality of life, PFMT can be supervised individually or in a group because it probably makes little to no difference. Many comparisons had low– or very low–certainty evidence, often because there was only one trial or several small trials with methodological limitations. More, better-designed and reported trials, directly comparing PFMT approaches are needed, especially trials investigating exercise dose.",

The readability metrics are repeated excessively, some statements are contradictory (e.g., the Flesch reading ease score is described as \"above the typical range\" when a score of 34.97 actually indicates very difficult text), and the analysis does not clearly explain why the draft fails to meet plain‑language standards. Additionally, the feedback mixes technical jargon with unclear explanations, and the overall structure is hard to follow. To be approved, the evaluation should be concise, avoid redundant repetitions, correctly interpret readability scores, and provide clear, actionable recommendations.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets structural requirements (title, key messages, background, methods, results, limitations, currency) and uses question‑style headings. However, it scores poorly on readability: high passive voice, many complex words, long sentences, and elevated readability indices (Flesch 34.97, SMOG 13.7, Gunning Fog 17.21, etc.). The evaluation repeatedly lists the same metrics, which reduces clarity. Suggested improvements include simplifying language, reducing passive constructions, defining technical terms (e.g., \"parous\"), and clarifying statements about income settings and evidence limitations. Overall, the draft needs significant revision to achieve a plain‑language level suitable for a general audience."
