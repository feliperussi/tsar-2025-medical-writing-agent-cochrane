    "Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is effective for most women with urinary incontinence, with direct PFMT (sets of repeated, isolated, voluntary pelvic floor muscle contractions) slightly improving incontinence quality of life compared to indirect training.",
    "The type of PFMT, dose, and delivery method may make a difference, with some approaches showing little or no difference in quality of life.",
    "More, better-designed and reported trials are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of different PFMT approaches.",
    "Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as exercise dose and delivery method."

      "subheading": "What is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is a recommended treatment for female stress, urgency, and mixed urinary incontinence. Training varies in exercise type (pelvic floor muscles contracting with and without other muscles), dose, and delivery (e.g. amount and type of supervision). Despite its recommendation, many women with urinary incontinence do not receive PFMT. This may be due to lack of awareness, limited access to healthcare services, or concerns about the effectiveness of PFMT. As a result, many women continue to experience symptoms of urinary incontinence, which can have a significant impact on their quality of life."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of alternative approaches (exercise type, dose, and delivery) to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) in the management of urinary incontinence (stress, urgency, and mixed) in women. They aimed to determine which approaches to PFMT are most effective in improving symptoms of urinary incontinence and whether there are any differences in outcomes between different types of PFMT."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "This review update included 63 trials with 4920 women. The studies were conducted in countries around the world, mostly in middle– or high–output settings. The participants were mid–age (45 to 65 years) parous women with stress or stress–predominant mixed urinary incontinence. The trials were categorized as comparisons of exercise type, dose, and delivery. The primary outcome was incontinence quality of life data. The studies had varying levels of certainty, with some having low–certainty evidence and others having very low–certainty evidence. The review found that some approaches to PFMT were better than others, but for some there was little or no difference. The 7th International Consultation on Incontinence recommends PFMT as first–line therapy for women with urinary incontinence."

      "content": "Think8: Direct pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) may slightly improve quality of life compared with indirect training. PFMT with resistance devices may slightly improve incontinence quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain. Clinic‑supervised PFMT may slightly improve incontinence quality of life, also with very uncertain evidence. Individually supervised PFMT probably makes little to no difference in quality of life. E‑health delivery of PFMT may slightly improve quality of life."
