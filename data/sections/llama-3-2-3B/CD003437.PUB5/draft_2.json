  "draft": "The current evidence on treatments for post‑stroke depression is limited. Most findings are based on very low‑certainty data, with wide confidence intervals and substantial heterogeneity across studies. Few trials examined long‑term outcomes, and many lacked rigorous blinding or adequate control groups. Consequently, the apparent benefits of pharmacological, brain‑stimulation, and combined therapies remain uncertain, and further high‑quality, adequately powered randomized trials are needed before firm recommendations can be made.",
