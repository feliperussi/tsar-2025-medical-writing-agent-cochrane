  "draft": "Here is the revised Plain Language Summary:\n\n**Do medication, therapy, and brain stimulation work better for depression?**\n\nDepression is a common problem after a stroke that can affect a person's mood, motivation, and ability to recover from the physical effects of the stroke. It can also increase the risk of further health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes. Common treatments for depression include medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes, but these may not always be effective for everyone.\n\nThis review aims to evaluate the benefits and harms of different treatments for depression after stroke, including pharmacological interventions, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combinations of these treatments.\n\n**Key messages:**\n\n- Pharmacological interventions, non-invasive brain stimulation, and psychological therapy can reduce the prevalence of depression, but the quality of the evidence is very low.\n- Pharmacological intervention was associated with adverse events related to the CNS and the gastrointestinal tract.\n- Non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on the prevalence of depression.\n- More research is required before recommendations can be made about the routine use of these treatments for depression after stroke.\n\n**What is depression after stroke?**\n\nDepression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that impacts on recovery, yet is often undetected or inadequately treated. After a stroke, some people may experience depression, which can affect their mood, motivation, and ability to recover from the physical effects of the stroke. Depression can also increase the risk of further health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nThis review aims to evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these to treat depression after stroke.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nThe included studies were 65 in total, involving 5831 participants. The studies lasted for varying durations, with no specific information provided in the abstract. The funding sources of the studies were not mentioned in the abstract. The population characteristics of the studies were not specified, but the studies were conducted in various countries. The interventions and comparisons included pharmacological interventions, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combinations of these. No studies were found for comparisons 7 to 9. The studies were conducted in various settings, including hospitals and clinics. The authors concluded that more research is required to make recommendations about the routine use of these treatments for depression after stroke.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n- The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.\n\n**Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as:**\n\n- Pharmacological interventions, non-invasive brain stimulation, and psychological therapy that can be used together or separately to treat depression after stroke.\n- More research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of these treatments for people with depression after stroke, including studies with longer-term effects and those that compare different types of interventions directly against each other.",

Structural issues such as missing paragraph breaks and inconsistent bullet points further reduce clarity. Significant revisions are needed to meet the required format, readability, and style standards.",
