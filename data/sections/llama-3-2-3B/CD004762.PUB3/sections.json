    "The main question the review aims to answer is whether drug treatment can stop myotonia in people with myotonic disorders. The review found that mexiletine and lamotrigine may reduce myotonia, but the evidence is of low to moderate certainty. There may be no difference in quality of life between these treatments and placebo. Other medications were either ineffective or had uncertain evidence. The review concludes that more recent trials are more robust, and well‑conducted RCTs demonstrate moderate‑certainty evidence for the efficacy of symptomatic treatments in non‑dystrophic myotonias.",
    "Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision‑makers, such as: drugs that redistribute pressure under the body; and unwanted effects and costs.",
    "Larger, well‑designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of the different ways of delivering medicines directly to the eye during cataract surgery.",
    "The studies in this review suggest that rapid tests can detect the most common cause of bacterial infections (Strep A) in children with sore throats, leading to early and appropriate treatment with antibiotics. The number of children receiving unnecessary antibiotics following a rapid test is still likely to be lower than the number of children who would receive unnecessary antibiotics if the test is not used.",
    "After six months of treatment, medicines called ‘biologics’ seem to work best to clear patches of psoriasis on the skin. Longer studies are needed to assess the benefits and potential harms of longer treatment with medicines that are injected or taken by mouth to treat psoriasis.",
    "Treating COVID‑19 with tocilizumab (a medicine that blocks interleukin‑6) reduces the numbers of people who die within 28 days of treatment, and probably results in fewer serious unwanted effects than placebo treatment. Studies of other medicines that block interleukin‑6 to treat COVID‑19 are under way."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 17 studies that involved 392 people with myotonia. The biggest study was in 219 people and the smallest study was in 9 people. The studies were conducted in countries around the world; most were done in the USA and the UK. Pharmaceutical companies funded some of the studies. Most studies lasted for around 12 weeks; only 2 studies lasted for 24 weeks or more. People with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and non-dystrophic myotonia took part in the studies. The studies compared different drug treatments, including mexiletine and lamotrigine, with placebo. There was no study on other medications or on people with other conditions. The studies were carried out between 2005 and 2023. The included studies were double-blind or single-blind, and the participants were assessed for risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE framework. The studies reported on various outcomes, including participant-reported improvement in clinical myotonia, relaxation time, electromyographic relaxation time, adverse events, and quality of life. The results suggested that mexiletine and lamotrigine may be effective in reducing myotonia, but the evidence was of varying quality and certainty. The studies also reported on the adverse events associated with the drug treatments, including gastrointestinal symptoms, lethargy, and headache. Overall, the review found that more recent trials were more robust, and well-conducted RCTs demonstrated moderate-certainty evidence for the efficacy of symptomatic treatments in non-dystrophic myotonias. However, the data also suggested that not all patients respond to therapy, and research into aetiology and treatment options for non-responders is needed. Other agents that have not been tested in RCTs, such as acetazolamide, flecainide, ranolazine, and lacosamide, will need to be considered when planning future clinical trials. The RCTs, in particular the small numbers of most trials, highlight the challenges in recruitment and design of robust trials in rare diseases, and research into trial design to improve recruitment in rare diseases will be important for future trials."
