    "Adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) may not improve clinical outcomes for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases when compared to subgingival instrumentation (SI) alone, due to very low-certainty evidence. Any apparent differences between aPDT and SI alone were not judged to be clinically important. No studies reported pocket closure at six months, participant satisfaction or quality of life.",
    "Future research is needed to assess the effects of aPDT in people with peri-implantitis and to increase the certainty of the evidence by including large, well-conducted RCTs that are appropriately analysed to account for change in outcome over time or within-participant split-mouth study designs.",
    "More studies are needed to determine whether adjunctive aPDT leads to improved clinical outcomes during the active or supportive treatment of periodontitis, and to explore the effects of aPDT in people with peri-implant mucositis."

      "content": "Periodontitis and peri-implant diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions occurring in the mouth. Left untreated, periodontitis progressively destroys the tooth-supporting apparatus. Peri-implant diseases occur in tissues around dental implants and are characterised by inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa and subsequent progressive loss of supporting bone. Treatment aims to clean the pockets around teeth or dental implants and prevent damage to surrounding soft tissue and bone, including improvement of oral hygiene, risk factor control (e.g. encouraging cessation of smoking) and surgical interventions. The key aspect of standard non-surgical treatment is the removal of the subgingival biofilm using subgingival instrumentation (SI) (also called scaling and root planing). Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) can be used an adjunctive treatment to SI. It uses light energy to kill micro-organisms that have been treated with a light-absorbing photosensitising agent immediately prior to aPDT. What are periodontitis and peri-implant diseases? Why are they a problem? What are the common treatments for these conditions?"

      "content": "The researchers wanted to assess the effects of SI with adjunctive aPDT versus SI alone or with placebo aPDT for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases in adults. They wanted to know if adjunctive aPDT leads to improved clinical outcomes during the active or supportive treatment of periodontitis; moreover, results suggest that any improvements may be too small to be clinically important. The researchers also wanted to find out if adjunctive aPDT can cause any unwanted effects."

For every 100 people with periodontitis, aPDT probably reduces the risk of infection and dry socket after tooth extraction by 0-1%."
