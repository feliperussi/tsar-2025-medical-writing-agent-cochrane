  "draft": "- Adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) may not improve clinical outcomes for periodontitis and peri-implant diseases when compared to subgingival instrumentation (SI) alone, due to very low‑certainty evidence. Any apparent differences between aPDT and SI alone were not judged to be clinically important. No studies reported pocket closure at six months, participant satisfaction or quality of life.\n- Future research is needed to assess the effects of aPDT in people with peri‑implantitis and to increase the certainty of the evidence by including large, well‑conducted RCTs that are appropriately analysed to account for change in outcome over time or within‑participant split‑mouth study designs.\n- More studies are needed to determine whether adjunctive aPDT leads to improved clinical outcomes during the active or supportive treatment of periodontitis, and to explore the effects of aPDT in people with peri‑implant mucositis.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical checks due to several significant clarity issues: (1) unexplained jargon such as \"aPDT\" is used without definition, (2) overly long and convoluted sentences hinder comprehension, and (3) missing context for study designs and research aims leaves readers confused. These issues exceed the allowed threshold for approval. The text also contains numerous passive constructions and wordy phrases, contributing to poor readability (e.g., 7 passive voice instances, SMOG index 8.74, Flesch‑Kincaid grade 16.2). Revision is needed to define technical terms, simplify sentences, provide clear context, use active voice, and improve paragraph structure.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft text deviates from typical PLS patterns in several areas, including passive voice, nominalization, nouns, smog index, complex words, long words, Coleman-Liau index, words per sentence, automated readability index, Flesch reading ease, Flesch-Kincaid grade, Gunning-Fog index, LIX, RIX, and Dale-Chall readability. These metrics suggest that the draft text could benefit from improvements in clarity, style, and structure."
