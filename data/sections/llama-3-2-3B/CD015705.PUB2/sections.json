    "The quality of evidence for benefits and risks of informal mobile device use is moderate to high, but evidence on regulation and device type effects is lacking.",
    "More research is needed on long-term effects and strategies to support safe, effective informal mobile device use for all healthcare workers."

      "subheading": "Background",
      "content": "Healthcare workers often resort to using their personal mobile phones for work‑related tasks when official communication and information systems are lacking. While this informal practice can fill gaps in service delivery, it also raises concerns such as distractions, reduced productivity, data security risks, and increased organizational costs."

    {
      "subheading": "Aims",
      "content": "The review sought to explore the perspectives, experiences, and practices of healthcare workers, managers, and related professionals regarding informal, innovative uses of mobile devices at work. It aimed to identify both benefits and drawbacks of these practices and to assess their impact on patient care and health system performance."

    {
      "subheading": "Implications",
      "content": "Findings indicate that informal mobile device use can enhance patient outcomes and efficiency, yet it may also compromise safety, productivity, and cost‑effectiveness. Healthcare organisations and policymakers should develop strategies to support beneficial uses while establishing regulations that protect patient safety and maintain quality of care."

      "subheading": "Limitations",
      "content": "The review was limited to qualitative and mixed‑methods studies containing a qualitative component and focused solely on the views of healthcare workers, managers, and related professionals. Consequently, quantitative evidence and perspectives from other stakeholder groups were not captured."

    {
      "subheading": "Future Directions",
      "content": "Future research should examine how informal mobile device use influences patient outcomes and system performance, identify optimal approaches for supporting and regulating such practices, and explore mechanisms to ensure that patient safety and care quality are not compromised."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 30 studies, published between 2013 and 2022. The studies were from high-, middle-, and low-income countries and covered a range of healthcare settings and healthcare worker cadres. No information was available on the total number of people who took part in the studies. There was no information on how long the studies lasted. The authors did not report on the funding sources of the included studies. The studies included healthcare workers from various age groups, genders, and severity of condition. The studies were conducted in different countries, including high-, middle-, and low-income settings. The studies explored the informal uses of mobile phones and other mobile content. No information was available on the types of interventions and comparisons used in the studies.\n\nHealthcare workers use personal mobile phones to support work due to resource gaps (large effect, high certainty). They may feel pressure from colleagues/managers to use phones (moderate effect, moderate certainty). Phone use can humanize care but may reinforce hierarchies and inequities (small but important effect, moderate certainty). It can cause patient confidentiality issues (trivial effect, low certainty). Informal phone use can fill system gaps but also weaken it (trivial effect, low certainty)."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search."
