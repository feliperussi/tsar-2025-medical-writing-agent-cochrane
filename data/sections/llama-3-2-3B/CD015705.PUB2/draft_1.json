  "draft": "**Personal Mobile Devices Can Help Healthcare Workers, but Safety Depends on Proper Use and Policies**\n\n- Personal mobile devices can help healthcare workers, but safety depends on proper use and policies.\n- The quality of evidence for benefits and risks of informal mobile device use is moderate to high, but evidence on regulation and device type effects is lacking.\n- More research is needed on long-term effects and strategies to support safe, effective informal mobile device use for all healthcare workers.\n\n**Background**\nHealthcare workers often resort to using their personal mobile phones for work-related tasks when official communication and information systems are lacking. While this informal practice can fill gaps in service delivery, it also raises concerns such as distractions, reduced productivity, data security risks, and increased organizational costs.\n\n**Aims**\nThe review sought to explore the perspectives, experiences, and practices of healthcare workers, managers, and related professionals regarding informal, innovative uses of mobile devices at work. It aimed to identify both benefits and drawbacks of these practices and to assess their impact on patient care and health system performance.\n\n**Implications**\nFindings indicate that informal mobile device use can enhance patient outcomes and efficiency, yet it may also compromise safety, productivity, and cost-effectiveness. Healthcare organisations and policymakers should develop strategies to support beneficial uses while establishing regulations that protect patient safety and maintain quality of care.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe review was limited to qualitative and mixed-methods studies containing a qualitative component and focused solely on the views of healthcare workers, managers, and related professionals. Consequently, quantitative evidence and perspectives from other stakeholder groups were not captured.\n\n**Future Directions**\nFuture research should examine how informal mobile device use influences patient outcomes and system performance, identify optimal approaches for supporting and regulating such practices, and explore mechanisms to ensure that patient safety and care quality are not compromised.",
