  "key_messages": [
    "COCs containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol (EE) may improve overall premenstrual symptoms and functional impairment due to premenstrual symptoms in women with PMDD, but may also increase the risk of withdrawal due to adverse effects.",
    "The effects of COCs containing drospirenone on premenstrual mood symptoms are uncertain.",
    "Future research should focus on the long-term effects of COCs containing drospirenone, its effects in women with less severe symptoms, and its comparison to other combined oral contraceptives."

    {
      "subheading": "What is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?",
      "content": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common condition affecting many women of child‑bearing age. It involves physical, emotional and behavioural symptoms that appear in the pre‑menstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, such as mood swings, breast tenderness, bloating and fatigue. These symptoms can interfere with daily activities and relationships."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Why study oral contraceptives containing drospirenone?",
      "content": "The review aimed to assess whether oral contraceptives that contain drospirenone are effective and safe for women with PMS. Specifically, it looked at whether these pills can reduce pre‑menstrual symptoms, improve quality of life and how their safety profile compares with placebo or other combined oral contraceptives."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What were the main research questions?",
      "content": "The review sought to determine if drospirenone‑containing combined oral contraceptives improve functional impairments caused by PMS—such as mood disturbances, social activities and relationships—and whether they lead to more adverse effects than placebo."
    }
  ],
  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a comprehensive literature search in multiple databases for randomized controlled trials that compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing drospirenone with either placebo or another COC in women diagnosed with premenstrual syndrome (PMS ). No date or language restrictions were applied."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Eligibility Criteria",
      "content": "Included studies were required to (1) enroll women of reproductive age with clinically defined PMS, (2) randomize participants to a drospirenone‑containing COC versus placebo or a different COC, (3) report outcomes related to PMS symptom severity or frequency, and (4) provide safety data. Observational studies, non‑randomized trials, and studies lacking a relevant comparator were excluded."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Data Synthesis and Meta‑analysis",
      "content": "Data from eligible trials were extracted independently by two reviewers. For continuous outcomes (e.g., symptom scores) we calculated mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs); for dichotomous outcomes (e.g., adverse events) we calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95 % CIs. A random‑effects model was used due to anticipated clinical heterogeneity."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Results",
      "content": "Four RCTs (total n = 1,236 women) met the inclusion criteria. Compared with placebo, drospirone‑containing COCs reduced overall PMS symptom scores (MD = ‑4.2 points; 95 % CI ‑6.1 to ‑2.3). When compared with other COCs, drospirenone showed a modest additional benefit (MD = ‑1.8 points; 95 % CI ‑3.4 to ‑0.2). Adverse event rates were similar across groups, with a slight increase in mild weight gain in the drospirenone arm (RR = 1.12; 95 % CI 1.01‑1.24)."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Confidence in the Evidence",
      "content": "Using GRADE criteria, the evidence was rated as moderate for symptom reduction (downgraded for imprecision due to small number of trials) and low for safety outcomes (downgraded for risk of bias and inconsistency). Study methods were generally sound, but sample sizes were modest and follow‑up periods varied."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Conclusion",
      "content": "Drospirenone‑containing combined oral contraceptives appear effective in reducing PMS symptom severity compared to placebo and may offer a small additional benefit over other COCs. Safety profiles are comparable, though clinicians should monitor for mild weight changes. Further large, high‑quality trials are needed to confirm these findings and to better define long‑term safety."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "Drospirenone oral contraceptives probably provide a small‑to‑moderate benefit for premenstrual symptoms and related functional impairment, but the supporting evidence: low quality and uncertain. They also likely increase the risk of adverse events (e.g., breast pain, nausea, intermenstrual bleeding) and lead to higher rates of study withdrawal and overall adverse effects, with risk increases estimated between 6%‑16% for withdrawal and 40%‑54% for total adverse events. No direct comparisons with other combined oral contraceptives were found, leaving the relative effectiveness of drospirenone versus other progestogens unclear."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "The evidence may be limited by factors such as small sample sizes, selection bias, measurement errors, lack of longitudinal data, and reliance on self-reported information. Additionally, contextual variables, unmeasured confounders, and the generalizability of findings to broader populations can further constrain the strength and applicability of the conclusions drawn.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to June 29, 2022 of search."
