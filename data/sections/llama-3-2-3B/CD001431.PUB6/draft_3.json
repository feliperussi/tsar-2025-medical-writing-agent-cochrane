  "draft": "Do patient decision aids help adults make better choices when facing health treatment or screening decisions?\n\n**Key messages:**\n\n- Patient decision aids probably help adults reach informed values-congruent choices compared to usual care, leading to large increases in knowledge, accurate risk perceptions, and an active role in decision-making.\n- However, the review found no difference in decision regret between people using decision aids versus those receiving usual care.\n- The quality of evidence for the effects of patient decision aids on adherence and downstream effects is uncertain due to a lack of robust studies in this area.\n- Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as the impact of patient decision aids on adherence and downstream effects on cost and resource use.\n\n**What is the health problem?**\n\nPeople facing health treatment or screening decisions may use patient decision aids to support their choices. Patient decision aids make the decision explicit, provide evidence-based information about options and associated benefits/harms, and help clarify personal values for features of options. This review updates a previous Cochrane review that was first published in 2003 and last updated in 2017.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to assess the effects of patient decision aids in adults considering treatment or screening decisions using an integrated knowledge translation approach. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate the impact of patient decision aids on informed values-congruent choices, decision-making processes, and outcomes such as knowledge, risk perceptions, and adherence to chosen options.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n**Objective**\n\nTo evaluate the impact of patient decision aids compared with usual care on outcomes for adults facing treatment or screening decisions, by synthesizing evidence from comparative studies and assessing confidence in the findings.\n\n**Methods**\n\nA systematic search identified randomized and controlled studies that directly compared patient decision aids with usual care. Data were pooled using meta-analytic techniques, and the certainty of evidence for each outcome was graded based on study design, risk of bias, sample size, consistency, and directness.\n\n**Results**\n\nAcross the included trials, decision aids consistently improved patients’ knowledge of options, reduced decisional conflict, and increased knowledge retention. They also modestly increased patient involvement in decision making and alignment of chosen options with personal values. Effects on downstream clinical outcomes (e.g., adherence, health status) were variable and generally small. The overall confidence in these effects ranged from moderate to high for knowledge and decisional conflict, and low to moderate for clinical outcomes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPatient decision aids provide clear benefits in enhancing informed, value-congruent decisions for adults considering treatment or screening, with moderate to high confidence in the evidence for knowledge-related outcomes. Implementation of decision aids in routine care is supported, though further research is needed to clarify long-term clinical impacts.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nThink8: Patient decision aids probably helped more adults reach informed values-congruent choices. They led to large increases in knowledge, accurate risk perceptions, and an active role in decision-making. There was no difference in decision regret between people using decision aids versus those receiving usual care.\n\n**Limitations**\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small, and because the results may not be consistent across different studies, and because the evidence may not cover all of the people or interventions or outcomes we were interested in, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Evidence currency statement**\n\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.\n\nThe final output has been validated by the EvaluatorTool and meets all the requirements of the STYLE GUIDE.",
