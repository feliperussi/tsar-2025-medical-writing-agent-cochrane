  "key_messages": [
    "The main question this review aimed to answer was whether psychological and social interventions can promote mental health in people living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises. The review found that these interventions may improve functioning in children and adults, but the evidence is very uncertain due to a lack of robust studies. There is a large gap between what is known and what still needs to be addressed in the research area of mental health promotion in humanitarian settings.",
    "Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as interventions that redistribute pressure under the body or unwanted effects and costs related to beds, mattresses, and mattress toppers for treating pressure ulcers.",
    "Larger, well-designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of the different ways of delivering medicines directly to the eye during cataract surgery."

      "subheading": "What is the health problem?",
      "content": "People living in low- and middle-income countries affected by humanitarian crises are at risk of mental health problems due to wars, conflicts, persecutions, human rights violations, and humanitarian crises. Psychosocial interventions may be helpful to promote positive aspects of mental health, such as mental well‑being, psychosocial functioning, coping, and quality of life. Previous reviews have focused on treatment and mixed promotion and prevention interventions. In this review, we focused on promotion of positive aspects of mental health."

      "content": "We wanted to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting mental health versus control conditions (no intervention, intervention as usual, or waiting list) in people living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises."

      "subheading": "Study Characteristics",
      "content": "The agent stopped because it reached the maximum allowed number of iterations, indicating that the process did not converge or lacked a proper termination condition. This typically occurs when the agent is caught in a loop or when the iteration limit is set too low for the task at hand."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Findings Summary",
      "content": "The intervention appears to have little or no effect on mental well‑being for both adults and children at the study endpoint, and also little or no effect on children’s prosocial behaviour. However, it probably leads to a large reduction in functioning. Data on acceptability (drop‑out rates) were not reported, and the evidence for medium‑term effects on mental‑well‑behaviour is very uncertain. There remains a substantial gap in research on mental health promotion in humanitarian settings."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search."
