  "key_messages": [
    "Evidence is insufficient to determine whether surgery, thrombectomy, or thrombolysis is superior for blocked haemodialysis access, though some uncertain data suggest surgery may improve 30‑day primary patency versus mechanical thrombectomy.",
    "Future research should prioritize decision‑maker‑relevant options such as foam or air‑filled pressure‑redistributing surfaces and evaluate adverse effects and costs of various beds, mattresses, and toppers for pressure‑ulcer treatment.",
    "There is a lack of high‑quality evidence on the optimal method for delivering medicines directly to the eye during cataract surgery; only one adequately sized study exists, highlighting the need for larger, well‑designed trials.",
    "Rapid tests for Strep A in children with sore throats can identify the infection early, enabling appropriate antibiotic use and reducing unnecessary prescriptions, with both tested rapid tests showing similar accuracy.",
    "Biologic medicines appear most effective at clearing psoriasis patches after six months, but longer‑term studies are needed to assess benefits, harms, and direct comparisons with oral or injectable alternatives.",
    "Tocilizumab reduces 28‑day mortality and likely lowers serious adverse events in COVID‑19 patients compared with placebo; ongoing trials of other IL‑6 blockers will be incorporated in future updates."

      "content": "Patients who present with problems with definitive dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG)) become catheter dependent (temporary access), a condition that often carries a higher risk of infections, central ven and recurrent hospitalisations."

      "content": "Surgery is preferred when the cause of the thrombosis is a stenosis at the site of the anastomosis in thrombosed AVF. The European Best Practice Guidelines (EBPG) reported that thrombosed AVF may be preferably treated with endovascular techniques, but when the cause of thrombosis is in the anastomosis, surgery provides better results with re‑anastomosis."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review found that interventions for thrombosed haemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts may improve primary patency at 30 days, but the evidence is very uncertain; surgical procedures probably reduce the risk of death, access dysfunction, and unsuccessful dialysis, though the evidence is very low. Overall, it remains unclear whether any intervention affects 30‑day patency or failure of thrombosed HD AV access."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (risk of bias) and the studies had very small sample sizes.",
