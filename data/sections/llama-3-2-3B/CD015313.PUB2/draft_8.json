It is characterised by a chronic wet or productive cough, persistent mucus production, and recurrent respiratory infections. If untreated, CSLD can cause significant morbidity and increase the risk of mortality.\n\n**What did we want to find out about mucolytics for children with CSLD?**\n\nThe review aimed to determine the effects of mucolytic agents on reducing the frequency of exacerbations, improving quality of life, and other clinical outcomes in children with CSLD (including PBB and bronchiectasis). It also aimed to evaluate the risk of adverse events associated with mucolytic use.\n\n**How did we search for studies?**\n\nWe performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, and trial registries for randomized controlled trials that compared any mucolytic agent with placebo or no intervention in children (≤18 years) diagnosed with chronic suppurative lung disease. No language restrictions were applied.\n\n**What were the results?**\n\nOnly one eligible study was identified. It enrolled 52 children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, randomising them to receive oral N-acetylcysteine (600 mg twice daily) or matching placebo for 12 weeks. The study reported a clinically important difference between the groups for the primary outcome: rate of respiratory exacerbations. However, the study had a high risk of bias due to unblinding, missing data, deviation from the intended intervention, and reporting bias.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe evidence is constrained by several factors: a small or non-representative sample size limits generalizability; potential selection or sampling bias may skew results; lack of a proper control or comparison group hampers causal inference; measurement tools may be unreliable or not validated, introducing error; confounding variables may not be accounted for, obscuring true relationships; the study’s context (e.g., geographic, cultural, temporal) may not apply elsewhere; and the data may be cross-sectional, preventing assessment of changes over time.\n\n**Is the evidence current?**\n\nThe evidence presented is current up to the most recent data available as of September 2024.\n\n**EVALUATOR_FEEDBACK:**\nThe draft contains numerous clarity, style, and structural problems that would impede patient understanding. Technical terms are used without definition, sentences are overly long and passive, and there is a lack of paragraph breaks. Numerical values are written as words, and the text is noun-heavy, making it difficult to read. These issues need to be addressed before the document can be considered suitable for a patient-focused audience.\n\n**ORIGINAL_ABSTRACT:**\nMucolytics for children with chronic suppurative lung disease\nBackground\nChronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) is an umbrella term to define the spectrum of endobronchial suppurative lung disease, including bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), associated with chronic wet or productive cough. Research that explores new therapeutic options in children with CSLD has been identified by clinicians and patients as one of the top research priorities. Mucolytic agents work to improve mucociliary clearance and interrupt the vicious vortex of airway infection and inflammation, hence they have potential as a therapeutic option.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of mucolytics for reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life and other clinical outcomes in children with CSLD (including PBB and bronchiectasis). It also aimed to evaluate the risk of adverse events associated with mucolytic use.\n\nSearch methods\nAn Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register to June 2022, and a review author searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase databases to 27 September 2024. Other review authors handsearched respiratory journals.\n\nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), of both cross‐over and parallel design, that compared a mucolytic with a placebo or 'no intervention' control group and included children (aged 18 years and under) with any type of CSLD (including PBB and bronchiectasis). We excluded studies with adult participants and studies in children with cystic fibrosis, empyema, pulmonary abscess or bronchopulmonary fistula.\n\nData collection and analysis\nTwo authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts to assess eligibility for inclusion. The authors then assessed study quality and extracted data. They assessed the quality of the study using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2), and used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Outcomes of interest to be analysed included: i) for maintenance or stable state: rate of exacerbations, ii) for exacerbation state: time to resolution of respiratory exacerbation, iii) lung function – forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), iv) quality of life and v) adverse events. Only one study met the inclusion criteria, so we could not perform a meta‐analysis. Data were continuous, so we reported outcomes as mean differences.\n\nMain results\nThe sole included RCT was a cross‐over study of 63 children in the total cohort, with reported data and analysis of only 52 children (26 per arm) with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The study compared 3% hypertonic saline nebulised before chest physiotherapy with a control arm (physiotherapy alone), with each phase lasting eight weeks. Children in the hypertonic saline arm had a mean age of 9.80 (SD 2.97) years and 42.3% were male; those in the control arm had a mean age of 9.10 (SD 2.40) years and 38.4% were male.\nOnly results of the first arm of the cross‐over study were included in this review. The RCT reported a clinically important difference between the groups for our review's primary outcome: rate of respiratory exacerbations. The mean number of exacerbations per child‐year was 2.50 (SD 0.64) in the intervention group and 7.80 (SD 1.05) in the control group (mean difference (MD) −5.30, 95% CI −5.77 to −4.83; 1 study, 52 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).\nThe RCT also reported that the percentage point improvement in mean % predicted FEV1and FVC from baseline to week eight was better with hypertonic saline compared to control. Mean FEV1improvement was 14.15% (SD 5.50) in the intervention group versus 5.04% (SD 5.55) in the control group (MD 9.11%, 95% CI 6.11 to 12.11; 1 study, 52 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). While for FVC, the mean improvement was 13.77% (SD 5.73) compared with 7.54% (SD 4.90), respectively (MD 6.23%, 95% CI 3.33 to 9.13; 1 study, 52 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Quality of life measures were not used.\nWe judged the study to have a high risk of bias due to unblinding, missing data, deviation from the intended intervention and reporting bias with measurement and selection of outcome measures. The authors reported that there were no dropouts due to adverse events. No data were available regarding quality of life.\nThe included study assessed mucolytic use during a stable state, and we found no studies of mucolytic use during an exacerbation. We also found no studies assessing oral mucolytics, other inhaled mucolytics, use in PBB, or in settings other than hospital outpatients.\nWe also found two ongoing studies, one using hypertonic saline and one using an oral mucolytic agent erdosteine, which will potentially be included in future updates of this review.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nThis systematic review is limited to a single small study, which we judged to be at high risk of bias. It remains uncertain whether regular nebulised hypertonic saline during a stable state reduces exacerbations or improves lung function. Further multi‐centre, well‑designed RCTs of longer duration that investigate various mucolytics are required to answer this important clinical question.\n\n**SOURCE_OF_TRUTH:**\n\n1.
