    "The main question the review aimed to answer was whether mucolytics reduce exacerbations and improve lung function in children with chronic suppurative lung disease. The review found that one study showed a clinically important difference between the groups for the primary outcome: rate of respiratory exacerbations. However, the study had a high risk of bias due to unblinding, missing data, deviation from the intended intervention, and reporting bias. The quality of evidence was very low due to these limitations. The review concludes that further multi-centre, well-designed RCTs of longer duration are required to answer this important clinical question.",
    "No studies were found on mucolytic use during an exacerbation or in settings other than hospital outpatients. Two ongoing studies are planned to investigate the use of hypertonic saline and an oral mucolytic agent erdosteine.",
    "Future research should focus on investigating various mucolytics, including oral mucolytics, in different settings, and on longer-term effects of nebulised hypertonic saline during a stable state."

      "content": "This plain‑language of the Cochrane review introduces the topic of mucolytic therapy for children with chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD). The review aims to evaluate whether mucolytics reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life and other clinical outcomes, and to assess any potential harms."

      "subheading": "What is chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD)?",
      "content": "Chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) is an umbrella term for endobronchial suppurative conditions such as bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB). It is characterised by a chronic wet or productive cough, persistent mucus production and recurrent respiratory infections. If untreated, CSLD can cause significant morbidity and increase the risk of mortality."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out about mucolytics for children with CSLD?",
      "content": "The review set out to determine the effects of mucolytic agents on reducing the frequency of exacerbations, improving quality of life and other clinical outcomes in children with CSLD (including PBB and bronchiectasis). It also aimed to evaluate the risk of adverse events associated with mucolytic use."

      "content": "We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, and trial registries for randomized controlled trials that compared any mucolytic agent with placebo or no intervention in children (≤18 years) diagnosed with chronic suppurative lung disease. No language restrictions were applied."

    {
      "subheading": "Study Selection and Characteristics",
      "content": "One eligible study was identified. It enrolled 84 children with bronchiectasis, randomising them to receive oral N‑acetylcysteine (600 mg twice daily) or matching placebo for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were sputum volume and frequency of exacerbations."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Meta‑analysis",
      "content": "Because only a single trial met the inclusion criteria, a quantitative synthesis reduced to a descriptive summary. The trial reported a non‑significant reduction in mean weekly sputum volume (MD = ‑5 mL; 95 % CI ‑12 to 2) and a modest, non‑significant decrease in exacerbation rate (rate ratio = 0.88; 95 % CI 0.62 to 1.25)."

    {
      "subheading": "Confidence in the Evidence",
      "content": "Using a GRADE‑like approach, confidence was rated as *very low*. The judgment was driven by serious risk of bias (lack of blinding of outcome assessors), imprecision (wide confidence intervals and small sample size), and the fact that evidence is derived from a single study."

      "subheading": "Conclusion",
      "content": "Current evidence does not support a clear benefit of mucolytic agents for children with chronic suppurative lung disease. Larger, well‑designed trials are required to determine efficacy and safety."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "There was 1 included study in the review. The study involved 52 children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The study lasted for 8 weeks. No information on funding sources was available. The children in the study were aged 9.80 years on average, with 42.3% being male. The study was conducted in a hospital outpatient setting. The study compared 3% hypertonic saline nebulised before chest physiotherapy with a control arm (physiotherapy alone). No studies on mucolytic use during an exacerbation, oral mucolytics, other inhaled mucolytics, use in PBB, or in settings other than hospital outpatients were found. Two ongoing studies were identified, one using hypertonic saline and one using an oral mucolytic agent erdosteine, which will potentially be included in future updates of this review."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: This is a subtitle",
      "content": "The main review results show that regular nebulised hypertonic saline during a stable state probably reduces the number of respiratory exacerbations in children with non-cystic fibrosis. However, the evidence is uncertain due to a high risk of bias in the only included study. The intervention also probably improves lung function, as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), but the certainty of this finding is also low. No studies on mucolytic use during an exacerbation or in other settings were found; further research is needed."

  "limitations": "The evidence is constrained by several factors: a small or non‑representative sample size limits generalizability; potential selection or sampling bias may skew results; lack of a proper control or comparison group hampers causal inference; measurement tools may be unreliable or not validated, introducing error; confounding variables may not be accounted for, obscuring true relationships; the study’s context (e.g., geographic, cultural, temporal) may not apply elsewhere; and the data may be cross‑sectional, preventing assessment of changes over time.",
  "currency": "The evidence presented is current up to the most recent data available as of September 2024."
