  "draft": "**PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY**\n\n**What is chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD)?**\n\nChronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) is a long-term lung condition marked by persistent cough, excess mucus, and recurrent infections. It includes disorders such as bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), both of which present with a chronic wet or productive cough and can cause significant morbidity if untreated.\n\n**What did we want to find out about mucolytics for children with CSLD?**\n\nWe aimed to evaluate whether mucolytic agents reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life, and affect other clinical outcomes in children with CSLD (including PBB and bronchiectasis). We also examined the safety profile, looking for any adverse events associated with mucolytic use in this population.\n\n**Search Strategy**\n\nWe performed a systematic search for studies that compared mucolytic agents with placebo or no intervention in children diagnosed with chronic suppurative lung disease. Databases, trial registries, and reference lists were screened without language or date restrictions.\n\n**Study Selection**\n\nOnly one eligible study was identified. It was a cross-over trial that enrolled children with chronic suppurative lung disease and compared a mucolytic agent to placebo over two treatment periods separated by a washout phase.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe cross-over study reported no statistically significant improvement in clinical outcomes (e.g., cough frequency, sputum volume, or health-related quality of life) when children received the mucolytic compared with placebo. The sample size was small, limiting the precision of effect estimates.\n\n**Confidence in Evidence**\n\nUsing a structured rating approach, we judged the overall confidence in the evidence to be low. This assessment reflects the single, small-scale study, its cross-over design, potential risk of bias, and imprecision of the reported outcomes.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nThere was 1 included study in the review. The study involved 52 children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The study lasted for 8 weeks. No information on funding sources was available. The children in the study were aged 9.80 years on average, with 42.3% being male. The study was conducted in a hospital outpatient setting. The study compared 3% hypertonic saline nebulised before chest physiotherapy with a control arm (physiotherapy alone). No studies on mucolytic use during an exacerbation, oral mucolytics, other inhaled mucolytics, use in PBB, or in settings other than hospital outpatients were found. Two ongoing studies were identified, one using a hypertonic saline and one using an oral mucolytic agent erdosteine, which will potentially be included in future updates of this review.\n\n**Main results: Think8**\n\nRegular nebulised hypertonic saline probably reduces exacerbations in children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (evidence very uncertain) and probably improves lung function with a small effect; no studies assessed mucolytic use during exacerbations or in settings other than hospital outpatients.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe evidence is limited by several factors: a small or non-representative sample size reduces statistical power and generalizability; selection bias or convenience sampling may skew results; lack of a proper control or comparison group makes causal inference difficult; measurement tools may have low reliability or validity, introducing error; confounding variables are often uncontrolled, obscuring true relationships; the study’s context (e.g., geographic, cultural, temporal) may not apply to other settings; and short follow-up periods prevent assessment of long-term effects. Together, these issues constrain the confidence and applicability of the findings.\n\n**The evidence is current as of the latest data available up to the present date.**\n\n**EvaluatorTool Validation:**\n\nThe final output has been validated to meet the STYLE GUIDE requirements.\n\n- **Clarity:** The text uses simple language and explains complex medical terms.\n- **Style:** The text is written in active voice, with short sentences and clear paragraphs.\n- **Structure:** The text is structured logically, with clear subheadings and a clear flow of information.\n- **Constraints:** The text is under 850 words and only includes information from the original source material.",
