    "Is oestrogen therapy (hormone replacement therapy that helps balance estrogen levels in the body) effective in treating pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women? There was insufficient evidence from RCTs to draw any solid conclusions on the benefits or harms of oestrogen therapy for managing POP symptoms in postmenopausal women. Topical oestrogen in conjunction with pessaries was associated with fewer adverse vaginal events compared with pessaries alone, and topical oestrogen in conjunction with surgery was associated with reduced postoperative urinary tract infections compared with surgery alone; however, these findings should be interpreted with caution, as the studies that contributed data varied substantially in their design. There is a need for larger studies on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of oestrogen therapy, used alone or in conjunction with pelvic floor muscle training, vaginal pessaries, or surgery, for the management of POP. These studies should measure outcomes in the medium and long term.",
    "No studies assessed the effects of oestrogen therapy alone versus no treatment, placebo, pelvic floor muscle training, devices such as vaginal pessaries, or surgery.",
    "Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: foam or air-filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body; and unwanted effects and costs."

      "subheading": "What is pelvic organ prolapse?",
      "content": "Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is the descent of a woman's uterus, bladder, or rectum into the vagina. It affects 50% of women over 50 years old who have given birth to at least one child, and recognised risk factors are older age, higher number of births, and higher body mass index."

      "subheading": "What is oestrogen therapy?",
      "content": "Oestrogen therapy is treatment that involves taking oestrogen medication to help manage symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. In the context of this review, oestrogen therapy refers to the use of oestrogen medication to and treat pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women."

      "content": "We wanted to assess the benefits and harms of local and systemic oestrogen therapy in the management of pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women, and to summarise the principal findings of relevant economic evaluations."

      "content": "The review comprised 14 studies involving a total of 1,002 participants. Study durations varied, most lasting about 3 months, with some extending to 12 months or longer. No funding source information was reported. All studies enrolled postmenopausal women with any grade of pelvic organ prolapse; specific age ranges or gender distributions were not detailed. Research was conducted across multiple countries, though exact locations were not specified. Interventions compared estrogen therapy (alone or combined with other treatments) against placebo, no treatment, or alternative interventions. No studies addressed the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of estrogen therapy used alone or together with pelvic floor muscle training, vaginal pessaries, or surgery for POP in particular subpopulations such as nulliparous women or women retaining a uterus."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding) and because the studies were very small.",
