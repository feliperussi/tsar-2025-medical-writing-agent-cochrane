  "key_messages": [
    "Fenestrated endovascular repair (a type of minimally invasive surgery that uses a special graft to reach the renal arteries) is not compared to open surgery or no treatment for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms due to a lack of eligible randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared treatment of complex AAAs with fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) versus open surgical repair or conservative management.",
    "Future studies could consider commissioning agreements mandating patient inclusion in studies to make the generation of high-quality evidence in this area feasible.",
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of fenestrated endovascular repair (a type of minimally invasive surgery that uses a special graft to reach the renal arteries) for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms are unclear."

      "subheading": "What is abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs)?",
      "content": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are abnormal dilatations of the aorta that most commonly affect its infrarenal segment, but can become more difficult to repair when they are close to or next to the renal arteries. The optimum treatment for these complex AAAs is unknown. One option is fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR), which involves using fenestrations or scallops in the graft to facilitate access to the visceral arteries. Common treatments include open surgical repair (OSR) and conservative (non-operative) management."
