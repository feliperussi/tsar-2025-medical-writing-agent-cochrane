  "draft": "**Is fenestrated endovascular repair (a type of minimally invasive surgery that uses a special graft to reach the renal arteries) better than open surgery or no treatment for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms?**\n\n- Fenestrated endovascular repair (a type of minimally invasive surgery that uses a special graft to reach the renal arteries) is not compared to open surgery or no treatment for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms due to a lack of eligible randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared treatment of complex AAAs with fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) versus open surgical repair or conservative management.\n- Future studies could consider commissioning agreements mandating patient inclusion in studies to make the generation of high-quality evidence in this area feasible.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of fenestrated endovascular repair (a type of minimally invasive surgery that uses a special graft to reach the renal arteries) for people with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms are unclear.\n\n**What is abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs)?**\n\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are abnormal dilatations of the aorta that most commonly affect its infrarenal segment, but can become more difficult to repair when they are close to or next to the renal arteries. The optimum treatment for these complex AAAs is unknown. One option is fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR), which involves using fenestrations or scallops in the graft to facilitate access to the visceral arteries. Common treatments include open surgical repair (OSR) and conservative (non-operative) management.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to assess the benefits and harms of complex stent-graft fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) versus open surgical repair (OSR) or conservative (non-operative) management for people with complex AAAs.\n\n**Search Strategy**\n\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases to identify studies comparing fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgical repair or conservative management for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). The search included all relevant keywords, MeSH terms, and filters for study design and population.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe agent stopped because it reached the maximum number of iterations allowed for processing. This limit is in place to prevent infinite loops or excessively long computations.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (lack of blinding) and the studies were very small.\n\n**The evidence is up to date to March 28, 2023 of search.**",
