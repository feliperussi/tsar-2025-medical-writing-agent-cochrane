  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptives effective for treating painful menstrual cramps in women, and what are the risks of using them?\n\nKey messages:\n- Combined oral contraceptives are effective for treating painful menstrual cramps in women, but they probably increase the risk of irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea. There is probably little or no difference between different types of combined oral contraceptives in terms of effectiveness and safety.\n- Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision‑makers, such as the effects of different types of combined oral contraceptives on the risk of irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea, and the impact of long‑term use on health outcomes.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of most types of combined oral contraceptives for treating primary dysmenorrhoea are unclear.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea is painful menstrual cramps without pelvic pathology. It is a common cause of pain in women. Combined oral contraceptives (OCPs) are often used to manage primary dysmenorrhoea, but there is a need to report the benefits and harms of OCPs for this condition.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of combined oral contraceptive pills for the management of primary dysmenorrhoea.\n\nKey Actions:\n- Define objectives, recruit participants, collect data, analyze results, and report findings.\n- Link to Research Aims\n- Study Design\n  A randomized controlled trial with parallel arms, blinded outcome assessment, and pre‑registered analysis plan to meet critical methodological standards.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe 21 included RCTs involved a total of 3723 women. The studies were conducted in various countries, including the USA, Canada, Australia, and Europe. The duration of the studies ranged from 3 to 12 months. The funding sources of the studies were not reported. The studies included women of different ages, with most being in their reproductive years. The severity of dysmenorrhoea varied among the participants. The studies compared different types of combined oral contraceptive pills, including continuous and standard regimens, as well as placebo and non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). There were insufficient data to determine the effectiveness of OCPs versus NSAIDs for pain. The studies found that OCPs reduce pain in women with dysmenorrhoea more effectively than placebo, but may increase the risk of adverse events such as irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea. The continuous use of OCPs may be more effective than the standard regimen, but the long‑term effects are not reported. There is uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of different types of OCPs and the risk of adverse events associated with their use. The studies also found that OCPs may increase the risk of irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea, but the evidence for these findings is of varying quality. Overall, the available evidence suggests that OCPs are effective for treating dysmenorrhoea, but their use is associated with potential risks and uncertainties.\n\nMain results:\nThe combined oral contraceptive pill is effective in reducing pain in women with dysmenorrhoea, but it may cause more unwanted effects such as irregular bleeding, headaches, and nausea. The risk of these effects is higher in women who use the pill for a longer period. The exact benefits and harms of using the pill for primary dysmenorrhoea are still uncertain, and more research is needed to fully understand its effects.\n\nLimitations:\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. We are also uncertain about the results because the studies were very small, and because some of the studies did not provide data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nEvidence currency statement:\nThe evidence is up to date to 28 March 2023 of search.",
