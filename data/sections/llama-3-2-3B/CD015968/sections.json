    "Digital tools for weight management in kids may have a small, short-term beneficial effect on fat mass compared to conventional care alone, but the effect on other outcome measures is unclear. (Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of most types of digital tools for weight management in kids are unclear.)",
    "Future studies should report their results by age, gender, and race/ethnicity; report full data to better enable data extraction and analysis; assess other important outcomes, particularly adverse events; control for both diet and physical activity in their analyses; and report the behavioral theory informing their intervention. (More research is needed to assess the long-term clinical benefit in children and adolescents and to determine the optimal digital interventions for managing obesity in this population.)"

      "content": "Childhood obesity is a serious public health problem that affects millions of children and adolescents worldwide. It increases the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were living with overweight or obesity."
