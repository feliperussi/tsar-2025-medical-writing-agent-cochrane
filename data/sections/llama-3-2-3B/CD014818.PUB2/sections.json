    "Which regional analgesia technique (pain relief with nerve injections) works best for postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery? The evidence suggests that paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) are comparable in reducing postoperative pain, but PEC may be slightly more effective in reducing pain at rest and during movement at two and 24 hours. However, the evidence is of low to moderate certainty due to imprecision and heterogeneity. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to recommend one technique over another. Future research should focus on longer-term effects and the effects of these techniques in different subgroups of patients.",
    "No serious unwanted effects were reported in the included studies, but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.",
    "More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of these regional analgesia techniques in women undergoing breast cancer surgery."

      "subheading": "What is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery?",
      "content": "Postoperative pain is a common problem for individuals undergoing breast cancer surgery. It can be caused by the surgery itself, as well as by the removal of lymph nodes and other tissues. Pain can be severe and may last for several weeks or even months after surgery. It can also affect a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and enjoy life. Regional analgesia techniques are considered integral to postoperative pain management, but are not without risks. Common treatments for postoperative pain include pain medication, physical therapy, and alternative therapies such as acupuncture and massage."

They aimed to compare the effectiveness of paravertebral block (PVB), erector spinae plane block (ESPB), pectoral nerve block (PEC), and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) in reducing postoperative pain and rates of complications."

      "content": "In the included studies, pectoral nerve block (PEC) was probably slightly more effective than paravertebral block (PVB) for reducing postoperative pain at rest at 2 hours and 24 hours, although the differences were smaller than the minimal clinically important difference. PEC may also produce a large reduction in pain during movement at 2 hours, but the evidence is low-certainty. Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) showed similar effectiveness to PVB for most pain outcomes. No serious complications such as block failure, toxicity, hypotension, nerve injury, vascular puncture, bleeding, infection, or pneumothorax were reported."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
