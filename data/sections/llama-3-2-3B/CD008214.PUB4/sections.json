    "The perioperative use of anti-VEGF reduces the risk of late POVCH, probably results in lower early POVCH risk and may improve visual outcomes. It also reduces the incidence of intraoperative retinal breaks.",
    "The evidence is very uncertain about its effect on the need for silicone oil tamponade.",
    "Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: vitrectomy for PDR, anti-VEGF agents, and complications like retinal detachment and scar tissue on the retina after surgery."

      "content": "Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced stage of diabetic eye disease in which abnormal new blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina. These fragile vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, and cause retinal detachments, leading to severe vision loss. The standard surgical treatment for these complications is pars plana vitrectomy, a procedure that removes the cloudy vitreous gel and any scar tissue to restore the eye’s structure. However, vitrectomy for PDR often results in intra‑operative problems such as retinal holes and bleeding, and post‑operative issues like early or late vitreous cavity haemorrhage (POVCH), retinal detachment, and the need for additional surgeries. Anti‑vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‑VEGF) drugs are medicines injected into the eye that shrink and reduce the blood supply of these abnormal vessels, potentially making surgery safer. Terms explained: \n- **Anti‑VEGF**: a class of eye injections that block a protein (VEGF) that promotes growth of abnormal blood vessels. \n- **Vitrectomy**: eye surgery that removes the gel‑like vitreous body to treat retinal problems. \n- **BCVA (best corrected visual acuity)**: the sharpest vision a person can achieve with glasses or contact lenses, measured on a logMAR scale (lower numbers = better vision). \n- **POVCH (post‑operative vitreous cavity haemorrhage)**: bleeding inside the eye after surgery, classified as early (within 4 weeks) or late (after 4 weeks). \n- **Silicone oil tamponade**: a bubble of silicone oil placed in the eye during surgery to hold the retina in place."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to determine whether giving anti‑VEGF injections around the time of vitrectomy improves outcomes for people with PDR. Specifically, the authors wanted to assess the effect of peri‑operative anti‑VEGF on visual acuity (BCVA) six months after surgery, on the rates of early and late POVCH, on the need for revision surgeries (including those for recurrent traction or retinal detachment), on intra‑operative retinal breaks, on the use of silicone oil tamponade, and on vision‑related quality of life."

      "content": "Intravitreal anti‑VEGF given before or during pars plana vitrectomy produced a moderate improvement in six‑month best‑corrected visual acuity (high certainty). It also moderately reduced both early and late postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (moderate certainty for early, high certainty for late) and lowered the rate of intra‑operative retinal breaks (high certainty). Revision surgery for postoperative haemorrhage was slightly less common (small but important effect, moderate certainty). Evidence that anti‑VEGF reduces the need for silicone oil is very low certainty and suggests a trivial, unimportant effect."
