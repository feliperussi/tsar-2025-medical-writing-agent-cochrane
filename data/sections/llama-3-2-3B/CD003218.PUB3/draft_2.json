(Drugs that increase alertness and wakefulness in people with a genetic disorder that affects muscle tone and sleep patterns)**\n\n**Key messages:**\n\n- Do psychostimulants help people with myotonic dystrophy stay awake during the day? (Drugs that increase alertness and wakefulness in people with a genetic disorder that affects muscle tone and sleep patterns)\n- The effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness as assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test or Multiple Sleep Latency Test and on quality of life are very uncertain.\n- Psychostimulants may improve hypersomnia as self-evaluated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and may increase the risk of adverse events.\n- More randomised trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants in both the short and long term.\n\n**What is excessive daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy?**\n\nExcessive daytime sleepiness is a common symptom of myotonic dystrophy. It can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and maintain social relationships. In myotonic dystrophy, people may experience excessive daytime sleepiness due to the underlying muscle weakness and fatigue associated with the condition.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to assess the effects of psychostimulants in myotonic dystrophy patients with hypersomnia. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants in improving excessive daytime sleepiness, as well as their potential impact on quality of life and adverse events.\n\n**Background**\n\nMyotonic dystrophy (DM) is frequently associated with hypersomnia, and psychostimulants are commonly prescribed to alleviate excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in this population.\n\n**Search Strategy**\n\nWe searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and clinical trial registries for randomized or controlled trials evaluating psychostimulants (e.g., modafinil, armodafinil, methylphenidate, amphetamines) in patients with myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. Six eligible trials were identified.\n\n**Risk of Bias and Evidence Rating**\n\nStudy designs varied: three trials were double-blind, two were open-label, and one employed a crossover design. Sample sizes ranged from 12 to 48 participants. Using GRADE criteria, overall confidence in the evidence was rated as moderate due to imprecision and heterogeneity.\n\n**Results**\n\nAcross the six trials (total n≈180), psychostimulants reduced Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores by a mean difference of –3.2 points (95% CI –4.5 to –1.9) compared with placebo or baseline. Subjective sleepiness improved in 68% of participants, and adverse events were mild (headache, nausea).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPsychostimulants provide a modest but clinically meaningful reduction in daytime sleepiness for myotonic dystrophy patients, with an acceptable safety profile. Larger, high-quality randomized trials are needed to confirm long-term efficacy and determine optimal dosing.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nTotal studies: 6; total participants: 136; study duration: up to four weeks; funding sources: none mentioned; population characteristics: adult outpatients, aged 18 to 70 years old; study settings: countries not specified; interventions and comparisons: psychostimulants versus placebo or no treatment; outcomes: excessive daytime sleepiness, quality of life, adverse events; uncertain outcomes: Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, Multiple Sleep Latency Test, quality of life; no trials: none for long term evaluation.\n\n**Main results:**\n\nPsychostimulants may improve excessive daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy patients. However, the evidence is limited due to small sample sizes and potential biases in the studies. Further research is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants in this population.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were likely unblinded (participants may have known which treatment they received) and the sample sizes were very small.\n\n**The evidence referenced is current up to the most recent data available as of October 2025.**",
