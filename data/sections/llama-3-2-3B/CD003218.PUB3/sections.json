    "Do psychostimulants help people with myotonic dystrophy stay awake during the day? (Drugs that increase alertness and wakefulness in people with a genetic disorder that affects muscle tone and sleep patterns) The effects of psychostimulants on excessive daytime sleepiness as assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test or Multiple Sleep Latency Test and on quality of life are very uncertain. Psychostimulants may improve hypersomnia as self-evaluated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and may increase the risk of adverse events. More randomised trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants in both the short and long term.",

      "content": "Excessive daytime sleepiness is a common symptom of myotonic dystrophy. It can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and maintain social relationships. In myotonic dystrophy, people may experience excessive daytime sleepiness due to the underlying muscle weakness and fatigue associated with the condition."

Limited randomized trials suggest modest improvement in alertness with modafinil, but data are sparse and adverse effects such as insomnia, anxiety, and cardiovascular symptoms are notable. No consensus exists on the optimal agent, and off‑label use remains common. Further controlled studies are needed to define efficacy, optimal dosing, and safety profiles.",
