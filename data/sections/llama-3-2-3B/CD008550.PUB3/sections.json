      "subheading": "What is gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) in children?",
      "content": "Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a common condition in infants and young children where stomach acid flows back into the oesophagus. This can cause symptoms such as vomiting, coughing, and difficulty feeding. GOR can be a self-limiting condition that improves with age, but older children and children with co-existing medical conditions can have more protracted symptoms. The distinction between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and GOR is debated. Current National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines define GORD as GOR causing symptoms severe enough to merit treatment. This review updates a previous review first published in 2014."

      "subheading": "What did we want to find out?",
      "content": "This review aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in infants and children. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any currently-available pharmacological treatment for GOR in children with placebo or another medication. We included studies in infants and children up to 16 years old and evaluated the effects of omeprazole, ranitidine, esomeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and other medications on symptoms and pH indices in infants and children with GOR."

      "subheading": "Study Selection",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts. Eligible studies enrolled children (0‑18 years) with clinically diagnosed GOR and reported at least one relevant outcome (e.g., symptom improvement, adverse events). Disagreements were resolved by consensus."

    {
      "subheading": "Data Synthesis",
      "content": "For each comparison we extracted the number of participants with improvement and the total number randomised. Random‑effects meta‑analysis was performed to calculate pooled risk ratios (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed with I²."

      "subheading": "Confidence in the Evidence",
      "content": "The GRADE approach was applied, considering risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias. Evidence was downgraded for small sample sizes, unclear allocation concealment, and high heterogeneity, resulting in low to moderate confidence for most outcomes."

H2‑receptor antagonists did not differ significantly from placebo (RR = 1.05, 95 % CI 0.78‑1.41; moderate certainty). Adverse events were similar across groups."

      "subheading": "Main results: This is a subtitle",
      "content": "Think8: Pharmacological treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux in children shows that omeprazole may or may not provide symptomatic benefit for infants, and proton pump inhibitors at various doses provide little to no symptomatic and endoscopic benefit for children; further studies are needed to determine effectiveness."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
