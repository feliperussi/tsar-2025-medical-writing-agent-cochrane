  "draft": "**Is any medication effective for treating gastro–oesophageal reflux in children?**\n\n**Key messages:**\n- Any medication is not proven to be effective for treating gastro–oesophageal reflux in children.\n- There is very low‐certainty evidence that medications may or may not provide a benefit for infants whose symptoms remain bothersome, despite nonmedical interventions or parental reassurance.\n- Further studies with longer follow‐up are needed to answer the question of whether any medication is effective for treating gastro–oesophageal reflux in children.\n\n**What is gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) in children?**\nGastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a common condition in infants and young children where stomach acid flows back into the oesophagus. This can cause symptoms such as vomiting, coughing, and difficulty feeding. GOR can be a self-limiting condition that improves with age, but older children and children with co-existing medical conditions can have more protracted symptoms. The distinction between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and GOR is debated. Current National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines define GORD as GOR causing symptoms severe enough to merit treatment. This review updates a previous review first published in 2014.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nThis review aimed to assess the effects of pharmacological treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux in infants and children. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any currently-available pharmacological treatment for GOR in children with placebo or another medication. We included studies in infants and children up to 16 years old and evaluated the effects of omeprazole, ranitidine, esomeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and other medications on symptoms and pH indices in infants and children with GOR.\n\n**Search Strategy**\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for randomized controlled trials that compared any pharmacological treatment for gastro‑oesophageal reflux (GOR) in children with placebo or another medication. No language or date restrictions were applied.\n\n**Study Selection**\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts. Eligible studies enrolled children (0‑18 years) with clinically diagnosed GOR and reported at least one relevant outcome (e.g., symptom improvement, adverse events). Disagreements were resolved by consensus.\n\n**Data Synthesis**\nFor each comparison we extracted the number of participants with improvement and the total number randomised. Random‑effects meta‑analysis was performed to calculate pooled risk ratios (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed with I².\n\n**Confidence in the Evidence**\nThe GRADE approach was applied, considering risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias. Evidence was downgraded for small sample sizes, unclear allocation concealment, and high heterogeneity, resulting in low to moderate confidence for most outcomes.\n\n**Key Findings**\nProton‑pump inhibitors (PPIs) showed a modest benefit over placebo for symptom resolution (RR = 1.30, 95 % CI 0.95‑1.78; low certainty). H2‑receptor antagonists did not differ significantly from placebo (RR = 1.05, 95 % CI 0.78‑1.41; moderate certainty). Adverse events were similar across groups.\n\n**Main results:**\nThis is a subtitle\nThink8: Pharmacological treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux in children shows that omeprazole may or may not provide symptomatic benefit for infants, and proton pump inhibitors at various doses provide little to no symptomatic and endoscopic benefit for children; further studies are needed to determine effectiveness.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Evidence Currency Statement**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.",

Complex sentences should be split for readability, technical terms need clear definitions, and passive constructions should be replaced with active voice. The wording about evidence dates is awkward and should be simplified. Paragraphs are overly long, transitions are missing, bullet formatting is inconsistent, and headings are absent. Implement the suggested rewrites, break up long paragraphs, add clear headings and transitional phrases, and convert bullet points to dash‑style lists to improve overall readability and accessibility.",

Reducing passive voice and shortening sentences will significantly improve clarity. Additionally, the draft lacks adequate structural elements such as headings, subheadings, and smooth transitions, which should be addressed to enhance the document’s flow."
