  "draft": "**Can primary-level and community worker interventions improve mental health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries?**\n\n- The evidence suggests that these interventions may improve mental health outcomes, but the quality of the evidence is limited by a lack of robust studies and high levels of heterogeneity. The benefits of these interventions are likely to be small, with probably slightly reduced anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms in adults, and may improve the quality of life in children. However, the certainty of the evidence is influenced by the risk of bias and substantial levels of heterogeneity. A supportive network of infrastructure and research would enhance and reinforce this delivery modality across low- and middle-income countries.\n- Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as task-shifting interventions, infrastructure and research support, and the effects and costs of different delivery modalities.\n- Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and should use more robust study designs, such as cluster randomised trials, to provide more reliable estimates of the benefits and potential harms of primary-level and community worker interventions for mental health promotion and prevention.\n\n**What is the health problem?**\n\nThere is a significant research gap in the field of universal, selective, and indicated prevention interventions for mental health promotion and the prevention of mental disorders. Barriers to closing the research gap include scarcity of skilled human resources, large inequities in resource distribution and utilization, and stigma.\n\n**What are common treatments?**\n\nCommon treatments for mental disorders include medication and psychotherapy. However, these treatments may not be accessible or effective for everyone, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe aimed to assess the effectiveness of delivery by primary workers of interventions for the promotion of mental health and universal prevention, and for the selective and indicated prevention of mental disorders or symptoms of mental illness in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We also wanted to examine the impact of intervention delivery by primary workers on resource use and costs.\n\n**Mental health interventions delivered by primary workers (e.g., community health workers) in low- and middle-income countries show modest benefits. For adults, universal prevention slightly reduces anxiety, selective prevention slightly reduces depression, and indicated prevention may lower adverse events and functional impairment. For children, universal prevention may improve quality of life, selective prevention slightly reduces depression, and indicated prevention may slightly reduce both depression and anxiety. Overall, these prevention approaches appear to improve mental health outcomes, though the certainty is limited by risk of bias and heterogeneity. Strengthening infrastructure and research could enhance this delivery model across LMICs.**\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is current up to 29 November 2021.**",
