    "The accuracy of toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is uncertain due to a lack of robust evidence. (Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of TBI and TSBP for diagnosing PAD are unclear.)",
    "The evidence base to support the use of TBI and TSBP to identify PAD is limited, and future research is needed to comprehensively determine their diagnostic test accuracy. (We did not find enough good-quality evidence about the diagnostic test accuracy of TBI and TSBP for identifying PAD.)",
    "Future studies should focus on investigating the diagnostic performance of TBI and TSBP in different populations, such as those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and exploring the effects of various equipment types and positivity thresholds. (Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: foam or air-filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body; and unwanted effects and costs.)"

      "subheading": "What is peripheral arterial disease (PAD)?",
      "content": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the legs and feet become narrowed or blocked due to atherosclerosis. This reduces blood flow to the lower limbs, leading to symptoms such as claudication pain, rest pain, wounds, gangrene, amputation, and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PAD is common, affecting an estimated 236 million individuals worldwide, and is associated with advanced age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and concomitant cardiovascular disease."

      "content": "Current evidence indicates that both the toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) have very low certainty and only small effect sizes for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Consequently, their diagnostic accuracy is uncertain, and clinicians should consider supplementary methods such as imaging when evaluating patients at risk for PAD. Further research is needed to clarify the performance of TBI and TSBP across diverse populations and in combination with other diagnostic tools."
