  "draft": "**Generate a plain language title from a complex regex pattern**\n\n- The accuracy of toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is uncertain due to a lack of robust evidence. (Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of TBI and TSBP for diagnosing PAD are unclear.)\n- The evidence base to support the use of TBI and TSBP to identify PAD is limited, and future research is needed to comprehensively determine their diagnostic test accuracy. (We did not find enough good-quality evidence about the diagnostic test accuracy of TBI and TSBP for identifying PAD.)\n- Future studies should focus on investigating the diagnostic performance of TBI and TSBP in different populations, such as those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and exploring the effects of various equipment types and positivity thresholds. (Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: foam or air-filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body; and unwanted effects and costs.)\n\n**What is peripheral arterial disease (PAD)?**\n\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the legs and feet become narrowed or blocked due to atherosclerosis. This reduces blood flow to the lower limbs, leading to symptoms such as claudication pain, rest pain, wounds, gangrene, amputation, and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PAD is common, affecting an estimated 236 million individuals worldwide, and is associated with advanced age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and concomitant cardiovascular disease.\n\n**What did we want to find out about toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP)?**\n\nWe wanted to estimate the accuracy of TSBP and TBI for diagnosing PAD in the lower extremities at different cut-off values for test positivity in populations at risk of PAD, and compare the accuracy of TBI and TSBP for diagnosing PAD in the lower extremities.\n\n**We searched for studies that evaluated the accuracy of toe brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in adults aged 18 years and older.**\n\nRelevant studies were identified, data were pooled, and confidence in the evidence was assessed using criteria such as study design, sample size, and risk of bias. The meta-analysis combined diagnostic accuracy results across the included studies, providing pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios for TBI and TSBP.\n\n**The meta-analysis combined diagnostic accuracy results across the included studies, providing pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios for TBI and TSBP.**\n\nThe synthesized evidence informs clinical practice by highlighting the reliability of TBI and TSBP in PAD detection, aiming to reduce missed diagnoses and related complications.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nTotal studies: 18; total participants: 1927 + 701; study duration: Generally of low methodological quality, with poor reporting of participant recruitment in regard to consecutive or random sampling, and poor reporting of blinding between index test and reference standard, as well as timing between index test and reference standard.; funding sources: No information available in the abstract.; population characteristics: Adults aged 18 years and over, with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, renal disease, or general population.; study settings: Countries around the world, with most studies conducted in the USA.; interventions and comparisons: Diagnostic tests for PAD, including TBI and TSBP, compared to reference standards such as colour duplex ultrasound, computed tomography angiography, and angiography.; outcomes of interest: Diagnostic accuracy of TBI and TSBP for the diagnosis of PAD in the lower extremities.\n\n**Current evidence indicates that both the toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) have very low certainty and only small effect sizes for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Consequently, their diagnostic accuracy is uncertain, and clinicians should consider supplementary methods such as imaging when evaluating patients at risk for PAD. Further research is needed to clarify the performance of TBI and TSBP across diverse populations and in combination with other diagnostic tools.**\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is up to date to 27 February 2024 of search.**",
