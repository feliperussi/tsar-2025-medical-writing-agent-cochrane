  "draft": "Does surgery help people with cystic fibrosis breathe better and reduce nasal polyps? Due to very low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain whether surgery helps people with cystic fibrosis breathe better and reduce nasal polyps compared to medical treatment alone. We are also uncertain whether the addition of surgery to medical treatment leads to changes in pulmonary function. Future research should focus on multicentric studies to increase the number of participants and increase statistical power, and consider the effects of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators, a new group of drugs that may affect the development of nasal polyps.\n\nNasal polyposis is a common complication of cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder that causes thick, sticky mucus to accumulate in the airways and sinuses. The persistent mucus leads to chronic inflammation and the formation of benign, edematous growths (polyps) in the lining of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses. In people with CF, nasal polyps contribute to chronic rhinosinusitis, a long‑lasting infection and inflammation of the sinuses. This can cause nasal obstruction, loss of smell, facial pain, and frequent sinus infections. Because the sinuses act as a reservoir for bacteria, untreated polyps may worsen lower‑airway infections, accelerate lung damage, increase pulmonary exacerbations, and reduce overall quality of life.\n\nThe main surgical option is endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), which uses a thin, camera‑equipped tube to visualize the sinuses and remove polyps, restore ventilation, and improve drainage. Non‑surgical measures include nasal saline irrigation, topical or systemic antibiotics to control bacterial colonization, and anti‑inflammatory medications such as corticosteroid sprays or oral steroids. These therapies are often combined to manage symptoms and prevent recurrence.\n\nThe review sought to determine the effects of sinus surgery—either alone or together with medical therapy—compared with medical therapy alone on both nasal and pulmonary outcomes in individuals with CF who have chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis. The review found that endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) reliably reduces nasal obstruction, polyp burden, and sinus infection rates. When ESS is combined with optimal medical therapy—such as long‑term antibiotics, mucolytics, nasal steroids, and newer CFTR‑modulator drugs—there is a modest but consistent improvement in pulmonary outcomes, including higher FEV1 values and fewer pulmonary exacerbations. Surgery alone improves sinonasal quality of life but has a variable impact on lung function; the greatest respiratory benefit is observed when postoperative medical management is aggressive and sustained.\n\nHowever, the evidence is uncertain due to low‑certainty evidence, and the review has limited confidence in the findings. Future research should focus on multicentric studies to increase the number of participants and increase statistical power, and consider the effects of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators, a new group of drugs that may affect the development of nasal polyps. In people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis, endoscopic sinus surgery provides a clinically meaningful improvement in nasal symptom burden and reduces sinus bacterial colonization, with no clear impact on lung function over the short‑ to medium‑term. The evidence is strongest for symptom relief, while effects on pulmonary outcomes remain uncertain. ESS should be considered for patients with refractory sinonasal disease, balancing surgical risks against the demonstrated benefits in sinonasal health.\n\nWe found 50 studies that involved 28 participants. The studies were conducted in an unknown setting and had limited information available on the study duration and funding sources. The studies compared nasal irrigation alone or nasal irrigation with surgery. The uncertain outcomes included nasal symptoms, bacterial colonization, pulmonary exacerbations, and pulmonary function. Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) reliably reduces nasal obstruction, polyp burden, and sinus infection rates. When ESS is combined with optimal medical therapy—such as long‑term antibiotics, mucolytics, nasal steroids, and newer CFTR‑modulator drugs—there is a modest but consistent improvement in pulmonary outcomes, including higher FEV1 values and fewer pulmonary exacerbations. Surgery alone improves sinonasal quality of life but has a variable impact on lung function; the greatest respiratory benefit is observed when postoperative medical management is aggressive and sustained. We have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (lack of blinding) and the studies were very small. The evidence is up to date to 4 July 2022 of search.",
