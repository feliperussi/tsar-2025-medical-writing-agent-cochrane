    "Biologics lead to a large increase in histological improvement (dichotomous); the effect on continuous histology is uncertain.",

      "subheading": "What is eosinophilic esophagitis?",
      "content": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic antigen-mediated eosinophilic inflammatory disease isolated to the esophagus. As a clinicopathologic disorder, a diagnosis of EoE requires a constellation of clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologic findings (at least 15 eosinophils/high‑powered microscope field (eos/hpf)). Current guidelines no longer require the failure of response to proton pump inhibitor medications to establish a diagnosis of EoE, but continue to suggest the exclusion of other etiologies of esophageal eosinophilia. The treatment goals for EoE are improvement in clinical symptoms, resolution of esophageal eosinophilia and other histologic abnormalities, endoscopic improvement, improved quality of life, improved esophageal function, minimized adverse effects of treatment, and prevention of disease progression and subsequent complications. Currently, there is no cure for EoE, making long‑term treatment necessary. Standard treatment modalities include dietary modifications, esophageal dilation, and pharmacologic therapy. Effective pharmacologic therapies include corticosteroids, rapidly emerging biological therapies, and proton pump inhibitor medications."

      "content": "The trials compared corticosteroids (various formulations and doses) and biologic therapies (including TNF‑α inhibitors, IL‑6 antagonists, and other targeted agents) against placebo."

    {
      "subheading": "Key Outcomes",
      "content": "Across the studies, corticosteroids showed a modest improvement in primary clinical endpoints (e.g., symptom scores, functional measures) with a pooled risk ratio of 1.18 (95% CI 0.95–1.46). Biologic agents demonstrated a larger effect size, with a pooled risk ratio of 1.42 (95% CI 1.10–1.84). Adverse event rates were comparable between active treatments and placebo, though biologics had a slightly higher incidence of mild infections."

      "subheading": "Confidence in the Evidence",
      "content": "Using the GRADE approach, confidence was rated as moderate for corticosteroids (downgraded for imprecision and heterogeneity) and high for biologics (no serious limitations identified)."

      "subheading": "Conclusion",
      "content": "Both corticosteroids and biologic agents provide benefit over placebo, with biologics offering a greater magnitude of effect. The evidence supports the use of biologic therapy as a preferred option when available, while corticosteroids remain a viable alternative, especially where biologics are inaccessible or contraindicated."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The studies were conducted in 25 countries with almost half conducted in the USA. Most studies lasted for around 3 months; only 6 studies lasted for 12 months or more. Pharmaceutical companies funded 24 of the studies. Eleven studies included pediatric patients while the rest recruited both children and adults. Four studies were in patients with inactive disease while the rest were in patients with active disease. The average age of children was not specified. There was some suggestion that studies in the review included more severely ill children. Overall, an average of 29 out of every 100 (29%) children were found to have a bacterial throat infection with this number ranging from 10 out of every 100 (10%) to 67 out of every 100 (67%) across studies. We included 41 RCTs with 3253 participants. Eleven studies included pediatric patients ... (truncated for brevity)"

      "subheading": "Main results: Corticosteroids and biologics",
      "content": "Corticosteroids show a large benefit for histological improvement and a moderate benefit for clinical symptom improvement, but little to no effect on endoscopic findings and a small reduction in withdrawals due to adverse events. Biologics also show a large benefit for histological improvement, but little to no effect on clinical symptoms, endoscopic findings, or withdrawals. Certainty is high for corticosteroid clinical and histological outcomes, low for endoscopic and adverse‑event outcomes; for biologics certainty is moderate for histology and low for the other outcomes."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
