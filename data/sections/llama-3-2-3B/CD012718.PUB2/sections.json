    "Topical silver diamine fluoride (SDF) may help prevent new caries in the primary dentition and root caries, but the evidence is very uncertain for other caries outcome measures in this dentition and in all caries outcomes for coronal surfaces of permanent dentition.",
    "Compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may offer little or no benefit in preventing new caries in the primary dentition, but the evidence is very uncertain for other caries outcome measures in the primary dentition and for preventing new caries in the permanent dentition.",
    "Future research is needed to determine the impact of SDF staining of teeth and to measure the impact of clustering issues within participants, as well as to assess the effects of different approaches to SDF application and compare SDF to other treatments."

      "subheading": "What is dental caries?",
      "content": "Dental caries is the world's most prevalent disease. It is caused by the bacteria in the mouth breaking down food, especially sugars and starches, and leading to tooth decay. If left untreated, dental caries can cause pain and negatively impact psychosocial health, functioning, and nutrition. Common treatments for dental caries include fluoride varnishes, sealants, and fillings."

      "content": "A concise summary describing the key characteristics of the requested data, formatted as a plain string. Topical silver diamine fluoride (SDF) may help prevent new caries in children and adults, but the evidence is very uncertain. SDF probably prevents new root caries, but the evidence is uncertain for other caries outcome measures. The impact of SDF staining of teeth was poorly reported and the evidence for adverse effects is very uncertain. Additional wellâ€‘conducted studies are needed."
