    "Self-management programs for people with visual impairment have little to no effect on improving quality of life, according to low-certainty evidence. (Quality of life refers to how well or poorly a person feels about their health and well-being.)",
    "More research is needed to develop more sensitive measures of quality of life and to assess the benefit of self-management interventions across a broader demographic, including different stages of vision impairment and people with dual-sensory impairment.",
    "Future studies should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as developing more effective self-management interventions for adults with visual impairment."

      "content": "Visual impairment is a significant health concern that affects millions of people worldwide, particularly older adults. It can lead to functional and psychological decline, emphasizing the need for effective self-management interventions. These interventions aim to enhance: to enhance individuals' abilities to manage their condition, maintain daily activities, and improve overall well‑being."

      "content": "The review included 20 studies with 3,151 participants; the median study size was 153 participants (range 30–323). Funding came from one industry source, with the remaining studies supported by research grants or non‑profit organizations. Participants were older adults (mean age 60–84 years) with visual acuity (logMAR) ranging from 0.15 to 1.11. Studies were conducted in Asia (2), Australia (2), Europe (6), and North America (10) across academic medical centers, hospitals, low‑vision clinics, private practices, rehabilitation centers, and Veterans Affairs facilities. Multifaceted self‑management interventions were compared with inactive or active controls such as usual care, wait‑list, optical aids, or low‑vision rehabilitation. No studies were found for adults with dual sensory impairment."

      "subheading": "Main results: Low‑certainty evidence",
      "content": "Low‑certainty evidence suggests that self‑management interventions for adults with visual impairment probably have little to no effect on overall or vision‑related quality of life, and probably do not change the risk of adverse events."
