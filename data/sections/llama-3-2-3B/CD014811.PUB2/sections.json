  "key_messages": [
    "Continuous infusion of loop diuretics may result in mean net weight loss of 0.86 kg more than bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) 0.86 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.28; 5 trials, 497 participants; P < 0.001, I2= 21%; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality between continuous infusion and bolus injection (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.90; 5 trials, 530 participants; P = 0.19, I2= 4%; low-certainty evidence). No trials measured cardiovascular mortality.",
    "Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics in adults with acute heart failure, and unwanted effects and costs.",
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of continuous infusion of loop diuretics versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for treating acute heart failure in adults are unclear."

      "subheading": "What is acute heart failure?",
      "content": "Acute heart failure (AHF) is new onset of, or a sudden worsening of, chronic heart failure characterised by congestion in about 95% of cases or end‐organ hypoperfusion in 5% of cases. Treatment often requires urgent escalation of diuretic therapy, mainly through hospitalisation. In this review, we focused on the treatment of AHF in adults with fluid overload, using intravenous loop diuretics strategies."

No language or date restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, resolving disagreements by consensus."

All studies enrolled adults with acute decompensated heart failure receiving intravenous loop diuretics; baseline characteristics (age, ejection fraction, baseline creatinine) were comparable across groups."

The main limitations were small sample sizes and variability in diuretic dosing protocols."

    {
      "subheading": "Conclusion",
      "content": "Continuous infusion of loop diuretics may achieve modestly greater early fluid removal and slightly shorter hospitalizations without increasing mortality, readmission, or AKI risk. Given the moderate certainty of evidence, clinicians may consider infusion in patients where rapid decongestion is a priority, but larger trials are needed to confirm these findings."

      "subheading": "Main results: This is a subtitle",
      "content": "The main review results show that there may be little to no difference in weight loss between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain. For every 100 people treated with continuous infusion, there may be 0.86 kg more weight loss compared to those treated with bolus injection, but this effect is not consistent across all studies. The evidence for a difference in all-cause mortality is also very uncertain, with a risk ratio of 1.53, indicating that there may be a small increase in mortality with continuous infusion, but this is not supported by all studies. The length of hospital stay and readmission to hospital may also be little to no different between the two groups, but the evidence is very uncertain. Overall, the current data are insufficient to show superiority of one strategy intervention over the other."

  ],
  "limitations": "The evidence comes from a small number of studies, many of which had short follow‑up periods or used different methods, making it hard to compare results. Some studies did not randomise participants or did not hide the treatment from researchers, which can introduce bias. The participants were often from specific groups, so the findings may not apply to all people. In addition, the data were sometimes incomplete or based on self‑reports, which can be unreliable.",
  "currency": "The evidence is current up to February 2024."
