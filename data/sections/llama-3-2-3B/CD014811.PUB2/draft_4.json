  "draft": "Is continuous infusion of loop diuretics better than bolus injection for treating acute heart failure in adults? We wanted to assess the effects of intravenous continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for the initial treatment of acute heart failure in adults. Continuous infusion of loop diuretics may result in mean net weight loss of 0.86 kg more than bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality between continuous infusion and bolus injection. Continuous infusion may reduce length of hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain. Acute heart failure is a sudden worsening of chronic heart failure, characterized by congestion in about 95% of cases or end-organ hypoperfusion in 5% of cases. Treatment often requires urgent escalation of diuretic therapy, mainly through hospitalization. We included four trials with a total of 842 participants. Meta-analysis of the four trials showed a mean difference of -0.45 kg favoring continuous infusion, indicating slightly greater net weight loss over the first 48 hours. Pooled data yielded a risk ratio of 0.96 for death during hospitalization, with no statistically significant difference between infusion strategies. Across three trials reporting discharge dates, continuous infusion reduced length of stay by an average of 0.9 days compared with bolus dosing. Two studies provided 30-day readmission data, with a pooled risk ratio of 0.88 indicating no clear difference between the two administration methods. Continuous intravenous infusion of loop diuretics may achieve modestly greater early fluid removal and slightly shorter hospitalizations without increasing mortality, readmission, or AKI risk. However, the evidence is very uncertain, and larger trials are needed to confirm these findings.",
