  "draft": "**Is home-based asthma education better than usual care for children with asthma?**\n\nWe wanted to find out if home-based asthma education is better than usual care for children with asthma. We looked at 26 studies that compared home-based education to usual care, waiting list, or less-intensive education programs delivered outside the home.\n\n**What is asthma?**\n\nAsthma is a chronic airway condition that affects 262.4 million people worldwide. It causes inflammation and constriction of the airways, leading to symptoms like wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Asthma education is an important part of managing the condition and includes teaching people how to avoid triggers and use their inhalers correctly.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to see if home-based education is better than usual care or less-intensive education programs delivered outside the home for children with asthma. We looked at how home-based education affects asthma-related outcomes like reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing hospitalizations.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nHome-based educational interventions for children with asthma were studied in 26 studies involving 5122 participants. The studies were conducted in various settings, including the home, and compared home-based education to usual care, waiting list, or less-intensive education programs delivered outside the home. The studies included a range of population characteristics, including age (1-18 years) and asthma severity (mild to severe). The interventions varied in terms of content and duration, and some studies focused on specific outcomes, such as hospitalization or quality of life.\n\n**How did home-based education affect asthma-related outcomes?**\n\nThe evidence for the effectiveness of home-based education was generally uncertain. Some studies suggested that home-based education may improve quality of life, but not reduce exacerbations or hospitalization. Overall, the review found that the evidence for home-based education is limited and that further studies are needed to determine its effectiveness.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe evidence is constrained by a small sample size, potential selection bias, reliance on self-reported data, and a lack of longitudinal follow-up, which together limit the generalizability and causal inference of the findings.\n\n**What's next?**\n\nFurther studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of home-based education for children with asthma. We recommend that future studies use standard outcomes from this review and design trials to determine what components of an education program are most important.",
