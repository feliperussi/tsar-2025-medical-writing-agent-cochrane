  "draft": "**Is home-based asthma education better than usual care for children with asthma?**\n\n- Home-based asthma education may improve quality of life compared to usual care, but the evidence is very uncertain. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether home-based education is superior to usual care or less-intensive education delivered outside the home. Larger, well-designed studies are needed to answer these questions.\n- Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as the optimum content and setting for educational interventions in children with asthma.\n- Further studies should use standard outcomes from this review and design trials to determine what components of an education programme are most important.\n\n**What is asthma?**\n\nAsthma is a chronic airway condition with a global prevalence of 262.4 million people. It is a common long-term condition that causes inflammation and constriction of the airways, leading to symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Asthma education is an essential component of management and includes provision of information on the disease process and self-management skills development such as trigger avoidance. Education may be provided in various settings, including the home setting, which allows educators to reach populations that may experience barriers to care, such as transport limitations, within a familiar environment, and allows for avoidance of attendance at healthcare settings. However, it is unknown if education delivered in the home is superior to usual care or the same education delivered elsewhere. There are large variations in asthma education programmes, including patient-specific content versus broad asthma education, number/frequency/duration of education sessions. This is an update of the 2011 review with 14 new studies added.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nWe wanted to assess the effects of educational interventions for asthma, delivered in the home to children, their caregivers, or both, on asthma-related outcomes. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether home-based education is superior to usual care, education delivered outside the home, or a less-intensive educational intervention in terms of reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing hospitalizations.\n\n**Search Strategy**\n\nWe identified studies that compared home-based educational interventions with usual care, external education, or less-intensive home-based programs for children with asthma.\n\n**Data Synthesis**\n\nThe results from the eligible trials were pooled, and effect estimates for asthma-related outcomes (e.g., symptom control, health-care utilization) were calculated.\n\n**Confidence Assessment**\n\nThe certainty of the evidence was judged using factors such as study design, risk of bias, sample size, and consistency, following a systematic grading approach.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nHome-based educational interventions for children with asthma were studied in 26 studies involving 5122 participants. The studies were conducted in various settings, including the home, and compared home-based education to usual care, waiting list, or less-intensive education programs delivered outside the home. The studies included a range of population characteristics, including age (1-18 years) and asthma severity (mild to severe). The interventions varied in terms of content and duration, and some studies focused on specific outcomes, such as hospitalization or quality of life. The evidence for the effectiveness of home-based education was generally uncertain, with some studies suggesting that it may improve quality of life but not reduce exacerbations or hospitalization. Overall, the review found that the evidence for home-based education is limited and that further studies are needed to determine its effectiveness.\n\n**Main results**\n\nHome-based educational interventions for children with asthma may have little to no effect on exacerbations leading to emergency department visits at six-month follow-up compared to control, but the evidence is very uncertain. Home-based education may result in little to no difference in exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids compared to control (low-certainty evidence). Home-based education probably improves quality-of-life scores compared to control (very low-certainty evidence).\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe evidence is constrained by a small sample size, potential selection bias, reliance on self-reported data, and a lack of longitudinal follow-up, which together limit the generalizability and causal inference of the findings.\n\n**e: August 2022; f: The evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.**",
