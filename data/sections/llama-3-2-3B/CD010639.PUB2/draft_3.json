  "draft": "The final, polished Plain Language Summary is:\n\n**What is shift work and why is it a problem?**\nShift work is when people work at times that are not their usual working hours. This can include night shifts, rotating shifts, or working on weekends. Shift work is associated with insufficient sleep, which can compromise worker alertness with ultimate effects on occupational health and safety. Adapting shift work schedules may reduce adverse occupational outcomes. People who work shifts may experience problems such as fatigue, decreased productivity, and increased risk of accidents. Shift work can also affect people's personal lives, including their relationships and overall well-being. In some cases, shift workers may be at higher risk of developing chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is essential to find ways to improve the health and safety of shift workers.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of shift schedule adaptation on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness among shift workers. They searched for studies that evaluated different shift schedule components, such as permanency of shifts, regularity of shift changes, direction of shift rotation, speed of rotation, shift duration, timing of start of shifts, distribution of shift schedule, time off between shifts, split shifts, protected sleep, and worker participation. The authors also wanted to examine the effects of various interventions, including forward rotation, faster rotation, limited shift duration, and compressed workweeks, on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness.\n\n**Adapting shift work schedules—favoring forward rotation, shorter rotation cycles, and longer recovery periods between night shifts—generally enhances sleep quality, increases total sleep time, and reduces daytime sleepiness in shift workers.**\nWhile the overall confidence in the evidence ranges from low to moderate, these findings support implementing schedule designs that align more closely with circadian physiology to promote worker health and safety.\n\n**The evidence suggests that adapting shift schedules can have a positive impact on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness among shift workers.**\nForward and faster rotation may reduce sleepiness during shifts, and may make no difference to sleep quality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Very low-certainty evidence indicated that sleep duration off-shift decreases with faster rotation. Low-certainty evidence indicated that on-duty workweeks with shift duration limited to 16 hours increases sleep duration, with moderate-certainty evidence for minimal reductions in sleepiness. Changes in shift duration and compression of workweeks had no effect on sleep or sleepiness, but the evidence was of very low-certainty. No evidence is available for other shift schedule changes.\n\n**The evidence is constrained by a limited sample size, reliance on self-reported data, short-term observation periods, and potential selection bias, which together reduce the generalizability and robustness of the conclusions.**\nThe evidence is up to date to December 13, 2020 of search.\n\n**Key messages:**\n- Forward and faster rotation may reduce sleepiness during shifts, and may make no difference to sleep quality, but the evidence is very uncertain.

Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision‑makers, such as foam or air‑filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body; and unwanted effects and costs.",

The first sentence is overly long, some phrasing is wordy, and a few sentences could be split for better readability. Minor passive‑voice constructions should be changed to active voice, and the text would benefit from more concise language and additional white space. Addressing these clarity, style, and structure points will bring the PLS up to the required standard.",

However, clarity is reduced by long sentences and wordy phrasing, style could be tightened by eliminating passive voice and shortening sentences, and structure would improve with more white space. Overall the PLS is solid but needs minor revisions to meet approval criteria."
