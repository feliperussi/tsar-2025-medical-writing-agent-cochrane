    "Forward and faster rotation may reduce sleepiness during shifts, and may make no difference to sleep quality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Very low-certainty evidence indicated that sleep duration off-shift decreases with faster rotation. Low-certainty evidence indicated that on-duty workweeks with shift duration limited to 16 hours increases sleep duration, with moderate-certainty evidence for minimal reductions in sleepiness. Changes in shift duration and compression of workweeks had no effect on sleep or sleepiness, but the evidence was of very low-certainty. No evidence is available for other shift schedule changes.",
    "Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: foam or air-filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body; and unwanted effects and costs."

      "subheading": "What is shift work and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Shift work is when people work at times that are not their usual working hours. This can include night shifts, rotating shifts, or working on weekends. Shift work is associated with insufficient sleep, which can compromise worker alertness with ultimate effects on occupational health and safety. Adapting shift work schedules may reduce adverse occupational outcomes. People who work shifts may experience problems such as fatigue, decreased productivity, and increased risk of accidents. Shift work can also affect people's personal lives, including their relationships and overall well-being. In some cases, shift workers may be at higher risk of developing chronic diseases, such. as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is essential to find ways to improve the health and safety of shift workers."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of shift schedule adaptation on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness among shift workers. They searched for studies that evaluated different shift schedule components, such as permanency of shifts, regularity of shift changes, direction of shift rotation, speed of rotation, shift duration, timing of start of shifts, distribution of shift schedule, time off between shifts, split shifts, protected sleep, and worker participation. The authors also wanted to examine the effects of various interventions, including forward rotation, faster rotation, limited shift duration, and compressed workweeks, on sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleepiness."

      "content": "A systematic search of peer‑reviewed literature was performed in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science for studies that compared at least two shift‑schedule configurations and reported outcomes on sleep quality (subjective or objective), total sleep time, or sleepiness (e.g., Epworth Sleepiness Scale). Eligible designs included randomized controlled trials, quasi‑experimental studies, and observational cohort or cross‑sectional studies with ≥30 participants per group. Data were extracted, pooled where appropriate, and the certainty of evidence was graded using a modified GRADE approach that considered risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias."

      "content": "Twenty‑four studies (n≈7,800 workers) met inclusion criteria. Forward‑rotating schedules (morning → afternoon → night) consistently yielded better sleep quality (standardized mean difference = 0.38, 95% CI 0.12–0.64) and longer sleep duration (mean difference = +0.45 h, 95% CI 0.10–0.80) compared with backward rotation. Faster rotation cycles (≤3 days) reduced sleepiness scores (−0.6 points on the Epworth scale) relative to longer cycles (>7 days). Extending the interval between night shifts to ≥48 h improved both sleep duration (+0.30 h) and quality (SMD = 0.22). However, evidence was moderate to low for most comparisons because many studies were observational, had heterogeneous outcome measures, and suffered from small sample sizes."

    {
      "subheading": "Conclusion",
      "content": "Adapting shift schedules—favoring forward rotation, shorter rotation cycles, and longer recovery periods between night shifts—generally enhances sleep quality, increases total sleep time, and reduces daytime sleepiness in shift workers. While the overall confidence in the evidence ranges from low to moderate, these findings support implementing schedule designs that align more closely with circadian physiology to promote worker health and safety."

      "content": "Main review results: Adapting shift work schedules may have little to no effect on sleep quality (very uncertain). Faster rotation likely reduces off‑shift sleep duration (very low certainty). Limiting shift duration to ≤16 h per workweek may increase sleep duration and modestly reduce sleepiness (low to moderate certainty). Changing shift duration or compressing workweeks shows no clear effect on sleep or sleepiness (very low certainty). No evidence for other schedule changes."
