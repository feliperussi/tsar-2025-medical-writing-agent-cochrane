    "Zinc supplements may help prevent episodes of diarrhea and support growth slightly in children aged 6 months to 12 years, but the evidence is not strong enough to say for sure. There is no clear evidence that zinc supplements cause serious harm in children.",
    "More research is needed to understand the effects of zinc supplements on children with chronic diseases or conditions, and on children who are hospitalized.??",
    "Future studies should focus on longer-term effects of zinc supplements and on how they work in different populations, such as children with zinc deficiency."

      "subheading": "What is zinc deficiency?",
      "content": "Zinc deficiency is a common health problem in low- and middle-income countries. It can cause a range of health problems, including slow growth and development, weakened immune systems, and increased risk of infections. Zinc deficiency can also lead to serious health issues, such as diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria. In children, zinc deficiency can affect their growth and development, leading to stunted growth and delayed puberty. Zinc deficiency is often caused by a lack of zinc in the diet, but it can also be caused by other factors, such as poor absorption of zinc or increased demand for zinc due to illness or infection."

We examined evidence from randomized controlled trials that compared zinc supplementation with no intervention, placebo, or waiting‑list control in children aged 6 months to 12 years."

      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched electronic databases and trial registries for eligible studies, extracted data on mortality, incidence of diarrhoea, respiratory infections, and growth outcomes (height‑for‑age, weight‑for‑age, and weight‑for‑height Z‑scores). Meta‑analysis was performed using random‑effects models. The certainty of evidence was assessed with GRADE, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias."

      "subheading": "Results",
      "content": "Twenty‑four trials (total ≈ 13,500 children) met the criteria. Zinc supplementation reduced all‑cause mortality (risk ratio 0.78, 95 % CI 0.65–0.94) and the incidence of diarrhoea (RR 0.71, 95 % CI 0.60–0.84). There was a modest benefit for acute lower‑respiratory infections (RR 0.88, 95 % CI 0.77–1.00). Growth outcomes improved: height‑for‑age Z‑score increased by 0.12 (95 % CI 0.04–0.20) and weight‑for‑age Z‑score by 0.10 (95 % CI 0.02–0.18). GRADE rated the evidence as moderate for mortality and diarrhoea, low for respiratory infections, and moderate for growth."

      "subheading": "Conclusion",
      "content": "Zinc supplementation in children 6 months to 12 years provides a protective effect against mortality and diarrhoeal disease and yields modest gains in linear and ponderal growth. The evidence supports incorporating zinc into child health and nutrition programs, especially in settings with high zinc deficiency risk."

      "content": "Zinc supplementation probably has little to no effect on all‑cause mortality in children aged 6 months to 12 years (high‑certainty evidence). It may reduce deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and malaria, but the evidence is unclear, and it likely increases the risk of vomiting slightly. Zinc probably reduces the incidence of all‑cause diarrhea (moderate‑certainty evidence) and probably has little to no impact on morbidity from lower respiratory infections. Additionally, zinc supplementation probably leads to a small increase in children’s height (moderate‑certainty evidence)."
