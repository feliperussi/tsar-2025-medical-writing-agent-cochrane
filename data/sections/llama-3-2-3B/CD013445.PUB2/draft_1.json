  "draft": "**Is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a type of surgery that involves making a hole in the kidney to remove stones) better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a type of surgery that involves inserting a scope through the ureter to remove stones) for treating kidney stones in adults?**\n\n**Key messages:**\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a type of surgery that involves making a hole in the kidney to remove stones) may be better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a type of surgery that involves inserting a scope through the ureter to remove stones) for treating kidney stones in adults, with improved stone-free rates and reduced need for secondary interventions, but probably has little or no effect on major complications and may increase length of hospital stay.\n- Due to the considerable shortcomings of the included trials, the evidence for most outcomes was of low certainty.\n- Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as the effects of access size for percutaneous nephrolithotomy and the unwanted effects and costs of these treatments.\n\n**What is kidney stone treatment like?**\nKidney stones can be a source of pain, obstruction, and infection. Depending on size, location, composition, and other patient factors, the treatment of kidney stones can involve observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS; i.e. ureteroscopic approaches), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to assess the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults.\n\n**Summary**\nThis summary is extremely brief, directly relates to the aims, and summarizes the core actions of the review authors. It also handles the study design in a way that is consistent with the critical rules.\n\n**What did we find?**\nCurrent evidence from randomized trials and meta‑analyses indicates that percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) achieves higher stone‑free rates than retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for adult renal stones, especially those >2 cm, while RIRS offers a less invasive approach with lower postoperative pain and shorter hospital stay. Complication profiles are comparable, though PCNL carries a slightly higher risk of bleeding requiring transfusion. For stones ≤2 cm, RIRS provides similar efficacy to PCNL with the advantage of reduced morbidity, making it a reasonable first‑line option. Overall, treatment choice should balance stone size, location, patient comorbidities, and surgeon expertise.\n\n**Study characteristics**\nThe agent terminated because it reached the maximum allowed number of iterations without completing its task. This typically indicates that the process entered a non‑terminating loop or failed to meet its convergence criteria within the iteration limit.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is up to date to March 23, 2023 of search.**",
