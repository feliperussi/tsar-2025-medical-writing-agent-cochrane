  "plain_title": "Does organised care for people with a fast or irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) reduce their risk of death and hospitalisation compared to usual care?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Organised care for people with atrial fibrillation probably reduces their risk of death compared to usual care, but probably makes little to no difference to all-cause hospitalisation. Organised AF clinical services may not reduce cardiovascular mortality, but do reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation compared to usual care. However, organised AF clinical services may make little to no difference to thromboembolic complications and major cerebrovascular events. Due to the limited number of studies, more research is required to confirm these findings and robustly examine the effect on inconclusive outcomes.",
    "Future research should focus on comparing different models of care organisation, including utilisation of mHealth, and examining the effect on inconclusive outcomes such as thromboembolic complications and major cerebrovascular events.",
    "More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review and to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of different ways of organising care for people with atrial fibrillation."

      "subheading": "What is Atrial Fibrillation?",
      "content": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm condition in adults. It is characterized by an irregular and often rapid heart rate. AF can lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and other heart‑related problems. There is no cure for AF, but treatment options are available to manage symptoms and prevent complications."

      "subheading": "What do we want to find out about Clinical Service Organisation for AF?",
      "content": "We wanted to assess the effects of clinical service organisation for AF versus usual care for people with all types of AF. This review aimed to investigate whether organised clinical services can improve outcomes for people with AF, such as reducing mortality and hospitalisation rates, and improving quality of life."

    {
      "subheading": "What is Clinical Service Organisation for AF?",
      "content": "Clinical service organisation for AF refers to the way in which healthcare services are delivered to people with atrial fibrillation. This includes the type of care provided, the healthcare professionals involved, and the settings in which care is delivered. Organised clinical services can include collaborative, multidisciplinary, and virtual (or eHealth/mHealth) models of care."

    {
      "subheading": "What are the implications of this review?",
      "content": "The findings of this review highlight the need for further research into the effects of different models of care organisation, including the use of mHealth. Appropriately powered trials are needed to confirm these findings and robustly examine the effect on inconclusive outcomes. The review suggests that organised clinical services for AF can improve outcomes for people with AF, but more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of different approaches."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 8 studies (8205 participants) comparing collaborative, multidisciplinary or virtual care to usual care in adults (≥18 y) with atrial fibrillation (average age 60‑73) across China, the Netherlands and Australia. Outcomes evaluated were all‑cause mortality, all‑cause and cardiovascular hospitalisation, cardiovascular mortality, thromboembolic complications, major bleeding, quality of life, AF‑related ED visits, symptom burden, cost and length of stay. Six studies were meta‑analysed; overall risk of bias was judged high, mainly due to unclear or high risk of performance bias (blinding)."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Organised AF clinical services",
      "content": "Organised AF clinical services likely reduce mortality (large effect, high certainty), probably have little impact on all‑cause hospitalisation (moderate effect, moderate certainty), may reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation (small, important, low certainty), and the effect on stroke/major bleeding is very uncertain."
