    "The body of evidence in this review demonstrates that a range of school-based 'activity' interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short‐ and medium‐term, but not at long‐term follow‐up. Dietary interventions alone may result in little to no difference. Limited evidence of low quality was identified on the effect of dietary and/or activity interventions on severe adverse events and health inequalities; exploratory analyses of these data suggest no meaningful impact. We identified a dearth of evidence for home and community‐based settings (e.g. delivered through local youth groups), for children living with disabilities and indicators of health inequities.",
    "Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: school-based 'activity' interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, for children aged 5 to 11 years old; and unwanted effects and costs associated with these interventions.",
    "More research is needed to determine whether school-based 'activity' interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, can prevent obesity in childhood at long‐term follow‐up, and to identify the most effective interventions for different subgroups of children, such as those living with disabilities."
