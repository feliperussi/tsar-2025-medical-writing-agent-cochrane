  "draft": "**Heading**\nAgent stopped due to max iterations.\n\n**Key Messages**\n- The body of evidence in this review demonstrates that a range of school-based 'activity' interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, may have a modest beneficial effect on obesity in childhood at short‐ and medium‐term, but not at long‐term follow‐up. Dietary interventions alone may result in little to no difference. Limited evidence of low quality was identified on the effect of dietary and/or activity interventions on severe adverse events and health inequalities; exploratory analyses of these data suggest no meaningful impact. We identified a dearth of evidence for home and community‐based settings (e.g. delivered through local youth groups), for children living with disabilities and indicators of health inequities.\n- Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: school-based 'activity' interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, for children aged 5 to 11 years old; and unwanted effects and costs associated with these interventions.\n- More research is needed to determine whether school-based 'activity' interventions, alone or in combination with dietary interventions, can prevent obesity in childhood at long‐term follow‐up, and to identify the most effective interventions for different subgroups of children, such as those living with disabilities.\n\n**Execution Halted**\nThe agent stopped because it reached the maximum number of iterations allowed. This typically occurs when the task cannot be completed within the iteration limit. Consider simplifying the request or breaking it into smaller steps.\n\n**Methods Summary**\nWe searched for studies that compared diet or activity interventions with no intervention, usual care, or another eligible intervention in children aged 5 to 11 years. The identified results were combined, and the confidence in the evidence was assessed.\n\n**What did we find?**\nStudy name: Think8; Parameters: input=\"To assess the effects of interventions that aim to prevent obesity in children by modifying dietary intake or \\\"\"\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence presented is limited by its reliance on self‑reported data, small sample sizes, and a lack of longitudinal follow‑up, which together constrain the generalizability and causal inference of the findings.\n\n**Evidence Currency Statement**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023.",
