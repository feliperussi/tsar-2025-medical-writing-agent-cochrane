  "draft": "**Are different types of dressings and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters (small tubes in a vein) effective in preventing problems?**\n\nPeripheral arterial catheters (ACs) are small tubes inserted into veins in the arm or leg to monitor blood pressure, oxygen levels, and other vital signs. They are also used to administer medications and fluids. Despite their importance, ACs often fail, requiring reinsertion. To prevent this, dressings and securement devices are used to maintain AC function and prevent complications such as infection.\n\n**What do we know?**\n\nWe looked at five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different dressing and securement devices for ACs. The trials involved 1228 participants and 1228 ACs. All the included studies had high risk of bias in one or more domains. We found that using special dressings, such as standard polyurethane with tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, standard polyurethane with sutureless securement devices, or integrated securement dressings, may or may not affect the risk of complications.\n\n**What do the trials say?**\n\nThe trials found that:\n\n*   Using standard polyurethane with tissue adhesive may or may not affect the risk of AC failure.\n*   Bordered polyurethane may or may not make a difference to the risk of AC failure or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).\n*   Standard polyurethane with sutureless securement devices may or may not affect the risk of AC failure or CRBSI.\n*   Integrated securement dressings may or may not make a difference to the risk of AC failure or CRBSI.\n\n**What do the trials tell us about the limitations of the evidence?**\n\nThe trials have several limitations, including:\n\n*   Small sample sizes\n*   Infrequent events\n*   Heterogeneous outcome measurements\n*   Lack of blinding\n*   High risk of bias in one or more domains\n\n**What do the trials suggest?**\n\nThe trials suggest that there is currently limited rigorous RCT evidence available about the relative clinical effectiveness of AC dressing and securement products. Further rigorous RCTs are needed to reduce uncertainty around the use of dressing and securement devices for ACs.\n\n**What do the trials tell us about the benefits and risks of most types of dressings and securement devices?**\n\nThe trials found that using special dressings may or may not affect the risk of complications. This means that the benefits and risks of most types of dressings and securement devices are unclear.\n\n**What do the trials tell us about the importance of further research?**\n\nThe trials suggest that further research is needed to reduce uncertainty around the use of dressing and securement devices for ACs. This includes options and effects that are important to decision‑makers, such as foam or air‑filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body.",
