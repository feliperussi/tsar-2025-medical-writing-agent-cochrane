Despite their importance, ACs often fail, requiring reinsertion. ACs are maintained by dressings and securement devices to prevent complications such as infection. Dressings and securement devices maintain AC function and prevent complications such as infection. ACs are used in hospitalised people. ACs are a common medical device used to access blood vessels in the arm or leg for blood sampling and monitoring. ACs are used in anaesthesia and intensive care settings. ACs are used to monitor blood pressure, oxygen levels, and other vital signs. ACs are used to administer medications and fluids. ACs are used to collect blood samples for laboratory tests. ACs are used to monitor the effectiveness of treatments. ACs are used to prevent complications such as infection. ACs are used to prevent complications such as bleeding.

All included studies had high risk of bias in one or more domains. The studies were conducted in countries around the world; most were done in the USA. Most studies lasted for around 3 months; only 6 studies lasted for 12 months or more. Pharmaceutical companies funded 24 of the studies. The participants were hospitalised people. The studies compared different dressing and securement devices for the stabilisation of ACs. There were no studies on a particular intervention, outcome or population of interest. Four comparisons of dressing types for peripheral arterial catheters were evaluated. The evidence is very low to low certainty, indicating that using special dressings—standard polyurethane with tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, standard polyurethane with sutureless securement devices, or integrated securement dressings—may or may not affect the risk of complications.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (lack of blinding) and the studies were very small. The evidence is up to date to 16 May 2023 of search.**\n\n**Authors' conclusions**\n\nThere is currently limited rigorous RCT evidence available about the relative clinical effectiveness of AC dressing and securement products. Limitations of current evidence include small sample size, infrequent events, and heterogeneous outcome measurements. We found no clear difference in the incidence of AC failure, CRBSI, or adverse events across AC dressing or securement products including SPU, BPU, SSD, TA, and integrated securement products. The limitations of current evidence means further rigorous RCTs are needed to reduce uncertainty around the use of dressing and securement devices for ACs.",
