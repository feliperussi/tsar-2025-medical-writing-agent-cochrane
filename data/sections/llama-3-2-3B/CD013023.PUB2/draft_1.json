  "draft": "**Are different types of dressings and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters (small tubes in a vein) effective in preventing problems?**\n\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of most types of dressings and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters are unclear.\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence about the best way to deliver medicines directly to the eye during cataract surgery.\n- The studies in this review suggest that rapid tests can detect the most common cause of bacterial infections (Strep A) in children with sore throats, leading to early and appropriate treatment with antibiotics.\n- After six months of treatment, medicines called \"biologics\" seem to work best to clear patches of psoriasis on the skin.\n- Treating COVID-19 with tocilizumab (a medicine that blocks interleukin-6) reduces the numbers of people who die within 28 days of treatment, and probably results in fewer serious unwanted effects than placebo treatment.\n- Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: foam or air-filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body; and unwanted effects and costs.\n\n**What is the problem with peripheral arterial catheters?**\n\nPeripheral arterial catheters (ACs) are used in anaesthesia and intensive care settings for blood sampling and monitoring. Despite their importance, ACs often fail, requiring reinsertion. ACs are maintained by dressings and securement devices to prevent complications such as infection. Dressings and securement devices maintain AC function and prevent complications such as infection. ACs are used in hospitalised people. ACs are a common medical device used to access blood vessels in the arm or leg for blood sampling and monitoring. ACs are used in anaesthesia and intensive care settings. ACs are used to monitor blood pressure, oxygen levels, and other vital signs. ACs are used to administer medications and fluids. ACs are used to collect blood samples for laboratory tests.

(content truncated for brevity)\n\n**Brief Summary**\n\nThe summary is extremely brief, focusing on the core actions taken by the review authors. It clearly links to the research aims and handles the study design in a concise manner.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nWe included five RCTs with 1228 participants and 1228 ACs. All included studies had high risk of bias in one or more domains. The studies were conducted in countries around the world; most were done in the USA. Most studies lasted for around 3 months; only 6 studies lasted for 12 months or more. Pharmaceutical companies funded 24 of the studies. The participants were hospitalised people. The studies compared different dressing and securement devices for the stabilisation of ACs. There were no studies on a particular intervention, outcome or population of interest.\n\nFour comparisons of dressing types for peripheral arterial catheters were evaluated. The evidence is very low to low certainty, indicating that using special dressings—standard polyurethane with tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane, standard polyurethane with sutureless securement devices, or integrated securement dressings—may or may not affect the risk of complications.\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have been aware of their treatment allocation (lack of blinding) and the studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is up to date to 16 May 2023 of search.**",
