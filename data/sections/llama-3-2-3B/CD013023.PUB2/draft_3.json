Reduce the high number of passive‑voice constructions and nominalizations, replace noun‑heavy phrasing with active verbs, and break complex sentences into simpler ones. Add clear definitions for technical terms and reorganize the content with explicit headings and paragraph breaks. Streamline wordy phrases to improve readability and bring the text within the desired clarity standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "Word count: 494 (within limit). Sentences: 36. Readability scores are moderate (Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 8.5, Flesch Reading Ease 58.6). However, passive voice (35 instances) and nominalizations (32) are beyond the 90th percentile, and noun usage (188) is at the 90th percentile, indicating heavy noun‑bias. Pronoun usage is very low (1). These metrics confirm the need to shift toward active voice, reduce nominalizations, and increase verb usage for clearer communication."
