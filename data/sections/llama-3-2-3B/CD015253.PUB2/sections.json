      "content": "Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a common condition in young children where fluid accumulates in the middle ear, leading to hearing loss, behavioral issues, and delayed expressive language. Management options include watchful waiting, medical or surgical treatment, and mechanical approaches such as autoinflation, a self‑administered technique that creates positive pressure through the nose and nasopharynx to ventilate the middle ear and promote fluid clearance."

      "subheading": "What is otitis media with effusion (OME)?",
      "content": "OME involves the presence of non‑infectious fluid in the middle ear cavity. It can impair hearing and affect language development, prompting various treatment strategies."

      "subheading": "What are the common treatments for OME?",
      "content": "Standard treatments comprise watchful waiting, pharmacologic therapy, surgical intervention (e.g., tympanostomy tubes), and mechanical methods. Autoinflation is a self‑administered mechanical option that may be used alongside or instead of these approaches."

      "content": "The review included 11 completed studies with a total of 1,036 participants, primarily children aged 3–11 years. Studies were conducted in hospital and community settings across Europe and North America. Autoinflation was compared with no treatment, usually performed 2–3 times daily for 2–12 weeks, with the longest follow‑up lasting 11 weeks. Funding sources varied, including government agencies and private organisations, and results were published in a range of journals and conference proceedings."

      "content": "The evidence suggests that autoinflation may lead to a small improvement in hearing for some children (low certainty), a moderate improvement in disease‑specific quality of life (moderate certainty), may increase ear pain (very low certainty), and may reduce middle‑ear fluid (moderate certainty)."

  "limitations": "The evidence is constrained by several factors, including a small or non‑representative sample size, potential selection or confirmation bias, limited or absent control groups, measurement errors or imprecise instruments, short observation periods that may not capture long‑term effects, and contextual differences that reduce the ability to generalize findings to other populations or settings.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search."
