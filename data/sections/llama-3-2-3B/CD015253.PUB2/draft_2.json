  "draft": "**PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY**\n\n**What is otitis media with effusion (OME)?**\nOME is a common condition in young children where fluid accumulates in the middle ear, leading to hearing loss, behavioral issues, and delayed expressive language.\n\n**What are the management options for OME?**\nManagement options include watchful waiting, medical or surgical treatment, and mechanical approaches such as autoinflation, a self-administered technique that creates positive pressure through the nose and nasopharynx to ventilate the middle ear and promote fluid clearance.\n\n**What is autoinflation?**\nAutoinflation is a self-administered mechanical option that may be used alongside or instead of other approaches to treat OME. It involves creating positive pressure through the nose and nasopharynx to ventilate the middle ear and promote fluid clearance.\n\n**What does the review aim to evaluate?**\nThe review aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of autoinflation for treating OME in children, focusing on improvements in hearing, quality of life, and the reduction of persistent effusion.\n\n**What did the review find?**\nThe review included 11 completed studies with a total of 1,036 participants, primarily children aged 3–11 years. The evidence suggests that autoinflation may lead to a small improvement in hearing for some children (low certainty), a moderate improvement in disease-specific quality of life (moderate certainty), may increase ear pain (very low certainty), and may reduce middle-ear fluid (moderate certainty).\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nThe evidence is constrained by several factors, including a small or non-representative sample size, potential selection or confirmation bias, limited or absent control groups, measurement errors or imprecise instruments, short observation periods that may not capture long-term effects, and contextual differences that reduce the ability to generalize findings to other populations or settings.\n\n**What is the conclusion?**\nOur systematic review suggests that autoinflation may be an effective non-surgical option for otitis media with effusion in children, though the strength of the evidence varies across studies. The potential benefits of autoinflation should be weighed against the inconvenience of regularly carrying out autoinflation, and the possible risk of ear pain.",

Quote: Missing title and question‑style subheadings.\n   Problem: Reduces scannability and fails the critical check for a question‑framed title.\n   Suggested rewrite: Add a title such as \"Can Autoinflation Improve Outcomes for Children with Otitis Media with Effusion?\" and rephrase each subheading as a question.\n5. Structural issue: lack of paragraph breaks and proper bullet formatting.\n   Problem: Creates walls of text and violates formatting guidelines.\n   Suggested rewrite: Insert blank lines between sections, use dash‑style bullets (–), and break long paragraphs into shorter ones.\n\nSupporting Evidence: The draft contains 27 passive constructions, an average sentence length of 17.05 words, a SMOG index of 12.22, a Flesch‑Kincaid grade of 11.79, and a Flesch reading ease score of 40.89, all indicating poor readability and excessive complexity.",

These values exceed typical ranges for patient‑friendly language and contribute to the clarity and style issues identified."
