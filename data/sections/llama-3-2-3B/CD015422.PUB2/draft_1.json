  "draft": "**Do topical repellents help prevent malaria in people living in areas where other mosquito control methods are available?**\n\n**Key messages:**\n- Topical repellents may slightly reduce P falciparum infection and clinical incidence when both outcomes are considered together, but not when considered independently. (Low-certainty evidence)\n- Topical repellents are considered safe, with a very low prevalence of adverse events (0.6%) and limited to mild skin reactions.\n- There is insufficient evidence to conclude that topical repellents can prevent malaria in settings where other vector control interventions are in place.\n- A protective effect was suggested among high-risk populations, specially refugees, who might not have access to other standard vector control measures.\n- More adequately powered clinical trials carried out in refugee camps could provide further information on the potential benefit of topical repellents in this setting.\n- Individually randomized studies are also likely necessary to understand whether topical repellents have an effect on personal protection, and the degree to which diversion to non-protected participants affects overall transmission dynamics.\n- Despite this, the potential additional benefits of topical repellents are most likely limited in contexts where other interventions are available.\n\n**What is the health problem?**\nMalaria is a serious and sometimes life‑threatening disease caused by a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. Insecticide‑based interventions such as long‑lasting insecticide‑treated nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are the backbone of vector control, but they mainly target mosquitoes that feed and rest indoors. Consequently, they have limited ability to prevent outdoor or early‑evening transmission. In low‑endemicity settings, eliminating malaria will require addressing these gaps with complementary tools. Topical repellents could be especially useful for groups that may not benefit fully from standard measures, such as refugees, military personnel, or forest goers.\n\n**What did the researchers want to find out?**\nThe Cochrane Review aims to evaluate whether topical repellents, used alone or together with background interventions (LLINs, IRS, or both), reduce malaria incidence in high‑risk and non‑high‑risk populations living in endemic areas.\n\n**Methods:**\nThe agent reached its configured maximum number of iterations and halted to prevent infinite loops. This typically occurs when the task requires more steps than allowed or when the reasoning does not converge. To resolve, consider increasing the iteration limit, simplifying the task, or breaking it into smaller sub‑tasks.",
