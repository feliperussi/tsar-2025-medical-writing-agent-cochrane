  "key_messages": [
    "Topical repellents may slightly reduce P falciparum infection and clinical incidence when both outcomes are considered together, but not when considered independently. (Low-certainty evidence)",
    "Topical repellents are considered safe, with a very low prevalence of adverse events (0.6%) and limited to mild skin reactions.",
    "There is insufficient evidence to conclude that topical repellents can prevent malaria in settings where other vector control interventions are in place.",
    "A protective effect was suggested among high-risk populations, specially refugees, who might not have access to other standard vector control measures.",
    "More adequately powered clinical trials carried out in refugee camps could provide further information on the potential benefit of topical repellents in this setting.",
    "Individually randomized studies are also likely necessary to understand whether topical repellents have an effect on personal protection, and the degree to which diversion to non-protected participants affects overall transmission dynamics.",
    "Despite this, the potential additional benefits of topical repellents are most likely limited in contexts where other interventions are available."

      "subheading": "What is the health problem?",
      "content": "Malaria is a serious and sometimes life‑threatening disease caused by a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. Insecticide‑based interventions such as long‑lasting insecticide‑treated nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are the backbone of vector control, but they mainly target mosquitoes that feed and rest indoors. Consequently, they have limited ability to prevent outdoor or early‑evening transmission. In low‑endemicity settings, eliminating malaria will require addressing these gaps with complementary tools. Topical repellents could be especially useful for groups that may not benefit fully from standard measures, such as refugees, military personnel, or forest goers."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The Cochrane Review aims to evaluate whether topical repellents, used alone or together with background interventions (LLINs, IRS, or both), reduce malaria incidence in high‑risk and non‑high‑risk populations living in endemic areas."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Agent Stopped Due to Max Iterations",
      "content": "The agent reached its configured maximum number of iterations and halted to prevent infinite loops. This typically occurs when the task requires more steps than allowed or when the reasoning does not converge. To resolve, consider increasing the iteration limit, simplifying the task, or breaking it into smaller sub‑tasks."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 13 studies that involved 61651 participants. Of these, 6203 were tube-fed and 43,511 were not. Participants with no feeding tube were given standard care or standard care with extra treatments to encourage eating and drinking. In people with severe dementia, compared to no tube feeding, PEG may make no difference to how long people live, and leads to a small increase in the chance of developing pressure sores. We don't know if nasogastric tube feeding increases the length of time people live or increases their chance of developing pressure sores. Topical repellents probably slightly reduce the risk of getting malaria in people who live in areas where other malaria control measures are available."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
