  "draft": "**Heading**\nAgent stopped due to max iterations.\n\n**Key Messages**\n- The review found that education support interventions may slightly improve mental health, measured as self-esteem, in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, but the overall certainty of evidence for this outcome was 'low'. There is no clear evidence that education support improves school engagement or academic achievement in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of most types of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions are unclear.\n- Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as educational support interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of children and adolescents with different types of chronic health conditions, and unwanted effects and costs associated with these interventions.\n\n**Background**\nChronic health conditions in children and adolescents can have a significant impact on their education, well-being, and overall health. These conditions are long-lasting and rarely cured, often limiting a child's ability to attend school regularly. Regular school attendance is essential for academic progress, social skill development, and general well-being. When chronic illness leads to absenteeism, school engagement may suffer, resulting in poorer academic achievement, reduced social-emotional functioning, and limited future career options.\n\n**Aims**\nThe purpose of this review is to describe the range of educational support interventions that are provided to children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, and to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement.\n\n**Brief Summary**\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, identified relevant studies, and applied the predefined critical rules to assess study designs. They extracted core actions, synthesized findings across randomized and observational studies, and presented conclusions that directly address the review's objectives.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 4 randomised controlled studies with a combined total of 359 participants. All included studies were disease-specific; three studies focused on children with cancer, and one study focused on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The studies were conducted in eight electronic databases and five grey literature trials registers and databases. The interventions were education support services, and the outcomes were school engagement and academic achievement.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Evidence Currency Statement**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 25, 2021 of search.",
