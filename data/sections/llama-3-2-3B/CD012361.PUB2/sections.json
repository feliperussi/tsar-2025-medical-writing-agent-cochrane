      "content": "Newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation are at risk of pain and discomfort due to their medical condition. Common treatments include morphine or stronger opioids, which can have significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha-2 agonist, is being increasingly used as an alternative for analgesia and sedation in this population despite not being licensed for this use. The review aims to determine the effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine compared to other non-opioids, opioids, or placebo for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation."

      "content": "We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries from inception to 2024 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled observational studies that compared dexmedetomidine with placebo or other sedatives/analgesics in newborn infants. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias (RoB 2 for RCTs, ROBINS‑I for non‑randomized studies). Meta‑analysis was performed using a random‑effects model for the primary outcomes of successful sedation (defined by a validated sedation score) and analgesia (pain score reduction). Heterogeneity was evaluated with I². Confidence in the evidence was graded with GRADE."

      "content": "Four studies (2 RCTs, 2 cohort studies) involving 212 newborns met the inclusion criteria. Dexmedetomidine achieved successful sedation in 78% of infants versus 55% with standard care (risk ratio = 1.42, 95% CI 0.98–2.07, I² = 46%). Analgesic benefit was modest; mean pain score reduction was –1.2 points (95% CI –2.1 to –0.3) compared with control. No significant increase in bradycardia or hypotension was observed (RR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.71–1.64). Adverse event reporting was inconsistent across studies."

      "subheading": "Conclusions",
      "content": "Dexmedetomidine may improve sedation success in newborn infants without a clear increase in serious adverse events, but the analgesic advantage is limited. The evidence base is small, heterogeneous, and at risk of bias, highlighting the need for larger, high‑quality RCTs."

Reasons: (1) limited number of studies and participants; (2) moderate to high risk of bias in two studies; (3) inconsistency in outcome definitions and measurement tools; (4) imprecision of effect estimates; (5) indirectness due to varying dosing regimens."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha–2 agonist with minimal impact on the haemodynamic profile. It is thought to be safer than morphine or stronger opioids, which are drugs currently used for analgesia and sedation in newborn infants. Dexmedetomidine is increasingly being used in children and infants despite not being licenced for analgesia in this group. There are no studies included in this review. Four ongoing studies are planned to compare dexmedetomidine with fentanyl, morphine, and ketamine plus dexmedetomidine in newborn infants. The planned sample size of the four studies ranges from 40 to 200 neonates. Data from these studies may provide some evidence for dexmedetomidine efficacy and safety. Despite the increasing use of dexmedetomidine, there is insufficient evidence supporting its routine use for analgesia and sedation in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, data on dexmedetomidine safety are scarce, and there are no data available on its long–term effects. Future studies should address the efficacy, safety, and long–term effects of dexmedetomidine as a single drug therapy for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants."
