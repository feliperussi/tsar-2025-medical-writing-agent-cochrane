    "Favipiravir may not be effective in treating COVID-19, and its use may lead to an increased incidence of adverse events, but it may not result in serious adverse events.",
    "The quality of evidence for the effectiveness of favipiravir in treating COVID-19 is very low to low due to a lack of robust studies and high risk of bias.",
    "More research is needed to determine the benefits and risks of favipiravir in treating COVID-19? Wait ensure correct: More research is needed to determine the benefits and risks of favipiravir in treating COVID-19, particularly in different populations and with different treatment durations."

The aim is to synthesize existing evidence on its efficacy and safety compared with no treatment, supportive care, or other experimental antivirals, and to inform clinicians and policymakers about its utility in managing acute SARS‑CoV‑2 infection."

      "content": "COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the SARS‑CoV‑2 virus. It can lead to severe illness, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. The pandemic has caused widespread illness and death globally, placing a significant burden on healthcare systems and societies. Favipiravir, an antiviral medication, has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19, but its effectiveness and safety are unclear."

      "content": "The included studies were 25 trials that randomized 5750 adults (most under 60 years of age). The trials were conducted in 12 countries, including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and the UK. Most participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%). The studies were conducted over a period of 5 to 14 days. No information was available on the funding sources of the included studies. The population characteristics were not described in the abstract. The included studies compared favipiravir to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatment. No studies were found on the use of favipiravir in people with severe COVID-19 or in children. No information was available on the use of favipiravir in people with underlying medical conditions or in older adults. The query concerns the use of favipiravir for treating COVID-19."
