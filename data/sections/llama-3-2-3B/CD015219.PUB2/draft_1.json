  "draft": "**Does favipiravir help people with COVID-19 get better, and is it safe to use? (A medicine to treat COVID-19, also known as coronavirus disease 2019.)**\n\n- Favipiravir may not be effective in treating COVID-19, and its use may lead to an increased incidence of adverse events, but it may not result in serious adverse events.\n- The quality of evidence for the effectiveness of favipiravir in treating COVID-19 is very low to low due to a lack of robust studies and high risk of bias.\n- More research is needed to determine the benefits and risks of favipiravir in treating COVID-19, particularly in different populations and with different treatment durations.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims**\n\nThis review examines the potential role of favipiravir, an antiviral medication, in the treatment of COVID-19. The aim is to synthesize existing evidence on its efficacy and safety compared with no treatment, supportive care, or other experimental antivirals, and to inform clinicians and policymakers about its utility in managing acute SARS‑CoV‑2 infection.\n\n**What is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?**\n\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the SARS‑CoV‑2 virus. It can lead to severe illness, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. The pandemic has caused widespread illness and death globally, placing a significant burden on healthcare systems and societies. Favipiravir, an antiviral medication, has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19, but its effectiveness and safety are unclear.\n\n**What did the researchers want to find out?**\n\nThe researchers aimed to assess the effects of favipiravir compared to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatments in people with acute COVID-19.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\n\nThe review authors wanted to determine whether favipiravir is effective in treating people with COVID-19, regardless of severity or admission status, and whether it results in an increased incidence of adverse events.\n\n**Objective**\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir in treating individuals with COVID‑19 illness by reviewing randomized controlled trials.\n\n**Methods**\n\nStandard Cochrane methodological procedures were applied for data collection and analysis, including systematic searching, selection, risk‑of‑bias assessment, and meta‑analysis where appropriate.\n\n**Evidence Assessment**\n\nThe certainty of evidence for each outcome was appraised using the GRADE approach, providing transparent judgments on the quality of the evidence.\n\n**The included studies were 25 trials that randomized 5750 adults (most under 60 years of age). The trials were conducted in 12 countries, including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and the UK. Most participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%). The studies were conducted over a period of 5 to 14 days. No information was available on the funding sources of the included studies. The population characteristics were not described in the abstract. The included studies compared favipiravir to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatment. No studies were found on the use of favipiravir in people with severe COVID-19 or in children. No information was available on the use of favipiravir in people with underlying medical conditions or in older adults. The query concerns the use of favipiravir for treating COVID-19.**\n\n**We have little confidence in the evidence because It is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because The studies were very small.**\n\n**The evidence is up to date to 18 July 2023 of search.**",
