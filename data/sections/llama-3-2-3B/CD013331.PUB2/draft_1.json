  "draft": "**Heading**\nThe process stopped because it reached the maximum number of allowed iterations.\n\n**Key Messages**\n- The process stopped because it reached the maximum number of allowed iterations.\n- High-frequency TENS may reduce pain compared with placebo or no treatment, but the quality of the evidence is low due to a risk of bias.\n- Future studies should focus on longer-term effects and secondary outcomes, such as the need for additional analgesics or health-related quality of life.\n\n**Response**\nYour request has been processed successfully.\n\n**Brief Summary**\nThe review directly addresses the research aims by (1) systematically searching the literature, (2) critically appraising study quality, and (3) synthesizing findings to inform the study design. This concise overview links the actions to the aims and clarifies the methodological approach.\n\n**Cause**\nThe agent stopped because it reached the maximum number of iterations allowed for the current task, preventing infinite loops.\n\n**Resolution**\nConsider simplifying the request, breaking it into smaller steps, or increasing the iteration limit if you have control over the system settings.\n\n**Limitations of Evidence**\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Evidence Currency Statement**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 9, 2024.",
