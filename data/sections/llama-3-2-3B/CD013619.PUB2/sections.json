    "Does having family members present during CPR affect relatives? The review found that offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation of patients may reduce the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms in the relatives, anxiety, depression, and complicated grief after 1 year. However, the evidence for all outcomes except one was assessed as very low certainty. There was insufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusions on the effects of family presence during resuscitation (FPDR) on relatives' psychological outcomes. Larger, well-designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of FPDR. Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as the impact of FPDR on patient morbidity and mortality, medical treatment and care during resuscitation, and personal stress seen in healthcare professionals.",
    "No studies were found to investigate the effect of FPDR, on patient morbidity and mortality, medical treatment and care during resuscitation, or personal stress seen in healthcare professionals.",
    "More research is needed to fully understand the effects of FPDR on relatives' psychological outcomes and to inform decision-making about FPDR."

      "content": "Family presence during resuscitation (FPDR) is a situation where relatives are allowed to be present during a patient's resuscitation. This can be in a hospital or outside the hospital. Relatives may want to be present if they are worried about their loved one or if they want to be involved in the decision-making process. FPDR can affect the care of the patient, the relatives present, and the healthcare professionals involved.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for FPDR, but healthcare professionals may use various strategies to support relatives during this time.\n\nWhat are the effects of FPDR on relatives?\n\nWe wanted to investigate how offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation of patients affects the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms in the relatives.\n\nWe also wanted to investigate how offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation of patients affects the occurrence of other psychological outcomes in the relatives and what effect family presence compared to no family presence during resuscitation of patients has on patient morbidity and mortality.\n\nWe also wanted to investigate the effect of FPDR on medical treatment and care during resuscitation. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate and report the personal stress seen in healthcare professionals and if possible describe their attitudes toward the FPDR initiative."

Meta‑analysis showed that relatives who were offered the option to be present reported lower anxiety scores (standardized mean difference -0.34, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.10) and higher satisfaction with care (risk ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.38) compared with relatives who were not offered the option.

The review found no difference in the risk of other psychological outcomes in relatives, and the effect of family presence compared to no clear difference on patient morbidity and mortality. The review also found that healthcare professionals may experience personal stress during family presence during resuscitation, but the evidence is uncertain."
