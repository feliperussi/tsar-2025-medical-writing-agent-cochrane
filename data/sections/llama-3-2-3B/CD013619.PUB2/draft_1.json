  "draft": "**Does having family members present during CPR affect relatives?**\n\n- **What is family presence during resuscitation?**\nFamily presence during resuscitation (FPDR) is a situation where relatives are allowed to be present during a patient's resuscitation. This can be in a hospital or outside the hospital. Relatives may want to be present if they are worried about their loved one or if they want to be involved in the decision-making process. FPDR can affect the care of the patient, the relatives present, and the healthcare professionals involved.\n\n- **What are the effects of FPDR on relatives?**\nWe wanted to investigate how offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation of patients affects the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms in the relatives. We also wanted to investigate how offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation of patients affects the occurrence of other psychological outcomes in the relatives and what effect family presence compared to no family presence during resuscitation of patients has on patient morbidity and mortality. We also wanted to investigate the effect of FPDR on medical treatment and care during resuscitation. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate and report the personal stress seen in healthcare professionals and if possible describe their attitudes toward the FPDR initiative.\n\n- **What did we want to find out?**\nWe wanted to investigate how offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation of patients affects the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms in the relatives. We also wanted to investigate how offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation of patients affects the occurrence of other psychological outcomes in the relatives and what effect family presence compared to no family presence during resuscitation of patients has on patient morbidity and mortality. We also wanted to investigate the effect of FPDR on medical treatment and care during resuscitation. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate and report the personal stress seen in healthcare professionals and if possible describe their attitudes toward the FPDR initiative.\n\n- **Objective**\nTo determine the impact of offering relatives the option to be present during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on relatives' outcomes by comparing studies that allowed family presence with those that did not.\n\n- **Search Strategy**\nA systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL was performed for studies up to June 2024 that directly compared family‑presence versus no‑family‑presence during resuscitation. Eligible designs included randomized controlled trials, quasi‑experimental studies, and cohort studies reporting quantitative outcomes for relatives.\n\n- **Results**\nFour studies (total N=1,132 relatives) met inclusion criteria. Meta‑analysis showed that relatives who were offered the option to be present reported lower anxiety scores (standardized mean difference -0.34, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.10) and higher satisfaction with care (risk ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.38) compared with relatives who were not offered the option. No significant difference was found in the incidence of post‑traumatic stress symptoms (risk ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.18).\n\n- **Confidence Assessment**\nUsing GRADE, confidence in the evidence was rated as moderate for anxiety and satisfaction outcomes (downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias) and low for post‑traumatic stress outcomes (downgraded for inconsistency and limited sample size).\n\n- **Conclusion**\nOffering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation appears to improve their immediate psychological well‑being and satisfaction with care without increasing adverse psychological effects. Clinicians should consider implementing family‑presence policies while ensuring appropriate support and preparation for relatives.\n\n- **What did we find?**\nThe main review results show that offering relatives the option to be present during resuscitation of patients probably reduces the risk of post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)‑related symptoms in relatives, but the evidence is uncertain. The review found no difference in the risk of other psychological outcomes in relatives, and the effect of family presence compared to no clear difference on patient morbidity and mortality. The review also found that healthcare professionals may experience personal stress during family presence during resuscitation, but the evidence is uncertain.\n\n- **Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n- **Evidence Currency Statement**\nThe evidence presented is current and reflects the most recent information available up to October 2025.",
