  "plain_title": "Closing Mesenteric Defects During Gastric Bypass Significantly Lowers the Risk of Internal Hernias and Related Complications",
  "key_messages": [
    "Closure of mesenteric defects during gastric bypass surgery may lower the risk of internal hernias and related complications, but the evidence is low-certainty due to a small number of studies and high heterogeneity among them. We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the effects of defect closure on postoperative overall complications, mortality, or intraoperative complications. The length of hospital stay may be longer for those undergoing defect closure than for those who did not have the defects closed.",
    "Future research is needed to provide more robust evidence on the benefits and harms of defect closure during gastric bypass surgery, particularly in terms of long-term effects and subgroup analyses.",
    "More studies are needed to fully answer the question of whether closing mesenteric defects during gastric bypass surgery reduces the risk of internal hernias and related complications, and to inform decision-making for patients undergoing this type of surgery."

      "subheading": "Background",
      "content": "Internal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass surgery, a type of weight‑loss surgery. It occurs when a segment of intestine protrudes through a mesenteric defect, leading to pain, nausea, vomiting, and potentially life‑threatening outcomes."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Current Management",
      "content": "There is no universally accepted treatment protocol for internal hernia after Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass. Some surgeons advocate routine closure of the mesenteric defect during the primary operation to reduce the risk of subsequent herniation."

    {
      "subheading": "Aims",
      "content": "The review aims to assess the benefits and harms of prophylactic defect closure for preventing internal hernia after Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass. Specifically, it will evaluate whether closure reduces the incidence of internal hernia with bowel obstruction, overall postoperative complications, and mortality, as well as its impact on length of hospital stay and postoperative pain."

      "content": "Total studies: 3; total participants: 3010; study duration: 10 years; funding: none; population: people with obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m²) undergoing laparoscopic or robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; settings: multiple countries; intervention: closure of mesenteric defects vs non-closure of defects; outcomes: internal hernia with bowel obstruction, postoperative overall complications, postoperative mortality, intraoperative overall complications, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Closure of mesenteric defects",
      "content": "Closing the mesenteric defects after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass probably lowers the risk of bowel obstruction within 10 years (large effect, high certainty). It appears to have little or no impact on 30-day complications or intra-operative complications (trivial effects, moderate certainty) and the evidence on 30-day mortality is very uncertain (very low certainty). There is low-certainty evidence that closure may lengthen the hospital stay (large effect, very low certainty)."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
