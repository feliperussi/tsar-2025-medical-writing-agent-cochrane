  "draft": "**Heading**\nClosing Mesenteric Defects During Gastric Bypass Significantly Lowers the Risk of Internal Hernias and Related Complications\n\n**Background**\nInternal hernia is a serious complication that can occur after Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass surgery, a type of weight‑loss surgery. It occurs when a segment of intestine protrudes through a mesenteric defect, leading to pain, nausea, vomiting, and potentially life‑threatening outcomes.\n\n**Current Management**\nThere is no universally accepted treatment protocol for internal hernia after Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass. Some surgeons advocate routine closure of the mesenteric defect during the primary operation to reduce the risk of subsequent herniation.\n\n**Aims**\nThe review aims to assess the benefits and harms of prophylactic defect closure for preventing internal hernia after Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass. Specifically, it will evaluate whether closure reduces the incidence of internal hernia with bowel obstruction, overall postoperative complications, and mortality, as well as its impact on length of hospital stay and postoperative pain.\n\n**What did we find?**\nTotal studies: 3; total participants: 3010; study duration: 10 years; funding: none; population: people with obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m²) undergoing laparoscopic or robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; settings: multiple countries; intervention: closure of mesenteric defects vs non-closure of defects; outcomes: internal hernia with bowel obstruction, postoperative overall complications, postoperative mortality, intraoperative overall complications, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain.\n\n**Main results: Closure of mesenteric defects**\nClosing the mesenteric defects after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass probably lowers the risk of bowel obstruction within 10 years (large effect, high certainty). It appears to have little or no impact on 30-day complications or intra-operative complications (trivial effects, moderate certainty) and the evidence on 30-day mortality is very uncertain (very low certainty). There is low-certainty evidence that closure may lengthen the hospital stay (large effect, very low certainty).\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Evidence currency statement**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2024.",

Complex medical terminology is broken into shorter sentences, technical jargon is simplified, and paragraph breaks improve readability. The use of active voice is more consistent, and sentence length is generally reduced, making the text accessible to non‑medical readers. Minor improvements could include further shortening the “Main results” paragraph and ensuring uniform terminology (e.g., using either “mesenteric defect evaluation” or “defect closure” consistently). Overall, the draft meets the required standards.",
