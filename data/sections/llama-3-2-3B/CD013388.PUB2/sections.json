    "The review found that cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage everyday activities targeted in the intervention (CR is a personalised, solution-focused approach that aims to enable people with mild-to-moderate dementia to manage everyday activities and maintain as much independence as possible).",
    "The available evidence suggests that CR can form a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming some of the everyday barriers imposed by cognitive and functional difficulties. However, more high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings and to identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.",
    "Future research should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as the use of CR in combination with other interventions, and the potential unwanted effects and costs of CR."
