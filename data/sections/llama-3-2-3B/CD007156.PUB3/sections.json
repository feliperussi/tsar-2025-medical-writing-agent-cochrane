      "subheading": "What is oral submucous fibrosis?",
      "content": "Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease of the oral cavity that causes progressive constriction of the cheeks and mouth, accompanied by severe pain and reduced mouth opening. OSF has a significant impact on eating and swallowing, affecting quality of life. There is an increased risk of oral malignancy in people with OSF. The main risk factor for OSF is areca nut chewing, and the mainstay of treatment has been behavioural interventions to support habit cessation."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "Antioxidants and pentoxifylline may provide a small improvement in mouth opening (3‑6 months) and reduce burning sensation in oral submucous fibrosis, but the supporting evidence is of low certainty. Other treatments lack clear evidence of benefit. No interventions showed a significant effect on quality of life, and reported adverse effects were generally mild and transient, though evidence is uncertain. More high‑quality, adequately powered trials focusing on participant‑reported outcomes are needed."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
