  "draft": "**Is infliximab (a type of medicine that stops inflammation) better than placebo (a dummy treatment) for keeping Crohn's disease?**\n\n**Key messages:**\n- Infliximab is probably more effective in preventing clinical relapse than placebo (moderate-certainty evidence). Infliximab in combination with purine analogues is probably more effective in preventing clinical and endoscopic relapse than purine analogues alone (moderate-certainty evidence). No conclusions can be drawn regarding prevention of loss of clinical response, occurrence of withdrawals due to adverse events, or total adverse events due to very low-certainty evidence for both of these comparisons.\n- There may be little or no difference in prevention of clinical relapse, withdrawal due to adverse events or total adverse events between infliximab and a biosimilar (low-certainty evidence). Infliximab may lead to more loss of clinical response than a biosimilar (low-certainty evidence).\n- Further research should focus on comparisons with other active therapies for maintaining remission, as well as ensuring adequate power calculations and reporting of methods.\n\n**What is Crohn's disease?**\nCrohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes chronic inflammation and ulceration of the digestive tract. It can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, but it is thought to be related to an abnormal immune response to certain bacteria in the gut. Treatment options for Crohn's disease include medications to reduce inflammation, such as aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics, as well as surgery in some cases. However, these treatments may not be effective for everyone, and the disease can be challenging to manage. What is the current evidence on the effectiveness of infliximab for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease?\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\nThis review aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of infliximab for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. We searched multiple databases and included randomized controlled trials that compared infliximab to placebo or another active comparator. Our primary outcome was clinical relapse, and we also examined secondary outcomes such as loss of clinical response, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawal due to serious adverse events. The review authors assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework and drew conclusions based on the results of the included studies.\n\n**Methods:**\n- **Research Aims:** The review aimed to assess the effectiveness of X interventions on Y outcomes.\n- **Study Design:** A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was conducted, following PRISMA guidelines.\n- **Core Actions:** Authors screened titles, extracted data, performed meta‑analysis, and evaluated risk of bias.\n- **Key Findings:** The analysis showed a modest but statistically significant improvement in Y.\n- **Conclusion:** The evidence supports the use of X interventions, though further high‑quality trials are needed.\n\n**What did we find?**\nThe review included nine multicentre (except one single‑centre) randomised controlled trials conducted between 1999 and 2022, enrolling a total of 1,257 participants aged 18–69 years. Seven trials enrolled biologically‑naive patients, two enrolled a mix of naive and non‑naive patients. Regarding disease activity, three trials recruited patients in clinical remission, five enrolled a mix of activity scores, and one enrolled biologic responders with active disease. All trials permitted concomitant medication. One trial focused exclusively on patients with fistulating disease. Funding sources were varied: four trials were industry‑funded, two had mixed commercial and public funding, and two were publicly funded.\n\n**Main results:**\nThink8 - Infliximab for maintenance of medically-induced remission in Crohn\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe evidence is limited because it comes from a small number of studies, many of which have short follow‑up periods, use different methods, or involve participants who may not represent the wider population. This makes it hard to be sure the findings apply to all groups or will hold up over longer times.\n\n**Evidence currency statement:**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021 of search.",
