These issues would confuse readers. Style metrics also indicate poor readability: 27 passive constructions, Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 30.9, Gunning‑Fog 22.9, etc. Suggested fixes include adding brief definitions, breaking long sentences, inserting a clear introductory paragraph, and aligning efficacy statements with certainty level.",
