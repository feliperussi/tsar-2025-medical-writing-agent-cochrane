  "key_messages": [
    "Using different types of nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, and nasal spray) may be more effective for quitting smoking than using a single type, with combination NRT (fast-acting form plus patch) showing higher long-term quit rates. However, the evidence is not clear on the best dose, duration, or timing of NRT use, and more research is needed to ensure the robustness of these findings.",
    "There is some indication that lower-dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher-dose products, but this is not well established. Using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates, but further research is needed to confirm this finding.",
    "More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of different types of NRT, as well as the effects of longer-term treatment and the comparative safety and tolerability of different NRT use."

      "content": "Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation are unclear. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes, helping to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and ease the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Although there is high-certainty evidence that NRT is effective for achieving long-term smoking abstinence, it is unclear whether different forms, doses, durations of treatment or timing of use impacts its effects."

      "content": "Technical terms in examples have been explained earlier in the summary. Findings: 1) High-certainty evidence: Using combination nicotine replacement therapy (patches and gum) is probably better than using a single form; about 127 per 100 people succeed versus 117 with single NRT, 109 with patches only, 90 with gum only. 2) Moderate-certainty evidence (preloading): Using NRT before quitting probably improves long‑term cessation; about 125 per 100 succeed versus 121 when started after quitting, with little difference between timing. 3) Moderate-certainty evidence (dose): A 42/44 mg patch is probably as effective as a 21/22 mg patch; about 109 per 100 succeed versus 105, with little difference. 4) Low-certainty evidence (duration): Little to no difference between short and longer patch use; about 105 per 100 vs 104, but evidence is weak. 5) Very low-certainty evidence (fast‑acting type): Unclear whether gum vs lozenge makes a difference; about 102 per 100 vs 101, very uncertain."
