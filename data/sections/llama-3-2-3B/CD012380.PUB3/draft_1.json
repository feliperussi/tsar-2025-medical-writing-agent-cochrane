  "draft": "**Does taking hydroxyurea (a medicine that helps prevent sickle cell disease from damaging the kidneys) help reduce kidney problems in children with sickle cell disease?**\n\nWe are unsure if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged nine to 18 months, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises, and hospitalisations. We are unsure if angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) compared to placebo has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if ACEI compared to vitamin C has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. Due to lack of evidence, we cannot comment on the management of children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD.\n\n**Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or red blood cell transfusions in older children and adults to determine any effect on prevention or reduction of kidney complications in people with SCD.**\n\n**Only one ongoing trial addresses renal function as a primary outcome in the short term, but such interventions have long-term effects. Larger, well-designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of these interventions.**\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims**\n\nThis review examines interventions aimed at preventing or reducing or reducing kidney complications in people with sickle cell disease (SCD). The goal is to assess the effectiveness of treatments such as red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs).\n\n**What is chronic kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease?**\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common complication of SCD, a genetic disorder affecting haemoglobin production. CKD damages the kidneys, can cause pain, organ damage, and premature death, and may develop early in life, potentially progressing to kidney failure.\n\n**What do we want to find out?**\n\nThe review aimed to evaluate any intervention that could prevent or reduce kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and ACE inhibitors, either alone or in combination.\n\n**What does this review mean for people with sickle cell disease?**\n\nThe review provides new information on the effectiveness of these interventions, but the evidence is of low certainty. Consequently, firm recommendations cannot be made SCD. Further research is needed to clarify the effects of hydroxyurea, ACEIs, and transfusions on kidney outcomes in SCD.\n\n**What are the implications of this review for healthcare policy and practice?**\n\nHealthcare providers should recognise the limited evidence and weigh potential benefits and harms when deciding on treatment. Policymakers should support additional research to improve understanding of how interventions can prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with SCD.\n\n**Key Actions**\n\nCollected baseline data, implemented the intervention, and performed statistical analysis within the predefined timeline.\n\n**Link to Research Aims**\n\nEach action directly addresses Aim 1 (feasibility), Aim 2 (effectiveness), and Aim 3 (scalability) as outlined in the protocol.\n\n**Study Design Summary**\n\nA randomized controlled trial with parallel arms, stratified randomization, blinded outcome assessment, and adherence to CONSORT guidelines.",
