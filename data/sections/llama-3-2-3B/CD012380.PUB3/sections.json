  "key_messages": [
    "Does taking hydroxyurea (a medicine that helps prevent sickle cell disease from damaging the kidneys) help reduce kidney problems in children with sickle cell disease? We are unsure if hydroxyurea improves glomerular filtration rate or reduces hyperfiltration in children aged nine to 18 months, but it may improve their ability to concentrate urine and may make little or no difference to the incidence of acute chest syndrome, painful crises, and hospitalisations. We are unsure if angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) compared to placebo has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. We are unsure if ACEI compared to vitamin C has any effect on preventing or reducing kidney complications in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. Due to lack of evidence, we cannot comment on the management of children aged over 18 months or adults with any known genotype of SCD.",
    "Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or red blood cell transfusions in older children and adults to determine any effect on prevention or reduction of kidney complications in people with SCD.",
    "Only one ongoing trial addresses renal function as a primary outcome in the short term, but such interventions have long-term effects. Larger, well-designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of these interventions."

      "content": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common complication of SCD, a genetic disorder affecting haemoglobin production. CKD damages the kidneys, can cause pain, organ damage, and premature death, and may develop early in life, potentially progressing to kidney failure."

      "subheading": "What do we want to find out?",
      "content": "The review aimed to evaluate any intervention that could prevent or reduce kidney complications or CKD in people with SCD, including red blood cell transfusions, hydroxyurea, and ACE inhibitors, either alone or in combination."

      "subheading": "What does this review mean for people with sickle cell disease?",
      "content": "The review provides new information on the effectiveness of these interventions, but the evidence is of low certainty. Consequently, firm recommendations cannot be made SCD. Further research is needed to clarify the effects of hydroxyurea, ACEIs, and transfusions on kidney outcomes in SCD."

      "subheading": "What are the implications of this review for healthcare policy and practice?",
      "content": "Healthcare providers should recognise the limited evidence and weigh potential benefits and harms when deciding on treatment. Policymakers should support additional research to improve understanding of how interventions can prevent or reduce kidney complications in people with SCD."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 3 studies involving 385 participants. The studies lasted for up to 6 months. No information is available on the funding sources of the studies. The studies involved children and adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. The studies compared hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and vitamin C to placebo. No studies were found on red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions. The studies were conducted in multiple countries. The age range of the participants was not specified. The studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, but no specific information is available. The studies were limited by a lack of adequately designed and powered studies, although four ongoing trials were identified since the last version of this review."

      "subheading": "Main results: Uncertain evidence for improving overall kidney function",
      "content": "Hydroxyurea compared with placebo in children with sickle cell disease shows uncertain evidence for improving overall kidney function, though it may help the kidneys concentrate urine; it probably has little or no impact on acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospitalizations. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) versus placebo in adults with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria provide uncertain benefit for preventing or reducing kidney complications, and the same uncertainty applies to ACEIs versus vitamin C in children with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. No studies have evaluated red blood cell transfusions or combined interventions for kidney outcomes in people with sickle cell disease."

  "limitations": "The evidence may be limited by factors such as small sample sizes, selection bias, measurement error, lack of longitudinal data, reliance on self-reported information, and contextual variables that were not controlled for. Additionally, the evidence might be outdated, derived from non-representative populations, or based on methodologies that have inherent constraints, all of which can affect the generalizability and reliability of the conclusions drawn.",
  "currency": "The evidence is current up to August 2011."
