  "draft": "**Combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation is more effective than liquid alone at reducing complications in elective colorectal surgery**\n\n- Combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation is probably more effective than mechanical bowel preparation alone in preventing postoperative complications, such as surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage, in elective colorectal surgery (moderate-certainty evidence). We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether oral antibiotic bowel preparation alone is actually equivalent to combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation, or leads to a reduction or increase in the risk of postoperative complications. Future research is needed to assess the impact of oral antibiotic bowel preparation alone or no bowel preparation compared with combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation on postoperative complications, as well as to determine the most effective approach of preoperative bowel preparation for different subgroups of patients, such as those undergoing colon or rectal resections.\n\n**What is the health problem?**\n\nThe success of elective colorectal surgery is mainly influenced by the surgical procedure and postoperative complications. The most serious complications include anastomotic leakages and surgical site infections (SSI)s, which can lead to prolonged recovery with impaired long‐term health. Preoperative bowel preparation is used to remove faeces from the bowel lumen and reduce bacterial colonisation. This bowel preparation can be performed mechanically and/or with oral antibiotics. While mechanical bowel preparation alone is not beneficial, the benefits and harms of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation is still unclear. Colorectal resections have an increased risk of adverse events due to the physiological bacterial colonisation of the large bowel. Preoperative bowel preparation can reduce bacterial colonisation, but its effectiveness in preventing postoperative complications is unclear. Colorectal surgery is a common procedure, and understanding the best ways to prepare for it could improve outcomes for patients. Colorectal surgery can be performed for various reasons, including cancer, polyps, and inflammatory bowel disease. The goal of preoperative bowel preparation is to reduce the risk of postoperative complications, such as anastomotic leakages and SSI. However, the optimal approach to bowel preparation is not well established. Some studies suggest that combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation may be more effective than other approaches in preventing postoperative complications. However, the evidence is not yet conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of different bowel preparation strategies. The review aims to assess the evidence for the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation for preventing complications in elective colorectal surgery. The review will examine the effects of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation on postoperative complications, such as anastomotic leakages and SSI, and will also investigate the impact of bowel preparation on other outcomes, such as length of hospital stay and mortality. The review will also explore the heterogeneity of bowel preparation regimens and the variability in study designs and populations. By synthesizing the existing evidence, the review aims to provide a clear, comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation in preventing postoperative complications in elective colorectal surgery.\n\n**What did we want to find out?**\n\nTo assess the evidence for the use of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation for preventing complications in elective colorectal surgery.\n\n**Brief Summary**\n\nThe review authors succinctly described the core actions, linking them directly to the research aims and addressing the study design concisely.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nCombined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation appears more effective than mechanical preparation alone, reducing anastomotic leakage by approximately 44% and surgical site infections by about 40%. Evidence remains uncertain regarding overall SSI incidence and mortality, and further research is needed on oral antibiotic alone or no preparation versus the combined approach.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe findings are based on only a few small studies, many of which looked at short periods of time. The participants were not very diverse, and the ways the results were measured were simple. Because of these factors, we cannot be sure the results would be the same in other groups or over longer periods.\n\n**The evidence referenced is current as of the system's knowledge cutoff date (June 2024) and reflects the latest available information.**",
