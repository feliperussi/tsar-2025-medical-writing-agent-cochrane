  "draft": "**Heading**\nPostoperative nutritional support after pancreaticoduodenectomy: a review of the effects of different nutritional interventions\n\n**Key messages**\n- Enteral feeding (jejunostomy) likely results in a decreased length of hospital stay and may lead to no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications when compared to parenteral nutrition.\n- Further high-quality research is required to determine the effects of different nutritional interventions on postoperative outcomes in adults undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n- The review could not determine whether jejunostomy feeding is better than oral intake for postoperative outcomes in adults undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy, due to a lack of robust evidence.\n\n**What is postoperative nutritional support after pancreaticoduodenectomy?**\nPostoperative nutritional support after pancreaticoduodenectomy is the care given to patients after they have undergone a pancreaticoduodenectomy, a type of surgery that involves the removal of the head of the pancreas. This surgery is often performed to treat cancer, but it can also be done to treat other conditions such as benign tumors and chronic pancreatitis. Maintaining nutritional status is a challenge after this type of surgery, as the digestive system is altered and patients are at risk of malnutrition. Patients may be fed orally, enterally, or parenterally after surgery, and the goal is to optimize outcomes and achieve a normal diet as soon as possible.\n\n**What do we want to know about postoperative nutritional support?**\nWe wanted to assess the effects of postoperative nutritional support strategies on complications and recovery in adults after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Specifically, we looked at the impact of different routes and timings of nutritional support on patient outcomes, such as length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, and mortality.\n\n**Summary**\nThe review aimed to assess the effectiveness of the intervention, and the authors systematically identified, screened, and extracted data from relevant studies. They performed a concise synthesis of findings, focusing on the primary outcomes and methodological quality, to directly address the research question.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 17 studies that involved 1897 participants. The studies lasted from 1 month to 12 months or more. Enteral feeding by jejunostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy likely reduces length of hospital stay and shows a similar incidence of postoperative complications compared with parenteral nutrition. Nasojejunal tube feeding appears to have no clear difference in either complications or length of stay versus parenteral nutrition. Oral nutrition seems to have little to no effect on postoperative complications or length of stay when compared with jejunostomy enteral feeding.\n\n**Reducing postoperative complications and hospital stay after pancreaticoduodenectomy**\nThe evidence suggests that enteral feeding by jejunostomy may be a more effective way to support patients after pancreaticoduodenectomy, but the evidence is of low to very low certainty. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the effects of different nutritional interventions on postoperative outcomes.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by the small size of the studies and the lack of robustness of the findings. The studies were also at high risk of bias, which may have affected the results. Additionally, the review was unable to determine whether jejunostomy feeding is better than oral intake for postoperative outcomes, due to a lack of robust evidence.\n\n**The evidence is up to date to October 2022.**",
