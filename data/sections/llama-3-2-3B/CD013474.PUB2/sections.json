CLL can cause fatigue, weight loss, infections, and other symptoms. Treatment options include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy."

      "content": "Randomized studies of anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibody maintenance (rituximab or ofatumumab) versus observation in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia show a modest improvement in progression‑free survival (hazard ratios ≈0.6–0.7) but no consistent overall‑survival benefit. Maintenance therapy is associated with higher rates of infections, infusion‑related reactions, and cytopenias. The evidence base consists of a limited number of phase‑2/3 trials, and the clinical advantage appears most pronounced in patients with high‑risk disease features, while the safety profile warrants careful patient selection."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "The termination was caused by the system's safeguard against infinite loops, which halts execution after a predefined number of iterations. This limit prevents the model from exhausting resources but also means that any reasoning or data that would have been generated beyond that point is unavailable, creating a gap in the evidence base. Consequently, the final answer may be incomplete because the full chain of thought or additional supporting information could not be captured before the iteration cap was reached.",
  "currency": "The evidence cited is current up to the latest available data as of September 2023."
