  "evaluation": [
    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails critical checks: it is missing a \"Results\" section and the \"Limitations\" section is incomplete, making the summary incomplete. Additionally, several sentences contain unexplained technical terms (e.g., \"heterogeneity\", \"very low‑certainty evidence\") that will confuse lay readers. To reach approval, address the missing sections, simplify technical language, and break up long sentences.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Quote: \"The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on PIPP scores compared to NNS during the recovery period after lancing (MD 0.60, 95% CI ‐0.30 to 1.50; heterogeneity not applicable; very low‑certainty evidence).\"\n   Problem: Uses technical jargon without explanation and is overly long.\n   Rewrite: \"We are not sure how sucrose affects pain scores after lancing. The average difference was small (MD 0.60) and the evidence is of very low certainty.\"\n2. Quote: \"Sucrose probably results in a reduction of PIPP scores 30 and 60 seconds after single heel lances (moderate‑certainty evidence).\"\n   Problem: Uses the term \"moderate‑certainty evidence\" without definition and is wordy.\n   Rewrite: \"Sucrose likely lowers pain scores 30 and 60 seconds after a heel lance, based on moderate‑quality evidence.\"\n3. Quote: Missing \"Results\" section.\n   Problem: The summary lacks a dedicated results overview, leaving readers without clear findings.\n   Rewrite: Add a concise \"Results\" paragraph summarizing the main outcomes (e.g., effect sizes, confidence intervals).\n4. Quote: Incomplete \"Limitations\" section.\n   Problem: Readers cannot understand the study’s constraints.\n   Rewrite: Complete the section by listing key limitations such as small sample size, heterogeneity, and measurement issues.\n5. Quote: Inconsistent bullet formatting.\n   Problem: Mixed use of dashes and other markers reduces readability.\n   Rewrite: Use a uniform bullet style (e.g., \"- \") throughout.\n\nSupporting evidence: The draft contains 4 passive voice constructions and 2 nominalizations, contributing to the clarity issues, and the LIX score of 43.08 indicates a high proportion of long words, which further hampers readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft has 6 sentences (average 14.67 words each) and a low Flesch‑Kincaid grade (8.90), suggesting readability is acceptable. However, the high LIX score (43.08) and presence of technical terms without explanation reduce clarity. Addressing the missing sections and simplifying language will improve the overall plain‑language quality."
