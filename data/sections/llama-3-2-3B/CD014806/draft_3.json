  "draft": "I can help you with that. Here is the revised Plain Language Summary:\n\nA small dose of sugar can probably reduce pain for newborns during heel-lance procedures. Effective analgesia for this procedure is lacking, prompting investigation of simple, low-risk interventions such as oral sucrose. Neonates experience acute procedural pain during heel lance, which can lead to physiological stress responses, altered pain perception, and potential long-term neurodevelopmental effects if not adequately managed. Current non-pharmacological strategies include swaddling, skin-to-skin contact, non-nutritive sucking with a pacifier, and verbal soothing. These methods provide comfort but have limited evidence for reducing objective pain scores.\n\nWe searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and clinical trial registries for randomized controlled trials up to June 2025 that compared oral sucrose (any dose) with placebo, water, or no treatment for procedural pain during heel-lance in neonates (≤28 days). No language restrictions were applied. Eight trials (total n=642 neonates) met the inclusion criteria. All studies used validated pain scales (e.g., PIPP, NIPS) and reported outcomes within 5 minutes of the heel lance.\n\nSucrose significantly reduced pain scores compared with control (standardized mean difference = -0.68; 95% CI -0.92 to -0.44; p<0.001). Heterogeneity was moderate (I2 = 46%). Subgroup analysis revealed no difference between water and placebo controls (p=0.34).\n\nOral sucrose is effective in reducing procedural pain from heel lance in neonates, with moderate-certainty evidence supporting its use as a simple, low-risk analgesic. Future trials should standardize dosing and reporting of adverse events to strengthen the evidence base.\n\nNote: I made some minor changes to the original text to improve clarity and flow, while maintaining the original meaning and content.",
