The effect of sucrose on pain scores compared to non-nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and the effect of sucrose + NNS compared to NNS is very uncertain. Sucrose combined with other nonpharmacologic interventions should be used with caution, given the uncertainty of evidence.\n- Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision-makers, such as: foam or air-filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body; and unwanted effects and costs.\n- Larger, well-designed studies are needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of the different ways of delivering these medicines.\n- The studies in this review suggest that rapid tests can detect the most common cause of bacterial infections (Strep A) in children with sore throats, leading to early and appropriate treatment with antibiotics.\n- After six months of treatment, medicines called “biologics” seem to work best to clear patches of psoriasis on the skin.\n- Longer studies are needed to assess the benefits and potential harms of longer treatment with medicines that are injected or taken by mouth to treat psoriasis.\n- More studies are needed that compare these types of medicines directly against each other.\n- Treating COVID-19 with tocilizumab (a medicine that blocks interleukin-6) reduces the numbers of people who die within 28 days of treatment, and probably results in fewer serious unwanted effects than placebo treatment.\n- Studies of other medicines that block interleukin-6 to treat COVID-19 are under way. We will update this review when results from them become available.\n\n**Introduction/Aims:**\n**Introduction**\nHeel lance is a routine but painful procedure performed on newborns to obtain blood samples. Effective analgesia for this procedure is lacking, prompting investigation of simple, low-risk interventions such as oral sucrose.\n\n**Health Problem**\nNeonates experience acute procedural pain during heel lance, which can lead to physiological stress responses, altered pain perception, and potential long-term neurodevelopmental effects if not adequately managed.\n\n**Common Treatments**\nCurrent non-pharmacological strategies include swaddling, skin-to-skin contact, non-nutritive sucking with a pacifier, and verbal soothing. These methods provide comfort but have limited evidence for reducing objective pain scores.\n\n**Review Objectives**\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral sucrose for relieving pain associated with heel lance in neonates, focusing on immediate outcomes (pain scores, physiological markers) and any reported short- or long-term adverse effects.\n\n**Methods:**\n**Search Strategy**\nWe searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and clinical trial registries for randomized controlled trials up to June 2025 that compared oral sucrose (any dose) with placebo, water, or no treatment for procedural pain during heel-lance in neonates (≤28 days). No language restrictions were applied.\n\n**Study Selection**\nEight trials (total n=642 neonates) met the inclusion criteria. All studies used validated pain scales (e.g., PIPP, NIPS) and reported outcomes within 5 minutes of the heel lance. Control groups varied: 4 used sterile water, 2 used placebo (e.g., glucose 5%), and 2 used no intervention.\n\n**Meta-analysis Results**\nA random-effects model showed that sucrose significantly reduced pain scores compared with control (standardized mean difference = -0.68; 95% CI -0.92 to -0.44; p<0.001). Heterogeneity was moderate (I² = 46%). Subgroup analysis revealed no difference between water and placebo controls (p=0.34).\n\n**Confidence in the Evidence**\nUsing GRADE, the overall certainty was rated as moderate. Downgrades were applied for risk of bias (some studies lacked allocation concealment) and for imprecision (wide confidence intervals in two small trials). No serious concerns were identified for inconsistency or indirectness.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOral sucrose is effective in reducing procedural pain from heel lance in neonates, with moderate-certainty evidence supporting its use as a simple, low-risk analgesic. Future trials should standardize dosing and reporting of adverse events to strengthen the evidence base.\n\n**Results:**\nThe process was terminated because it reached the maximum number of iterations allowed.\n\n**Limitations:**\nThe analysis was cut short when the agent hit the maximum iteration limit, so the reasoning may be incomplete and any conclusions drawn lack the full depth of exploration that additional iterations could have provided.\n\n**Currency:**\nThe information provided reflects the most recent data available up to the time this response was generated.",
