  "draft": "**A small dose of sugar can probably reduce pain for newborns during heel-lance procedures (moderate-certainty evidence). The effect of sucrose on pain scores compared to non-nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and the effect of sucrose + NNS compared to NNS is very uncertain. Sucerose combined with other nonpharmacologic interventions should be used with caution, given the uncertainty of evidence.**\n\n**Key messages:**\n\n- A small dose of sugar can probably reduce pain for newborns during heel-lance procedures (moderate-certainty evidence).\n- The effect of sucrose on pain scores compared to non-nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and the effect of sucrose + NNS compared to NNS is very uncertain.\n- Sucrose combined with other nonpharmacologic interventions should be used with caution, given the uncertainty of evidence.\n\n**Background:**\nHeel lance is a routine but painful procedure performed on newborns to obtain blood samples. Effective analgesia for this procedure is lacking, prompting investigation of simple, low-risk interventions such as oral sucrose.\n\n**Objectives:**\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral sucrose for relieving pain associated with heel lance in neonates, focusing on immediate outcomes (pain scores, physiological markers) and any reported short- or long-term adverse effects.\n\n**Search methods:**\nWe searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and clinical trial registries for randomized controlled trials up to June 2025 that compared oral sucrose (any dose) with placebo, water, or no treatment for procedural pain during heel-lance in neonates (≤28 days). No language restrictions were applied.\n\n**Selection criteria:**\nWe included randomised controlled trials where term and/or preterm neonates received sucrose for heel lances. Comparison treatments included water/placebo/no intervention, non-nutritive sucking (NNS), glucose, breastfeeding, breast milk, music, acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and skin-to-skin care.\n\n**Data collection and analysis:**\nWe used standard Cochrane methods. We reported mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed-effect model for continuous outcome measures. We assessed heterogeneity by the I2test. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.\n\n**Main results:**\nWe included 55 trials (6273 infants): 29 included term neonates, 22 included preterm neonates, and four included both. Heel lance was investigated in 50 trials; 15 investigated other minor painful procedures in addition to lancing.\n\n**Sucrose vs control:**\nThe evidence suggests that sucrose probably results in a reduction in PIPP scores compared to the control group at 30 seconds (MD -1.74 (95% CI -2.11 to -1.37); I2= 62%; moderate-certainty evidence) and 60 seconds after lancing (MD -2.14, 95% CI -3.34 to -0.94; I2= 0%; moderate-certainty evidence).\n\n**Sucrose vs NNS:**\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on PIPP scores compared to NNS during the recovery period after lancing (MD 0.60, 95% CI -0.30 to 1.50; heterogeneity not applicable; very low-certainty evidence) and on DAN scores at 30 seconds after lancing (MD -1.20, 95% CI -7.87 to 5.47; heterogeneity N/A; very low-certainty evidence).\n\n**Sucrose + NNS vs NNS:**\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose + NNS on PIPP scores compared to NNS during lancing (MD -4.90, 95% CI -5.73 to -4. 07; heterogeneity not applicable; very low-certainty evidence) and during recovery after lancing (MD -3.80, 95% CI -4.47 to -3.13; heterogeneity N/A; very low-certainty evidence).\n\n**Sucrose vs glucose:**\nThe evidence suggests that sucrose results in little to no difference in PIPP scores compared to glucose at 30 seconds (MD 0.26, 95% CI -0.70 to 1.22; heterogeneity not applicable; low-certainty evidence) and 60 seconds after lancing (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.79 to 0.75; heterogeneity N/A; low-certainty evidence).\n\n**Sucrose vs breastfeeding:**\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on PIPP scores compared to breastfeeding at 30 seconds after lancing (MD -0.70, 95% CI -0.49 to 1.88; I2= 94%; very low-certainty evidence).\n\n**Sucrose vs expressed breast milk:**\nThe evidence suggests that sucrose may result in little to no difference in PIPP-R scores compared to expressed breast milk during (MD 0.3, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.84; heterogeneity not applicable; low-certainty evidence) and at 30 seconds after lancing (MD 0.3, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.71; heterogeneity N/A; low-certainty evidence).\n\n**Sucrose vs laser acupuncture:**\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on NIPS scores compared to laser acupuncture during lancing (MD -0.86, 95% CI -1.43 to -0.29; heterogeneity N/A; very low-certainty evidence).\n\n**Sucrose vs facilitated tucking:**\nThe evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose on total BPSN scores compared to facilitated tucking during lancing (MD -2.27, 95% CI -4.66 to 0.12; heterogeneity N/A; very low-certainty evidence) and during recovery after lancing (MD -0.31, 95% CI -1.72 to 1.10; heterogeneity N/A; very low-certainty evidence).\n\n**Sucrose vs skin-to-skin + water (repeated lancing):**\nThe evidence suggests that sucrose results in little to no difference in PIPP scores compared to skin-to-skin + water at 30 seconds after 1st (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.96); 2nd (MD -0.56, 95% CI -1.57 to 0.45); or 3rd lancing (MD-0.15, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.96); heterogeneity N/A, low-certainty evidence for all comparisons.\n\n**Authors' conclusions:**\nSucrose compared to control probably results in a reduction of PIPP scores 30 and 60 seconds after single heel lances (moderate-certainty evidence). Evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sucrose compared to NNS, breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and the effect of sucrose + NNS compared to NNS in reducing pain. Sucrose compared to glucose, expressed breast milk, and skin-to-skin care shows little to no difference in pain scores. Sucrose combined with other nonpharmacologic interventions should be used with caution, given the uncertainty of evidence.\n",

Key sentences assume prior knowledge and use technical jargon without explanation, making them hard to understand for a lay audience.

Structurally, the text lacks paragraph breaks, consistent bullet formatting, and adequate spacing, resulting in dense walls of text. Readability metrics (SMOG index 17.6, Dale-Chall 8.7) indicate a reading level far above the target audience, and the high count of passive constructions and complex words further confirms non‑compliance with plain‑language standards.",
