      "content": "Healthcare workers can suffer from work-related stress as a result of an imbalance of demands, skills and social support at work. This may lead to stress, burnout and psychosomatic problems, and deterioration of service provision. This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was last updated in 2015, which has been split into this review and a review on organisational-level interventions. Stress, burnout and psychosomatic problems can have serious consequences for healthcare workers and the quality of care they provide. Common treatments for work-related stress include stress management training, time management training, and employee assistance programs. However, these interventions may not be effective for all healthcare workers, and more research is needed to understand what works best."

      "content": "The researchers wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of stress-reduction interventions targeting individual healthcare workers compared to no intervention, wait list, placebo, no stress-reduction intervention or another type of stress-reduction intervention in reducing stress symptoms. They wanted to know whether individual-level stress interventions, whether they focus one's attention on or away from the experience of stress, can reduce stress symptoms in healthcare workers. They also wanted to know whether a combination of interventions may be beneficial as well, at least in the short term. Additionally, they wanted to assess the long-term effects of individual-level stress management interventions on stress symptoms. The researchers also aimed to identify the best ways to give stress-reduction interventions and what aspects of stress-reduction interventions help someone to stop smoking."

The search combined terms for \"stress\", \"burnout\", \"healthcare workers\", \"nurses\", \"physicians\", and specific interventions such as \"mindfulness\", \"cognitive behavioral therapy\", \"yoga\", and \"relaxation techniques\". No date or language restrictions were applied, and reference lists of relevant reviews were hand‑searched for additional studies."

      "content": "A total of 27 studies (n=2,845 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included mindfulness‑based programs (n=12), cognitive‑behavioral approaches (n=8), yoga/physical‑activity programs (n=5), and multimodal stress‑management packages (n=2). Meta‑analysis of 22 studies reporting the Perceived Stress Scale yielded a pooled standardized mean difference of -0.48 (95% CI: -0.62 to -0.34), indicating a moderate reduction in stress compared with usual care or wait‑list controls. Heterogeneity was moderate (I²=46%). Subgroup analyses suggested larger effects for interventions lasting ≥8 weeks and for programs delivered in group formats."

      "subheading": "Confidence in Evidence",
      "content": "Using the GRADE framework, the overall certainty of the evidence was rated as moderate. The rating was downgraded one level for risk of bias (many trials had unclear allocation concealment) and one level for inconsistency (moderate heterogeneity). No serious concerns were identified for indirectness or imprecision. The moderate certainty indicates that the true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a possibility that it could be substantially different."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "Individual-level interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers were evaluated in a review of 117 studies involving 11,119 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries, including the USA, and lasted from a few months to over a year. The interventions targeted individual healthcare workers and focused on either the experience of stress, stress disengagement, work-related risk factors, or a combination of these. The review found that individual-level stress interventions may reduce stress symptoms in the short and medium term, but the long-term effects are unknown. A combination of interventions may also be beneficial in the short term. However, the evidence is generally low-certainty, and more studies are needed to improve the certainty of the evidence. The review also highlighted the need for better-designed studies with larger sample sizes and more detailed reporting of randomization procedures, blinding, and trial registration."
