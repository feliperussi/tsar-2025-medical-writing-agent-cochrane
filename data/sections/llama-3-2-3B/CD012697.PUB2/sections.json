  "key_messages": [
    "Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) may not be better than electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for people with schizophrenia, due to a lack of robust evidence and high risk of bias in the included study. MST may cause less delayed memory deficit and less cognitive deterioration compared to ECT, but also may improve more cognitive function in some people with schizophrenia. Future research is needed to answer the question of whether MST is effective and safe for people with schizophrenia.",
    "The quality of the evidence for the effectiveness of MST for people with schizophrenia is unclear due to a lack of robust evidence and high risk of bias in the included study.",

      "content": "Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It can cause problems with thinking, mood, perception, and social interactions. Schizophrenia is a common condition that affects about 1% of the population worldwide. It can be a disabling condition, and people with schizophrenia may need to seek other treatment options if their symptoms do not improve with antipsychotics, which are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia today."
