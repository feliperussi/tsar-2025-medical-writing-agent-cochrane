      "content": "Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a common health problem in pregnant women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. It occurs when the body does not have enough iron to produce healthy red blood cells, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. IDA can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy, including postpartum haemorrhage and anaemia. Oral iron supplements are commonly used to treat IDA, but their effectiveness is often limited by poor adherence and gastrointestinal side effects. Intravenous iron, on the other hand, has been shown to be more effective in increasing haematological parameters, but its impact on serious pregnancy complications is unclear. This review aims to evaluate the effect and safety of intravenous versus oral iron preparations for treating IDA in pregnancy."

Actually keep original: Intravenous iron probably raises haemoglobin slightly more than oral iron during pregnancy (moderate certainty) and may modestly reduce anaemia (moderate certainty). After delivery the evidence is less certain: intravenous iron may slightly increase haemoglobin and reduce anaemia, severe anaemia, postpartum haemorrhage, need for blood transfusion, breastfeeding rates, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity and adverse events, but the certainty ranges from low to very low."
