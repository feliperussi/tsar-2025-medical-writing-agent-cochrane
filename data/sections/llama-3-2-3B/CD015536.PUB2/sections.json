  "key_messages": [
    "Entecavir is effective in treating chronic hepatitis B compared to no treatment or placebo in children and adults, but the quality of evidence is very low due to a lack of robust studies and high risk of bias in most trials. (Explain: \"Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of entecavir in treating chronic hepatitis B are unclear.\")",
    "The proportion of people with serious adverse events is uncertain, with a very low certainty of evidence due to the lack of events or few events reported in the included trials. (Explain: \"We are very uncertain about the effect of entecavir versus no treatment or placebo on the proportion of people with serious adverse events.\")",
    "Further evidence is needed to determine the effect of entecavir on critical outcomes such as all-cause mortality and serious adverse events, and to inform decision-making for people with chronic hepatitis B. (Explain: \"Further evidence is needed to give better estimates of the benefits and potential harms of entecavir in treating chronic hepatitis B.\")"

      "subheading": "What is chronic hepatitis B and why is it a public health concern?",
      "content": "Chronic hepatitis B is a long‑lasting infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV).  It affects millions of people worldwide and can lead to serious liver damage, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, making it a major global health problem.  The infection is often silent for years, so many people are unaware they are infected, which contributes to its spread.  Treatment aims to suppress the virus and prevent liver complications.  One of the most widely recommended medicines is entecavir, a \"nucleos(t)ide analogue\" – a type of drug that mimics the building blocks of viral DNA and stops the virus from copying itself.  Although many clinical guidelines list entecavir as a first‑line (initial) therapy, those recommendations have not been based on a systematic review that directly compares entecavir with no treatment or placebo."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to evaluate the benefits and harms of giving entecavir to children and adults with chronic hepatitis B, compared with giving no treatment or a placebo.  Specifically, they wanted to determine whether entecavir reduces all‑cause mortality, improves health‑related quality of life, and lowers the proportion of participants experiencing serious adverse events.  To do this, they planned a systematic review and meta‑analysis of randomised clinical trials, using statistical methods such as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and assessing the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach."
