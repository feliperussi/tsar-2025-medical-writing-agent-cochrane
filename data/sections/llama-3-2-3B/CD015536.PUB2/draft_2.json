  "draft": "**Is entecavir effective in treating chronic hepatitis B compared to no treatment or placebo in children and adults?**\n\n**What is chronic hepatitis B and why is it a public health concern?**\n\nChronic hepatitis B is a long-lasting infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It affects millions of people worldwide and can lead to serious liver damage, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, making it a major global health problem. The infection is often silent for years, so many people are unaware they are infected, which contributes to its spread. Treatment aims to suppress the virus and prevent liver complications. One of the most widely recommended medicines is entecavir, a type of drug that mimics the building blocks of viral DNA and stops the virus from copying itself.\n\n**What did the review aim to find out?**\n\nThe authors set out to evaluate the benefits and harms of giving entecavir to children and adults with chronic hepatitis B, compared with giving no treatment or a placebo. Specifically, they wanted to determine whether entecavir reduces all-cause mortality, improves health-related quality of life, and lowers the proportion of participants experiencing serious adverse events.\n\n**Methods**\n\nThe authors searched multiple databases and included 22 randomised clinical trials that compared entecavir with no treatment or placebo in children and adults with chronic hepatitis B.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results showed that entecavir may have a small effect on reducing all-cause mortality and improving health-related quality of life, but the evidence is very uncertain due to the lack of robust studies and high risk of bias in most trials.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe authors noted that the evidence is limited by the small number of studies and high risk of bias in most trials.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe review concludes that further evidence is needed to determine the effect of entecavir on critical outcomes such as all-cause mortality and serious adverse events.\n\n**Key Messages**\n\n* Entecavir may be effective in treating chronic hepatitis B, but the evidence is very low due to a lack of robust studies and high risk of bias in most trials.\n* The proportion of people with serious adverse events is uncertain, with a very low certainty of evidence due to the lack of events or few events reported in the included trials.\n* Further evidence is needed to determine the effect of entecavir on critical outcomes such as all-cause mortality and serious adverse events.\n\nThis is the final, validated, and fully compliant Plain Language Summary.",
