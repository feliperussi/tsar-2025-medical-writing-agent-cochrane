  "draft": "**Process halted because the maximum number of iterations was reached**\n\n- Education programmes may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self–management practices. Education programmes probably decrease HbA1c in people with CKD and diabetes, but the effect on other clinical outcomes is unclear. This review only included eight studies with small sample sizes. Therefore, more randomised studies are needed to examine the efficacy of education programmes on important clinical outcomes in people with CKD and diabetes.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of most types of beds, mattresses and mattress toppers for treating pressure ulcers are unclear. Beds with an air-filled surface that applies constant pressure to the skin may be better than mattresses and toppers made of foam for ulcer healing, but may cost more. Future research in this area should focus on options and effects that are important to decision‑makers, such as foam or air‑filled surfaces that redistribute pressure under the body, and unwanted effects and costs.\n- The studies in this review suggest that rapid tests can detect the most common cause of bacterial infections (Strep A) in children with sore throats, leading to early and appropriate treatment with antibiotics. The number of children receiving unnecessary antibiotics following a rapid test is still likely to be lower than the number of children who would receive unnecessary antibiotics if the test is not used. Both types of rapid tests studied in the review had similar accuracy.\n- After six months of treatment, medicines called “biologics” seem to work best to clear patches of psoriasis on the skin. Longer studies are needed to assess the benefits and potential harms of longer treatment with medicines that are injected or taken by mouth to treat psoriasis. More studies are needed that compare these types of medicines directly against each other.\n- Treating COVID’19 with tocilizumab (a medicine that blocks interleukin‖6) reduces the numbers of people who die within 28 days of treatment, and probably results in fewer serious unwanted effects than placebo treatment. Studies of other medicines that block interleukin‖6 to treat or COVID’19 are under way. We will update this review when results from them become available.\n\n**Introduction to the review topic and review aims**\n\n- People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes often have poor adherence to their treatment regimens, which can lead to complications and reduced quality of life.\n- Effective management requires knowledge of the disease, medication schedules, dietary recommendations, blood glucose monitoring, and kidney function monitoring to avoid complications and maintain quality of life.\n- We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes.\n\n**Search Strategy**\n\n- We performed a systematic search for studies evaluating education programmes for individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes.\n\n**Evidence Synthesis and Confidence Rating**\n\n- The results of the eligible studies were pooled, and the certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE framework.\n\n**What did we find?**\n\n- Education programmes probably lower glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes (large effect, moderate certainty). There may be small but important improvements in general diabetes knowledge, detailed knowledge about diagnosis, monitoring, medication, lifestyle, complications, coping, as well as modest gains in treatment‑effectiveness beliefs, self‑efficacy, personal control, and behaviours such as diet and home glucose monitoring (low certainty). Evidence suggests little or no difference in HbA1c, kidney failure, eGFR, blood pressure, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, LDL/HDL cholesterol, death, serious hypoglycaemia, or kidney failure in advanced diabetic nephropathy (low to very low certainty). No data were available for changes in kidney function measures such as creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, doubling of serum creatinine, or proteinuria (very low certainty).\n\n**Limitations**\n\n- We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Evidence currency statement**\n\n- The information provided reflects the state of knowledge as of the model's last training cut‑off in June 2024.",
