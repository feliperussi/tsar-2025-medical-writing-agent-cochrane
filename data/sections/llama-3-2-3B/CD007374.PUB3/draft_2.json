  "draft": "Education programmes for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes are interventions that provide intensive education and behavioural counselling to enhance adherence to complex regimens. People with CKD and diabetes often have poor adherence to their treatment regimens, which can lead to complications and reduced quality of life. Effective management requires knowledge of the disease, medication schedules, dietary recommendations, blood glucose monitoring, and kidney function monitoring to avoid complications and maintain quality of life. We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes. We performed a systematic search for studies evaluating education programmes for individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes. The results of the eligible studies were pooled, and the certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE framework. Education programmes probably lower glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes (large effect, moderate certainty). There may be small but important improvements in general diabetes knowledge, detailed knowledge about diagnosis, monitoring, medication, lifestyle, complications, coping, as well as modest gains in treatment‑effectiveness beliefs, self‑efficacy, personal control, and behaviours such as diet and home glucose monitoring (low certainty). Evidence suggests little or no difference in HbA1c, kidney failure, eGFR, blood pressure, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, LDL/HDL cholesterol, death, serious hypoglycaemia, or kidney failure in advanced diabetic nephropathy (low to very low certainty). No data were available for changes in kidney function measures such as creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, doubling of serum creatinine, or proteinuria (very low certainty). Education programmes may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self–management practices. Education programmes probably decrease HbA1c in people with CKD and diabetes, but the effect on other clinical outcomes is unclear. This review only included eight studies with small sample sizes. Therefore, more randomised studies are needed to examine the efficacy of education programmes on important clinical outcomes in people with CKD and diabetes.",

      "feedback": "The draft contains several critical clarity problems (overly long sentences, undefined technical terms), style issues (excessive passive voice, wordy constructions, heavy nominalisation) and structural weaknesses (missing paragraph breaks, inconsistent bullet formatting, no blank lines between sections). The suggested revisions – splitting sentences, defining jargon, converting to active voice, adding headings and paragraph spacing, and using dash‑started bullet points – are appropriate and should be applied throughout. Additionally, the readability metrics are far from typical plain‑language summary (PLS) standards: Flesch reading ease 16.7 (target ~40), Flesch‑Kincaid grade 16.6 (target ~13), Gunning fog 22.5, and high counts of nominalisation. Reducing nominalisation, simplifying vocabulary, and shortening sentences will improve these scores and make the text more accessible to a lay audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft deviates markedly from standard PLS patterns: active‑voice instances (19) match the median, but pronoun use (7) is also at the median, while nominalisations (23) far exceed the median of 13. Readability indices are all substantially higher than typical PLS values (Flesch reading ease, Flesch‑Kincaid, ARI, Coleman‑Liau, Gunning fog, Lix, Rix, Dale‑Chall), indicating a reading level that is too advanced for the intended audience. To align with PLS norms, the text should aim for a Flesch reading ease around 40–50, a Flesch‑Kincaid grade of 12–13, and reduce nominalisation and complex sentence structures."
