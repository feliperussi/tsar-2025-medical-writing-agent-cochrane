Here is the revised text:\n\n**Education programmes for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes**\n\nEducation programmes for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes are interventions that provide intensive education and behavioural counselling to enhance adherence to complex regimens. People with CKD and diabetes often have poor adherence to their treatment regimens, which can lead to complications and reduced quality of life. Effective management requires knowledge of the disease, medication schedules, dietary recommendations, blood glucose monitoring, and kidney function monitoring to avoid complications and maintain quality of life.\n\nWe wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with CKD and diabetes. We performed a systematic search for studies evaluating education programmes for individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes. The results of the eligible studies were pooled, and the certainty of the evidence was assessed ...\n\n**What did we find?**\n\nEducation programmes probably lower glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes (large effect, moderate certainty). There may be small but important improvements in general diabetes knowledge, detailed knowledge about diagnosis, monitoring, medication, lifestyle, complications, coping, as well as modest gains in treatment‑effectiveness beliefs, self‑efficacy, personal control, and behaviours such as diet and home glucose monitoring (low certainty). Evidence suggests little or no difference in HbA1c, kidney failure, eGFR, blood pressure, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, LDL/HDL cholesterol, death, serious hypoglycaemia, or kidney failure in advanced diabetic nephropathy (low to very low certainty). No data were available for changes in kidney function measures such as creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, doubling of serum creatinine, or proteinuria (very low certainty).\n\n**What does this mean?**\n\nEducation programmes may improve knowledge of some areas related to diabetes care and some self–management practices. Education programmes probably decrease HbA1c in people with CKD and diabetes, but the effect on other clinical outcomes is unclear. This review only included eight studies with small sample sizes. Therefore, more randomised studies are needed to examine the efficacy of education programmes on important clinical outcomes in people with CKD and diabetes.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",

Because of these issues, the PLS does not meet the required standards and must be revised before it can be approved.\n\n**Key recommendations**: add a \"What does this mean?\" section; define all technical terms; align terminology with the source; break long sentences into shorter ones; use active voice; format all headings as questions; insert clear paragraph breaks; and simplify language to achieve a reading level of around grade 8.\n\n",

All scores are well above the typical range for a Plain Language Summary, indicating the text is too complex for the intended audience."
