  "key_messages": [
    "Placing a drain (a tube to remove fluid) after surgery for a burst or perforated appendix does not show a clear benefit in preventing belly infections (intraperitoneal abscess), and the evidence suggests it may increase the risk of death, but the overall certainty of these findings is very low because the available studies were small and at high risk of bias.",
    "No reliable evidence was found to compare different types of drains (open versus closed) or to determine the best timing for removing a drain after surgery for complicated appendicitis.",
    "Because the current evidence is uncertain and based on studies with methodological limitations, larger, well‑designed trials are needed to clarify whether drains help prevent infections, what harms they might cause, and the optimal use of drains in this surgical setting."

      "subheading": "What is complicated appendicitis and why does it matter?",
      "content": "Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch attached to the large intestine. When the inflammation becomes severe enough to cause the appendix to die (gangrenous) or to burst (perforated), it is called \"complicated appendicitis.\" This form often spreads infection into the abdominal cavity (peritonitis) and can lead to painful pockets of pus called intraperitoneal abscesses after surgery. The usual treatment is an appendectomy – the surgical removal of the appendix – which can be performed through an open incision or a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) keyhole approach. Because the risk of infection is higher in complicated cases, surgeons sometimes place an abdominal drain, a tube that helps remove fluid or pus that might collect after the operation."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to determine whether using an abdominal drain after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis improves outcomes. Specifically, it aimed to: (1) compare the benefits and harms of placing a drain versus not placing one; (2) examine whether different drain types (open vs. closed) affect results; and (3) identify the optimal timing for removing a drain if one is used. In short, the authors wanted clear evidence on whether routine drainage reduces intraperitoneal abscesses or other complications, or whether it might cause additional problems such as longer hospital stays or higher mortality."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched databases for studies that compared abdominal drainage with no drainage, or different drain types or removal times after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. We combined their results in meta‑analyses (or summarized them when pooling was not possible) and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included eight studies (five randomized controlled trials and three quasi‑randomized trials) with a total of 739 participants—370 who received an abdominal drain and 369 who did not. The studies were published between 1973 and 2023 and were carried out in North America, Asia, and Africa. Both children and adults were enrolled, most of whom had perforated appendicitis with local or generalized peritonitis and all received postoperative antibiotics after open or laparoscopic appendectomy. The only comparison made was abdominal drainage versus no drainage; no trials examined open versus closed drains or early versus late drain removal. Details on follow‑up length or duration of the drainage intervention were not provided in the abstract. Funding for the review came from several Chinese sources, while funding for the individual studies was not reported."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Effect on 30‑day mortality",
      "content": "Abdominal drainage probably causes a large increase in the risk of death within 30 days after surgery for complicated appendicitis. For other outcomes—such as intra‑abdominal abscess, wound infection, overall postoperative morbidity, and length of hospital stay—the evidence is very uncertain, and no studies compared open versus closed drains or early versus late drain removal."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2023."
