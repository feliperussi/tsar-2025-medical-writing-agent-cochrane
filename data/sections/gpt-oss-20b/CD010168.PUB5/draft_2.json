  "draft": "Is placing a drain (a tube to remove fluid) in the abdomen after surgery for a burst or perforated appendix effective at preventing belly infections (intraperitoneal abscess)?\n\nKey messages\n– Using a drain after surgery for a burst or perforated appendix does not clearly reduce belly infections, and the limited evidence suggests it may raise the risk of death.  \n– We found no reliable studies that compare different drain types (open vs closed) or that test the best timing for removing a drain.  \n– Because the existing studies are small and have methodological problems, larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether drains are helpful and safe.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis and why does it matter?\nAppendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch attached to the large intestine. When the appendix dies (gangrenous) or bursts (perforated), the condition is called complicated appendicitis. Infection can spread into the abdominal cavity (peritonitis) and may form painful pockets of pus called intraperitoneal abscesses after surgery. The usual treatment is an appendectomy – surgical removal of the appendix – performed through an open cut or a keyhole (laparoscopic) technique. Because the risk of infection is higher in these cases, surgeons sometimes place an abdominal drain, a tube that helps remove fluid or pus that might collect after the operation.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether placing an abdominal drain after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis improves outcomes. Specifically we asked: (1) does a drain reduce infections or other complications compared with no drain? (2) do different drain types (open vs closed) give different results? (3) is there an optimal time to remove the drain?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several medical databases, trial registers, and reference lists for randomised and quasi‑randomised studies that compared drainage with no drainage, or compared drain types or removal times after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. We combined the results where possible and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included eight studies – five randomised controlled trials and three quasi‑randomised trials – involving 739 participants (370 with a drain, 369 without). The studies were conducted between 1973 and 2023 in North America, Asia and Africa and enrolled both children and adults. Most participants had perforated appendicitis with local or generalized peritonitis and all received antibiotics after open or laparoscopic surgery. The only comparison made was drain versus no drain; no study examined open versus closed drains or early versus late drain removal.\n\nWhat are the main results on 30‑day mortality?\nWe found that using a drain probably increases the risk of death within 30 days after surgery. Seven deaths occurred among participants with a drain (out of 291) compared with one death among those without a drain (out of 290). The evidence for other outcomes – such as intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, overall morbidity and length of hospital stay – is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in these findings because many studies were small, had a high risk of bias, and participants and clinicians often knew which treatment was given. Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, and the study populations and methods varied.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence up to October 2023.",

In addition, the text contains several clarity‑reducing problems: (1) excessive passive voice (19 instances, well above the typical PLS range of 9‑23) – e.g., \"The only comparison made was drain versus no drain\" should become \"We only compared drain versus no drain\"; (2) many complex and long words (complex_words_dc = 248, long_words = 173, both beyond the median) – replace \"methodological problems\" with \"study design problems\" and \"quasi‑randomised\" with \"almost random\"; (3) a few sentences still exceed 30 words and can be split for easier reading – e.g., the long background sentence can be broken into two shorter ones. Addressing these issues will bring the draft into full compliance with the style guide and improve patient‑readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (55.6% of features in the best quartile) but highlights five deviations: passive_voice (19, P90), smog_index (14.3, P90), complex_words_dc (248, P90), complex_words (131, P90) and long_words (173, P90). These indicate the draft is more passive and uses more complex/long words than typical PLS texts, supporting the suggested edits."
