  "draft": "Is placing a drain (a tube to remove fluid) in the abdomen after surgery for a burst or perforated appendix effective at preventing belly infections (intraperitoneal abscess)?\n\nKey messages\n– Placing a drain after surgery for a burst or perforated appendix does not clearly reduce belly infections (intraperitoneal abscess). The limited evidence also suggests it may increase the risk of death.  \n– No reliable studies compared different drain types (open versus closed) or examined the best timing for removing a drain.  \n– Because the existing studies are small and have design problems, larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether drains are helpful and safe.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis and why does it matter?  \nAppendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch attached to the large intestine. When the appendix dies (gangrenous) or bursts (perforated), the condition is called complicated appendicitis. This can spread infection into the abdominal cavity (peritonitis) and may lead to painful pockets of pus called intraperitoneal abscesses after surgery. Surgeons remove the appendix (appendectomy) through an open cut or a keyhole (laparoscopic) approach. Because infection risk is higher, they sometimes place an abdominal drain—a thin tube that helps remove fluid or pus that might collect after the operation.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether using an abdominal drain after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis improves outcomes. Specifically we asked: (1) does a drain reduce infections or other complications compared with no drain? (2) do different drain types (open vs closed) give different results? (3) is there an optimal time to remove the drain?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched several medical databases, trial registers and reference lists for randomised trials and quasi‑randomised trials (studies where participants are allocated to groups in a way that is close to random). We combined results from similar studies in meta‑analyses and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included eight studies (five randomised trials and three quasi‑randomised trials) that together enrolled 739 people – 370 received a drain and 369 did not. The studies were published between 1973 and 2023 in North America, Asia and Africa. They involved children and adults, most of whom had perforated appendicitis with peritonitis. All participants received antibiotics after open or laparoscopic surgery. The only comparison made was drain versus no drain; no study examined open versus closed drains or early versus late drain removal.\n\nWhat were the main results for 30‑day mortality?  \nSeven deaths occurred among participants with a drain (7/291) compared with one death among those without a drain (1/290). This suggests that using a drain probably increases the risk of death within 30 days after surgery. For other outcomes—such as intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, overall complications and length of hospital stay—the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany studies were small and had a high risk of bias. Participants and clinicians often knew which treatment was given, which can affect results. Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, and the study populations and methods varied.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence up to October 2023.",

These issues are reflected in the metric report, which shows a high SMOG index (14.0) and many complex words (122) and Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (235), indicating the text is more difficult than typical PLS. Reducing jargon, shortening the long sentence, and clarifying the benefit statement would bring the summary back into the acceptable readability range.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall to typical patterns, but three metrics deviate: SMOG index (14.0, beyond typical PLS), complex_words_dc (235, high) and complex_words (122, high). These suggest the text contains more difficult vocabulary and longer sentences than usual, supporting the need for simplification and clarification."
