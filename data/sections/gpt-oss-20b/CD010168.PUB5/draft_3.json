  "draft": "\"Is placing a drain (a tube to remove fluid) in the abdomen after surgery for a burst or perforated appendix effective at preventing belly infections (intraperitoneal abscess)?\"\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– We found no clear benefit of a drain in preventing belly infections, and the limited evidence suggests it may increase the risk of death.  \n– No reliable studies compared different drain types (open vs closed) or examined the best timing for removing a drain.  \n– Because the existing studies are small and have study design problems, larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether drains are helpful and safe.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis and why does it matter?\nAppendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch attached to the large intestine. When the appendix dies (gangrenous) or bursts (perforated), the condition is called complicated appendicitis. This can spread infection to the abdominal lining (peritonitis) and may lead to painful pockets of pus inside the abdominal cavity (intraperitoneal abscess) after surgery. Surgeons usually remove the appendix (appendectomy) through an open cut or a keyhole (laparoscopic) approach. Because infection risk is higher, they sometimes place an abdominal drain, a tube that helps remove fluid or pus that might collect after the operation.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether using an abdominal drain after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis improves outcomes. Specifically we asked: (1) does a drain reduce infections or other complications compared with no drain? (2) do different drain types (open vs closed) give different results? (3) is there an optimal time to remove the drain?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several medical databases, trial registers and reference lists for randomised and almost random studies that compared drainage with no drainage, or compared drain types or removal times after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. We combined results in meta‑analyses where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included eight studies – five randomised trials and three almost random trials – with 739 participants (370 with a drain, 369 without). The studies were published between 1973 and 2023 in North America, Asia and Africa and involved both children and adults. Most participants had perforated appendicitis with local or generalized peritonitis and all received antibiotics after open or laparoscopic surgery. We only compared drain versus no drain; no study examined open versus closed drains or early versus late drain removal.\n\nWhat are the main results on 30‑day mortality?\nWe found that using a drain probably increases the risk of death within 30 days after surgery. Seven deaths occurred among participants with a drain (out of 291) compared with one death among those without a drain (out of 290). Evidence for other outcomes – such as intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, overall complications and length of hospital stay – is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in these findings because many studies were small, had a high risk of bias, and participants and clinicians often knew which treatment was given. Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, and the study populations and methods varied.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence up to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "Critical checks pass (all required sections are present, subheadings are phrased as questions, facts and numbers match the source, word count is 563 < 850). However, the draft contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained technical term** – \"almost random trials\" (quoted from the draft). This jargon is not defined and may be misunderstood. Suggested rewrite: \"quasi‑randomised trials (studies where participants were allocated to groups in a way that is close to random)\".\n2. **Overly long, dense sentence** – \"We included eight studies – five randomised trials and three almost random trials – with 739 participants (370 with a drain, 369 without). The studies were published between 1973 and 2023 and were carried out in North America, Asia, and Africa. Both children and adults were enrolled, most of whom had perforated appendicitis with local or generalized peritonitis and all received postoperative antibiotics after open or laparoscopic appendectomy.\" This packs many facts into one paragraph, making it hard to follow. Suggested rewrite: split into shorter sentences, e.g., \"We included eight studies (five randomised trials and three quasi‑randomised trials) that together enrolled 739 people – 370 received a drain and 369 did not. The studies were published between 1973 and 2023 in North America, Asia and Africa. They involved children and adults, most of whom had perforated appendicitis with peritonitis. All participants received antibiotics after open or laparoscopic surgery.\"\n3. **Jargon in methods** – \"We combined results in meta‑analyses where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\" Terms \"meta‑analyses\" and \"GRADE\" are not explained. Suggested rewrite: \"We pooled the results from similar studies to get an overall estimate, and we judged how trustworthy the evidence was using a standard system called GRADE (which looks at study quality, consistency, and how precise the results are).\"\n4. **Complex word density** – metrics show high counts of complex (124) and long (166) words, exceeding typical PLS ranges. Replacing words like \"intraperitoneal\", \"peritonitis\", \"quasi‑randomised\" with simpler alternatives where possible will lower the reading difficulty.\nThese issues together constitute more than three significant clarity problems, so the draft does not yet meet the readability standards for a patient‑focused Plain Language Summary.\n\n**Metric support**: The evaluation shows 15 passive‑voice constructions (P75) and elevated counts of complex words (124, P90) and long words (166, P90), confirming the editorial observations about jargon and sentence complexity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (66.7% of features in best quartile), but four metrics deviate: smog_index (14.1, P90), complex_words_dc (241, P90), complex_words (124, P90) and long_words (166, P90). These indicate higher than usual reading difficulty and word complexity, supporting the need to simplify language and shorten sentences."
