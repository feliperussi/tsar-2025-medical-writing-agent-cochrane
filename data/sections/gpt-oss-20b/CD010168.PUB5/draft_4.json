  "draft": "\"Is placing a drain (a tube to remove fluid) in the abdomen after surgery for a burst or perforated appendix effective at preventing belly infections (intraperitoneal abscess)?\"\n\nKey messages\n– Placing a drain after surgery for a burst or perforated appendix does not show a clear benefit in preventing belly infections, and the limited evidence suggests it may increase the risk of death.  \n– No reliable studies compared different drain types (open vs closed) or examined the best timing for removing a drain.  \n– Because the existing studies are small and have design problems, larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether drains are helpful and safe.\n\nWhat is complicated appendicitis and why does it matter?\nAppendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch attached to the large intestine. When the appendix dies (gangrenous) or bursts (perforated), the condition is called complicated appendicitis. This can spread infection to the lining of the abdomen (peritonitis) and may lead to painful pockets of pus inside the abdomen (intraperitoneal abscess) after surgery. Surgeons usually remove the appendix (appendectomy) through an open cut or a keyhole (laparoscopic) approach. Because the infection risk is higher, they sometimes place an abdominal drain—a thin tube that helps remove fluid or pus that might collect after the operation.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether using an abdominal drain after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis improves outcomes. Specifically we asked: (1) does a drain reduce infections or other complications compared with no drain? (2) do different drain types (open vs closed) give different results? (3) is there an optimal time to remove the drain?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several medical databases, trial registers and reference lists for randomised trials and quasi‑randomised trials (studies where participants were allocated to groups in a way that is close to random) that compared drainage with no drainage, or compared drain types or removal times after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. We pooled the results from similar studies to get an overall estimate, and we judged how trustworthy the evidence was using a standard system called GRADE (which looks at study quality, consistency and precision).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included eight studies (five randomised trials and three quasi‑randomised trials) that together enrolled 739 people – 370 received a drain and 369 did not. The studies were published between 1973 and 2023 in North America, Asia and Africa. They involved children and adults, most of whom had perforated appendicitis with peritonitis. All participants received antibiotics after open or laparoscopic surgery. The only comparison made was drain versus no drain; no study examined open versus closed drains or early versus late drain removal.\n\nMain results: effect on 30‑day mortality\nSeven deaths occurred among participants with a drain (out of 291) compared with one death among those without a drain (out of 290). This suggests that using a drain probably increases the risk of death within 30 days after surgery. For other outcomes—such as intraperitoneal abscess, wound infection, overall complications and length of hospital stay—the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in these findings because many studies were small, had a high risk of bias, and participants and clinicians often knew which treatment was given. Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, and the study populations and methods varied.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence up to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check that **all subheadings must be phrased as questions**. The subheading \"Main results: effect on 30‑day mortality\" is a statement, not a question, and therefore does not meet the Master Style Guide. In addition, three clarity‑style issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Long, compound sentence in the first key message** – \"Placing a drain (a tube to remove fluid) after surgery for a burst or perforated appendix does not show a clear benefit in preventing belly infections (intraperitoneal abscess), and the limited evidence suggests it may increase the risk of death.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words and mixes two ideas. *Rewrite*: \"Placing a drain after surgery for a burst or perforated appendix does not clearly reduce belly infections (intraperitoneal abscess). The limited evidence also suggests it may increase the risk of death.\"\n2. **Unexplained term “quasi‑randomised trials”** appears in the Methods paragraph without an immediate definition, which may leave lay readers puzzled. *Rewrite*: \"...quasi‑randomised trials (studies where participants are allocated to groups in a way that is close to random)…\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy sentence in the Results section** – \"Main results: effect on 30‑day mortality\" is a noun phrase rather than a question and contributes to the high noun count (165, beyond the typical P90 range). *Rewrite as a question*: \"What were the main results for 30‑day mortality?\"\nThese changes address the most impactful readability problems. Supporting metrics show the draft has a high noun count (165, P90) and a relatively high passive‑voice count (18, P75), confirming that reducing noun‑heavy and passive constructions will improve clarity. Overall, the draft meets factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but the subheading format violation and the identified clarity issues prevent approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (44% of features in best quartile). However, five metrics deviate: nouns (165, P90), SMOG index (14.5, P90), complex words (135, P90), Dale‑Chall complex words (257, P90), and long words (178, P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex/long words than typical PLS, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce noun density."
