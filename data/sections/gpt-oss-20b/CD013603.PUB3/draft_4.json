  "draft": "\"What do health workers think and experience when primary health services are combined (primary healthcare integration)?\n\nKey messages\n– Health workers see both good and difficult sides to combining services. They notice that care becomes more coordinated and better meets patient needs, but they also report higher workload, unclear roles, and a need for more training and support. No harmful effects of integration were reported.\n– The studies come from 37 countries and mostly use single‑time‑point interviews or focus‑group discussions (cross‑sectional designs). Only a few use longer‑term or in‑depth observation methods such as longitudinal studies or ethnography, so our picture of workers’ experiences is fragmented.\n– Because the evidence is diverse and often shallow, we recommend future research that follows workers over time, uses clear conceptual frameworks, and includes under‑studied regions.\n\nWhy is integrating primary health services important?\nPrimary health care (PHC) is the first point of contact for most people seeking health services, from routine check‑ups to treatment of common illnesses. In many low‑resource settings, services have been delivered in separate “vertical” programmes – for example, one programme for HIV, another for maternal health, and another for tuberculosis. This separation can cause duplication, gaps in care, and higher costs. Integrating these services means delivering several services together as a coordinated package. Integration is promoted worldwide as a way to make health systems more efficient and to move toward universal health coverage (UHC) – the goal that everyone can obtain the health services they need without financial hardship. The people who deliver care – doctors, nurses, community health workers, managers, and policymakers – play a key role in whether integration works well.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to map all qualitative research that explores health‑worker perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. Our goal was to describe the range of evidence – the types of services combined, the strategies used, the settings and countries studied, and the cadres of health workers involved – so that researchers and decision‑makers can better understand what influences successful integration.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that reported health‑worker views on PHC integration. We extracted key information from each study, counted how often different features appeared, and assessed our confidence in the overall results.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 184 distinct studies reported in 191 papers. The studies came from 37 countries, with an almost equal split between high‑income and low‑ and middle‑income settings. The United States, South Africa, and Uganda were the most represented high‑, middle‑, and low‑income countries.\n\nMost investigations used cross‑sectional designs (single‑time‑point interviews or focus‑group discussions). Only a few employed longer‑term or in‑depth observation methods such as longitudinal studies or ethnography.\n\nThe integration interventions covered six broad service streams:\n– mental and behavioural health;\n– HIV, tuberculosis and sexual‑reproductive health;\n– maternal, women and child health;\n– non‑communicable diseases;\n– general primary‑care services;\n– allied or specialised services.\nEach stream was described as either full or partial integration.\n\nWe identified three integration strategies:\n– bringing services together at the same level (horizontal integration);\n– adding new services to existing ones (service expansion);\n– linking separate services so they refer patients to each other (service linkage).\n\nA wide range of health‑worker cadres participated, including policymakers, senior and middle managers, frontline managers, clinicians, allied professionals, lay workers and support staff. The studies did not report the total number of individual participants, the duration of the integration interventions, or the funding sources. Overall, the evidence does not allow us to say whether integration improves health outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because the studies involve different types of workers, use varied integration approaches, and often have small sample sizes. The evidence does not cover all relevant people or settings, and the methodological diversity makes it hard to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur searches were completed in July 2020, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\"",

These changes address the most important clarity problems and also bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns (reducing nominalisations, nouns, and complex words).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but shows several metric deviations: nominalisations (32, beyond P90), noun count (215, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.6, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.35, beyond P90), and high counts of complex and long words. These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical PLS, supporting the need to simplify language, reduce nominalisations, and add plain‑language definitions."
