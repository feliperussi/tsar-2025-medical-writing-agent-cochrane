  "draft": "What do health workers think and experience when primary health services are combined (primary healthcare integration)?\n\nKey messages\n– Health workers report many thoughts and experiences about combining primary health services. They see benefits such as more coordinated care and better meeting patient needs, but they also describe challenges like higher workload, unclear roles, and the need for more training and support. No specific harmful effects of integration were reported.\n– Most studies asked health workers about their experiences at a single point in time (cross‑sectional design). Only a few followed workers over months or years (longitudinal design) or watched their daily work in detail (ethnographic design). This gives us only a partial picture of what workers experience.\n– Because many studies used brief, simple methods and involved small numbers of participants, we have low confidence in the overall picture. Future research should use longer‑term designs, clear conceptual frameworks, and include under‑studied regions.\n\nWhy is integrating primary health services important?\nPrimary health care (PHC) is the first point of contact for most people seeking health services, from routine check‑ups to treatment of common illnesses. In many low‑resource settings, services have been delivered in separate “vertical” programmes – for example, one programme for HIV, another for maternal health, and another for tuberculosis. This separation can cause duplication, gaps in care, and higher costs. Integrating these services means delivering several services together as a coordinated package. Integration is promoted worldwide as a way to make health systems more efficient and to move toward universal health coverage (UHC) – the goal that everyone can obtain the health services they need without financial hardship. The people who deliver care – doctors, nurses, community health workers, managers, and policymakers – play a key role in whether integration works well. Understanding how they perceive and experience integration can reveal why some efforts succeed while others do not.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to map all qualitative research that explores health‑worker perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. Our goal was to describe the range of evidence – the types of services combined, the strategies used, the settings and countries studied, and the cadres of health workers involved – so that researchers and decision‑makers can better understand what influences successful integration.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that reported health‑worker views on PHC integration. We extracted and counted key information from each study and assessed our confidence in the overall results.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 184 distinct studies reported in 191 papers. The studies came from 37 countries, with an almost equal split between high‑income and low‑ and middle‑income settings. The United States, South Africa, and Uganda were the most represented high‑, middle‑, and low‑income countries.\n\nMost investigations used cross‑sectional designs (single‑time‑point interviews or focus‑group discussions). Only a few employed longer‑term or in‑depth observation methods such as longitudinal studies (following participants over months or years) or ethnography (detailed observation of everyday work).\n\nThe integration work covered six groups of services:\n– mental and behavioural health\n– HIV, tuberculosis and sexual‑reproductive health\n– maternal, women and child health\n– non‑communicable diseases\n– general primary‑care services\n– allied or specialised services\n\nWe identified three ways integration is carried out:\n– horizontal integration – combining different services at the same level\n– service expansion – adding new services to what already exists\n– service linkage – linking separate services so patients can be referred between them\n\nA wide range of health‑worker cadres took part, including policymakers, senior and middle managers, frontline managers, clinicians, allied professionals, lay workers and support staff. The studies did not report the total number of participants, the duration of the integration interventions, or the funding sources. Because the studies did not measure health outcomes, we cannot say whether integration improves those outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies involved different kinds of health workers, used many integration approaches, and often had very small sample sizes. They also did not cover all the people and settings we need to understand.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nOur searches were completed in July 2020, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

Only a few followed workers for months or years (longitudinal design) or watched their daily work closely (ethnographic design).\"\n2. **Overly long, list‑heavy sentence** – \"The integration work covered six groups of services: – mental and behavioural health – HIV, tuberculosis and sexual‑reproductive health – maternal, women and child health – non‑communicable diseases – general primary‑care services – allied or specialised services\" is a single, dense sentence that is hard to follow.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We found that integration involved six groups of services:\\n   - mental and behavioural health\\n   - HIV, tuberculosis and sexual‑reproductive health\\n   - maternal, women and child health\\n   - non‑communicable diseases\\n   - general primary‑care services\\n   - allied or specialised services\"\n3. **Heavy nominalisation and noun‑rich phrasing** – The draft frequently uses noun‑heavy constructions such as \"The integration work covered…\" and \"We identified three ways integration is carried out…\" which increase reading difficulty (nominalisation count 32, nouns 229, far above typical PLS ranges).\n   *Rewrite:* Change nouns to verbs: \"We covered six groups of services\" and \"We identified three ways to carry out integration\".\nThese three issues are the most likely to confuse a patient‑oriented audience. Addressing them will also bring the text closer to the metric targets (reduce nominalisations, nouns, and complex words).

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit (717 words) and has acceptable readability scores (FRE 46.5, FKGL 11.6). However, several metrics deviate strongly: nominalisations (32, beyond P90), total nouns (229, beyond P90), SMOG (15.6, beyond P90), complex words (177) and long words (248) are all far above typical PLS ranges, indicating noun‑heavy, complex language that hampers readability. These metric signals support the editorial recommendation to reduce nominalisations and simplify wording."
