  "draft": "What do health workers think and experience when primary health services are combined (primary healthcare integration)?\n\nKey messages\n– Health workers see both benefits and challenges when services are combined. They say integration can make care more coordinated and better meet patient needs, but it can also increase workload, blur roles, and create a need for more training and support. No harmful effects of integration were reported.\n– Most studies used a single‑time‑point interview or focus‑group approach (called a cross‑sectional design). Only a few followed participants over months or years (longitudinal studies) or observed everyday work in detail (ethnography). This gives us a fragmented picture of workers’ experiences.\n– Because the evidence is diverse and often shallow, we have low confidence in the overall picture. We do not yet know if integrating services leads to better health outcomes because the studies did not measure this directly. Future research should follow workers over time, use clear conceptual frameworks, and include under‑studied regions.\n\nWhy is integrating primary health services important?\nPrimary health care (PHC) is the first point of contact for most people seeking health services, from routine check‑ups to treatment of common illnesses. In many low‑resource settings, services have been delivered in separate “vertical” programmes – for example, one programme for HIV, another for maternal health, and another for tuberculosis. This separation can cause duplication, gaps in care, and higher costs. Integrating these services means delivering several services together as a coordinated package. Integration is promoted worldwide as a way to make health systems more efficient and to move toward universal health coverage (UHC) – the goal that everyone can obtain the health services they need without financial hardship. The people who deliver care – doctors, nurses, community health workers, managers, and policymakers – play a key role in whether integration works well.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to map all qualitative research that explores health‑worker perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. Our goal was to describe the range of evidence – the types of services combined, the strategies used, the settings and countries studied, and the cadres of health workers involved – so that researchers and decision‑makers can better understand what influences successful integration.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that reported health‑worker views on PHC integration. We extracted key information from each study, counted how often different features appeared, and assessed our confidence in the overall results.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 184 distinct studies reported in 191 papers. The studies came from 37 countries, with an almost equal split between high‑income and low‑ and middle‑income settings. The United States, South Africa, and Uganda were the most represented high‑, middle‑, and low‑income countries.\n\nMost investigations used cross‑sectional designs (single‑time‑point interviews or focus‑group discussions). Only a few employed longer‑term or in‑depth observation methods such as longitudinal studies (following participants over months or years) or ethnography (detailed observation of everyday work).\n\nThe integration work looked at six groups of services:\n– mental and behavioural health\n– HIV, tuberculosis and sexual‑reproductive health\n– maternal, women and child health\n– non‑communicable diseases\n– general primary‑care services\n– allied or specialised services\n\nWe identified three ways integration is carried out:\n– We combine different services at the same level (horizontal integration).\n– We add new services to what already exists (service expansion).\n– We link separate services so patients can be referred between them (service linkage).\n\nA wide range of health‑worker cadres participated, including policymakers, senior and middle managers, frontline managers, clinicians, allied professionals, lay workers and support staff. The studies did not report the total number of participants, the duration of the integration interventions, or the funding sources. Overall, we do not yet know if integrating services improves health outcomes because the studies did not measure outcomes directly.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies involved different types of workers, used varied integration approaches, and often had small sample sizes. The evidence does not cover all relevant people or settings, and the methodological diversity makes it hard to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur searches were completed in July 2020, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

However, several clarity problems would likely confuse readers:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as \"cross‑sectional designs\", \"longitudinal studies\", \"ethnography\", \"horizontal integration\", \"service expansion\" and \"service linkage\" appear without plain‑language definitions.\n   *Rewrite example*: \"Most studies used a one‑time interview or focus‑group (called a cross‑sectional design). Only a few followed workers over months or years (longitudinal studies) or watched everyday work closely (ethnography).\"\n2. **Overly long, complex sentence in the limitations section** – \"We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the integration, because the evidence does not cover all of the people and settings we are interested in, and because the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words, repeats \"because\" and overloads the reader.\n   *Rewrite example*: \"We have little confidence in the evidence. The studies involved different types of workers, used many integration approaches, and often had very small sample sizes. They also did not cover all the people or settings we need to understand.\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy, abstract phrasing** – phrases like \"the integration work looked at six groups of services\" and \"the wide range of health‑worker cadres participated\" are dense and can be made more active.\n   *Rewrite example*: \"We examined six groups of services\" and \"Many types of health workers took part, including policymakers, managers, clinicians, allied professionals, lay workers and support staff.\"\nThese issues are reflected in the metric analysis: the draft shows very high counts of nominalizations (31), nouns (227), complex words (189), and long words (254), all well beyond typical PLS ranges, indicating a noun‑heavy, complex style that hampers readability. To meet Cochrane plain‑language standards, the draft should reduce jargon, shorten and split long sentences, and replace noun‑heavy constructions with active verbs.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate overall conformity. While word count and sentence length are within typical ranges, six metrics deviate strongly (nominalizations, nouns, SMOG index, complex words, complex words (Dale‑Chall), and long words) – all far above the median for PLS texts. This indicates the draft is overly noun‑heavy and uses many complex, multi‑syllable words, which aligns with the identified clarity issues."
