  "draft": "\"What do health workers think and experience when primary health services are combined (primary healthcare integration)?\n\nKey messages\n– Health workers see both benefits and challenges when services are combined. They notice more coordinated care and better meeting of patient needs, but also report higher workload, unclear roles, and a need for extra training and support. No harmful effects of integration were reported.\n– The studies come from 37 countries and mostly use single‑time‑point interviews or focus‑group discussions (cross‑sectional designs). Only a few use longer‑term or in‑depth observation methods, so our picture of workers’ experiences is fragmented.\n– Because the evidence is diverse and often shallow, we recommend future research that follows workers over time, uses clear conceptual frameworks, and includes under‑studied regions.\n\nWhy is integrating primary health services important?\nPrimary health care (PHC) is the first point of contact for most people seeking health services, from routine check‑ups to treatment of common illnesses. In many low‑resource settings, services have been delivered in separate “vertical” programmes (for example, separate programmes for HIV, maternal health, or tuberculosis). This separation can cause duplication, gaps in care, and higher costs. Integrating these services means delivering them together as a coordinated package. Integration is promoted worldwide as a way to make health systems more efficient and to move toward universal health coverage (UHC) – the goal that everyone can obtain the health services they need without financial hardship. The people who deliver care – doctors, nurses, community health workers, managers, and policymakers – play a key role in whether integration works well.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to map all qualitative research that explores health‑worker perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. Our goal was to describe the range of evidence – the types of services combined, the strategies used, the settings and countries studied, and the cadres of health workers involved – so that researchers and decision‑makers can better understand what influences successful integration.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that reported health‑worker views on PHC integration. We extracted key information from each study, counted how often different features appeared, and assessed the findings. We also judged how confident we could be in the overall results.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 184 distinct studies reported in 191 papers. The studies came from 37 countries, with an almost equal split between high‑income and low‑ and middle‑income settings. The United States, South Africa, and Uganda were the most represented high‑, middle‑, and low‑income countries. Most investigations used cross‑sectional designs (single‑time‑point interviews or focus‑group discussions). Only a few employed longer‑term or in‑depth observation methods such as longitudinal studies or ethnography.\n\nThe integration interventions covered six broad service streams:\n– mental and behavioural health;\n– HIV, tuberculosis and sexual‑reproductive health;\n– maternal, women and child health;\n– non‑communicable diseases;\n– general primary‑care services;\n– allied or specialised services.\nEach stream was described as either full or partial integration.\n\nWe identified three integration strategies:\n– horizontal integration (bringing services together at the same level);\n– service expansion (adding new services to existing ones);\n– service linkage (connecting separate services).\n\nA wide range of health‑worker cadres participated, including policymakers, senior and middle managers, frontline managers, clinicians, allied professionals, lay workers and support staff. The studies did not report the total number of individual participants, the duration of the integration interventions, or the funding sources. Overall, the evidence does not allow us to say whether integration improves health outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence because the studies involve different types of workers, use varied integration approaches, and often have small sample sizes. The evidence does not cover all relevant people or settings, and the methodological diversity makes it hard to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date with searches completed in July 2020.",

Three major issues will likely confuse readers: (1) extensive unexplained jargon (e.g., “cross‑sectional designs”, “horizontal integration”) leaves non‑expert audiences without needed definitions; (2) several sentences use passive constructions and noun‑heavy phrasing that obscure who did what (e.g., “The evidence is up to date with searches completed in July 2020.”); (3) long, noun‑dense sentences reduce readability (e.g., “The integration interventions covered six broad service streams…”) and contribute to high nominalisation (31 instances) and noun count (212), both far beyond typical PLS ranges. These clarity problems outweigh the acceptable word count and structural compliance. Suggested concrete rewrites are provided for each issue below. Reducing jargon, converting passive voice to active voice, and simplifying noun‑heavy sentences will bring the summary into line with Cochrane plain‑language standards and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits and has acceptable sentence length (18.44 words per sentence, P25). However, several metrics deviate markedly: nominalisation (31, BEYOND_P90), noun count (212, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15.5, BEYOND_P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.24, P90), complex words (173, BEYOND_P90) and long words (234, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many complex words, which aligns with the identified clarity issues."
