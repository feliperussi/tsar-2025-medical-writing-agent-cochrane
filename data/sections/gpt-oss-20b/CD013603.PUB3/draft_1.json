  "draft": "What do health workers think and experience when primary health services are combined (primary healthcare integration)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Health workers report a wide range of thoughts and experiences about combining primary health services (basic health care provided at the community level); many see potential benefits such as more coordinated care and better meeting patient needs, while others describe challenges like increased workload, unclear roles, and the need for more training and support. No specific harmful effects of integration (bringing together services that were previously separate) were reported in the studies.\n- The available studies come from a range of countries and mainly use single‑time‑point interviews or focus groups (cross‑sectional designs), with few long‑term or in‑depth observational approaches (ethnographic studies), resulting in a fragmented understanding of health workers’ experiences.\n- Because the existing research is diverse and often limited in depth, future work should use more rigorous, longitudinal designs and clear conceptual frameworks to explore how context, integration strategies, and worker roles influence experiences, especially in under‑studied regions.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is integrating primary health services important?\nPrimary health care (PHC) is the first point of contact for people seeking health services, covering everything from routine check‑ups to treatment of common illnesses. In many countries, especially those with limited resources, health services have been delivered in separate \"vertical\" programmes – for example, one programme for HIV, another for maternal health, and another for tuberculosis. This can lead to duplication, gaps in care, and higher costs. Integrating these services means delivering them together as a coordinated package, which is promoted worldwide as a way to improve the efficiency of health systems and to move toward universal health coverage (UHC) – the goal that everyone can obtain the health services they need without financial hardship. However, putting integration into practice has produced mixed results, partly because the people who deliver the services – doctors, nurses, community health workers, managers, and policymakers – play a key role in how well integration works. Understanding how these healthcare workers perceive and experience integration can reveal why some integration efforts succeed while others do not.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors set out to map all qualitative research that explores healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. Their goal was to describe the breadth and characteristics of this evidence – such as the types of health services being integrated, the strategies used, the settings and countries studied, and the range of healthcare workers involved – so that future researchers and decision‑makers can better understand the factors that influence the success of integration and can plan more effective studies and policies.\n\n**Methods**\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies reporting healthcare workers’ perceptions and experiences of primary‑healthcare integration, extracted and counted key information to describe the evidence base, and assessed our confidence in the findings.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe scoping review examined 184 distinct studies (reported in 191 papers) that explored healthcare workers’ perceptions and experiences of integrating services into primary health care. These studies came from 37 countries, with an approximately equal split between high‑income and low‑ and middle‑income settings; the United States was the most represented high‑income country, South Africa the most represented middle‑income country, and Uganda the most represented low‑income country. Most investigations used cross‑sectional qualitative designs, mainly interviews and focus‑group discussions, with only a few employing longitudinal or ethnographic methods. The integration interventions covered six broad health‑service streams—mental and behavioural health; HIV, tuberculosis and sexual‑reproductive health; maternal, women and child health; non‑communicable diseases; general primary‑care services; and allied/specialised services—and were described as either full or partial integration. Three integration strategies were identified: horizontal integration, service expansion, and service linkage. A wide range of healthcare‑worker cadres participated, including policymakers, senior and middle managers, frontline managers, clinicians, allied professionals, lay workers and support staff. The review did not report the total number of individual participants, the duration of the integration interventions, or the funding sources for the included studies. Overall, it is unclear whether primary health‑care integration has any effect on outcomes.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the integration, because the evidence does not cover all of the people and settings we are interested in, and because the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2020 of search.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the required check that all section subheadings must be phrased as questions. Current subheadings such as \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text contains several clarity and style problems that would confuse readers: (1) heavy use of passive voice (21 instances, far above the typical PLS range) and excessive nominalisation (33 instances) making sentences hard to follow; (2) long, jargon‑laden sentences that exceed 30 words and include technical terms without simple explanations (e.g., \"cross‑sectional qualitative designs\"); (3) noun‑heavy paragraphs with very high noun count (248) and long‑word density (LIX 62.5), reducing readability. These issues, together with the subheading format problem, mean the PLS does not meet the required standards.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Change each heading to a question. Example: replace \"Methods\" with \"What did we do?\".\n2. **Reduce passive voice** – Rewrite passive sentences in active voice. Example: original \"The review examined 184 distinct studies...\" → \"We examined 184 distinct studies...\".\n3. **Simplify jargon and shorten sentences** – Break long sentences and define terms. Example: original \"Most investigations used cross‑sectional qualitative designs, mainly interviews and focus‑group discussions, with only a few employing longitudinal or ethnographic methods.\" → \"Most studies used one‑off interviews or focus groups. Only a few used longer‑term or in‑depth observations (ethnography).\".\n4. **Limit nominalisations and noun‑heavy phrasing** – Use verbs instead of noun forms. Example: original \"The integration interventions covered six broad health‑service streams…\" → \"We integrated six broad health‑service streams…\".\n5. **Add paragraph breaks and bullet formatting** – Ensure a blank line before each heading and use dashes for bullet points.\n\nSupporting evidence: The PLS evaluation shows 21 passive constructions (P90), 33 nominalisations (BEYOND_P90), 248 nouns (BEYOND_P90), and high readability indices (Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 14.4, Gunning Fog 20.1) indicating the text is considerably more complex than typical PLS. Addressing the above and the subheading issue will bring the draft closer to the typical PLS pattern and satisfy the style guide.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is within the 850‑word limit but deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns. Readability scores are high (Flesch‑Kincaid 14.4, Gunning Fog 20.1) and many metrics are beyond the 90th percentile: passive voice (21), nominalisation (33), nouns (248), long words (296), and complex‑word counts. These indicate the text is overly complex, noun‑heavy, and uses too much passive construction, which reduces clarity for lay readers."
