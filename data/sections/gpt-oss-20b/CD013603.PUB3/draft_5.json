  "draft": "What do health workers think and experience when primary health services are combined (primary healthcare integration)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Health workers see both benefits and challenges when services are combined. They say integration can make care more coordinated and better meet patient needs, but it can also increase workload, blur roles, and create a need for more training and support. No harmful effects of integration were reported.\n– The studies come from 37 countries and mostly use single‑time‑point interviews or focus‑group discussions (cross‑sectional designs). Only a few use longer‑term or in‑depth observation methods such as longitudinal studies (research that follows people over months or years) or ethnography (detailed observation of everyday work). This means our picture of workers’ experiences is fragmented.\n– Because the evidence is diverse and often shallow, we have low confidence in the overall picture. This means we cannot be very sure about the exact impact of integration. Future research should follow workers over time, use clear conceptual frameworks, and include under‑studied regions.\n\nWhy is integrating primary health services important?\nPrimary health care (PHC) is the first point of contact for most people seeking health services, from routine check‑ups to treatment of common illnesses. In many low‑resource settings, services have been delivered in separate “vertical” programmes – for example, one programme for HIV, another for maternal health, and another for tuberculosis. This separation can cause duplication, gaps in care, and higher costs. Integrating these services means delivering several services together as a coordinated package. Integration is promoted worldwide as a way to make health systems more efficient and to move toward universal health coverage (UHC) – the goal that everyone can obtain the health services they need without financial hardship. The people who deliver care – doctors, nurses, community health workers, managers, and policymakers – play a key role in whether integration works well.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to map all qualitative research that explores health‑worker perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. Our goal was to describe the range of evidence – the types of services combined, the strategies used, the settings and countries studied, and the cadres of health workers involved – so that researchers and decision‑makers can better understand what influences successful integration.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that reported health‑worker views on PHC integration. We extracted key information from each study, counted how often different features appeared, and assessed our confidence in the overall results.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe examined 184 distinct studies reported in 191 papers. The studies came from 37 countries, with an almost equal split between high‑income and low‑ and middle‑income settings. The United States, South Africa, and Uganda were the most represented high‑, middle‑, and low‑income countries.\n\nMost investigations used cross‑sectional designs (single‑time‑point interviews or focus‑group discussions). Only a few employed longer‑term or in‑depth observation methods such as longitudinal studies or ethnography.\n\nThe integration work looked at six groups of services:\n– mental and behavioural health\n– HIV, tuberculosis and sexual‑reproductive health\n– maternal, women and child health\n– non‑communicable diseases\n– general primary‑care services\n– allied or specialised services\n\nWe identified three integration strategies:\n– horizontal integration (bringing different services together at the same level)\n– service expansion (adding new services to existing ones)\n– service linkage (connecting separate services so patients are referred between them)\n\nA wide range of health‑worker cadres participated, including policymakers, senior and middle managers, frontline managers, clinicians, allied professionals, lay workers and support staff. The studies did not report the total and the duration of the integration interventions, or the funding sources. Overall, the evidence does not show whether integration improves health outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies involved different types of workers, used varied integration approaches, and often had small sample sizes. The evidence does not cover all relevant people or settings, and the methodological diversity makes it hard to draw firm conclusions.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur searches were completed in July 2020, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

These issues exceed the threshold for significant clarity problems. Specific improvements needed are listed below.\n\n1. **Jargon without definition** – \"cross‑sectional designs\", \"longitudinal studies\" and \"ethnography\" are not explained.\n   *Rewrite*: \"Most studies used a single‑time‑point interview or focus‑group approach (called a cross‑sectional design). Only a few followed participants over months or years (longitudinal studies) or observed everyday work in detail (ethnography).\"\n\n2. **Overly long sentence with multiple parenthetical explanations** – \"We identified three integration strategies: horizontal integration (bringing different services together at the same level), service expansion (adding new services to existing ones), and service linkage (connecting separate services so patients are referred between them).\"\n   *Rewrite*: \"We identified three ways integration is carried out. First, horizontal integration combines different services at the same level. Second, service expansion adds new services to what already exists. Third, service linkage connects separate services so patients can be referred between them.\"\n\n3. **Noun‑heavy bullet points** – bullet items start with nouns like \"horizontal integration\" and \"service expansion\" rather than active verbs, making the text harder to follow.\n   *Rewrite*: \"- We combine different services at the same level (horizontal integration).\\n- We add new services to existing ones (service expansion).\\n- We link separate services so patients can move between them (service linkage).\"\n\n4. **Unclear statement about evidence** – \"The evidence does not show whether integration improves health outcomes.\" may leave readers unsure of what is known.\n   *Rewrite*: \"We do not yet know if integrating services leads to better health outcomes because the studies did not measure this directly.\"\n\n**Supporting metrics**: The PLS evaluation shows unusually high nominalisation (35, beyond the 90th percentile) and noun count (225, beyond the 90th percentile), as well as elevated SMOG (15.8) and complex‑worded counts, confirming the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many long, technical words. Reducing nominalisations and simplifying language will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns and improve readability for patients.",
