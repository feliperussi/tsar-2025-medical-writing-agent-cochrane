  "draft": "What do health workers think and experience when primary health services are combined (primary healthcare integration)?\n\nKey messages\n– Health workers see both benefits and challenges when services are combined. They say integration can make care more coordinated and better meet patient needs, but it can also increase workload, blur roles, and require more training and support. No harmful effects of integration were reported.\n– Most studies asked health workers about their experiences only once (cross‑sectional design). Only a few followed workers over months or years (longitudinal design) or watched their daily work in detail (ethnographic design). This gives us only a partial picture of what workers experience.\n– Because the evidence comes from many different settings and often uses shallow methods, we have low confidence in the overall picture. We do not yet know whether integration improves health outcomes because the studies did not measure outcomes directly. Future research should use longer‑term designs, clear conceptual frameworks, and include under‑studied regions.\n\nWhy is integrating primary health services important?\nPrimary health care (PHC) is the first point of contact for most people seeking health services, from routine check‑ups to treatment of common illnesses. In many low‑resource settings, services have been delivered in separate “vertical” programmes – for example, one programme for HIV, another for maternal health, and another for tuberculosis. This separation can cause duplication, gaps in care, and higher costs. Integrating these services means delivering several services together as a coordinated package. Integration is promoted worldwide as a way to make health systems more efficient and to move toward universal health coverage (UHC) – the goal that everyone can obtain the health services they need without financial hardship. The people who deliver care – doctors, nurses, community health workers, managers, and policymakers – play a key role in whether integration works well. Understanding how they perceive and experience integration can reveal why some efforts succeed while others do not.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to map all qualitative research that explores health‑worker perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. Our goal was to describe the range of evidence – the types of services combined, the strategies used, the settings and countries studied, and the cadres of health workers involved – so that researchers and decision‑makers can better understand what influences successful integration.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that reported health‑worker views on PHC integration. We extracted and counted key information from each study and assessed our confidence in the overall results.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 184 distinct studies reported in 191 papers. The studies came from 37 countries, with an almost equal split between high‑income and low‑ and middle‑income settings. The United States, South Africa, and Uganda were the most represented high‑, middle‑, and low‑income countries.\n\nMost investigations used cross‑sectional designs (single‑time‑point interviews or focus‑group discussions). Only a few employed longer‑term or in‑depth observation methods such as longitudinal studies (following participants over months or years) or ethnography (detailed observation of everyday work).\n\nThe integration work covered six groups of services:\n– mental and behavioural health\n– HIV, tuberculosis and sexual‑reproductive health\n– maternal, women and child health\n– non‑communicable diseases\n– general primary‑care services\n– allied or specialised services\n\nWe identified three ways integration is carried out:\n– horizontal integration – combining different services at the same level\n– service expansion – adding new services to what already exists\n– service linkage – linking separate services so patients can be referred between them\n\nA wide range of health‑worker cadres took part, including policymakers, senior and middle managers, frontline managers, clinicians, allied professionals, lay workers and support staff. The studies did not report the total number of participants, the duration of the integration interventions, or the funding sources. Because the studies did not measure health outcomes, we cannot say whether integration improves those outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies involved different kinds of health workers, used many integration approaches, and often had very small sample sizes. They also did not cover all the people and settings we need to understand.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nOur searches were completed in July 2020, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",
