  "draft": "\"What do health workers think and experience when primary health services are combined (primary healthcare integration)?\n\nKey messages\n– Health workers see both benefits and challenges when services are combined. They say integration can make care more coordinated and better meet patient needs, but it can also increase workload, blur roles, and create a need for more training and support. No harmful effects of integration were reported.\n– Most studies used a one‑time interview or focus‑group (called a cross‑sectional design). Only a few followed workers over months or years (longitudinal studies) or watched everyday work closely (ethnography). This gives us a fragmented picture of workers’ experiences.\n– Because the evidence is diverse and often shallow, we have low confidence in the overall picture. We do not yet know if integrating services leads to better health outcomes because the studies did not measure this directly. Future research should follow workers over time, use clear conceptual frameworks, and include under‑studied regions.\n\nWhy is integrating primary health services important?\nPrimary health care (PHC) is the first point of contact for most people seeking health services, from routine check‑ups to treatment of common illnesses. In many low‑resource settings, services have been delivered in separate “vertical” programmes – for example, one programme for HIV, another for maternal health, and another for tuberculosis. This separation can cause duplication, gaps in care, and higher costs. Integrating these services means delivering several services together as a coordinated package. Integration is promoted worldwide as a way to make health systems more efficient and to move toward universal health coverage (UHC) – the goal that everyone can obtain the health services they need without financial hardship. The people who deliver care – doctors, nurses, community health workers, managers, and policymakers – play a key role in whether integration works well. Understanding how they perceive and experience integration can reveal why some efforts succeed while others do not.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to map all qualitative research that explores health‑worker perceptions and experiences of PHC integration. Our goal was to describe the range of evidence – the types of services combined, the strategies used, the settings and countries studied, and the cadres of health workers involved – so that researchers and decision‑makers can better understand what influences successful integration.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that reported health‑worker views on PHC integration. We extracted and counted key information from each study and assessed our confidence in the overall results.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 184 distinct studies reported in 191 papers. The studies came from 37 countries, with an almost equal split between high‑income and low‑ and middle‑income settings. The United States, South Africa, and Uganda were the most represented high‑, middle‑, and low‑income countries.\n\nMost investigations used cross‑sectional designs (single‑time‑point interviews or focus‑group discussions). Only a few employed longer‑term or in‑depth observation methods such as longitudinal studies (following participants over months or years) or ethnography (detailed observation of everyday work).\n\nThe integration work looked at six groups of services:\n– mental and behavioural health\n– HIV, tuberculosis and sexual‑reproductive health\n– maternal, women and child health\n– non‑communicable diseases\n– general primary‑care services\n– allied or specialised services\n\nWe identified three ways integration is carried out:\n– horizontal integration – combining different services at the same level\n– service expansion – adding new services to what already exists\n– service linkage – linking separate services so patients can be referred between them\n\nMany types of health workers took part, including policymakers, senior and middle managers, frontline managers, clinicians, allied professionals, lay workers and support staff. The studies did not report the total number of participants, the duration of the integration interventions, or the funding sources. Overall, we do not yet know if integrating services improves health outcomes because the studies did not measure outcomes directly.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies involved different types of workers, used many integration approaches, and often had very small sample sizes. They also did not cover all the people or settings we need to understand.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur searches were completed in July 2020, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failed: the subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, which breaches the style guide requirement that all subheadings be question‑style. In addition, several clarity issues would likely confuse readers:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – Quote: \"Most studies used a one‑time interview or focus‑group (called a cross‑sectional design). Only a few followed workers over months or years (longitudinal studies) or watched everyday work closely (ethnography).\" Explanation: Terms like \"cross‑sectional design\", \"longitudinal\" and \"ethnography\" are technical and are not defined for a lay audience. Rewrite: \"Most studies asked health workers about their experiences just once (a \\\"cross‑sectional\\\" design). Only a few followed by months or years (a \\\"longitudinal\\\" study) or observed their daily work in detail (an \\\"ethnography\\\").\"\n2. **Overly long sentence in limitations** – Quote: \"We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the integration, because the evidence does not cover all of the people and settings we are interested in, and because the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\" Explanation: This 55‑word sentence is hard to follow and contains multiple \"because\" clauses. Rewrite: \"We have little confidence in the evidence. The studies involved different kinds of health workers, used many integration approaches, and often had very small sample sizes. They also did not‑cover all the people and settings we need to understand.\"\n3. **Unclear phrase \"fragmented picture\"** – Quote: \"This gives us a fragmented picture of workers’ experiences.\" Explanation: \"Fragmented picture\" may be vague for non‑experts. Rewrite: \"This means we only have a partial and incomplete view of what workers experience.\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy wording (high nominalisation and noun count)** – Example: \"The integration work looked at six groups of services\" and many other noun‑dense sentences. Explanation: Excessive nouns make the text harder to read (metrics show 32 nominalisations and 227 nouns, far above typical PLS ranges). Rewrite: Use more verbs: \"We examined six groups of services\"; \"We identified three ways integration is carried out\".\n5. **Missing question‑style heading for key messages** – Quote: \"Key messages\" Explanation: The heading should be a question to match the style guide, e.g., \"What are the main messages?\". Rewrite the heading accordingly.\nThese issues, together with the metric deviations (high nominalisation, noun count, SMOG index 15.9, and many complex words), indicate the draft needs the above revisions before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability scores are within typical PLS ranges (e.g., Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 45.9, FKGL 11.7). However, six metrics deviate strongly: nominalisation (32, BEYOND_P90), noun count (227, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15.9, BEYOND_P90), complex words (180, BEYOND_P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (327, BEYOND_P90) and long words (253, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex words, supporting the suggested rewrites to reduce nominalisation and simplify language."
