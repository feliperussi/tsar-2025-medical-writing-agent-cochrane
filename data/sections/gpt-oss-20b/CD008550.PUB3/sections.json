  "key_messages": [
    "Medication for gastro‑oesophageal reflux (acid reflux) in babies and children does not show a clear benefit in reducing symptoms, and there is no reliable evidence of important harms; the available studies are few and of low quality, so we cannot be confident about any effect.",
    "In infants, drugs such as omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor that reduces stomach acid), esomeprazole (a similar acid‑reducing medicine), and H2 antagonists (another type of acid‑reducing medicine) did not consistently improve crying, fussing or reflux measurements; in older children, proton pump inhibitors like rabeprazole and pantoprazole (both reduce stomach acid) may or may not improve symptoms, and the evidence remains uncertain.",
    "Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that follow children for longer periods, report both symptom changes and any side effects, and examine specific groups such as preterm babies (babies born before full term) and children with neurological problems (disorders affecting the nervous system)."

      "subheading": "What is gastro‑oesophageal reflux in children and why does it matter?",
      "content": "Gastro‑oesophageal reflux (GOR) is when the contents of the stomach flow back up into the oesophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach). In babies this often shows up as frequent spitting up or vomiting. About half of all infants under three months experience GOR, and while it usually gets better on its own as the child grows, some babies and older children keep having troublesome symptoms. When the reflux causes enough discomfort or health problems to need treatment, it is called gastro‑oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) – a term used by the UK’s NICE guidelines. Parents and doctors often try non‑medicine approaches first (like positioning or feeding changes), but when symptoms stay bothersome, medicines are considered. The most common drug groups used are proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole and pantoprazole, which reduce stomach acid, and H₂‑antagonists like ranitidine, which also lower acid. Alginates, which form a protective foam in the stomach, are another option."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to determine whether any of the medicines currently used for GOR in children actually help. Specifically, they wanted to assess the effects of pharmacological treatments – the drugs listed above – on symptoms, acid‑measuring tests (pH indices), and any other health outcomes in infants and children up to 16 years old. In other words, the review aimed to answer the question: do these medicines improve the condition, and if so, how much benefit do they provide?"

      "subheading": "What did we do?",

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 36 randomised controlled trials that enrolled a total of 2,251 infants and children up to 16 years of age with gastro‑oesophageal reflux (GOR) or gastro‑oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The trials compared a range of medicines – proton‑pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole), an H₂‑antagonist (ranitidine) and alginates – with placebo or with another active drug. The abstract did not give details about study duration, country of conduct or funding sources. The review found that it is unclear whether omeprazole improves symptoms in infants or offers any benefit over ranitidine, it is also unclear whether esomeprazole reduces symptoms in newborns, and the limited evidence suggests that rabeprazole and pantoprazole probably have little or no effect on symptoms in children, but the certainty of these findings is very low."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search."
