  "draft": "Are single‑incision sling surgeries (a tiny tape placed through the vaginal wall) as effective as other sling procedures for treating stress urinary incontinence (leaking when coughing or exercising) in women?\n\nKey messages  \n– Single‑incision slings (a tiny tape placed through a small incision in the front vaginal wall) improve stress urinary incontinence about as well as retropubic slings (a tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (a tape placed through the side of the pelvis). Women report their symptoms after roughly one year.  \n– Compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings probably reduce pain two years after surgery, lower the risk of mesh exposure (when the synthetic material becomes visible in the vagina), and probably reduce postoperative urinary retention (difficulty emptying the bladder). Quality of life may be slightly lower, but the evidence is limited.  \n– Very few women have been studied with autologous fascial slings (a sling made from the patient’s own tissue). Longer‑term, high‑quality research is needed to clarify safety and durability.\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and how is it usually treated?  \nStress urinary incontinence means urine leaks when pressure rises in the bladder, such as during coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting heavy objects. The leakage can be embarrassing and affect daily life. Most women first try pelvic‑floor muscle exercises, lifestyle changes, or a pessary (a small device that supports the bladder). When these measures do not help enough, doctors may offer surgery that adds support to the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). A common surgical option uses a thin piece of synthetic material, called a mid‑urethral sling (a tape placed under the urethra to keep it closed during pressure spikes).\n\nWhat are single‑incision sling operations?  \nA single‑incision sling is a newer, minimally invasive version of the mid‑urethral sling. The surgeon makes one tiny incision in the front wall of the vagina and threads a short synthetic tape through it to support the middle part of the urethra. The smaller operation may cause less pain, quicker recovery and fewer complications. Many countries limit the use of synthetic mesh because it can become exposed, erode into surrounding tissue, or cause painful sex.\n\nWhat did the authors want to find out?  \nWe asked three questions:  \n1. How well do single‑incision slings stop or reduce leakage compared with retropubic slings, transobturator slings, or autologous fascial slings?  \n2. What short‑ and long‑term side‑effects occur, such as pain, mesh problems, urinary retention or the need for further surgery?  \n3. Are single‑incision slings cost‑effective compared with other options?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE and trial registers) up to 20 September 2022. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared a single‑incision sling with another surgical option in women with stress‑predominant urinary incontinence. Two reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias and combined results using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 62 trials that enrolled 8 051 women. In these studies, a single‑incision sling was compared with an autologous fascial sling (1 trial), a retropubic sling (10 trials) or a transobturator sling (51 trials). Sixteen trials used the TVT‑Secur sling, which was withdrawn from the market in 2013; we reported those separately and excluded them from the main analysis.\n\nWe usually measured the primary outcome – women’s own report of cure or improvement – at 12 months after surgery.\n\nCompared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings made little or no difference to the chance of cure or improvement at one year. They probably reduced patient‑reported pain two years after surgery, lowered the risk of mesh exposure, and probably reduced postoperative urinary retention. Quality of life may be slightly lower at twelve months, and the evidence on painful intercourse remains uncertain.\n\nCompared with retropubic slings, single‑incision slings also made little or no difference to the chance of cure or improvement at one year. Evidence was uncertain for mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat continence surgery or mesh revision.\n\nOnly one small trial compared single‑incision slings with autologous fascial slings, providing insufficient data to draw firm conclusions about effectiveness or safety.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small, participants and clinicians often knew which surgery was performed, and study methods varied. These factors reduce our confidence in the results and limit how broadly we can apply them.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to September – 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions – the heading \"Key messages\" is not a question. In addition, the text shows several readability problems that would confuse patients: (1) many definitions use passive voice (e.g., \"a tiny tape placed through the vaginal wall\"), (2) the key‑message bullet points contain long, dense sentences, (3) the prose is noun‑heavy and includes many nominalisations, making sentences feel static. These issues are reflected in the metric report (22 passive constructions – P90, 24 nominalisations – P90, 235 nouns – BEYOND_P90, smog index 15.37 – BEYOND_P90). The draft therefore needs revision before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights several out‑of‑range metrics: passive_voice (22, P90), nominalization (24, P90), nouns (235, BEYOND_P90), smog_index (15.37, BEYOND_P90), dale_chall_readability (8.18, P90), complex_words_dc (358, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (164, BEYOND_P90), long_words (225, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need for active‑voice rewrites, shorter sentences, and reduced nominalisation."
