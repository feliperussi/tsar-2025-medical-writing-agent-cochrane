  "draft": "\"Are single‑incision sling surgeries (a tiny tape placed through the vaginal wall) as effective as other sling procedures for treating stress urinary incontinence (leaking when coughing or exercising) in women?\"\n\nKey messages  \n– Single‑incision slings (a minimally invasive tape placed through one small incision in the front vaginal wall) improve stress urinary incontinence about as well as retropubic slings (a tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (a tape placed through the side of the pelvis) when women report their symptoms after roughly one year.  \n– Compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings probably reduce pain two years after surgery, lower the risk of mesh exposure (when the synthetic material becomes visible in the vagina), and probably reduce urinary retention (difficulty emptying the bladder). Quality of life may be slightly lower, but the evidence is limited.  \n– Evidence on mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat surgery or mesh revision after retropubic slings is uncertain, and we have very little data comparing single‑incision slings with autologous? (a sling made from the patient’s own tissue). Longer‑term, high‑quality research is needed.\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and how is it usually treated?  \nStress urinary incontinence means urine leaks when pressure rises in the bladder, for example during coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting heavy objects. The leakage can be embarrassing and affect daily activities. Most women first try pelvic‑floor muscle exercises, lifestyle changes or a pessary (a small device that supports the bladder). When these measures do not help enough, doctors may offer surgery that adds support to the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). A common surgical option uses a thin piece of synthetic material, called a mid‑urethral sling, placed under the urethra.\n\nWhat are single‑incision sling operations?  \nA single‑incision sling is a newer, minimally invasive version of the mid‑urethral sling. The surgeon makes one tiny incision in the front wall of the vagina and threads a short synthetic tape through it to support the middle part of the urethra. The smaller operation may cause less pain, quicker recovery and fewer complications. Some countries restrict synthetic mesh because it can become exposed, erode into surrounding tissue, or cause painful sex (dyspareunia). One brand, TVT‑Secur, was withdrawn from the market in 2013; we reported those trials separately and did not include them in the main analysis.\n\nWhat did the authors want to find out?  \nWe asked three questions:  \n1. How well do single‑incision slings stop or reduce leakage compared with retropubic slings, transobturator slings, or autologous fascial slings (a sling made from the patient’s own tissue)?  \n2. What short‑ and long‑term side‑effects occur, such as pain, mesh problems, urinary retention or the need for further surgery?  \n3. Are single‑incision slings cost‑effective compared with other options?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE and trial registers) up to 20 September 2022. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared a single‑incision sling with another surgical option in women with stress‑predominant urinary incontinence. Two reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias and combined results using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 62 trials that enrolled 8 051 women. In these studies, a single‑incision sling was compared with an autologous fascial sling (1 trial), a retropubic sling (10 trials) or a transobturator sling (51 trials). Sixteen trials used the TVT‑Secur sling; we reported those separately and excluded them from the main analysis.\n\nWe usually measured the primary efficacy outcome at 12 months after surgery.  \n\nCompared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings made little or no difference to the chance of cure or improvement at one year. They probably reduced patient‑reported pain two years after surgery, lowered the risk of mesh exposure, and probably reduced postoperative urinary retention. Quality of life may be slightly lower at twelve months, and we are uncertain about the evidence on painful intercourse.\n\nCompared with retropubic slings, single‑incision slings also made little or no difference to the chance of cure or improvement at one year. Evidence was uncertain for mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat continence surgery or mesh revision.\n\nOnly one small trial compared single‑incision slings with autologous fascial slings, providing insufficient data to draw firm conclusions about effectiveness or safety.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small, participants and clinicians often knew which surgery was performed, and study methods varied. These factors reduce our confidence in the results and limit how broadly we can apply them.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to September 2022.",

(2) The first key‑message bullet is a single, very long sentence packed with multiple parenthetical definitions, making it hard to follow. (3) Technical terms such as \"mesh exposure, extrusion or erosion\" are introduced without a brief lay explanation, leaving readers unsure what these complications mean. Suggested rewrites: • Replace the typo with a clear definition: \"...very little data comparing single‑incision slings with autologous slings (a sling made from the patient’s own tissue).\" • Break the long bullet into two sentences: \"Single‑incision slings (a minimally invasive tape placed through a tiny incision in the vaginal wall) improve stress urinary incontinence about as well as retropubic slings (a tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (a tape placed through the side of the pelvis) when women report their symptoms after roughly one sentence. However, it is unclear whether they lead to more or fewer mesh exposures (when the synthetic material becomes visible in the vagina), urinary retention (difficulty emptying the bladder), or the need for repeat surgery, and there is no clear evidence of a difference in painful sex (dyspareunia).\" • Add a brief lay definition after the first mention: \"Mesh exposure, extrusion or erosion (situations where the synthetic tape becomes visible or damages surrounding tissue).\" These changes will improve readability and patient understanding. The PLS evaluation also shows unusually high noun count (243, beyond P90), many complex and long words, and a high SMOG index (15.85), reflecting the dense, noun‑heavy sentences identified.",
