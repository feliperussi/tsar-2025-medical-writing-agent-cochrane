  "draft": "Are single‑incision sling surgeries (a tiny tape placed through the vaginal wall) as effective as other sling procedures for treating stress urinary incontinence in women?\n\nKey messages  \n– Single‑incision slings (a minimally invasive tape placed through a tiny incision in the front vaginal wall) improve stress urinary incontinence about as well as retropubic slings (a tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (a tape placed through the side of the pelvis) when women report their symptoms after roughly one year. However, we cannot tell whether they cause more or fewer mesh exposures (when the synthetic material becomes visible in the vagina or damages surrounding tissue), urinary retention (difficulty emptying the bladder), or the need for repeat surgery, and there is no clear evidence of a difference in painful sex (dyspareunia).  \n– Compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings probably reduce pain two years after surgery, lower the risk of mesh exposure, and probably reduce postoperative urinary retention. Quality of life may be slightly lower, but the evidence is limited.  \n– Very few women have been studied with autologous fascial slings (a sling made from the patient’s own tissue), so we need longer‑term, high‑quality research to clarify safety and durability.\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and how is it usually treated?  \nStress urinary incontinence means urine leaks when pressure rises in the bladder, for example during coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting heavy objects. The leakage can be embarrassing and affect daily activities. Most women first try pelvic‑floor muscle exercises, lifestyle changes or a pessary (a small device that supports the bladder). When these measures do not help enough, doctors may offer surgery that adds support to the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). A common surgical option uses a thin piece of synthetic material, called a mid‑urethral sling, placed under the urethra.\n\nWhat are single‑incision sling operations?  \nA single‑incision sling is a newer, minimally invasive version of the mid‑urethral sling. The surgeon makes one tiny incision in the front wall of the vagina and threads a short synthetic tape through it to support the middle part of the urethra. The smaller operation may cause less pain, quicker recovery and fewer complications. Some countries limit the use of synthetic mesh because it can become exposed, erode into surrounding tissue, or cause painful sex.\n\nWhat did the authors want to find out?  \nWe asked three questions:  \n1. How well do single‑incision slings stop or reduce leakage compared with retropubic slings, transobturator slings, or autologous fascial slings?  \n2. What short‑ and long‑term side‑effects occur, such as pain, mesh problems, urinary retention or the need for further surgery?  \n3. Are single‑incision slings cost‑effective compared with other options?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE and trial registers) up to 20 September 2022. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared a single‑incision sling with another surgical option in women with stress‑predominant urinary incontinence. Two reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias and combined results using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 62 trials that enrolled 8 051 women. In these studies, a single‑incision sling was compared with an autologous fascial sling (1 trial), a retropubic sling (10 trials) or a transobturator sling (51 trials). Sixteen trials used the TVT‑Secur sling, which was withdrawn from the market in 2013; we reported those separately and excluded them from the main analysis.\n\nWe usually measured the primary outcome – women’s own report of cure or improvement – at 12 months after surgery.  \n\nCompared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings made little or no difference to the chance of cure or improvement at one year. They probably reduced patient‑reported pain two years after surgery, lowered the risk of mesh exposure, and probably reduced postoperative urinary retention. Quality of life may be slightly lower at twelve months, and the evidence on painful intercourse remains uncertain.  \n\nCompared with retropubic slings, single‑incision slings also made little or no difference to the chance of cure or improvement at one year. Evidence was uncertain for mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat continence surgery or mesh revision.  \n\nOnly one small trial compared single‑incision slings with autologous fascial slings, providing insufficient data to draw firm conclusions about effectiveness or safety.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small, participants and clinicians often knew which surgery was performed, and study methods varied. These factors reduce our confidence in the results and limit how broadly we can apply them.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required completeness, title/subheading format, factual accuracy and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse patients:\n1. **Overly long key‑message sentence** – \"Single‑incision slings (a minimally invasive tape placed through a tiny incision in the front vaginal wall) improve stress urinary incontinence about as well as retropubic slings (a tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (a tape placed through the side of the pelvis) when women report their symptoms after roughly one year.\" This 38‑word sentence packs three concepts together and is hard to follow. *Rewrite*: \"Single‑incision slings (a tiny tape placed through a small incision in the front vaginal wall) improve stress urinary incontinence about as well as retropubic slings (a tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (a tape placed through the side of the pelvis). Women report their symptoms after roughly one year.\"\n2. **Passive voice that hides the actor** – e.g., \"The primary outcome was usually measured at 12 months after surgery.\" Passive phrasing makes it unclear who did the measurement. *Rewrite*: \"We usually measured the primary outcome at 12 months after surgery.\"\n3. **Heavy noun‑density and nominalisations** – sentences such as \"The evidence ranged from high to low certainty\" and \"The primary efficacy outcome was usually measured\" use many nouns and abstract forms, increasing reading difficulty. *Rewrite*: \"The certainty of the evidence varied from high to low\" and \"We usually measured the primary efficacy outcome.\"\n4. **Key‑messages presented as a single paragraph instead of separate bullet points** – patients find short, bulleted statements easier to scan. *Rewrite*: break the key messages into three separate dash‑started bullet points, each focusing on a single finding.\n5. **Occasional unexplained technical term** – the term \"mid‑urethral sling\" appears in the introduction without a plain‑language definition. Adding a brief explanation (e.g., \"a thin piece of synthetic material placed under the urethra to support it\") would aid comprehension.\nThese issues are reflected in the metric report: passive voice count is 20 (P90, higher than typical), nominalisations 27 (P90), noun count 244 (beyond P90), and readability indices (SMOG 15.85, Dale‑Chall 8.17) are well above the usual range, confirming the draft is more complex than typical Cochrane PLS texts. Addressing the points above will bring the summary back into the expected readability and style range.\n**Overall judgment:** Not approved until the identified clarity and style issues are resolved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate overall conformity but several metrics deviate strongly: passive voice (20, P90), nominalisation (27, P90), noun count (244, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.85, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.17, P90), and high counts of complex and long words. These indicate the draft is more complex and noun‑heavy than typical Cochrane plain‑language summaries, supporting the need for the suggested revisions."
