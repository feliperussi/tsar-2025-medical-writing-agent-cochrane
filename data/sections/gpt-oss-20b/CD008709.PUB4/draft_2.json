  "draft": "Are single‑incision sling surgeries (a tiny tape placed through the vaginal wall) as effective as other sling procedures for treating stress urinary incontinence (leaking when coughing or exercising) in women?\n\nKey messages  \n– Single‑incision slings improve stress urinary incontinence, about as well as retropubic slings (tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (tape placed through the side of the pelvis) after roughly one year.  \n– Compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings may cause less post‑operative pain and possibly fewer cases of urinary retention, while showing similar rates of mesh exposure; quality of life may be slightly lower, but certainty is limited.  \n– Longer‑term, high‑quality research is needed to clarify safety, mesh‑related complications, repeat surgery and quality‑of‑life effects.\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and how is it usually treated?  \nStress urinary incontinence means urine leaks when pressure increases in the bladder, such as during coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting. It can be embarrassing and affect daily activities. Most women first try pelvic‑floor exercises, lifestyle changes or a pessary (a small device that supports the bladder). Use active voice.\n\nWhat are single‑incision sling operations?  \nA single‑incision sling is a newer, minimally invasive version of the mid‑urethral sling. The surgeon makes one tiny incision in the and then threads a short synthetic tape through it to support the middle part of the urethra. The goal is less pain, quicker recovery and fewer complications, although many countries restrict synthetic mesh because it can become exposed, erode into tissue or cause painful sex (dyspareunia).\n\nWhat did the authors want to find out?  \nThe review asked three questions: (1) How well do single‑incision slings stop or reduce leakage compared with retropubic, transobturator or autologous fascial slings? (2) What short‑ and long‑term side‑effects occur, such as pain, mesh problems, urinary retention or need for further surgery? (3) Are single‑incision slings cost‑effective compared with other options?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE and trial registers, up to 20 September 2022. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared a single‑incision sling with another surgical option in women with stress‑predominant urinary incontinence. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias, then we combined results using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 62 trials involving 8 051 women. All compared a single‑incision sling with either an autologous fascial sling (1 trial), a retropubic sling (10 trials) or a transobturator sling (51 trials). Sixteen trials used the TVT‑Secur sling, which was withdrawn from the market in 2013; we reported these separately and excluded them from the main analysis.\n\nCompared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings made little or no difference to the chance of cure or improvement at one year. They probably reduced pain reported two years after surgery, lowered the risk of mesh exposure or erosion, and probably reduced postoperative urinary retention. Quality of life may be slightly lower at twelve months, and evidence on painful intercourse remains uncertain.\n\nCompared with retropubic slings, single‑incision slings also showed little or no difference in cure or improvement at one year. Evidence on mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat surgery or mesh revision was uncertain.\n\nOnly one small trial compared single‑incision slings with autologous fascial slings, providing insufficient data to draw firm conclusions about effectiveness or side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small, participants and clinicians often knew which surgery was performed, and study methods varied. These factors reduce our confidence in the results and limit how broadly we can apply them.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several reader‑confusing problems:\n1. **Missing word** – In the \"What are single‑incision sling operations?\" section the sentence reads: \"The surgeon makes one tiny incision in the and then threads a short synthetic tape…\" The phrase \"in the\" is incomplete and leaves the reader unsure where the incision is made. **Rewrite:** \"The surgeon makes one tiny incision in the front wall of the vagina and then threads a short synthetic tape through it to support the middle part of the urethra.\"\n2. **Editorial instruction left in the text** – The line \"Use active voice.\" appears as part of the summary, which is confusing for readers. **Rewrite:** Delete the line entirely; the surrounding sentences are already in active voice.\n3. **Overly long bullet sentence** – The first key‑message bullet is a single 30‑plus‑word sentence: \"Single‑incision slings improve stress urinary incontinence, about as well as retropubic slings (tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (tape placed through the side of the pelvis) after roughly one year.\" This can be split for easier reading. **Rewrite:** \"Single‑incision slings improve stress urinary incontinence about as well as other sling types. After roughly one year, they work as well as retropubic slings (tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (tape placed through the side of the pelvis).\"\n4. **Unexplained jargon** – The phrase \"mesh exposure, extrusion or erosion\" is used without a simple definition. Many patients may not know what these terms mean. **Rewrite:** \"mesh exposure (the tape becoming visible in the vagina), extrusion (the tape pushing out of the tissue) or erosion (the tape wearing away into surrounding tissue).\"\n5. **Noun‑heavy sentences** – The draft contains many noun‑dense constructions (e.g., \"single‑incision sling operations\" repeated, long noun phrases). This is reflected in the metrics (195 nouns, 145 complex words, 194 long words) which are well above typical PLS ranges and reduces readability. Re‑write sentences to use more verbs and fewer nouns, e.g., change \"The primary efficacy outcome was usually measured at 12 months after surgery\" to \"We usually measured how well the surgery worked 12 months later.\"\nThese issues together would likely confuse or frustrate a lay reader, so the PLS cannot be approved in its current form.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 53.8, FKGL 10.1) are within the best quartile. However, several metrics deviate strongly: nouns (195, P90), complex words (145, P90), long words (194, P90), and especially complex_words_dc (297, BEYOND_P90). These indicate a noun‑heavy, jargon‑rich style that hampers plain‑language clarity, supporting the editorial recommendations above."
