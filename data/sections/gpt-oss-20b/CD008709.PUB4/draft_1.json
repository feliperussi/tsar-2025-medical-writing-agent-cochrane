  "draft": "Are single-incision sling surgeries (a tiny tape placed through the vaginal wall) as effective as other sling procedures for treating stress urinary incontinence (leaking when coughing or exercising) in women?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Single‑incision slings (a minimally invasive tape placed through a tiny incision in the vaginal wall) seem to improve stress urinary incontinence about as well as retropubic slings (a tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (a tape placed through the side of the pelvis) when patients report their symptoms after roughly one year; however, it is unclear whether they lead to more or fewer mesh exposures (when the synthetic material becomes visible in the vagina), urinary retention (difficulty emptying the bladder), or the need for repeat surgery, and there is no clear evidence of a difference in painful sex (dyspareunia).\n- When compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings may cause less post‑operative pain and possibly fewer cases of urinary retention, while showing similar rates of mesh exposure; some evidence suggests quality of life may be slightly lower with single‑incision slings, but overall the certainty of these findings is limited.\n- Longer‑term, high‑quality research is needed to clarify the safety and durability of single‑incision slings, especially regarding mesh‑related complications, repeat procedures, and their impact on quality of life.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and how is it usually treated?\nStress urinary incontinence is a condition where women leak urine when they cough, sneeze, laugh, or lift heavy objects – basically any activity that puts pressure on the bladder. This leakage can be embarrassing, affect daily life, and lead to extra costs for pads, laundry, and medical visits. Many women try non‑surgical options first, such as pelvic‑floor muscle exercises, lifestyle changes, or a small device called a pessary that supports the bladder. When these measures do not help enough, doctors may offer surgical options that add support to the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). One common type of surgery uses a thin piece of synthetic material, called a mid‑urethral sling, placed under the urethra to keep it closed during pressure spikes.\n\nWhat are single‑incision sling operations?\nA single‑incision sling is a newer, minimally‑invasive version of the mid‑urethral sling. Instead of making several small cuts, the surgeon makes just one tiny incision in the front wall of the vagina and threads a short synthetic tape through it to support the middle part of the urethra. The idea is that a smaller operation might cause less pain, quicker recovery, and fewer complications. However, many countries have placed limits on the use of synthetic mesh (the material of the sling) because of concerns about rare but serious problems such as the mesh becoming exposed, eroding into surrounding tissue, or causing pain during sex.\n\nWhat did the authors want to find out about single‑incision sling operations?\nThe review authors set out to answer three main questions: (1) How well do single‑incision slings work in stopping or reducing urine leakage compared with other surgical options, such as the traditional retropubic sling, the transobturator sling, or a sling made from the patient’s own tissue (autologous fascial sling)? (2) What are the short‑ and long‑term side‑effects of single‑incision slings, including pain, problems with the mesh, urinary retention, or the need for additional surgery? (3) Are single‑incision slings cost‑effective compared with other treatments? By gathering evidence from many randomised trials, the authors hoped to clarify whether this newer, less invasive procedure is as safe and effective as the established options and whether it offers any advantages for women with stress urinary incontinence.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared single‑incision slings with other treatments for stress urinary incontinence in women, combined the results across those studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 62 randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that together enrolled 8,051 adult women with stress urinary incontinence (or stress‑predominant mixed incontinence). All studies compared a single‑incision mid‑urethral sling with one of three reference procedures: autologous fascial slings (1 study with 70 women), retropubic slings (10 studies), or transobturator slings (51 studies). Sixteen trials used the TVT‑Secur sling, which was withdrawn from the market in 2013; these were reported separately and not included in the main analysis. No trials compared single‑incision slings with no treatment, conservative therapy, colposuspension, or laparoscopic procedures. The primary efficacy outcome was usually measured at 12 months after surgery. Details such as participants’ exact ages, severity of incontinence, funding sources, or geographic locations of the trials were not provided in the abstract.\n\nMain results: Effectiveness and safety of single‑incision slings\nCompared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings made little or no difference to the chance of being cured or improved at one year. They probably reduced the amount of pain patients reported two years after surgery, lowered the risk of mesh exposure, extrusion or erosion, and probably reduced postoperative urinary retention. However, they may lead to a slightly lower quality of life at twelve months, and it is unclear whether they affect painful intercourse. Compared with retropubic slings, single‑incision slings also made little or no difference to the chance of cure or improvement at one year, and the evidence was uncertain for mesh exposure, urinary retention, the need for repeat surgery, or mesh revision. Evidence was also unclear for comparisons with autologous fascial slings.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, studies were very small, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators or outcomes we are interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.",

(2) The total word count is 990, exceeding the 850‑word limit for a Plain Language Summary. These issues prevent approval even though the factual content is accurate. To meet the guidelines, the author should rewrite subheadings as questions and trim the text by about 140 words, focusing on concise language and reducing passive constructions and noun‑heavy sentences.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Key messages\". Problem: Not a question, violating style rule 5.3. Rewrite as: \"What are the main findings?\".\n2. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Methods\". Problem: Not a question. Rewrite as: \"How did we find the evidence?\".\n3. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Results\". Problem: Not a question. Rewrite as: \"What did we find?\".\n4. **Word count** – The draft is 990 words (over the 850‑word limit). Problem: Too long for a PLS, making it harder for patients to read. Suggested action: Remove redundant phrases, combine overlapping sentences, and delete less essential details such as the exact number of trials using TVT‑Secur unless critical.\n5. **Passive voice and noun‑heavy sentences** – Quote: \"The primary efficacy outcome was usually measured at 12 months after surgery.\" Problem: Passive construction and noun‑heavy, reduces clarity. Rewrite as: \"We measured the main outcome 12 months after surgery.\".\n\nSupporting evidence: The PLS evaluation shows 26 passive‑voice instances (beyond typical PLS range), 36 nominalizations, 314 nouns, and a SMOG index of 17.25, all indicating the text is overly complex and dense. Reducing passive voice, nominalizations, and long words will help lower these metrics and improve readability for a lay audience.",
