  "draft": "Are single‑incision (a tiny tape placed through the vaginal wall) as effective as other sling procedures for treating stress urinary incontinence (leaking when coughing or exercising) in women?\n\nWhat are the main findings?  \n– Single‑incision slings (a minimally invasive tape placed through one small incision in the front wall of the vagina) improve stress urinary incontinence about as well as retropubic slings (tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (tape placed through the side of the pelvis) when women report their symptoms after roughly one year.  \n– Compared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings probably cause less post‑operative pain and may lower the risk of urinary retention (difficulty emptying the bladder). They show similar rates of mesh exposure (the synthetic material becoming visible in the vagina), mesh extrusion (the material pushing out of the tissue) or mesh erosion (the material wearing into surrounding tissue). Quality of life may be slightly lower, but the evidence is limited.  \n– Longer‑term, high‑quality research is needed to clarify safety, repeat‑surgery rates and quality‑of‑life effects.\n\nWhat is stress urinary incontinence and how is it usually treated?  \nStress urinary incontinence means urine leaks when pressure rises in the bladder, for example during coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting. The leakage can be embarrassing and affect daily activities. Most women first try pelvic‑floor muscle exercises, lifestyle changes or a pessary (a small device that supports the bladder). When these measures do not help enough, doctors may offer surgery that adds support to the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body).\n\nWhat are single‑incision sling operations?  \nA single‑incision sling is a newer, minimally invasive version of the mid‑urethral sling. The surgeon makes one tiny incision in the front wall of the vagina and threads a short synthetic tape through it to support the middle part of the urethra. The goal is less pain, quicker recovery and fewer complications. Many countries restrict synthetic mesh because it can become exposed, extrude, erode, or cause painful sex (dyspareunia).\n\nWhat did the authors want to find out?  \nWe asked three questions: (1) How well do single‑incision slings stop or reduce leakage compared with retropubic slings, transobturator slings, or autologous fascial slings (made from the patient’s own tissue)? (2) What short‑ and long‑term side‑effects occur, such as pain, mesh problems, urinary retention or the need for further surgery? (3) Are single‑incision slings cost‑effective compared with other options?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE and trial registers) up to 20 September 2022. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared a single‑incision sling with another surgical option in women with stress‑predominant urinary incontinence. Two reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias and combined results using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 62 trials involving 8 051 women. All trials compared a single‑incision sling with either an autologous fascial sling (1 trial), a retropubic sling (10 trials) or a transobturator sling (51 trials). Sixteen trials used the TVT‑Secur sling, which was withdrawn from the market in 2013; we reported these separately and excluded them from the main analysis.\n\nCompared with transobturator slings, single‑incision slings made little or no difference to the chance of cure or improvement at one year. They probably reduced pain reported two years after surgery, lowered the risk of mesh exposure, extrusion or erosion, and probably reduced postoperative urinary retention. Quality of life may be slightly lower at twelve months, and evidence on painful intercourse remains uncertain.\n\nCompared with retropubic slings, single‑incision slings also showed little or no difference in cure or improvement at one year. Evidence on mesh exposure, urinary retention, repeat surgery or mesh revision was uncertain.\n\nOnly one small trial compared single‑incision slings with autologous fascial slings, providing insufficient data to draw firm conclusions about effectiveness or side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small, participants and clinicians often knew which surgery was performed, and study methods varied. These factors reduce our confidence in the results and limit how broadly we can apply them.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural and factual requirements, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader. 1) The first bullet point is a single, very long sentence packed with multiple parenthetical explanations, making it hard to follow. 2) Passive constructions such as \"The primary efficacy outcome was usually measured at 12 months after surgery\" obscure who did the measuring. 3) Noun‑heavy phrasing like \"made little or no difference to the chance of cure or improvement\" is awkward and difficult to parse. 4) The term \"post‑operative\" is technical and could be replaced with simpler language. 5) Several sentences exceed 30 words, exceeding the recommended length for plain‑language text. These issues reduce readability despite the overall good metric scores.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Problematic sentence: \"– Single‑incision slings (a minimally invasive tape placed through one small incision in the front wall of the vagina) improve stress urinary incontinence about as well as retropubic slings (tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (tape placed through the side of the pelvis) when women report their symptoms after roughly one year.\"\n   Why: The sentence is long, contains three nested parenthetical definitions, and overloads the reader with information.\n   Rewrite: \"– Single‑incision slings are a minimally invasive tape placed through one small incision in the front wall of the vagina. They improve stress urinary incontinence about as well as retropubic slings (tape placed behind the pubic bone) and transobturator slings (tape placed through the side of the pelvis) when women report their symptoms after about one year.\"\n\n2. Problematic sentence: \"The primary efficacy outcome was usually measured at 12 months after surgery.\"\n   Why: Passive voice hides the actor and makes the sentence less direct.\n   Rewrite: \"We usually measured the primary efficacy outcome at 12 months after surgery.\"\n\n3. Problematic phrase: \"made little or no difference to the chance of cure or improvement\"\n   Why: Awkward noun‑heavy construction; readers may not understand what is being compared.\n   Rewrite: \"made little or no difference in the chance of being cured or improved.\"\n\n4. Problematic term: \"post‑operative pain\"\n   Why: Technical term that may be unfamiliar to patients.\n   Rewrite: \"pain after surgery\"\n\n5. Problematic sentence (over 30 words): \"They probably reduced pain reported two years after surgery, lowered the risk of mesh exposure, extrusion or erosion, and probably reduced postoperative urinary retention.\"\n   Why: Long, compound sentence that combines three separate findings.\n   Rewrite: \"They probably reduced pain two years after surgery. They also lowered the risk of mesh exposure, extrusion, or erosion, and probably reduced urinary retention after surgery.\"\n\nThese rewrites address the most confusing elements and bring the text closer to the plain‑language style recommended in the Master Style Guide.\n\nMetrics support: The evaluation shows high nominalisation (21, beyond typical), a very high noun count (225, beyond P90), and elevated complex‑word counts (complex_words = 161, long_words = 218). These numbers explain the noun‑heavy, complex phrasing identified above and justify the suggested simplifications.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on overall conformity (61% of features in best quartile) and meets word‑count limits, but it deviates strongly on several lexical metrics: nominalisations, nouns, SMOG index, Dale‑Chall readability, complex‑word and long‑word counts are all beyond the P90 range, indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical Cochrane PLSs. These metric outliers align with the identified clarity issues."
