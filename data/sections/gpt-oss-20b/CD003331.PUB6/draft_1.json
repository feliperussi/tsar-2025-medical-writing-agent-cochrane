  "draft": "Does an exercise program for heart failure patients (exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation) improve survival, lower hospital admissions, and enhance quality of life in adults?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised exercise program for people with heart failure) does not appear to change the chance of dying, but it probably reduces the chance of being admitted to hospital (hospital admission) and improves how patients feel about their health (health‑related quality of life); no harmful effects were reported, although the overall evidence is limited, so confidence in these findings is modest.\n- The studies showed similar benefits whether the programme was delivered in a centre‑based setting (exercise done at a clinic or hospital) or a home‑based setting (exercise done at home), and whether it included only exercise or also additional support such as education, but most participants had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), meaning people with other types of heart failure were under‑represented.\n- Future research should include more older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and should examine longer‑term effects on survival and other outcomes.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is heart failure and why is it a problem?\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart cannot pump blood as well as it should. This leads to symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness and fluid buildup, which make everyday activities hard. People with heart failure often have a reduced ability to exercise, a lower health‑related quality of life (HRQoL), a higher chance of dying, and they are frequently admitted to hospital. These problems also create high costs for the health‑care system.\n\nWhat is exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation and how is it usually delivered?\nExercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) is a structured programme that uses physical activity – such as walking, cycling or resistance training – to improve the heart’s function and the person’s overall wellbeing. It can be offered in a hospital or clinic (centre‑based) or at home, sometimes with digital support. ExCR may be provided on its own or as part of a broader cardiac rehabilitation programme that also includes education, psychological support and medication management. In past research most participants were men with a type of heart failure called reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF – the heart’s pumping ability is below 45%). Women, older adults and people with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF – the heart pumps normally but still cannot fill properly) have been less studied.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to determine whether taking part in exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation, compared with usual care that does not include exercise, changes the risk of death, the chance of being admitted to hospital, and the health‑related quality of life for adults living with heart failure. They also looked at whether the way the programme is delivered (centre‑based vs home‑based, type of exercise, or inclusion of other rehabilitation components) influences these outcomes.\n\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation with usual care in adults with heart failure, combined their results to assess effects on mortality, hospital admissions and quality of life, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 60 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 8,728 adults (aged 18 years or older) with heart failure. The median follow‑up time for the interventions was six months, and every trial met a minimum six‑month follow‑up requirement. Most participants had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and were classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III. Women, older adults and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction were less common, although newer studies are beginning to include more of these groups. The trials were mainly carried out in centre‑based or hospital settings, with an emerging group delivering exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation at home or through digital platforms. The studies came from a broad international evidence base, though specific countries were not listed. All interventions involved exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation—either exercise alone or as part of a comprehensive programme—compared with usual medical care that did not include exercise; some trials also used active comparators such as education, psychological support or additional medical management. No information on funding sources was provided in the abstract.\n\nMain results: Hospital admissions\nExercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the chance of being admitted to any hospital. For every 100 people with heart failure who take part in the programme, about eight fewer are admitted to any hospital compared with usual care (moderate certainty). It also probably reduces heart‑failure‑related admissions slightly – roughly one fewer admission per 100 people (moderate certainty). In addition, exercise probably improves health‑related quality of life, meaning people feel better about their health and daily activities (moderate certainty). The evidence does not show a clear difference in overall death rates; it may make little or no difference to mortality (low certainty).\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the evidence does not cover all of the people we are interested in, such as older patients, women, and those with a different type of heart failure, and the studies were very small or had few events, so we cannot be sure about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails two critical checks: (1) Subheadings are not phrased as questions as required by the style guide (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Methods\", \"Results\"), and (2) the total word count is 920, exceeding the 850‑word limit. In addition, the text contains several clarity and style problems that would confuse readers and are reflected in the metric analysis (54 passive constructions, 51 nominalisations, 278 nouns, and many long/complex words). \n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Change all section headings to question form. Example: replace \"Key messages\" with \"What are the main findings?\"; replace \"Methods\" with \"How did we find and analyse the evidence?\"; replace \"Results\" with \"What did we find?\"; replace \"Limitations\" with \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"; replace \"Currency\" with \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n2. **Reduce word count** – Trim redundant wording and combine sentences. For instance, the paragraph under \"Results\" can be shortened by removing repeated phrases about trial numbers and settings. Aim for ≤850 words.\n3. **Long sentences** – Break sentences longer than 30 words. Example problematic sentence: \"Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the chance of being admitted to any hospital. For every 100 people with heart failure who take part in the programme, about eight fewer are admitted to any hospital compared with usual care (moderate certainty).\" Rewrite as: \"Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces hospital admissions. For every 100 people with heart failure, about eight fewer are admitted when they join the programme (moderate certainty).\"\n4. **Passive voice and noun‑heavy phrasing** – Rewrite passive constructions and replace nominalisations with verbs. Problematic phrase: \"No information on funding sources was provided in the abstract.\" Rewrite: \"We did not report any funding sources in the abstract.\"\n5. **Simplify jargon** – Define terms the first time they appear and avoid technical language. Example: replace \"exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR)\" with \"exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation, a supervised exercise programme for heart failure\" and ensure the abbreviation is introduced only once.\n\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide, improve readability (metrics will drop: passive_voice, nominalisation, nouns, complex_words, long_words), and keep the word count within limits.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft exceeds the word limit (920 words) and deviates strongly from typical PLS patterns: very high passive voice (54, BEYOND_P90), nominalisation (51, BEYOND_P90), noun count (278, BEYOND_P90), and complex/long words (complex_words 225, long_words 300, both BEYOND_P90). Readability indices are borderline (FK grade 13.7, Gunning Fog 20) and sentence length averages 25.6 words (beyond typical 19‑28). Reducing passive constructions, nominalisations, and long sentences will improve readability and bring metrics closer to the median range."
