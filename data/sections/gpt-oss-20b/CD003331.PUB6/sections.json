  "key_messages": [
    "Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised exercise program for people with heart failure) does not appear to change the chance of dying, but it probably reduces the chance of being admitted to hospital (hospital admission) and improves how patients feel about their health (health‑related quality of life); no harmful effects were reported, although the overall evidence is limited, so confidence in these findings is modest.",
    "The studies showed similar benefits whether the programme was delivered in a centre‑based setting (exercise done at a clinic or hospital) or a home‑based setting (exercise done at home), and whether it included only exercise or also additional support such as education, but most participants had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), meaning people with other types of heart failure were under‑represented.",
    "Future research should include more older adults, women, and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and should examine longer‑term effects on survival and other outcomes."

      "subheading": "What is heart failure and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Heart failure is a condition where the heart cannot pump blood as well as it should. This leads to symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness and fluid buildup, which make everyday activities hard. People with heart failure often have a reduced ability to exercise, a lower health‑related quality of life (HRQoL), a higher chance of dying, and they are frequently admitted to hospital. These problems also create high costs for the health‑care system."

      "subheading": "What is exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation and how is it usually delivered?",
      "content": "Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) is a structured programme that uses physical activity – such as walking, cycling or resistance training – to improve the heart’s function and the person’s overall wellbeing. It can be offered in a hospital or clinic (centre‑based) or at home, sometimes with digital support. ExCR may be provided on its own or as part of a broader cardiac rehabilitation programme that also includes education, psychological support and medication management. In past research most participants were men with a type of heart failure called reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF – the heart’s pumping ability is below 45%). Women, older adults and people with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF – the heart pumps normally but still cannot fill properly) have been less studied."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to determine whether taking part in exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation, compared with usual care that does not include exercise, changes the risk of death, the chance of being admitted to hospital, and the health‑related quality of life for adults living with heart failure. They also looked at whether the way the programme is delivered (centre‑based vs home‑based, type of exercise, or inclusion of other rehabilitation components) influences these outcomes."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 60 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 8,728 adults (aged 18 years or older) with heart failure. The median follow‑up time for the interventions was six months, and every trial met a minimum six‑month follow‑up requirement. Most participants had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and were classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III. Women, older adults and people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction were less common, although newer studies are beginning to include more of these groups. The trials were mainly carried out in centre‑based or hospital settings, with an emerging group delivering exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation at home or through digital platforms. The studies came from a broad international evidence base, though specific countries were not listed. All interventions involved exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation—either exercise alone or as part of a comprehensive programme—compared with usual medical care that did not include exercise; some trials also used active comparators such as education, psychological support or additional medical management. No information on funding sources was provided in the abstract."

      "subheading": "Main results: Hospital admissions",
      "content": "Exercise‑based cardiac rehabilitation probably reduces the chance of being admitted to any hospital. For every 100 people with heart failure who take part in the programme, about eight fewer are admitted to any hospital compared with usual care (moderate certainty). It also probably reduces heart‑failure‑related admissions slightly – roughly one fewer admission per 100 people (moderate certainty). In addition, exercise probably improves health‑related quality of life, meaning people feel better about their health and daily activities (moderate certainty). The evidence does not show a clear difference in overall death rates; it may make little or no difference to mortality (low certainty)."

  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the evidence does not cover all of the people we are interested in, such as older patients, women, and those with a different type of heart failure, and the studies were very small or had few events, so we cannot be sure about the results.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2021 of search."
