  "plain_title": "Is the antiviral medicine entecavir (a drug that blocks hepatitis B virus) better than no treatment or a dummy pill for children and adults with long‑term hepatitis B?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Current research does not show a clear benefit of entecavir (a medicine that blocks hepatitis B virus) compared with no treatment or a dummy pill (placebo) for people with chronic hepatitis B (long‑term liver infection); the studies did not report any deaths and gave very uncertain information about serious adverse events (harmful side effects that are severe).",
    "The trials also did not provide information on how treatment affects patients’ overall well‑being or health‑related quality of life (how health impacts daily life).",
    "Because the available evidence is limited and uncertain, more well‑designed, larger studies that follow patients for longer periods are needed to determine whether entecavir improves important outcomes such as survival, serious side effects, and quality of life."

      "subheading": "Why is chronic hepatitis B a major health problem?",
      "content": "Hepatitis B is a virus that infects the liver. When the infection lasts a long time (called chronic hepatitis B), it can cause serious liver damage, liver cancer, and even death. Around a third of the world’s population has been exposed to the virus, and millions live with chronic infection, making it a big public‑health concern. People with chronic hepatitis B may feel well for years, but the virus can silently harm the liver over time."

      "subheading": "What is entecavir and how is it used to treat hepatitis B?",
      "content": "Entecavir is a medicine that belongs to a group called nucleos(t)ide analogues – drugs that look like the building blocks of viral DNA and stop the virus from copying itself. Because it works well and is usually safe, many clinical guidelines recommend entecavir as a first‑line (first choice) treatment for chronic hepatitis B in both children and adults. The drug is taken by mouth and is meant to keep the virus at low levels, reducing liver damage."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to discover whether taking entecavir is beneficial and safe compared with receiving no treatment or a placebo. Specifically, they looked at both children and adults with chronic hepatitis B, whether they were positive or negative for hepatitis B e‑antigen (HBeAg – a marker that helps show how active the infection is). They examined important outcomes such as death from any cause, serious side‑effects, and health‑related quality of life."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 22 randomised trials with a total of 2,940 participants who had chronic hepatitis B. All trials used a parallel‑group design and tested oral entecavir for periods ranging from 5 weeks to 228 weeks. Twelve trials compared entecavir with no treatment, ten used a placebo comparator, and in 14 trials co‑interventions were given equally to both arms. Participants were mainly adults (19 trials); one trial enrolled only children, one enrolled people aged 14‑55 years, and one did not report ages. Gender distribution and disease severity were not specified, and the abstract gave no details on the countries, settings, or funding sources of the studies. No studies reported health‑related quality of life outcomes. Overall, the review found that it is unclear whether entecavir changes the risk of death, improves health‑related quality of life, or reduces serious adverse events."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search."
