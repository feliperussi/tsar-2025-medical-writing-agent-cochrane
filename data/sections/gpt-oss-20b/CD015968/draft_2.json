It raises the risk of long‑term illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease and some cancers. In 2016 more than 340 million young people aged 5–19 years were living with excess weight. Traditional management (often called “usual care”) includes advice on healthier eating, encouragement to be more active and regular follow‑up with health professionals.\n\nWhat are digital health interventions for obesity?  \nDigital health interventions are technology‑based tools that help people reach health goals. In obesity they can be wearable devices that track activity, web‑based programmes, text‑message reminders, smartphone or tablet apps, active video‑gaming (“exergaming”) and remote consultations (telehealth). They aim to support diet changes, increase physical activity, or both, and can be used together with usual care or on their own.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether digital health tools help children and adolescents lose body fat or improve other health outcomes compared with usual care alone. Specifically we asked: (1) Does adding digital tools to usual care give better results than usual care by itself? (2) Does using digital tools alone provide any benefit over usual care alone? We also looked at safety.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched four major databases and two trial registers for studies that tested digital tools for obesity management in people aged 0–19 years. We included only randomised studies (studies that randomly assigned participants to groups) that compared a digital tool, with or without usual care, against usual care alone. Two reviewers independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found 15 studies that together included 911 children and teenagers with obesity. Most participants were aged 10–19 years; five studies also enrolled younger children (0–9 years). The trials were conducted in ten countries, most often the United States (5 studies) and Sweden (3 studies). Nine studies lasted less than six months and six lasted six months or longer. The digital tools tested were wearables or implantable devices, web‑based programmes, text messages, mobile or tablet apps, exergaming and telehealth. Eight studies used the digital tool together with usual care, and seven used the tool alone, each compared with usual care alone. The studies did not report funding sources, did not record side‑effects and nine did not explain the theory behind the intervention.\n\nWhen digital tools were added to usual care, the studies probably reduced body fat slightly – about a 3 % lower amount of body fat compared with usual care alone. When the tools were used alone, we are uncertain whether they change body fat or any other health outcomes. No study reported side‑effects, so we cannot say whether the digital tools cause any harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate confidence in the result that digital tools plus usual care may reduce body fat, because the number of studies is small and the follow‑up periods are short. The evidence for digital tools used alone is very uncertain. Many studies did not report side‑effects or describe the theoretical basis of the intervention, which limits our ability to judge safety and understand how the tools work.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe literature search was completed in April 2025, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

The draft also shows excessive passive constructions (25 instances, beyond the typical PLS range) and a very high noun count (231, beyond typical). These issues reduce clarity for readers. The most important improvements are: 1) the title needs to be corrected; 2) rewrite long, noun‑heavy sentences into active, shorter statements; 3) define any remaining technical terms (e.g., GRADE) or replace them with plain language; 4) split overly long bullet points; 5) reduce passive voice throughout. Metrics support these suggestions: passive_voice is BEYOND_P90, nouns are BEYOND_P90, complex_words and long_words are also far above typical ranges, indicating the text is more complex than needed for a plain‑language summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 52.9, FKGL 10.8) are within the best quartile. However, six features deviate markedly: passive_voice (25, BEYOND_P90), nouns (231, BEYOND_P90), smog_index (14.3, P90), complex_words_dc (324, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (150, BEYOND_P90) and long_words (188, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is overly noun‑heavy, uses many complex and long words, and contains many passive constructions, which can hinder patient‑friendly understanding."
