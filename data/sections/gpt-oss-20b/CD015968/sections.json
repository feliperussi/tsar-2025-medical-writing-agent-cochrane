  "key_messages": [
    "Using digital health tools (such as apps, wearables, text messages, or video games) together with usual care (standard treatment without digital components) may lead to a small short‑term reduction in body fat (the amount of fat in the body) in children and adolescents with obesity, and no harmful effects were reported, although the evidence is limited.",
    "When digital health tools are used alone, without the addition of usual care, the current studies do not show a clear benefit for weight‑related outcomes, and no information on possible harms was provided.",
    "Because the existing research includes few participants, short follow‑up periods, and limited reporting of side effects, larger and longer studies are needed to determine the true benefits, any risks, and how effects may differ by age, gender or ethnicity."

      "subheading": "Why is childhood obesity a public health concern?",
      "content": "Being overweight or obese as a child or teenager is a global problem that puts young people at higher risk for long‑term illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5‑19 years were living with excess weight. Traditional ways to manage obesity include advice on healthier eating, encouragement to be more physically active, and regular follow‑up with health professionals – often called \"conventional care\"."

    {
      "subheading": "What are digital health interventions for obesity?",
      "content": "Digital health interventions are tools that use technology to help people reach health goals. In the context of obesity, these can be wearable devices that track activity, web‑based programs, text‑message reminders, smartphone or tablet apps, active video‑gaming (sometimes called \"exergaming\"), and remote consultations (telehealth). They are designed to support diet changes, increase physical activity, or both, and can be used together with conventional care or on their own."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether using digital health tools helps children and adolescents lose body fat or improve other health outcomes compared with standard care alone. Specifically, they examined two questions: (1) Does adding digital technology to conventional care lead to better results than conventional care by itself? and (2) Does using digital technology alone provide any benefit over conventional care alone? They also looked at the safety of these digital approaches."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We included 15 randomised randomised controlled trials involving 911 children and adolescents with obesity. Most participants were aged 10 to 19 years, with five trials also enrolling younger children (0‑9 years). The studies were carried out in ten countries, most often in the United States (five trials) and Sweden (three trials), with single trials from Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland and Thailand. Nine trials were short‑term (lasting less than six months) and six were longer‑term (six months or more). The digital health interventions tested included wearables or implantable devices, web‑based programmes, text messaging, mobile or tablet apps, exergaming and telehealth. Eight trials used these tools together with usual care, and seven used them as stand‑alone interventions, each compared with usual care alone. Funding sources were not reported, no adverse events were recorded, and nine trials did not describe a theoretical basis for the intervention."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Effect on body fat",
      "content": "When digital health tools were added to usual care, they probably reduced body fat slightly – about a 3% lower fat mass in children and adolescents. When the digital tools were used alone, we are uncertain whether they change body fat or any other health outcomes. No studies reported side‑effects, so we do not know whether these digital interventions cause any harms."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.",
