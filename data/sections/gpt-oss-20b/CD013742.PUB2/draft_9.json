  "draft": "How accurate are blood tests (like serum retinol and retinol‑binding protein) for detecting vitamin A deficiency in people who are at risk?\n\nKey messages  \n– Blood tests that measure serum retinol (vitamin A in blood) or retinol‑binding protein (the protein that carries vitamin A) often miss many true cases (low sensitivity) but are fairly good at confirming that someone is not deficient (high specificity). No harms were reported, and the evidence is limited because the studies did not focus on test accuracy.  \n– Test performance changes with the reference standard used. The most accurate standards are liver vitamin A measurement and retinol isotope dilution (a technique that uses a labelled form the vitamin A to measure body stores). Overall, the tests show modest accuracy, and data on other methods such as breast‑milk vitamin A or relative dose response are scarce.  \n– Future research should include well‑designed diagnostic‑accuracy studies that use appropriate reference standards and include enough participants with true deficiency.\n\nWhy is vitamin A deficiency a health problem?  \nVitamin A helps children grow, keeps the immune system strong, and protects the eyes. When people do not get enough vitamin A they may experience poor growth, weaker immunity, more infections, eye problems that can lead to blindness, and a higher risk of death for mothers and children. Many low‑resource populations are at risk, so identifying deficiency is an important public‑health task.\n\nHow is vitamin A deficiency currently tested?  \nWe use laboratory‑based “biomarkers” – measurable substances in blood, milk or other tissues – to see if vitamin A stores are low. The most common tests are:  \n– **Serum or plasma retinol (SR)** – measures the amount of vitamin A directly in a blood sample.  \n– **Retinol‑binding protein (RBP)** – a protein that the carries vitamin A in the blood; its level gives an indirect clue about vitamin A status.  \n– **Relative dose response (RDR)** – measures how the body’s vitamin A level changes after a very small dose of the vitamin.  \n\nWe compare these tests with reference standards such as retinol isotope dilution (RID) or direct measurement of vitamin A in liver tissue, which are considered the most accurate ways to know a person’s true vitamin A status. Two important performance measures are:  \n– **Sensitivity** – the ability of a test to correctly identify people who truly have deficiency (true positives).  \n– **Specificity** – the ability of a test to correctly identify people who do not have deficiency (true negatives).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know how well the routinely used laboratory tests (SR, RBP, RDR and a few others) detect subclinical vitamin A deficiency (deficiency that does not yet cause obvious symptoms) in at‑risk people. Specifically we aimed to:  \n1. Measure the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of each test compared with the best‑available reference standards.  \n‑2. Explore whether factors such as the type of reference standard, the cut‑off values used, or study‑population characteristics explain differences in test performance.\n\nHow did we find and analyse the studies?  \nWe searched multiple databases up to 18 August 2022 without language or setting limits. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS‑2 tool. We pooled sensitivity and specificity with a bivariate random‑effects model, examined heterogeneity with subgroup analyses, and graded confidence in the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 40 eligible studies (reported as 65 records) that examined serum retinol, retinol‑binding protein, breast‑milk vitamin A and relative dose response in people at risk. No study was designed specifically as a diagnostic‑accuracy investigation, and many did not include enough participants with true deficiency. Risk of bias was often unclear.\n\nHow well does serum retinol testing work?  \nIf 100 people truly have vitamin A deficiency, serum retinol correctly identifies only about 10 of them (sensitivity ≈10 %). The test correctly rules out deficiency in about 90 % of people without deficiency (specificity ≈90 %). Sensitivity improves to roughly 50 % when liver vitamin A serves as the reference standard, but specificity then falls to about 80 %.\n\nHow well does retinol‑binding protein testing work?  \nRetinol‑binding protein shows sensitivity of roughly 45–50 % against isotope dilution and specificity of 75–80 %. When liver vitamin A is the reference, sensitivity drops to near 0 % while specificity rises to about 98 %, reflecting very few true‑positive cases in those studies.\n\nHow well does relative dose response testing work?  \nData on relative dose response are limited. The test correctly rules out deficiency in about 90 % of people (specificity ≈90 %), but we could not estimate sensitivity because the studies lacked participants who were truly deficient.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were not designed as diagnostic‑accuracy investigations, often did not include enough people with true deficiency, and risk of bias was frequently unclear. Consequently, the pooled accuracy estimates should be interpreted with caution.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe search covered studies published up to August 2022, so the evidence reflects research available up to that date.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails critical checks: (1) the \"Key messages\" heading is not phrased as a question, which the style guide requires for all sub‑headings; (2) the total word count is 907, exceeding the 850‑word limit. These issues must be fixed before the summary can be approved. In addition, the text contains several clarity and style problems that would confuse readers:\n- Unquestioned heading: \"Key messages\" – not a question. Rewrite as \"What are the key messages?\".\n- Word‑count bloat: many sentences repeat the same idea (e.g., the description of test performance appears in both the key messages and the detailed results). Condense by removing redundancy and using shorter sentences.\n- Long, complex sentences: e.g., \"If 100 people truly have vitamin A deficiency, serum retinol correctly identifies only about 10 of them (sensitivity ≈10 %). The test correctly rules out deficiency in about 90 % of people without deficiency (specificity ≈90 %).\" This can be split and simplified.\n- Passive voice: the draft has 19 passive constructions (e.g., \"The evidence reflects research available up to that date.\") which makes it harder for lay readers. Convert to active voice.\n- Nominalisations and noun‑heavy phrasing: phrases like \"the accuracy of the breast‑milk vitamin A\" or \"the pooled accuracy estimates\" add unnecessary density. Replace with verbs (e.g., \"we measured\" instead of \"the accuracy was measured\").\n\nSuggested concrete rewrites:\n1. Heading: Change \"Key messages\" to \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. Combine and shorten: Replace the two‑sentence paragraph on serum retinol with: \"Serum retinol finds only about 10 % of true deficiencies (low sensitivity) but correctly rules out deficiency in roughly 90 % of people (high specificity).\".\n3. Active voice: Rewrite \"The evidence reflects research available up to that date\" as \"We included research published up to August 2022\".\n4. Reduce noun‑heavy sentences: Change \"The test correctly rules out deficiency in about 90 % of people without deficiency (specificity ≈90 %).\" to \"The test correctly says a person does not have deficiency in about 90 % of cases.\".\n5. Trim redundancy: Remove the repeated statement about no harms being reported from the key messages and the results sections; keep it once.\n\nThese changes will bring the summary under the word limit, align headings with the style guide, and improve readability for patients.\n\nMetrics support: The evaluation shows 19 passive constructions (well above the typical 9‑23 range) and high counts of nominalisations (26) and nouns (299), confirming the need to shift to more active, verb‑focused language. The SMOG index (16.5) and complex‑word counts are also far beyond typical PLS ranges, indicating the text is too dense and benefits from the suggested simplifications.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation flags several deviations: word count 907 > 850 (over limit); passive_voice 19 (P90, higher than typical); nominalization 26 (P90); nouns 299 (BEYOND_P90); smog_index 16.5 (BEYOND_P90); complex_words_dc 398 and complex_words 195 (both BEYOND_P90). These indicate the draft is overly dense, uses many passive constructions and noun‑heavy phrasing, and exceeds the allowed length."
