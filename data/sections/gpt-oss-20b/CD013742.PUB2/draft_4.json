  "draft": "\"How accurate are blood tests (like serum retinol and retinol‑binding protein) for detecting vitamin A deficiency in people who are at risk?\"\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– Blood tests that measure serum retinol (the amount of vitamin A in blood) or retinol‑binding protein (a protein that carries vitamin A) often miss many true cases (low sensitivity) but are fairly good at confirming that someone is not deficient (high specificity). No harmful effects of the tests were reported, and the evidence is limited because the included studies were not designed specifically to evaluate test accuracy.  \n– Test performance varied with the reference standard used – the most accurate method for confirming deficiency, such as liver vitamin A measurement or retinol isotope dilution (a technique that uses a labelled form of vitamin A to measure body stores). Overall, the tests showed modest accuracy, and data on other methods like breast‑milk vitamin A or relative dose response are scarce.  \n– Future research should conduct well‑designed diagnostic‑accuracy studies that use appropriate reference standards and include enough participants with true deficiency, so we can better understand how reliable these blood tests are.\n\nWhy is vitamin A deficiency a health problem?  \nVitamin A helps children grow, supports the immune system, and protects the eyes. When intake is insufficient, people can experience poor growth, weaker immunity, more infections, eye problems that may lead to blindness, and higher risk of death for mothers and children. Many low‑resource populations are at risk, making identification of deficiency an important public‑health task.\n\nHow is vitamin A deficiency currently tested?  \nWe use laboratory‑based “biomarkers” – measurable substances in blood, milk, or other tissues – to see if vitamin A stores are low. The most common tests are:  \n– Serum or plasma retinol (SR): measures vitamin A directly in a blood sample.  \n– Retinol‑binding protein (RBP): a protein that carries vitamin A in the blood; its level gives an indirect clue about vitamin A status.  \n– Relative dose response (RDR): looks at how the body’s vitamin A levels change after a small dose of the vitamin.  \n\nWe compare these tests with reference standards such as retinol isotope dilution (RID) or direct measurement of vitamin A in liver tissue, which are considered the most accurate ways to know a person’s true vitamin A status. Two key performance measures are sensitivity (the ability of a test to correctly identify people who truly have deficiency) and specificity (the ability to correctly identify people who do not have deficiency).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know how well the routinely used laboratory tests (SR, RBP, RDR, and a few others) detect subclinical vitamin A deficiency (deficiency that does not yet cause obvious symptoms) in at‑risk people. Specifically we aimed to:  \n1. Measure the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of each test compared with the best‑available reference standards.  \n2. Explore whether factors such as the type of reference standard, the cut‑off values used, or study‑population characteristics explain differences in test performance.\n\nHow did we find and analyse the studies?  \nWe systematically searched multiple bibliographic databases up to 18 August 2022 without language or setting limits. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS‑2 tool. When appropriate, we pooled sensitivity and specificity with a bivariate random‑effects model and examined heterogeneity with subgroup analyses. We graded the overall confidence in the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 40 eligible studies (reported as 65 records). The studies evaluated serum or plasma retinol, retinol‑binding protein, breast‑milk vitamin A, and relative dose response, comparing them with RID or liver vitamin A. No study was designed specifically as a diagnostic‑test‑accuracy investigation, and many did not include enough participants with true deficiency. Risk of bias was often unclear.\n\nHow well does serum retinol testing work?  \nIf 100 people truly have vitamin A deficiency, serum retinol testing would correctly identify only about 10 of them (sensitivity ≈10 %). The test is better at ruling out deficiency, with specificity around 90 % in most analyses. Sensitivity improves modestly when liver vitamin A is used as the reference standard (≈50 %), but specificity then falls to about 80 %.\n\nHow well does retinol‑binding protein testing work?  \nRetinol‑binding protein shows sensitivity of roughly 45–50 % against isotope dilution and specificity of 75–80 %. When liver vitamin A is the reference, sensitivity drops to near 0 % while specificity rises to about 98 %, reflecting very few true‑positive cases in those studies.\n\nHow well does relative dose response testing work?  \nData on relative dose response are limited. Specificity is around 90 %, but we could not estimate sensitivity because the studies lacked participants who were truly deficient.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were not designed as diagnostic‑accuracy investigations, often did not include enough people with true deficiency, and risk of bias was frequently unclear. Consequently, the pooled accuracy estimates should be interpreted with caution.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe search covered studies published up to August 2022, so the evidence reflects research available up to that date.",

It also contains a high number of passive constructions (23 instances, well above the typical PLS range) and excessive nominalisations (27) and noun density (295 nouns), which make the text harder to read for patients. To meet the guidelines you need to trim at least 70 words and rewrite many sentences in active voice, using more verbs and fewer noun‑heavy phrases. For example, change “The test is better at ruling out deficiency, with specificity around 90 % in most analyses.” to “The test correctly rules out deficiency in about 90 % of people.” Reducing long sentences and replacing nominalisations such as “assessment of the accuracy” with “we assessed accuracy” will also improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is over the word limit (917 words). Readability metrics are relatively good (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 52, grade 10.7) but several language features deviate strongly: passive voice (23, P90), nominalisation (27, P90), nouns (295, BEYOND_P90), SMOG (16.7, BEYOND_P90), complex words (201, BEYOND_P90) and long words (273, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex terms, which should be reduced to improve plain‑language clarity."
