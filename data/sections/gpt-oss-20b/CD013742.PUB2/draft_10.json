  "draft": "How accurate are blood tests (like serum retinol and retinol‑binding protein) for detecting vitamin A deficiency in people who are at risk?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Blood tests that measure serum retinol (vitamin A in blood) or retinol‑binding protein (the protein that carries vitamin A) often miss many true cases (low sensitivity) but are good at confirming that someone is not deficient (high specificity). No harms were reported.  \n– Test performance changes with the reference standard used. Liver vitamin A measurement and retinol isotope dilution (a technique that uses a labelled form of vitamin A) give the most accurate reference. Overall, the tests show modest accuracy, and data on other methods such as breast‑milk vitamin A or relative dose response are scarce.  \n– Future research should include well‑designed diagnostic‑accuracy studies that use appropriate reference standards and include enough participants with true deficiency.\n\nWhy is vitamin A deficiency a health problem?\nVitamin A helps children grow, keeps the immune system strong, and protects the eyes. When people do not get enough vitamin A they may experience poor growth, weaker immunity, more infections, eye problems that can lead to blindness, and a higher risk of death for mothers and children. Many low‑resource populations are at risk, so identifying deficiency is an important public‑health task.\n\nHow is vitamin A deficiency currently tested?\nWe use laboratory‑based biomarkers – measurable substances in blood, milk or other tissues – to see if vitamin A stores are low. The most common tests are:  \n– Serum or plasma retinol (SR) – measures the amount of vitamin A directly in a blood sample.  \n– Retinol‑binding protein (RBP) – a protein that carries vitamin A in the blood; its level gives an indirect clue about vitamin A status.  \n– Relative dose response (RDR) – looks at how the body’s vitamin A level changes after a very small dose of the vitamin.  \n\nWe compare these tests with reference standards such as retinol isotope dilution (RID) or direct measurement of vitamin A in liver tissue, which are considered the most accurate ways to know a person’s true vitamin A status. Two important performance measures are:  \n– Sensitivity – the ability of a test to correctly identify people who truly have deficiency (true positives).  \n– Specificity – the ability of a test to correctly identify people who do not have deficiency (true negatives).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well the routinely used laboratory tests (SR, RBP, RDR and a few others) detect subclinical vitamin A deficiency (deficiency that does not yet cause obvious symptoms) in at‑risk people. Specifically we aimed to:  \n1. Measure the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of each test compared with the best‑available reference standards.  \n2. Explore whether factors such as the type of reference standard, the cut‑off values used, or study‑population characteristics explain differences in test performance.\n\nHow did we find and analyse the studies?\nWe searched multiple databases up to 18 August 2022 without language or setting limits. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS‑2 tool. We pooled sensitivity and specificity with a bivariate random‑effects model, examined heterogeneity with subgroup analyses, and graded confidence in the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 40 eligible studies (reported as 65 records) that examined serum retinol, retinol‑binding protein, breast‑milk vitamin A and relative dose response in people at risk. No study was designed specifically as a diagnostic‑accuracy investigation, and many did not include enough participants with true deficiency. We often found unclear risk of bias.\n\nHow well does serum retinol testing work?\nIf 100 people truly have vitamin A deficiency, serum retinol correctly identifies only about 10 of them (sensitivity ≈10 %). The test correctly rules out deficiency in about 90 % of people without deficiency (specificity ≈90 %). Sensitivity improves to roughly 50 % when liver vitamin A serves as the reference standard, but specificity then falls to about 80 %.\n\nHow well does retinol‑binding protein testing work?\nRetinol‑binding protein shows sensitivity of roughly 45–50 % against isotope dilution and specificity of 75–80 %. When liver vitamin A is the reference, sensitivity drops to near 0 % while specificity rises to about 98 %, reflecting very few true‑positive cases in those studies.\n\nHow well does relative dose response testing work?\nData on relative dose response are limited. The test correctly rules out deficiency in about 90 % of people (specificity ≈90 %), but we could not estimate sensitivity because the studies lacked participants who were truly deficient.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were not designed as diagnostic‑accuracy investigations, often did not include enough people with true deficiency, and risk of bias was frequently unclear. Consequently, we should interpret the pooled accuracy estimates with caution.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe included research published up to August 2022, so the evidence reflects studies available up to that date.",

In addition, the text is overly noun‑heavy and contains many nominalisations, long words and complex vocabulary (e.g., 292 nouns, 26 nominalisations, SMOG 16.4, 387 Dale‑Chall complex words), which inflate the word count and reduce readability.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Correct the serum‑retinol specificity statement** – replace \"The test also makes little or no difference in correctly ruling out deficiency in people who are not deficient.\" with \"The test correctly rules out deficiency in about 90% of people who are not deficient.\"\n2. **Reduce overall length** – delete redundant phrases, combine short sentences, and remove unnecessary detail while keeping key numbers.\n3. **Cut noun‑heavy and nominalised language** – change \"assessment of vitamin A deficiency\" to \"checking for vitamin A deficiency\", \"laboratory‑based biomarkers\" to \"lab tests\", and rewrite sentences that start with multiple nouns into active‑voice verb constructions.\n4. **Simplify long/complex words** – replace words like \"laboratory‑based\" (12 letters) with \"lab\", \"concurrently\" (11) with \"at the same time\", etc., to lower the SMOG and long‑word counts.\n5. **Increase active voice and pronoun use** – replace passive constructions like \"The test was compared with\" with \"We compared the test with\" and add first‑person plural pronouns where appropriate to meet the style guide.\n\nThese changes will bring the word count under 850, fix the factual error, and align the draft with the Master Style Guide and typical PLS readability patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is over the 850‑word limit (889 words). While many metrics are within typical ranges, several deviate strongly: nouns (292, beyond P90), nominalisations (26, beyond P90), SMOG index (16.4, beyond P90), and counts of complex and long words are far above median values. These deviations indicate the text is overly dense and noun‑heavy, supporting the need for simplification and length reduction."
