  "draft": "Is adding breast ultrasound (sound imaging) to a mammogram (breast X‑ray) better than a mammogram alone for finding breast cancer in women at average risk?\n\nKey messages (question)\n– Does adding ultrasound to mammography find more cancers? Yes – about two extra cancers per 1,000 women screened, and about three extra cancers per 1,000 women with dense breasts.  \n– Does it increase harms? Yes – it adds roughly 37 more false‑positive results and 27 more biopsies per 1,000 women screened.  \n– What do we know about overall benefit? The extra cancers are detected earlier, but the studies did not measure whether this reduces death rates.\n\nWhy is breast cancer screening important?  \nBreast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. Detecting the disease early, before it spreads, gives the best chance of successful treatment and survival. For this reason health organisations recommend regular screening for women roughly between ages 40 and 75. Early detection can lower the number of women who die from breast cancer.\n\nWhat are mammography and breast ultrasonography, and how are they used for screening?  \nMammography (a low‑dose X‑ray picture of the breast) is the standard screening test. In some women the breast tissue is “dense” (it appears white on a mammogram), which can hide tumours and lead to missed cancers – called false‑negative results. Breast ultrasonography (ultrasound, which uses sound waves to create images) can be added to a mammogram to try to spot cancers that the X‑ray missed. However, ultrasound also creates more false‑positive results, meaning the test suggests cancer when none is present, and can lead to unnecessary follow‑up procedures such as biopsies (taking a small tissue sample to check for cancer).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?  \nWe compared two screening strategies for women at average risk of breast cancer: (1) mammography alone and (2) mammography together with breast ultrasonography. We wanted to know whether adding ultrasound detects more cancers, whether it changes the type or stage of cancers found, and whether it leads to more false‑positive results and biopsies. In short, we aimed to assess the overall benefits and harms of combining ultrasound with the standard mammogram.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases up to May 2021 for studies that enrolled women aged 40‑75 at average risk and compared the two strategies. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and applied the GRADE approach to rate confidence in the evidence. We combined the results in a random‑effects meta‑analysis.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eight studies that together involved 209,207 women. The evidence came from one randomised controlled trial, two prospective cohort studies and five retrospective cohort studies. Follow‑up ranged from one to three years. The proportion of women with dense breasts varied from 48 % to 100 %.\n\nWhat are the main results of adding ultrasound to mammography?  \nAdding ultrasound probably increases the number of cancers detected slightly – about two extra cancers per 1,000 women screened (high‑certainty evidence). In women with dense breasts the increase is a little larger – about three extra cancers per 1,000 screened. In women with non‑dense breasts the difference is probably little or none. Adding ultrasound also probably reduces false‑negative results and lowers the proportion of cancers that have spread to lymph nodes (moderate‑certainty evidence). At the same time, it probably raises false‑positive results by roughly 37 per 1,000 women without cancer and leads to about 27 more biopsies per 1,000 women screened (high‑certainty evidence).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because most studies did not randomly assign women to screening groups, participants may have known which test they received, the studies did not measure mortality outcomes, and the total number of cancer cases is relatively small.\n\nHow up to date is this review?  \nWe searched for relevant studies up to May 2021, so the evidence reflects research published up to that date.",
