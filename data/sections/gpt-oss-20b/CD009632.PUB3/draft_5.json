  "draft": "\"Is adding breast ultrasound (sound imaging) to a mammogram (breast X‑ray) better than a mammogram alone for finding breast cancer in women at average risk?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– Adding ultrasound to mammography finds about two extra cancers per 1,000 women screened (about three extra per 1,000 women with dense breasts).  \n– Adding ultrasound also creates more false‑positive results – roughly 37 more per 1,000 women without cancer – and leads to about 27 more biopsies per 1,000 screened.  \n– The extra cancers are detected earlier, but the studies did not examine whether this reduces death rates. We are moderately confident about the benefit on missed cancers and lymph‑node spread, and highly confident about the increase in false‑positives and biopsies.\n\nWhy is breast cancer screening important?  \nBreast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. Finding the disease early, before it spreads, gives the best chance of successful treatment and survival. For this reason health organisations recommend regular screening for women roughly between ages 40 and 75. Early detection can lower the number of women who die from breast cancer.\n\nWhat are mammography and breast ultrasonography, and how are they?  \nMammography (a low‑dose X‑ray picture of the breast) is the standard screening test. In some women the breast tissue is “dense” (it looks white on a mammogram), which can hide tumours and cause false‑negative results (cancers that are missed). Breast ultrasonography (ultrasound, which uses sound waves to create images) can be added to a mammogram to try to spot cancers that the X‑ray missed. However, ultrasound also creates more false‑positive results (tests that suggest cancer when none is present) and can lead to unnecessary follow‑up procedures such as biopsies (taking a small tissue sample to check for cancer).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?  \nWe compared two screening strategies for women at average risk of breast cancer: (1) mammography alone and (2) mammography together with breast ultrasonography. We wanted to know whether adding ultrasound detects more cancers, whether it changes the type or stage of cancers found, and whether it leads to more false‑positive results and biopsies. In short, we aimed to assess the overall benefits and harms of combining ultrasound with the standard mammogram.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases up to May 2021. We looked for studies that enrolled women aged 40‑75 at average risk and compared the two screening strategies. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and applied the GRADE approach to rate confidence in the evidence. We combined the results in a random‑effects meta‑analysis.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eight studies involving 209,207 women: one randomised trial, two prospective cohort studies and five retrospective cohort studies. Follow‑up lasted 1‑3 years, and the proportion of women with dense breasts ranged from 48 % to 100 %.\n\nWhat are the main results of adding ultrasound to mammography?  \nBenefits – Adding ultrasound probably increases the number of cancers detected slightly – about two extra cancers per 1,000 screened (about three extra per 1,000 women with dense breasts). It also probably reduces missed cancers and lowers the chance that detected cancers have spread to the lymph nodes (we are moderately confident about this).  \n\nHarms – Adding ultrasound probably raises false‑positive results by roughly 37 per 1,000 women without cancer and leads to about 27 more biopsies per 1,000 screened (we are highly confident about these increases).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because most studies did not randomly assign women to screening groups, participants may have known which test they received, the studies did not measure mortality outcomes, and the total number of cancer cases is relatively small.\n\nHow up to date is this review?  \nWe searched for relevant studies up to May 2021, so the evidence reflects research published up to that date.",

A false‑positive result means the test suggested cancer when there was none. ‘Lymph‑node spread’ means the cancer has moved to nearby lymph nodes, which can make treatment harder.\"\n3. **Cluttered parenthetical definitions** – the opening paragraph uses many brackets, e.g., \"breast ultrasound (sound imaging)\" and \"mammogram (breast X‑ray)\".

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (e.g., Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 9, words per sentence 19.5). However, three metrics deviate markedly: noun count (183, beyond typical P90), long‑word count (179, beyond typical P90) and complex‑word‑DC count (306, beyond BEYOND_P90).
