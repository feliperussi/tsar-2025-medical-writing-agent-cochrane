  "plain_title": "Is adding breast ultrasound (sound imaging) to a mammogram (breast X-ray) better than a mammogram alone for finding breast cancer in women at average risk?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Adding ultrasound (sound imaging) to mammography (breast X‑ray) finds more breast cancers and reduces missed cancers (false‑negative results), but also leads to more false‑positive results (tests that suggest cancer when there is none) and more biopsies (small tissue samples taken to check for cancer); the studies did not examine whether this changes death rates (mortality), and the main evidence comes from one large, well‑designed trial supported by other less robust studies.",
    "The extra cancer detection and higher false‑positive rate were observed in women with both dense breasts (breast tissue that appears white on a mammogram, making cancer harder to see) and non‑dense breasts, although the evidence is clearer for women with dense breasts.",
    "Future research should include longer‑term, high‑quality trials that assess whether the additional cancers found lead to lower breast‑cancer mortality and that further evaluate the balance of benefits and harms."

      "subheading": "Why is breast cancer screening important?",
      "content": "Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. Finding the disease early, before it spreads, gives the best chance of successful treatment and survival. For this reason, health organisations recommend that women between about 40 and 75 years of age have regular screening tests. The most widely used test is a mammogram, which is an X‑ray picture of the breast. Early detection through screening can reduce the number of women who die from breast cancer."

      "subheading": "What are mammography and breast ultrasonography, and how are they used for screening?",
      "content": "Mammography (a low‑dose X‑ray of the breast) is the standard screening tool. In some women, especially those whose breast tissue is \"dense\" (the tissue looks white on a mammogram, making it harder to see any hidden tumours), the mammogram can miss cancers – this is called a false‑negative result. Breast ultrasonography (often just called an ultrasound) uses sound waves to create images of the breast and can be added to a mammogram to try to spot cancers that the X‑ray missed. However, adding ultrasound can also produce more false‑positive results, meaning the test suggests cancer when there is none, which can lead to unnecessary follow‑up procedures such as biopsies (taking a small piece of tissue to check for cancer)."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to compare two screening strategies for women who have an average risk of breast cancer: (1) mammography alone, and (2) mammography together with breast ultrasonography. They wanted to know whether adding ultrasound detects more cancers, whether it changes the type or stage of cancers found, and whether it leads to more false‑positive results and biopsies. In short, the review aimed to assess the overall benefits and harms of combining ultrasound with the standard mammogram."

      "content": "We searched for studies of average‑risk women (aged 40‑75) comparing mammography alone with mammography plus ultrasonography, combined the findings in a meta‑analysis, and rated our confidence in the evidence using risk‑of‑bias assessment and the GRADE approach."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We included eight studies that together involved 209,207 women aged 40 to 75 years who were at average risk for breast cancer. The evidence came from one randomised controlled trial, two prospective cohort studies and five retrospective cohort studies. Follow‑up periods ranged from one to three years. All participants were female; the proportion of women with dense breast tissue varied between 48 % and 100 %. The abstract did not report any information about study funding or sponsorship."

      "subheading": "Main results: Adding ultrasound to mammography",
      "content": "Adding ultrasound to mammography probably increases the number of cancers detected slightly – about two extra cancers per 1,000 women screened compared with mammography alone (high certainty). It probably leads to a large reduction in the proportion of cancers that have positive lymph nodes (moderate certainty), a large reduction in interval cancers (high certainty) and a large reduction in false‑negative results (moderate certainty). However, it also increases false‑positive results slightly – roughly 37 more false‑positives per 1,000 women without cancer (high certainty) – and leads to a large increase in the number of biopsies, about 27 more biopsies per 1,000 women screened (high certainty). In women with dense breasts, the increase in cancer detection is a little larger – about three extra cancers per 1,000 screened (high certainty). In women with non‑dense breasts, adding ultrasound probably makes little or no difference to cancer detection (moderate certainty)."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the evidence does not cover all of the outcomes we were interested in, and the evidence is based on few cases of the condition.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2021 of search."
