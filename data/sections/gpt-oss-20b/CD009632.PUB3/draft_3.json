  "draft": "Is adding breast ultrasound (sound imaging) to a mammogram (breast X‑ray) better than a mammogram alone for finding breast cancer in women at average risk?\n\nKey messages\n- Adding ultrasound to mammography finds about two extra cancers per 1,000 women screened and reduces missed cancers (false‑negative results, where the test fails to spot an existing cancer).  \n- The same addition also creates roughly 37 more false‑positive results (tests that suggest cancer when there is none) and leads to about 27? actually 27 more biopsies (small tissue samples taken to check for cancer) per 1,000 women without cancer.  \n- The benefit of detecting more cancers is clearer in women with dense breasts (about three extra cancers per 1,000); in women with non‑dense breasts the difference is small or none. All evidence comes from one large trial supported by several observational studies, and none of the studies measured whether the extra cancers reduce death rates.\n\nWhy is breast cancer screening important?  \nBreast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. Finding the disease early, before it spreads, gives the best chance of successful treatment and survival. For this reason health organisations recommend regular screening for women roughly between ages 40 and 75. Early detection through screening can reduce the number of women who die from breast cancer.\n\nWhat are mammography and breast ultrasonography, and how are they used for screening?  \nMammography (a low‑dose X‑ray picture of the breast) is the standard screening tool. In some women, especially those whose breast tissue is “dense” (the tissue looks white on a mammogram, making hidden tumours harder to see), the mammogram can miss cancers – this is called a false‑negative result. Breast ultrasonography (ultrasound, which uses sound waves to create images of the breast) can be added to a mammogram to try to spot cancers that the X‑ray missed. However, adding ultrasound can also produce more false‑positive results, meaning the test suggests cancer when there is none, leading to unnecessary follow‑up procedures such as biopsies (taking a small piece of tissue to check for cancer).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?  \nWe compared two screening strategies for women at average risk of breast cancer: (1) mammography alone and (2) mammography together with breast ultrasonography. We wanted to know whether adding ultrasound detects more cancers, whether it changes the type or stage of cancers found, and whether it leads to more false‑positive results and biopsies. In short, we aimed to assess the overall benefits and harms of combining ultrasound with the standard mammogram.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?  \nWe searched databases up to May 2021 for studies that enrolled women aged 40‑75 at average risk and compared mammography alone with mammography plus ultrasonography. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and applied the GRADE approach to rate confidence in the evidence. We combined the results in a random‑effects meta‑analysis.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eight studies involving 209,207 women. The evidence came from one randomised controlled trial, two prospective cohort studies and five retrospective cohort studies – we refer to all of these as observational studies. Follow‑up ranged from one to three years. The proportion of women with dense breasts varied from 48 % to 100 %.\n\nWhat are the main results of adding ultrasound to mammography?  \nAdding ultrasound probably increases the number of cancers detected slightly – about two extra cancers per 1,000 women screened (strong evidence). It probably reduces the proportion of cancers that have spread to lymph nodes (large reduction, moderate evidence), lowers the number of cancers that appear between regular screenings (interval cancers, strong evidence) and cuts false‑negative results (moderate evidence). In women with dense breasts the increase is a little larger – about three extra cancers per 1,000 screened (strong evidence). In women with non‑dense breasts the difference is probably little or none (moderate evidence). At the same time, adding ultrasound probably raises false‑positive results by roughly 37 per 1,000 women without cancer and increases biopsies by about 27? actually 27 per 1,000 screened (both strong evidence).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because most studies did not randomly assign women to screening groups, participants may have known which test they received, the evidence does not cover outcomes such as mortality, and the total number of cancer cases is relatively small.\n\nHow up to date is this review?  \nWe searched for relevant studies up to May 2021, so the evidence reflects research published up to that date.",

These issues would confuse readers and reduce trust in the summary. Additionally, the PLS metrics show a high number of passive constructions (19, beyond the typical range) and a very high noun count (226, beyond P90), confirming the style problems. To meet Cochrane standards the draft needs to (a) re‑write the \"Key messages\" heading as a question, (b) replace the placeholder with a clear, definitive figure, (c) simplify or define technical terms, and (d) break long sentences into shorter, active‑voice statements.",

These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy phrasing, and high lexical complexity, which support the identified clarity and style concerns."
