  "draft": "Are mental‑health promotion programs (psychological and social interventions) effective for people living in low‑and middle‑income countries affected by war or disaster?\n\n– Programs that aim to boost mental health in these settings show little or no clear benefit for children and adolescents and only a small short‑term gain for adults; we found no evidence of lasting effects or harms.  \n– The evidence comes from a small number of trials with few participants and varied methods, so confidence in the findings is low.  \n– Larger, well‑designed studies that follow people for longer periods are needed to determine whether these programmes can provide lasting benefits and to identify any potential harms.\n\nWhat mental health problems do people face in humanitarian crises?\nAround 84 million people are forced to leave their homes because of war, conflict, persecution or other emergencies. Most live in low‑ and middle‑income countries where health resources are limited. In these stressful environments people experience fear, loss, insecurity and other threats to their mental well‑being. While many studies look at treating mental illness, this review focused on ways to promote good mental health, such as feeling hopeful, coping well, enjoying a good quality of life and functioning socially.\n\nWhat are psychosocial interventions and how are they used?\nPsychosocial interventions combine psychological support (for example, talking about feelings or learning coping skills) with social activities (such as group games, community projects or peer support). They are usually delivered in groups by trained community helpers (people who are not mental‑health professionals but have received basic training). The aim is to boost mental‑well‑being, resilience and everyday functioning without treating a diagnosed mental disorder.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether group‑based psychosocial programmes improve positive aspects of mental health compared with doing nothing, receiving usual care, or waiting for help. We looked at outcomes such as mental‑well‑being, daily functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope and prosocial behaviour in children, adolescents and adults living in low‑ and middle‑income countries affected by humanitarian crises.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched eight databases and trial registries for randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial promotion programmes with no intervention or usual care. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 13 trials involving 7 917 participants. Nine trials studied children or adolescents and four studied adults. The studies were carried out in Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian territories, Nepal and Tanzania. All participants did not have a diagnosed mental disorder. The programmes were group‑based, delivered mainly by trained community helpers, and lasted on average 18 weeks (range 10–32 weeks).\n\nFor children and adolescents, the programmes had little or no effect on mental‑well‑being or prosocial behaviour, and the certainty of this evidence is very low. We could not determine whether the programmes changed functioning in this age group.\n\nFor adults, the programmes produced a small improvement in mental‑well‑being at the end of the study, but the evidence is uncertain and we do not know if any benefit lasts after follow‑up. No trials measured functioning or prosocial behaviour in adults.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the findings because the trials were small, participants often knew which group they were in, and the studies varied in who was included and how the interventions were delivered.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date with searches completed in January 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse readers. 1) A very long bullet sentence combines multiple ideas and uses vague phrasing (\"little or no clear benefit\", \"small short‑term gain\"). 2) Frequent passive constructions (e.g., \"The programmes were group‑based, delivered mainly by trained community helpers, and lasted on average 18 weeks\") obscure who did what. 3) Some sentences are noun‑heavy and abstract, making the key message harder to grasp (e.g., \"The evidence suggests that these psychosocial programmes may have little to no effect on mental well‑being and prosocial behaviour in children and adolescents, but the certainty of the evidence is very low.\"). These issues are supported by the metrics: passive_voice = 24 (beyond P90), nouns = 166 (beyond P90), and high scores for complex and long words. The draft should be revised to shorten sentences, use active voice, and replace noun‑heavy phrasing with clearer verbs.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1) Problematic sentence: \"Programs that aim to boost mental health in these settings show little or no clear benefit for children and adolescents and only a small short‑term gain for adults; we found no evidence of lasting effects or harms.\"\n   Why problematic: 37 words, combines several ideas, uses vague terms.\n   Suggested rewrite: \"Programs that aim to boost mental health in these settings show little or no benefit for children and adolescents. For adults they produce only a small short‑term improvement, and we found no evidence that the benefits last or that harms occur.\"\n2) Problematic sentence: \"The programmes were group‑based, delivered mainly by trained community helpers, and lasted on average 18 weeks (range 10–32 weeks).\"\n   Why problematic: Passive voice hides the actor.\n   Suggested rewrite: \"We delivered group‑based programmes, mainly by trained community helpers, and they lasted on average 18 weeks (range 10–32 weeks).\"\n3) Problematic sentence: \"The evidence suggests that these psychosocial programmes may have little to no effect on mental well‑being and prosocial behaviour in children and adolescents, but the certainty of the evidence is very low.\"\n   Why problematic: Noun‑heavy, abstract phrasing.\n   Suggested rewrite: \"The evidence shows that these programmes have little or no effect on mental well‑being and prosocial behaviour in children and adolescents, and the certainty of this evidence is very low.\"\n4) Problematic sentence: \"We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the studies were very small.\"\n   Why problematic: Long, repetitive, and uses passive‑like structure.\n   Suggested rewrite: \"We have low confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies varied in participants and delivery methods, and the trials were very small.\"\n5) Problematic heading: \"What mental health problems do people face in humanitarian crises?\"\n   Why problematic: The heading is fine, but the paragraph that follows repeats information from the abstract without adding plain‑language explanation of terms like \"humanitarian crises\".\n   Suggested rewrite: Add a brief definition: \"Humanitarian crises are situations such as war, conflict, or natural disasters that force people to flee their homes and live in stressful, resource‑poor conditions.\"\n\nThese revisions will reduce sentence length, increase active voice, and make the summary easier for patients and the public to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but notable deviations: passive_voice = 24 (beyond P90), nouns = 166 (beyond P90), and high scores for complex_words (129, beyond P90), complex_words_dc (272, beyond P90), long_words (188, beyond P90), and smog_index (14.05, beyond P90). These metrics confirm the editorial observations of excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy phrasing, and high lexical complexity, supporting the recommended revisions."
