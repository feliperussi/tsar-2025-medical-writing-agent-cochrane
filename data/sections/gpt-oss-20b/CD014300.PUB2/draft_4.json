  "draft": "Are mental‑health promotion programs (psychological and social interventions) effective for people living in low‑and middle‑income countries (poorer nations) affected by war or disaster?\n\nKey messages\n– Programs that aim to boost mental health showed little or no clear benefit for children and adolescents and only a small short‑term gain for adults; we found no evidence of lasting effects or harms.  \n– The evidence comes from a small number of trials with few participants and varied methods, so our confidence in the findings is low.  \n– Larger, well‑designed studies that follow people for longer periods are needed to determine whether these programmes can provide lasting benefits and to identify any potential harms.\n\nWhat mental health problems do people face in humanitarian crises?  \nAround 84 million people are forced to leave their homes because of war, conflict, persecution or other emergencies. Most live in low‑ and middle‑income countries where health services are limited. In these stressful settings people experience fear, loss, insecurity and other threats to their mental well‑being (overall emotional health). While many studies look at treating mental illness, we focused on ways to promote good mental health – feeling hopeful, coping well, enjoying a good quality of life and being able to function socially.\n\nWhat are psychosocial interventions and how are they used?  \nPsychosocial interventions combine psychological support (talking about feelings or learning coping skills) with social activities (group games, community projects or peer support). They are usually delivered in groups by trained helpers – people who are not formal mental‑health professionals but have received basic training to assist others. The aim is to boost mental‑well‑being, resilience and everyday functioning without treating a diagnosed mental disorder.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether group‑based psychosocial programmes improve positive aspects of mental health compared with doing nothing, receiving usual care, or waiting for help. We looked at outcomes such as mental‑well‑being, daily functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope and prosocial behaviour (helpful social behaviour) in children, adolescents and adults living in low‑ and middle‑income countries affected by humanitarian crises.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched eight databases and trial registries for randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial promotion programmes with no intervention or usual care. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 13 trials that together involved 7 917 participants. Nine trials studied children or adolescents and four studied adults. The studies were carried out in Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian territories, Nepal and Tanzania. None of the participants had a diagnosed mental disorder. We delivered group‑based programmes, mainly by trained helpers, and they lasted on average 18 weeks (range 10–32 weeks).\n\nFor children and adolescents, the programmes had little or no effect on mental‑well‑being or prosocial behaviour, and the certainty of this evidence is very low. We could not determine whether the programmes changed functioning in this age group.\n\nFor adults, the programmes gave a small boost to mental‑well‑being at the end of the study, but the evidence is uncertain and we do not know if any benefit lasts after follow‑up. No trials measured functioning or prosocial behaviour in adults.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence in the evidence. Participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies varied in who was included and how the interventions were delivered, and the trials were very small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe completed our searches in January 2023, so the evidence is up to date.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required structural and factual checks, but several clarity‑related problems would likely confuse a lay reader and reduce comprehension:\n1. **Passive, misleading sentence** – \"We delivered group‑based programmes, mainly by trained helpers, and they lasted on average 18 weeks…\" suggests the review authors ran the interventions, which is inaccurate and uses passive voice. Rewrite as an active description of who delivered the programmes.\n2. **Overly long country‑list sentence** – \"The studies were carried out in Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian territories, Nepal and Tanzania.\" This 30‑word sentence is hard to follow. Split into two shorter sentences.\n3.  **Dense key‑message bullet** – \"Programs that aim to boost mental health showed little or no clear benefit for children and adolescents and only a small short‑term gain for adults; we found no evidence of lasting effects or harms.\" The single bullet packs several ideas, making it difficult for a patient to grasp the main point. Break into two bullets.\n4. **Inconsistent terminology** – The draft uses both \"trained helpers\" and \"paraprofessionals\" for the same group, which may confuse readers. Choose one term and define it once.\n5. **Nominalised, noun‑heavy phrasing** – Several sentences rely on noun forms (e.g., \"the evidence suggests that these psychosocial programmes may have little to no effect…\") rather than clear verbs, contributing to a high nominalisation count (21, P90) and noun count (168, P90).\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- \"Trained helpers delivered the group‑based programmes, which lasted on average 18 weeks (range 10–32 weeks).\"\n- \"The studies were carried out in Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, and Haiti. Additional trials were conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the occupied Palestinian territories, Nepal, and Tanzania.\"\n- \"• Programs that aim to boost mental health showed little or no clear benefit for children and adolescents, and only a small short‑term gain for adults.\n• We found no evidence that any benefits lasted, and no evidence of harms.\"\n- Replace \"trained helpers\" with \"paraprofessionals (people who are not formal mental‑health professionals but have received basic training)\" and use this term consistently.\n- Convert noun‑heavy sentences to active verbs, e.g., \"The evidence shows that these programmes have little or no effect…\" instead of \"The evidence suggests that these psychosocial programmes may have little to no effect…\".\n\nThese changes will lower the passive‑voice count (currently 22, P90), reduce nominalisations, and improve overall readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits (619 words) and most readability indices are within typical PLS ranges (e.g., Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 50.7, P75). However, several metrics deviate markedly: passive_voice (22, P90), nominalization (21, P90), nouns (168, P90) and smog_index (14.1, P90), complex_words_dc (281, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (129, P90) and long_words (191, P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy phrasing, and high lexical complexity, supporting the editorial recommendations above."
