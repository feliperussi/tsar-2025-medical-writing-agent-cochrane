  "draft": "Are mental‑health promotion programmes (psychological and social interventions) effective for people living in low‑and middle‑income countries affected by war or disaster?\n\nKey messages\n– Programs that aim to boost mental health show little or no clear benefit for children and adolescents, and only a small short‑term gain for adults.  \n– We found no evidence that any benefits last over time, and no evidence of harmful effects.  \n– The evidence comes from few small trials with varied methods, so our confidence is low; larger, well‑designed studies are needed.\n\nWhat mental health problems do people face in humanitarian crises?  \nAround 84 million people are forced to leave their homes because of war, conflict, persecution or other emergencies. Most live in low‑ and middle‑income countries where health services are limited. In these stressful settings people experience fear, loss, insecurity and other threats to their mental well‑being (overall emotional health). While many studies look at treating mental illness, we focused on ways to promote good mental health – feeling hopeful, coping well, enjoying a good quality of life and being able to function socially.\n\nWhat are psychosocial interventions and how are they used?  \nPsychosocial interventions combine psychological support (talking about feelings or learning coping skills) with social activities (group games, community projects or peer support). They are usually delivered in groups by paraprofessionals – people who are not formally trained mental‑health professionals but have received basic training to help others at the first point of contact. The aim is to boost mental‑well‑being, resilience and everyday functioning without treating a diagnosed mental disorder.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether group‑based psychosocial programmes improve positive aspects of mental health compared with doing nothing, receiving usual care, or waiting for help. We looked at outcomes such as mental‑well‑being, daily functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope and prosocial behaviour (helpful social behaviour) in children, adolescents and adults living in low‑and middle‑income countries affected by humanitarian crises.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched eight databases and trial registries for randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial promotion programmes with no intervention or usual care. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 13 trials that together involved 7 917 participants. Nine trials studied children or adolescents and four studied adults. The studies were carried out in Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan and Haiti. Additional trials were conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian territories, Nepal and Tanzania. All participants had no diagnosed mental disorder. Paraprofessionals delivered the group‑based programmes, which lasted on average 18 weeks (range 10–32 weeks).\n\nFor children and adolescents, the programmes had little or no effect on mental‑well‑being or prosocial behaviour, and the certainty of this evidence is very low. We could not determine whether the programmes changed functioning in this age group.\n\nFor adults, the programmes gave a small boost to mental‑well‑being at the end of the study, but the evidence is uncertain and we do not know if any benefit lasts after follow‑up. No trials measured functioning or prosocial behaviour in adults.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies varied in who was included and how the interventions were delivered, and the trials were very small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe completed our searches in January 2023, so the evidence is up to date.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical check: all section subheadings must be phrased as questions, but the current headings (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"What mental health problems do people face in humanitarian crises?\" is a statement, not a question) do not meet this requirement. Additionally, the text contains several clarity and style issues that would confuse readers:\n\n1. **Subheadings not in question form** – e.g., \"Key messages\" and \"What did we do?\" are statements. Rewrite as questions such as \"What are the key messages?\" and \"What did we do?\".\n\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"The evidence suggests that these psychosocial programmes may have little to no effect on mental‑well‑being and prosocial behaviour in children and adolescents, but the certainty of the evidence is very low.\" This 33‑word sentence can be split for easier reading: \"The evidence suggests that these programmes have little or no effect on mental‑well‑being and prosocial behaviour in children and adolescents. However, the certainty of this evidence is very low.\"\n\n3. **High passive voice and nominalisation** – The draft includes 22 passive constructions (P90) and 22 nominalisations (P90), making the text noun‑heavy and harder to follow. Example: \"All participants had no diagnosed mental disorder.\" Change to active: \"We included participants who did not have a diagnosed mental disorder.\"\n\n4. **Noun‑heavy language** – 164 nouns (P90) and many long/complex words (e.g., \"psychosocial programmes\", \"paraprofessionals\"). Replace some with simpler verbs: \"Paraprofessionals ran the group programmes\" instead of \"Paraprofessionals delivered the group‑based programmes\".\n\n5. **Readability metrics indicate high complexity** – SMOG index 14.2 (P90), complex words 129 (P90), long words 185 (P90). Reducing multi‑syllable words (e.g., use \"help\" instead of \"facilitate\", \"use\" instead of \"utilize\") will lower these scores and improve patient‑facing clarity.\n\nAddressing the subheading format is mandatory for approval; the additional style and readability edits are strongly recommended to align the draft with the Master Style Guide and typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits (602 words) and most readability indices are in the lower quartile, but several metrics deviate markedly: passive_voice (22, P90), nominalization (22, P90), nouns (164, P90), smog_index (14.2, P90), complex_words (129, P90) and long_words (185, P90). These indicate excessive noun‑heavy, passive, and complex language, supporting the suggested active‑voice and simplification edits."
