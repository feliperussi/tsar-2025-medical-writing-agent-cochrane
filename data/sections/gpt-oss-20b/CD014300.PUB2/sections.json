  "plain_title": "Are mental‑health promotion programs (psychological and social interventions) effective for people living in low‑and middle‑income countries (poorer nations) affected by war or disaster?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Mental‑health promotion programmes in low‑ and middle‑income countries affected by war or disaster showed little or no clear benefit for improving overall emotional health (mental‑well‑being) or helpful social behaviour (pro‑social behaviour) in children and adolescents, and only a small possible short‑term improvement in adults, with no evidence of lasting effects or of harmful outcomes.",
    "The evidence is limited because it comes from a small number of studies with few participants and varied methods, so confidence in the findings is low.",
    "More well‑designed, larger studies that follow participants for longer periods are needed to determine whether these programmes can provide lasting benefits and to identify any potential harms."

      "subheading": "What mental health problems do people face in humanitarian crises?",
      "content": "Around 84 million people are forced to leave their homes because of wars, conflict, persecution or other humanitarian emergencies. Most of them live in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) – nations where resources for health care are limited. Living in these stressful settings exposes people to many threats to their mental well‑being, such as fear, loss, and ongoing insecurity. While many studies look at treating mental illness, this review is interested in ways to promote good mental health – things like feeling hopeful, coping well, having a good quality of life, and being able to function socially."

      "subheading": "What are psychosocial interventions and how are they used?",
      "content": "Psychosocial interventions are programmes that combine psychological support (like talking about feelings or learning coping skills) with social activities (such as group games, community projects or peer support). They are often delivered in groups by paraprofessionals – people who are not formally trained mental‑health professionals but have been taught to help others in the first point of contact. These interventions aim to boost mental‑well‑being, resilience, and everyday functioning without focusing on treating a diagnosed mental disorder."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether these group‑based psychosocial programmes actually improve positive aspects of mental health compared with doing nothing, receiving usual care, or waiting for help. Specifically, they looked at outcomes such as mental well‑being, daily functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope and prosocial behaviour in children, adolescents and adults living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we do?",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting mental health with no intervention or usual care in people living in low‑ and middle‑income countries affected by humanitarian crises. We combined the findings across these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 13 randomised controlled trials that together involved 7,917 people living in low‑ and middle‑income countries affected by humanitarian crises. Nine of the trials were done with children and adolescents and four with adults. The studies were carried out in a variety of locations – four in Lebanon, two in India, and one each in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian Territories, Nepal and Tanzania. All participants were people without a diagnosed mental disorder. The interventions tested were group‑based psychosocial programmes, usually delivered by paraprofessionals, and they were compared with no intervention, usual care or a waiting‑list. The programmes lasted on average 18 weeks (range 10–32 weeks) and were funded mainly by academic grants or non‑governmental organisations.\n\nThe evidence suggests that these psychosocial programmes may have little to no effect on mental well‑being and prosocial behaviour in children and adolescents, but the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is also unclear whether the programmes affect functioning in this age group. In adults, the programmes may lead to a small improvement in mental well‑being, but again the evidence is uncertain, and we do not know whether any benefit persists at follow‑up."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search."
