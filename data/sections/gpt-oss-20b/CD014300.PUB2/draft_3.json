  "draft": "Are mental‑health promotion programs (psychological and social interventions) effective for people living in low‑and middle‑income countries affected by war or disaster?\n\nKey messages\n– Programs that aim to boost mental health show little or no benefit for children and adolescents and only a small short‑term gain for adults; we found no evidence of lasting effects or harms.  \n– The evidence comes from a small number of trials with few participants and varied methods, so our confidence in the findings is low.  \n– Larger, well‑designed studies that follow people for longer periods are needed to determine whether these programmes can provide lasting benefits and to identify any potential harms.\n\nWhat mental health problems do people face in humanitarian crises?  \nHumanitarian crises are situations such as war, conflict, persecution or natural disasters that force people to flee their homes and live in stressful, resource‑poor conditions. Around 84 million people are displaced by such crises, most of them in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) where health services are limited. In these settings people experience fear, loss, insecurity and other threats to their mental well‑being. While many studies look at treating mental illness, this review focused on ways to promote good mental health – feeling hopeful, coping well, enjoying a good quality of life and functioning socially.\n\nWhat are psychosocial interventions and how are they used?  \nPsychosocial interventions combine psychological support (for example, talking about feelings or learning coping skills) with social activities (such as group games, community projects or peer support). They are usually delivered in groups by paraprofessionals – people who are not formally trained mental‑health professionals but have received basic training to help others. The aim is to boost mental‑well‑being, resilience and everyday functioning without treating a diagnosed mental disorder.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether group‑based psychosocial programmes improve positive aspects of mental health compared with doing nothing, receiving usual care, or waiting for help. We looked at outcomes such as mental‑well‑being, daily functioning, quality of life, resilience, coping, hope and prosocial behaviour in children, adolescents and adults living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched eight databases and trial registries for randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial promotion programmes with no intervention or usual care. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 13 trials that together involved 7 917 participants. Nine trials studied children or adolescents and four studied adults. The studies were carried out in Lebanon, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the occupied Palestinian territories, Nepal and Tanzania. All participants did not have a diagnosed mental disorder. We delivered group‑based programmes, mainly by trained paraprofessionals, and they lasted on average 18 weeks (range 10–32 weeks).\n\nFor children and adolescents, the programmes had little or no effect on mental‑well‑being or prosocial behaviour, and the certainty of this evidence is very low. We could not determine whether the programmes changed functioning in this age group.\n\nFor adults, the programmes produced a small improvement in mental‑well‑being at the end of the study, but the evidence is uncertain and we do not know if any benefit lasts after follow‑up. No trials measured functioning or prosocial behaviour in adults.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies varied in who was included and how the interventions were delivered, and the trials were very small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date with searches completed in January 2023.",

      "feedback": "Critical checks (sections, title format, factual accuracy, word count) all pass, but the draft contains several clarity problems that could confuse readers. The most important issues are:\n\n1. **Awkward negative phrasing** – \"All participants did not have a diagnosed mental disorder.\" This double‑negative is hard to process. Suggested rewrite: \"None of the participants had a diagnosed mental disorder.\"\n\n2. **Overly long, compound sentence in the limitations section** – \"We have low confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies varied in who was included and how the interventions were delivered, and the trials were very small.\" This packs three ideas into one sentence. Suggested rewrite: \"We have low confidence in the evidence. Participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies varied in who was included and how the interventions were delivered, and the trials were very small.\"\n\n3. **Passive construction that obscures agency** – \"The evidence is up to date with searches completed in January 2023.\" Readers benefit from an active voice. Suggested rewrite: \"We completed our searches in January 2023, so the evidence is up to date.\"\n\n4. **High density of complex and long words** – The metrics show 138 complex words, 194 long‑word tokens and 280 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (BEYOND_P90). Replacing words like \"paraprofessionals\" with \"trained helpers\" and simplifying phrases such as \"the programmes produced a small improvement\" to \"the programmes gave a small boost\" will lower reading difficulty.\n\n5. **Nominalisations and noun‑heavy sentences** – The draft contains 21 nominalisations and 170 nouns (both P90). Converting noun‑forms to verbs (e.g., \"We measured\" instead of \"Measurement was performed\") will make the text more active and easier to follow.\n\nAddressing these five points will bring the draft in line with the Cochrane plain‑language style guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (FRE 48.6, FKGL 11.3) are within typical PLS ranges, but several metrics deviate strongly: passive_voice (23, P90), nominalization (21, P90), nouns (170, P90), smog_index (14.5, P90), complex_words_dc (280, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (138, P90) and long_words (194, P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy phrasing, and a high proportion of complex/long words, supporting the suggested style and clarity revisions."
