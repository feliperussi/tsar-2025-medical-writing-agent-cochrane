  "draft": "Do preventive antibiotics (antibiotics given before a miscarriage procedure) lower the risk of infection after the procedure?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– Giving antibiotics before a uterine evacuation (surgical removal of pregnancy tissue) may reduce the chance of a uterine infection (infection of the uterus), but the evidence is not strong.  \n– Antibiotics probably do not change the risk of common side‑effects such as vomiting or diarrhoea, and we are uncertain whether they are increased allergic reactions.  \n– The studies we found had several problems, so more high‑quality research is needed to know the true benefits and harms.\n\nWhy might antibiotics be needed during miscarriage procedures?  \nWhen a woman experiences an early pregnancy loss (miscarriage), doctors often need to remove any remaining tissue from the uterus. This procedure can let bacteria enter the uterus and cause a serious infection. If a woman already shows signs of infection (for example fever or pain), we treat her with antibiotics. It is unclear whether giving antibiotics to every woman before the procedure – even when there are no signs of infection – is helpful. This preventive use is called prophylactic antibiotic use.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about routine antibiotic use?  \nWe wanted to find out whether giving prophylactic antibiotics to women undergoing uterine evacuation reduces the risk of developing a uterine infection compared with giving a placebo or no treatment. We also looked at whether routine antibiotics affect other outcomes, such as the need for later antibiotic treatment, hospital admission for infection, and side‑effects like vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases and trial registers for randomised controlled and randomised controlled trials that compared routine prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment in women having uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified six trials that together enrolled 4,371 women. All trials excluded women who already had signs of infection.\n\n– Overall, routine antibiotics may make little or no difference to the risk of uterine infection (low‑certainty evidence).  \n– When we looked only at the three trials judged to be at low risk of bias, antibiotics reduced infections by about 43% (high‑certainty evidence).  \n– Antibiotics probably make little or no difference to the risk of vomiting (moderate certainty) or diarrhoea (moderate certainty).  \n– They may increase allergic reactions, but the evidence is low certainty.  \n– We are very uncertain whether antibiotics reduce the need for later antibiotic treatment or hospital admission for infection.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the results because some studies may have been unblinded, not all outcomes were reported, the participants and methods varied, and there were few studies overall. These issues make the evidence uncertain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe searches were up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the structural and factual checks, but three major clarity problems would likely confuse a patient reader:\n1. **Awkward phrasing in the key‑messages bullet** – \"we are uncertain whether they are increased allergic reactions\" is grammatically incorrect and unclear. Suggested rewrite: \"Antibiotics probably do not change the risk of common side‑effects such as vomiting or diarrhoea, and we are uncertain whether they increase allergic reactions.\"\n2. **Unclear wording about later treatment** – \"We are very uncertain whether antibiotics reduce the need for later antibiotic treatment or hospital admission for infection\" repeats the word antibiotic and is vague. Suggested rewrite: \"We are very uncertain whether antibiotics reduce the need for additional antibiotics or for hospital admission because of infection.\"\n3. **Jargon – \"low‑certainty evidence\"** – The phrase may not be understood by lay readers. Suggested rewrite: \"Overall, routine antibiotics may make little or no difference to the risk of uterine infection, but we have low confidence in this result.\"\nThese issues affect readability and comprehension. The PLS evaluation also flags a high level of nominalisation (30 instances, beyond the typical range) and elevated counts of complex and long words, which stem from the same problematic phrasing. Reducing nominalisations and simplifying vocabulary (e.g., using \"we are not sure\" instead of \"we are uncertain\") will further improve the text. To achieve approval, rewrite the three highlighted sentences as suggested and consider simplifying any remaining dense wording.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and shows good overall conformity (words_per_sentence 18, active_voice 50, pronouns 27). However, several metrics deviate: nominalisation (30, beyond P90), SMOG (14.7, beyond P90), and high counts of complex/long words. These metric alerts correspond to the identified clarity issues and indicate the text could be made simpler and more active."
