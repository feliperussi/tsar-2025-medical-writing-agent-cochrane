  "draft": "Do preventive antibiotics (antibiotics given before a miscarriage procedure) lower the risk of infection after the procedure?\n\nKey messages\n– Giving antibiotics before a uterine evacuation (surgical removal of pregnancy tissue) may lower the chance of a uterine infection, but the evidence is not strong.  \n– Antibiotics are unlikely to affect the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea, and we are not sure if they increase allergic reactions.  \n– We are very uncertain whether antibiotics reduce the need for later antibiotics or for hospital admission because of infection.\n\nWhy might antibiotics be needed during procedures for early pregnancy loss?\nWhen a woman experiences an early pregnancy loss (miscarriage), doctors often need to remove any remaining tissue from the uterus. This is called a uterine evacuation. Removing tissue can let bacteria enter the uterus and cause a serious infection. If a woman already shows signs of infection (for example fever or pain), doctors give antibiotics to treat it. It is unclear whether giving antibiotics to every woman before the procedure – even when there are no signs of infection – is helpful. Giving antibiotics to prevent infection is called prophylactic use.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about routine antibiotic use?\nWe wanted to know whether giving prophylactic antibiotics to women undergoing uterine evacuation reduces the risk of developing a uterine infection compared with giving a placebo (a harmless pill) or no treatment. We also looked at whether routine antibiotics affect other outcomes, such as the need for later antibiotic treatment, hospital admission for infection, and side‑effects like vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to October 2023 in several databases and trial registers. Two‑reviewer teams independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach, a system that rates how sure we are about the evidence. The studies we included were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which compare a new treatment with a placebo or no treatment.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six RCTs that together enrolled 4,371 women undergoing surgical uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss. All trials excluded women who already had signs of infection.\n\n– Overall, routine antibiotics may make little or no difference to the risk of uterine infection (low‑certainty evidence).  \n– When we looked only at the three trials judged to be at low risk of bias, antibiotics reduced infections by about 43% and we have high confidence in that finding.  \n– Antibiotics probably make little or no difference to the risk of vomiting (moderate confidence) or diarrhoea (moderate confidence).  \n– They may increase allergic reactions, but the evidence is of low confidence.  \n– We are very uncertain whether antibiotics reduce the need for additional antibiotics or for hospital admission because of infection (very low confidence).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not very sure about the results because some studies were unblinded, the studies did not report all outcomes, they used different participants and methods, and there were only a few studies.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural and factual requirements, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a patient audience. 1) Unexplained jargon: the acronyms “RCTs” and “GRADE” appear without definition, leaving readers unsure what they mean. 2) Overly long sentence in the Methods section makes the information hard to follow. 3) Heavy use of nominalisations (e.g., “assessment of the certainty of the evidence”) creates noun‑heavy sentences that reduce readability. 4) Slight inconsistency in wording about the effect on uterine infection (\"may lower the chance\" vs \"may make little or no difference\") can mislead readers about the strength of the evidence. These issues are supported by the metric report, which shows a high SMOG index (14.75 → grade 15 reading level), many complex words (138) and a very high nominalisation count (35, beyond the typical range). Reducing jargon, shortening sentences, using more verbs instead of nouns, and harmonising the wording will bring the summary into the typical PLS readability range.\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- \"RCTs (randomised controlled trials)\" and \"GRADE (a system for rating how confident we are in the evidence)\" should be introduced at first mention.\n- Split the long methods sentence: \"We searched the literature up to October 2023 in several databases and trial registers. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted the data, and used the GRADE approach to assess how certain we are about the evidence.\"\n- Replace nominalisations: change \"assessment of the certainty of the evidence\" to \"we assessed how certain we are about the evidence\".\n- Align effect wording: use a single phrasing such as \"Overall, routine antibiotics probably make little or no difference to the risk of uterine infection (low‑certainty evidence), but in the three high‑quality studies they reduced infections by about 43% (high‑certainty evidence).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights five deviations: nominalisation (35, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.75, P90), complex_words_dc (226, P90), complex_words (138, P90) and long_words (179, P90). These indicate the draft is more complex than typical PLS texts, supporting the need to simplify language, reduce noun‑heavy constructions, and lower the reading grade level."
