  "draft": "Do preventive antibiotics (antibiotics given before a miscarriage procedure) lower the risk of infection after the procedure?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Prophylactic antibiotics (antibiotics given before the procedure) may lower the chance of uterine infection (infection of the uterus) after uterine evacuation (surgical removal of pregnancy tissue) for early pregnancy loss (loss of a pregnancy in the first trimester), but the evidence is not strong. They appear to have little effect on common side effects such as vomiting or diarrhoea, and any increase in allergic reactions (allergy) is uncertain.\n- The review also found very uncertain evidence about whether giving antibiotics before the procedure reduces the need for later antibiotic treatment or hospital admission for infection.\n- Because the existing studies have limitations such as poor follow‑up and inconsistent use of the antibiotics, more high‑quality research is needed to clarify the true benefits and possible harms of routine antibiotic prophylaxis in this context.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy might antibiotics be needed during procedures for early pregnancy loss?\nWhen a woman experiences an early pregnancy loss (also called “miscarriage”), doctors often need to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from the uterus. This is called a uterine evacuation. Removing tissue can sometimes let bacteria enter the uterus and cause an infection, which can be serious. If a woman already shows signs of infection (like fever or pain), doctors clearly give antibiotics to treat it. However, it is not clear whether giving antibiotics to every woman before the procedure – even when there are no signs of infection – is helpful or necessary. Giving antibiotics to prevent infection is called \"prophylactic\" use. The question is whether this routine preventive treatment reduces the chance of a uterine infection after the procedure, and whether it might cause side‑effects such as nausea, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about routine antibiotic use?\nThe authors set out to find out whether giving prophylactic antibiotics to women undergoing uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss reduces the risk of developing a uterine infection compared with giving a placebo or no treatment. They also wanted to see if routine antibiotics affect other outcomes, such as the need for later antibiotic treatment, hospital admission for infection, and any unwanted side‑effects like vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions. In short, the review evaluated the benefits and harms of using antibiotics as a preventive measure in this specific surgical setting.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared routine antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no treatment in women undergoing uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss, combined their results in meta‑analyses, and assessed our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 4,371 women who were having surgical uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss. The studies did not set a limit on gestational age and excluded any women who showed signs of infection. All trials compared giving routine prophylactic antibiotics with giving a placebo or no treatment. The abstract does not provide details about how long participants were followed, the countries or settings of the studies, the ages or other demographic features of the women, or the sources of funding for the trials.\n\nMain results: Uterine infection and other outcomes\nRoutine antibiotic prophylaxis may make little to no difference to the risk of uterine infection after uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss (low certainty). However, when only high‑quality studies are considered, routine antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the risk of uterine infection (high certainty). Antibiotic prophylaxis probably makes little to no difference to the risk of vomiting (moderate certainty) or diarrhoea (moderate certainty) after the procedure. It may increase the risk of allergic reactions (low certainty). It is unclear whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the need for additional antibiotics to treat infection (very low certainty) or reduces hospitalisation for infection after the procedure (very low certainty).\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that all section subheadings must be phrased as questions. Current subheadings such as \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are statements, not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide requirement. Additionally, the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many nominalisations, leading to low readability (Flesch Reading Ease 30.85 P10, Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 14.7 P90) and high complexity metrics (e.g., 43 nominalisations, 219 nouns, 204 complex words). These issues make the summary harder for patients to understand. Suggested improvements: 1) Re‑write each subheading as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\", \"Why might antibiotics be needed during miscarriage procedures?\"). 2) Reduce nominalisations and noun‑heavy sentences by converting nouns to active verbs (e.g., change \"The review also found very uncertain evidence about whether giving antibiotics before the procedure reduces the need for later antibiotic treatment or hospital admission for infection\" to \"Do antibiotics before the procedure reduce the need for later treatment or hospital admission?\"). 3) Shorten long sentences and replace complex words with simpler alternatives to raise the reading ease score. These changes will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft deviates from typical PLS patterns on 11 metrics. Notably, nominalisations (43, BEYOND_P90) and noun count (219, BEYOND_P90) are far above median levels, and readability scores are low (Flesch Reading Ease 30.85 P10, Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 14.7 P90, Gunning Fog 20.3 P90). These indicate the text is too complex and noun‑heavy for a plain‑language summary, supporting the need for the suggested revisions."
