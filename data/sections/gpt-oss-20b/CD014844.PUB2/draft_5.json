  "draft": "Do preventive antibiotics (antibiotics given before a miscarriage procedure) lower the risk of infection after the procedure?\n\nKey messages\n– Giving antibiotics before a uterine evacuation (surgical removal of pregnancy tissue) may lower the chance of a uterine infection, but the overall evidence is uncertain.  \n– Antibiotics probably do‑much to change the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea, and we are not sure whether they increase allergic reactions.  \n– Evidence is very uncertain about whether antibiotics reduce the need for later antibiotics or for hospital admission because of infection.\n\nWhy might antibiotics be needed during procedures for early pregnancy loss?\nWhen a woman experiences an early pregnancy loss (miscarriage), doctors often need to remove any remaining tissue from the uterus. This procedure is called a uterine evacuation. Removing tissue can allow bacteria to enter the uterus and cause a serious infection. If a woman already shows signs of infection (for example fever or pain), doctors give antibiotics to treat it. It is unclear whether giving antibiotics to every woman before the procedure – even when there are no signs of infection – is helpful. Giving antibiotics to prevent infection is called prophylactic use.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about routine antibiotic use?\nWe wanted to know whether giving prophylactic antibiotics to women undergoing uterine evacuation reduces the risk of developing a uterine infection compared with giving a placebo (a harmless pill) or no treatment. We also looked at whether routine antibiotics affect other outcomes, such as the need for later antibiotic treatment, hospital admission for infection, and side‑effects like vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases and trial registers for studies up to October 2023. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted the data, and used the GRADE approach (a system for rating how confident we are in the evidence) to assess our certainty. All included studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which compare a new treatment with a placebo or no treatment.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six RCTs that together enrolled 4,371 women having surgical uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss. All trials excluded women who already had signs of infection.\n\n– Overall, routine antibiotics probably make little or no difference to the risk of uterine infection (low‑certainty evidence).  \n– When we looked only at the three trials judged to be at low risk of bias, antibiotics reduced infections by about 43% (high‑certainty evidence).  \n– Antibiotics probably make little or no difference to the risk of vomiting (moderate‑certainty evidence) or diarrhoea (moderate‑certainty evidence).  \n– They may increase allergic reactions, but the evidence is of low certainty.  \n– We are very uncertain whether antibiotics reduce the need for additional antibiotics or for hospital admission because of infection (very low certainty).\n\nWhat are the evidence’s limitations?\nWe have little confidence in the results because some studies were unblinded, not all outcomes were reported, the participants and methods varied, and only a few studies were available.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to October 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several statements that would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. The second key‑message bullet uses vague and contradictory language (“Antibiotics probably do‑much to change the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea”).\n2. The acronym “RCTs” is never explained, leaving readers unsure what type of study is being referred to.\n3. The term “GRADE approach” is mentioned without a plain‑language explanation, so readers cannot understand what it means.\nThese three issues meet the threshold of 3 significant clarity problems, so the PLS cannot be approved. Minor style and structural issues are also present (high nominalisation count 35, SMOG ≈15, many complex words), which support the need to simplify the wording.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n- Quote: \"Antibiotics probably do‑much to change the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea, and we are not sure whether they increase allergic reactions.\"\n  Why problematic: The phrase “do‑much to change the risk” is vague and suggests a large effect, contradicting the later statement that the effect is likely little or none.\n  Suggested rewrite: \"Antibiotics probably make little or no difference to the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea, and we are not sure whether they increase allergic reactions.\"\n\n- Quote: \"All included studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which compare a new treatment with a placebo or no treatment.\"\n  Why problematic: The abbreviation “RCTs” is introduced without first defining it, which can confuse readers unfamiliar with research terminology.\n  Suggested rewrite: \"All included studies were randomised controlled trials – a type of study that randomly assigns participants to receive either the antibiotic or a harmless placebo (or no treatment).\"\n\n- Quote: \"... and used the GRADE approach (a system for rating how confident we are in the evidence) to assess our certainty.\"\n  Why problematic: Although a brief parenthetical explanation is given, the term “GRADE approach” remains technical and may still be unclear to a lay audience.\n  Suggested rewrite: \"... and used a simple system called GRADE, which helps us judge how confident we are in the results.\"\n\n- Quote: \"All trials excluded women who already had signs of infection.\"\n  Why problematic: The passive construction and lack of explicit wording can be unclear about who was excluded.\n  Suggested rewrite: \"All the studies only included women who did not have any signs of infection.\"\n\n- Quote: \"We identified six RCTs that together enrolled 4,371 women having surgical uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss.\"\n  Why problematic: The sentence is long and contains the nominalisation “identification”. It can be split for easier reading.\n  Suggested rewrite: \"We found six studies. In total, they included 4,371 women who had a surgical uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss.\"\n\nSupporting evidence: The PLS evaluation shows high nominalisation (35, beyond typical range), a high SMOG index (≈15, beyond typical), and many complex words (complex_words 145, long_words 186). These metrics confirm the draft is more complex than typical PLS texts, reinforcing the need for the simplifications above.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on overall conformity (good overall pattern), but shows significant deviations in nominalisation (35, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (≈15, BEYOND_P90), and complex/long word counts (well above median). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words, suggesting a need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
