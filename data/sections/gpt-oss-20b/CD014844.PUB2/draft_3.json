  "draft": "Do preventive antibiotics (antibiotics given before a miscarriage procedure) lower the risk of infection after the procedure?\n\nKey messages\n– Giving antibiotics before a uterine evacuation (surgical removal of pregnancy tissue) may lower the chance of a uterine infection, but the evidence is not strong.  \n– Antibiotics probably do not change the risk of common side‑effects such as vomiting or diarrhoea, and we are uncertain whether they increase allergic reactions.  \n– We are very uncertain whether antibiotics reduce the need for additional antibiotics or for hospital admission because of infection.\n\nWhy might antibiotics be needed during procedures for early pregnancy loss?\nWhen a woman experiences an early pregnancy loss (miscarriage), doctors often need to remove any remaining tissue from the uterus. This procedure is called a uterine evacuation. Removing tissue can let bacteria enter the uterus and cause a serious infection. If a woman already shows signs of infection (for example fever or pain), we treat her with antibiotics. It is unclear whether giving antibiotics to every woman before the procedure – even when there are no signs of infection – is helpful. Giving antibiotics to prevent infection is called prophylactic use.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about routine antibiotic use?\nWe wanted to know whether giving prophylactic antibiotics to women undergoing uterine evacuation reduces the risk of developing a uterine infection compared with giving a placebo or no treatment. We also looked at whether routine antibiotics affect other outcomes, such as the need for later antibiotic treatment, hospital admission for infection, and side‑effects like vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared routine prophylactic antibiotics with placebo or no treatment in women having uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six trials that together enrolled 4,371 women. All trials excluded women who already had signs of infection.\n\n– Overall, routine antibiotics may make little or no difference to the risk of uterine infection, but we have low confidence in this result.  \n– When we looked only at the three trials judged to be at low risk of bias, antibiotics reduced infections by about 43% and we have high confidence in that finding.  \n– Antibiotics probably make little or no difference to the risk of vomiting (moderate confidence) or diarrhoea (moderate confidence).  \n– They may increase allergic reactions, but the evidence is of low confidence.  \n– We are very uncertain whether antibiotics reduce the need for additional antibiotics or for hospital admission because of infection.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the results because some studies may have been unblinded, not all outcomes were reported, the participants and methods varied, and there were few studies overall. These issues make the evidence uncertain.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe searches were up to date to October 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, title/subheading format, factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse patients. \n1) **Long, complex sentence in the limitations paragraph** – \"We have little confidence in the results because some studies may have been unblinded, not all outcomes were reported, the participants and methods varied, and there were few studies overall.\" This 33‑word sentence packs multiple ideas, making it hard to follow. *Rewrite*: \"We have little confidence in the results. Some studies were unblinded, not all outcomes were reported, the participants and methods differed, and there were only a few studies.\"\n2) **Unexplained technical terms** – the draft uses \"GRADE approach\", \"randomised controlled trials\" and \"placebo\" without brief explanations. Patients may not know these concepts. *Rewrite*: \"We used the GRADE approach, a system that rates how sure we are about the evidence. The studies we looked at were randomised controlled trials, which compare a new treatment with a placebo (a harmless pill) or no treatment.\"\n3) **Passive voice in the currency statement** – \"The searches were up to date to October 2023.\" Passive wording hides who did the work. *Rewrite*: \"We searched the literature up to October 2023.\"\n4) **Nominalisation and noun‑heavy wording in the limitations description** – \"We have little confidence in the results because some studies may have been unblinded…\" uses the noun \"confidence\" and a long clause. *Rewrite*: \"We are not very sure about the results because some studies were unblinded, did not report all outcomes, used different participants and methods, and there were only a few studies.\"\n5) **Redundant phrasing in key messages** – \"Antibiotics probably do not change the risk of common side‑effects such as vomiting or diarrhoea, and we are uncertain whether they increase allergic reactions.\" The phrase \"probably do not change\" and \"we are uncertain\" repeat the same idea. *Rewrite*: \"Antibiotics are unlikely to affect the risk of vomiting or diarrhoea, and we are not sure if they increase allergic reactions.\"\nThese issues stem from the metric analysis, which shows the draft is far above typical PLS levels for nominalisation (34 instances, BEYOND_P90), Gunning‑Fog (19.6, P90), SMOG (14.9, P90), and complex/long words. Reducing nominalisations and simplifying vocabulary will lower these scores and improve readability. Overall, the draft needs the above revisions before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit but deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: nominalisation (34, BEYOND_P90), Gunning‑Fog (19.6, P90), SMOG (14.9, P90), complex words (142, P90) and long words (178, P90). These indicate the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than usual, supporting the need to simplify language, reduce nominalisations, and shorten sentences."
