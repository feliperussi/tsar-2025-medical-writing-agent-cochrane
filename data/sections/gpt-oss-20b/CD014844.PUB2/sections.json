  "key_messages": [
    "Prophylactic antibiotics (antibiotics given before the procedure) may lower the chance of uterine infection (infection of the uterus) after uterine evacuation (surgical removal of pregnancy tissue) for early pregnancy loss (loss of a pregnancy in the first trimester), but the evidence is not strong. They appear to have little effect on common side effects such as vomiting or diarrhoea, and any increase in allergic reactions (allergy) is uncertain.",
    "The review also found very uncertain evidence about whether giving antibiotics before the procedure reduces the need for later antibiotic treatment or hospital admission for infection.",
    "Because the existing studies have limitations such as poor follow‑up and inconsistent use of the antibiotics, more high‑quality research is needed to clarify the true benefits and possible harms of routine antibiotic prophylaxis in this context."

      "subheading": "Why might antibiotics be needed during procedures for early pregnancy loss?",
      "content": "When a woman experiences an early pregnancy loss (also called “miscarriage”), doctors often need to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue from the uterus. This is called a uterine evacuation. Removing tissue can sometimes let bacteria enter the uterus and cause an infection, which can be serious. If a woman already shows signs of infection (like fever or pain), doctors clearly give antibiotics to treat it. However, it is not clear whether giving antibiotics to every woman before the procedure – even when there are no signs of infection – is helpful or necessary. Giving antibiotics to prevent infection is called \"prophylactic\" use. The question is whether this routine preventive treatment reduces the chance of a uterine infection after the procedure, and whether it might cause side‑effects such as nausea, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to discover about routine antibiotic use?",
      "content": "The authors set out to find out whether giving prophylactic antibiotics to women undergoing uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss reduces the risk of developing a uterine infection compared with giving a placebo or no treatment. They also wanted to see if routine antibiotics affect other outcomes, such as the need for later antibiotic treatment, hospital admission for infection, and any unwanted side‑effects like vomiting, diarrhoea, or allergic reactions. In short, the review evaluated the benefits and harms of using antibiotics as a preventive measure in this specific surgical setting."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified six randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 4,371 women who were having surgical uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss. The studies did not set a limit on gestational age and excluded any women who showed signs of infection. All trials compared giving routine prophylactic antibiotics with giving a placebo or no treatment. The abstract does not provide details about how long participants were followed, the countries or settings of the studies, the ages or other demographic features of the women, or the sources of funding for the trials."

      "subheading": "Main results: Uterine infection and other outcomes",
      "content": "Routine antibiotic prophylaxis may make little to no difference to the risk of uterine infection after uterine evacuation for early pregnancy loss (low certainty). However, when only high‑quality studies are considered, routine antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the risk of uterine infection (high certainty). Antibiotic prophylaxis probably makes little to no difference to the risk of vomiting (moderate certainty) or diarrhoea (moderate certainty) after the procedure. It may increase the risk of allergic reactions (low certainty). It is unclear whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the need for additional antibiotics to treat infection (very low certainty) or reduces hospitalisation for infection after the procedure (very low certainty)."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
