  "draft": "Do organisational policies and staff training reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bed rails and belts) for older people in care homes?\n\nKey messages\n– Policies that set a “least‑restraint” rule and include staff training usually lower the proportion of residents who are restrained, especially belt restraints, and no serious harms were reported.  \n– Training programmes that only provide education without broader policy changes show unclear effects because the evidence is inconsistent.  \n– We have moderate confidence in these findings, but we need more large, high‑quality studies to confirm long‑term outcomes and any possible harms.\n\nWhy are physical restraints used in long‑term care, and why is this a problem?  \nMany older people living in care homes are fitted with devices such as bed rails, belts around chairs or beds, or other equipment that limits movement. These devices are called physical restraints because they keep a person from moving freely. Staff often use them because they worry a resident might fall, wander, or hurt themselves or others. Research shows that restraints do not improve safety and can cause injuries, loss of independence, and even death. For this reason, health organisations recommend avoiding physical restraints whenever possible.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether specific programmes can help care homes reduce or stop the use of physical restraints for older people. We looked at two types of programmes: (1) organisational programmes that change policies, train staff, and promote a “least‑restraint” approach, and (2) simple educational programmes that aim to increase staff knowledge and change attitudes about restraints.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe looked for studies that compared different ways of preventing or reducing restraints. We searched many research databases to find these studies. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted the data, and judged the risk of bias. We focused on the proportion of residents with at least one restraint and on serious adverse events such as death or serious injury. When several studies measured the same outcome, we combined their results (a meta‑analysis). We used a standard method (the GRADE system) to describe how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 11 studies that together included 19,003 older adults with dementia living in long‑term residential care facilities. The average age was about 85 years. All studies were done in institutions; none were set in the community.\n\nThe interventions fell into three groups:  \n– Four organisational programmes that introduced a least‑restraint policy (including staff education, “champion” training, and policy changes).  \n– Six simple educational programmes that aimed to improve staff knowledge and attitudes.  \n– One programme that gave staff information about residents’ fall risk.\n\nCompared with usual care, the organisational programmes reduced overall restraint use slightly and reduced belt‑restraint use by about half. No serious harms were reported in the studies that looked at safety outcomes. The simple educational programmes showed unclear effects on overall restraint use and probably made little or no difference to how intensely restraints were used. Both types of programmes probably had little or no impact on falls, on the use of psychotropic medications (drugs that affect mood or behaviour), or on residents’ quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate confidence in these findings because many studies were small, used different participants and delivery methods, and participants often knew which programme they received, which could influence results. The risk of bias was high or unclear in most studies.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes all evidence up to the August 2022 search.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft passes the checklist (all required sections, question‑style headings, factual accuracy, word count), but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained technical terms** – phrases such as “GRADE system”, “risk of bias”, and “organisational interventions” are used without plain language definitions. \n   *Rewrite*: “We used a recognised method (called GRADE) to show how confident we are in the results.” and “We checked how reliable each study was (its risk of bias).”\n2. **Long, dense sentences** – e.g., “We looked for studies that compared different ways of preventing or reducing restraints… We used a standard method (the GRADE system) to describe how confident we are in the evidence.” This packs many ideas into one paragraph, making it hard to follow.\n   *Rewrite*: break into bullet points or short sentences, e.g., “We searched many databases for studies that tested ways to reduce restraints. Two reviewers independently chose the studies and extracted the data. We assessed how reliable each study was. We focused on how many residents were restrained and on serious harms such as death. When possible we combined the results (a meta‑analysis). We then used the GRADE method to show our confidence in the evidence.”\n3. **Vague wording of results** – the sentence “The simple educational programmes showed unclear effects on overall restraint use and probably made little or no difference to how intensely restraints were used.” is ambiguous.\n   *Rewrite*: “We are not sure whether simple education changes the number of residents who are restrained, and it probably does not change how often restraints are used.”\n4. **Heavy noun‑heavy language** – the draft has a very high noun count (194) and many complex/long words, which makes sentences feel dense (e.g., “The interventions fell into three groups”).\n   *Rewrite*: use more verbs and shorter words, e.g., “We grouped the interventions into three types:” and replace “implementation of a least‑restraint policy” with “introducing a rule to use as few restraints as possible.”\n5. **Key messages are long and noun‑heavy** – each bullet reads like a paragraph.\n   *Rewrite*: split into two short sentences per bullet, e.g., “Policies that set a ‘least‑restraint’ rule and include staff training usually lower the proportion of residents who are restrained, especially belt restraints. No serious harms were reported in the studies.”\nThese issues are reflected in the metric report: the draft shows unusually high noun count, complex‑word, long‑word and SMOG scores (all in the >P90 range), indicating the text is more noun‑ and word‑dense than typical PLSs. Reducing‑or‑re‑phrasing as suggested will bring the draft closer to typical PLS readability levels. Overall, the draft needs these revisions before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count and sentence‑length norms (words_per_sentence P25, readability indices P25‑P75). However, five metrics deviate strongly (nouns, SMOG, complex_words_dc, complex_words, long_words all >P90), indicating excessive noun density and complex vocabulary. Active voice and pronoun use are good, but the high noun count contributes to the clarity issues identified above."
