  "key_messages": [
    "Organisational policies (facility‑level rules) that aim to create a ‘least‑restraint’ approach (a set of rules and support to use as few restraints as possible) together with staff training tend to lower the proportion of residents who are restrained (devices such as bed rails or belts that limit movement), especially reducing the use of belts, and no serious harms (serious injuries or deaths) were reported in the studies.",
    "Training programmes that only provide education to staff, without broader policy changes, showed unclear effects on restraint use, with the available evidence being inconsistent.",
    "More high‑quality research is needed, especially studies that reduce bias, examine long‑term outcomes, and report any possible harms, to confirm these findings and to understand how best to implement restraint‑reduction strategies in care homes."

      "subheading": "Why are physical restraints used in long‑term care, and why is this a problem?",
      "content": "Many older people living in care homes or receiving care at home are sometimes fitted with devices such as bed‑rails, belts around chairs or beds, or other devices that limit their movement. These are called physical restraints – tools that keep a person from moving freely. They are often used because staff worry that a resident might fall, wander, or hurt themselves or others. However, research shows that these restraints do not improve safety and can cause serious harm, including injuries, loss of independence, and even death. Because of this, health organisations recommend that physical restraints should be avoided whenever possible."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to discover whether specific programmes or actions can help care homes and community settings reduce or stop the use of physical restraints for older people. They looked at two main types of interventions: (1) organisational interventions, which involve changing policies, training staff, and promoting a \"least‑restraint\" approach, and (2) simple educational interventions, which aim to increase staff knowledge and change attitudes about restraints. The review evaluated how these strategies affect the number of residents who are restrained, the use of belts, and any related safety outcomes."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 11 studies that together included 19,003 older adults living in long‑term residential care facilities and diagnosed with dementia. The average age of participants was about 85 years. All studies were carried out in institutional care settings; no community‑based trials were found, and the abstract does not state the countries where the research was conducted. The interventions fell into three groups: four organisational programmes that aimed to implement a least‑restraint policy (including staff education, champion training, and changes to policy and culture), six simple educational programmes designed to improve staff knowledge and attitudes toward restraints, and one study that gave staff information about residents’ fall risk. Control groups generally received usual care, although two trials also provided informational materials about restraint reduction. Details such as trial duration, funding sources, gender distribution, and specific dementia severity were not reported."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Use of physical restraints",
      "content": "Organisational interventions probably reduce the overall use of physical restraints slightly and probably lead to a large reduction in the use of belt restraints. Simple educational interventions have an unclear effect on the use of physical restraints and probably make little or no difference to restraint intensity. Both organisational and educational approaches probably make little or no difference to falls, the use of psychotropic medications, or residents’ quality of life."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search."
