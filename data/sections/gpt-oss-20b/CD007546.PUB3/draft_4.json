  "draft": "Do organisational policies and staff training reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bed rails and belts) for older people in care homes?\n\nKey messages\n– Policies that set a “least‑restraint” rule and include staff training usually lower the proportion of residents who are restrained, especially belt restraints. No serious harms were reported in the studies.  \n– Training programmes that only provide education without broader policy changes show unclear effects on restraint use because the evidence is inconsistent.  \n– More high‑quality, larger studies are needed to examine long‑term outcomes and any possible harms before we can be sure how best to reduce restraints in care homes.\n\nWhy are physical restraints used in long‑term care, and why is this a problem?  \nMany older people living in care homes are fitted with devices such as bed rails, belts around chairs or beds, or other equipment that limits movement. These devices are called physical restraints because they keep a person from moving freely. Staff often use them out of fear that a resident might fall, wander, or hurt themselves or others. Research shows that restraints do not improve safety and can cause injuries, loss of independence, and even death. For this reason, health organisations recommend avoiding physical restraints whenever possible.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether specific programmes can help care homes reduce or stop the use of physical restraints for older people. We looked at two types of programmes: (1) organisational programmes that change policies, train staff, and promote a “least‑restraint” approach, and (2) simple educational programmes that aim to increase staff knowledge and change attitudes about restraints.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases for randomised or controlled trials that tested actions to prevent or reduce physical restraints in older people receiving long‑term care. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and judged the risk of bias. We focused on the proportion of residents with at least one restraint and on serious adverse events such as death or serious injury. When possible we combined results in meta‑analyses; otherwise we described findings narratively. We used the GRADE system to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 11 studies that together included 19,003 residents with dementia living in long‑term residential care facilities. The average age was about 85 years. All studies were done in institutions; none were set in the community. The interventions fell into three groups: four organisational programmes that introduced a least‑restraint policy (including staff education, “champion” training, and policy changes); six simple educational programmes that aimed to improve staff knowledge and attitudes; and one programme that gave staff information about residents’ fall risk. Control groups usually received usual care, and two studies also provided informational leaflets about restraint reduction.\n\nOrganisational programmes probably reduce the overall use of physical restraints slightly and lead to a large reduction in belt‑restraint use. Simple educational programmes show unclear effects on overall restraint use and probably make little or no difference to how intensely restraints are used. Both types of programmes probably have little or no impact on falls, on the use of psychotropic medications (drugs that affect mood or behaviour), or on residents’ quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in these findings. Many studies were small, used different participants and delivery methods, and participants often knew which programme they received, which could influence results. The risk of bias was high or unclear in most studies.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes all evidence up to the August 2022 search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check. Three major issues were identified that could confuse readers:\n1. **Unexplained technical jargon** – terms such as “randomised or controlled trials”, “meta‑analyses” and “GRADE system” are not defined for a lay audience. Rewrite to plain language (e.g., “studies that compared groups of residents”, “we combined results from similar studies”, “we used a standard method to judge how confident we are in the evidence”).\n2. **Overly long sentence** – \"We searched several databases for randomised or controlled trials that tested actions to prevent or reduce physical restraints in older people receiving long‑term care.\" This 27‑word sentence packs several ideas. Split it: \"We looked for studies that compared different ways of preventing or reducing restraints. We searched many research databases to find these studies.\"\n3. **Repeated uncertainty wording** – Frequent use of “probably” and “little or no” without explaining what that means for confidence can leave readers unsure. Replace with a clear statement of confidence (e.g., “We have moderate confidence that policies reduce overall restraint use, and strong confidence that they greatly reduce belt use”).\nAdditional minor issues: the phrase “little or no impact” is repeated and could be simplified, and the term “psychotropic medications (drugs that affect mood or behaviour)” could be introduced earlier.\n**Metric support**: The PLS evaluation shows high complexity – SMOG index 14.2, complex words 136, long words 195, and complex‑word‑Dale‑Chall count 275 – all well above typical PLS ranges. Reducing jargon and long words will bring these metrics into the normal range and improve readability.\nOverall, the draft needs these revisions before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (overall high conformity), but five metrics deviate significantly: nouns (200 > median 116), SMOG index (14.2 > 12.1), complex_words_dc (275 > 160), complex_words (136 > 84), and long_words (195 > 122). These indicate excess lexical complexity that should be reduced for better plain‑language readability."
