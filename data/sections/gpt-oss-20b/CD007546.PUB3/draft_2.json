  "draft": "Do organisational policies and staff training reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bed rails and belts) for older people in care homes?\n\nKey messages\n- Policies that promote a “least‑restraint” approach (a rule to use as few restraints as possible) together with staff training usually lower the share of residents who are restrained, especially cutting the use of belt restraints, and no serious harms were reported.\n- Training that only provides education without changing policies shows unclear effects on restraint use, because the evidence is inconsistent.\n- We need more high‑quality, larger studies that look at long‑term outcomes and any possible harms before we can be sure how best to reduce restraints in care homes.\n\nWhy are physical restraints used in long‑term care, and why is this a problem?\nMany older people in care homes or receiving care at home are fitted with devices such as bed‑rails, belts around chairs or beds, or other equipment that limits movement. These devices are called physical restraints because they keep a person from moving freely. Staff often use them out of fear that a resident might fall, wander, or hurt themselves or others. Research shows that restraints do not improve safety and can cause injuries, loss of independence, and even death. For this reason, health organisations recommend avoiding physical restraints whenever possible.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether specific programmes can help care homes and community settings reduce or stop the use of physical restraints for older people. We looked at two types of programmes: (1) organisational programmes that change policies, train staff, and promote a least‑restraint approach; and (2) simple educational programmes that aim to increase staff knowledge and change attitudes about restraints. We examined how these programmes affect the number of residents who are restrained, the use of belt restraints, and any related safety outcomes.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched several databases for randomised or controlled trials that tested actions to prevent or reduce physical restraints in older people receiving long‑term care. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and judged the risk of bias. We focused on the proportion of residents with at least one restraint and on serious adverse events such as death or serious injury. When possible we combined results in meta‑analyses; otherwise we described findings narratively. We used the GRADE system to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 11 studies that together included 19,003 residents with dementia living in long‑term residential care facilities. Participants were on average 85 years old. All studies were conducted in institutions; none were set in the community. The interventions fell into three groups: four organisational programmes that introduced a least‑restraint policy (including staff education, “champion” training, and policy changes); six simple educational programmes that aimed to improve staff knowledge and attitudes; and one programme that gave staff information about residents’ fall risk. Control groups usually received usual care, and two studies also provided informational leaflets about restraint reduction.\n\nWhat are the main results for physical restraint use?\nOrganisational programmes probably lower overall restraint use a little and they greatly cut belt‑restraint use. Simple educational programmes show unclear effects on overall restraint use and probably make little or no difference to restraint intensity. Both types of programmes probably have little or no impact on falls, on the use of psychotropic medications (drugs that affect mood or behaviour), or on residents’ quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these findings. Many studies were small, used different types of participants and delivery methods, and participants often knew which programme they received, which could influence results. The risk of bias was high or unclear in most studies.\n\nWhat is the currency of the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes all evidence up to the August 2022 search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the required subheading format: the section heading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, while the style guide mandates all subheadings be questions. Additionally, the text contains several clarity problems that would confuse readers: (1) a long, noun‑heavy sentence in the first key message that mixes several ideas and uses jargon such as \"share of residents\" and \"least‑restraint\" without clear definition; (2) unexplained technical terms like \"restraint intensity\" and \"psychotropic medications\" that are not defined for a lay audience; (3) a sentence that exceeds 30 words and packs multiple clauses, making it hard to follow. These issues, combined with metric deviations (nouns 215 → beyond P90, smog index 14.6 → P90, complex words 145 → P90, complex words‑DC 289 → beyond P90, long words 209 → beyond P90) indicate the draft is more noun‑ and complex‑word heavy than typical PLS texts. The draft therefore does not meet the critical checks and needs revision.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall (high conformity) but deviates on five metrics: nouns (215, beyond P90), smog_index (14.6, P90), complex_words (145, P90), complex_words_dc (289, beyond P90) and long_words (209, beyond P90). These indicate excessive noun density and lexical complexity, suggesting the text could be simplified for better readability."
