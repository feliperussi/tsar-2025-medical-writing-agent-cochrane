  "draft": "Do organisational policies and staff training reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bed rails and belts) for older people in care homes?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Policies that set a “least‑restraint” rule and include staff training usually lower the proportion of residents who are restrained, especially belt restraints, and no serious harms were reported.  \n– Training that only provides education without changing policies shows unclear effects on restraint use because the evidence is inconsistent.  \n– More high‑quality, larger studies are needed to examine long‑term outcomes and any possible harms before we can be sure how best to reduce restraints in care homes.\n\nWhy are physical restraints used in long‑term care, and why is this a problem?\nMany older people in care homes are fitted with devices such as bed rails, belts around chairs or beds, or other equipment that limits movement. These devices are called physical restraints because they keep a person from moving freely. Staff often use them out of fear that a resident might fall, wander, or hurt themselves or others. Research shows that restraints do not improve safety and can cause injuries, loss of independence, and even death. For this reason, health organisations recommend avoiding physical restraints whenever possible.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether specific programmes can help care homes reduce or stop the use of physical restraints for older people. We looked at two types of programmes:  \n1. Organisational programmes that change policies, train staff, and promote a “least‑restraint” approach.  \n2. Simple educational programmes that aim to increase staff knowledge and change attitudes about restraints.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases for randomised or controlled trials that tested actions to prevent or reduce physical restraints in older people receiving long‑term care. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and judged the risk of bias. We focused on the proportion of residents with at least one restraint and on serious adverse events such as death or serious injury. When possible we combined results in meta‑analyses; otherwise we described findings narratively. We used the GRADE system to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 11 studies that together included 19,003 residents with dementia living in long‑term residential care facilities. The average age was about 85 years. All studies were done in institutions; none were set in the community. The interventions fell into three groups: four organisational programmes that introduced a least‑restraint policy (including staff education, “champion” training, and policy changes); six simple educational programmes that aimed to improve staff knowledge and attitudes; and one programme that gave staff information about residents’ fall risk. Control groups usually received usual care, and two studies also provided informational leaflets about restraint reduction.\n\nWhat were the main results for physical restraint use?\nOrganisational programmes probably reduce overall restraint use a little and greatly cut belt‑restraint use. Simple educational programmes show unclear effects on overall restraint use and probably make little or no difference to how intensely restraints are used. Both types of programmes probably have little or no impact on falls, on the use of psychotropic medications (drugs that affect mood or behaviour), or on residents’ quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these findings. Many studies were small, used different participants and delivery methods, and participants often knew which programme they received, which could influence results. The risk of bias was high or unclear in most studies.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes all evidence up to the August 2022 search.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required structural checks, but three major clarity problems would likely confuse readers: 1) The first key‑message bullet packs three ideas into one long sentence and uses passive voice – it should be split into two shorter, active sentences. 2) The sentence describing the impact on falls, psychotropic medications and quality of life is overly long and contains a parenthetical definition that interrupts flow – it should be streamlined. 3) The phrase “reduce overall restraint use a little” is vague; a more precise term such as “slightly” and a clearer contrast with “greatly cut belt‑restraint use” is needed. These issues are reflected in the metrics (nouns = 198 > median, complex_words = 134 > median, long_words = 194 > median), indicating noun‑heavy, complex wording that hampers readability. Rewriting the three sentences as suggested will bring the text in line with the Master Style Guide and improve patient‑facing clarity.",

These indicate higher noun density and word complexity than typical PLS texts, supporting the need to simplify and shorten sentences."
