  "draft": "Do organisational policies and staff training reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bed rails and belts) for older people in care homes?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Organisational policies (facility‑level rules) that aim to create a ‘least‑restraint’ approach (a set of rules and support to use as few restraints as possible) together with staff training tend to lower the proportion of residents who are restrained (devices such as bed rails or belts that limit movement), especially reducing the use of belts, and no serious harms (serious injuries or deaths) were reported in the studies.\n- Training programmes that only provide education to staff, without broader policy changes, showed unclear effects on restraint use, with the available evidence being inconsistent.\n- More high‑quality research is needed, especially studies that reduce bias, examine long‑term outcomes, and report any possible harms, to confirm these findings and to understand how best to implement restraint‑reduction strategies in care homes.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy are physical restraints used in long‑term care, and why is this a problem?\nMany older people living in care homes or receiving care at home are sometimes fitted with devices such as bed‑rails, belts around chairs or beds, or other devices that limit their movement. These are called physical restraints – tools that keep a person from moving freely. They are often used because staff worry that a resident might fall, wander, or hurt themselves or others. However, research shows that these restraints do not improve safety and can cause serious harm, including injuries, loss of independence, and even death. Because of this, health organisations recommend that physical restraints should be avoided whenever possible.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to discover whether specific programmes or actions can help care homes and community settings reduce or stop the use of physical restraints for older people. They looked at two main types of interventions: (1) organisational interventions, which involve changing policies, training staff, and promoting a “least‑restraint” approach, and (2) simple educational interventions, which aim to increase staff knowledge and change attitudes about restraints. The review evaluated how these strategies affect the number of residents who are restrained, the use of belts, and any related safety outcomes.\n\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies evaluating interventions to prevent or reduce physical restraints for older people in long‑term care, combined their findings, and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 11 studies that together included 19,003 older adults living in long‑term residential care facilities and diagnosed with dementia. The average age of participants was about 85 years. All studies were carried out in institutional care settings; no community‑based trials were found, and the abstract does not state the countries where the research was conducted. The interventions fell into three groups: four organisational programmes that aimed to implement a least‑restraint policy (including staff education, champion training, and changes to policy and culture), six simple educational programmes designed to improve staff knowledge and attitudes toward restraints, and one study that gave staff information about residents’ fall risk. Control groups generally received usual care, although two trials also provided informational materials about restraint reduction. Details such as trial duration, funding sources, gender distribution, and specific dementia severity were not reported.\n\nMain results: Use of physical restraints\nOrganisational interventions probably reduce the overall use of physical restraints slightly and probably lead to a large reduction in the use of belt restraints. Simple educational interventions have an unclear effect on the use of physical restraints and probably make little or no difference to restraint intensity. Both organisational and educational approaches probably make little or no difference to falls, the use of psychotropic medications, or residents’ quality of life.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions. Sections such as \"Methods\", \"Main results: Use of physical restraints\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are presented as statements rather than questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text contains several clarity and style issues that would confuse readers: (1) many passive‑voice sentences obscure who did what; (2) several long, noun‑heavy sentences make the information hard to follow; (3) technical terms like \"least‑restraint approach\" and \"psychotropic medications\" are not defined for a lay audience; (4) the draft uses a high number of complex and long words (e.g., 159 complex words, 231 long words) and nominalisations (24), which raise the reading grade level well above typical PLS ranges. These issues, together with the subheading problem, mean the PLS cannot be approved.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Change all section headings to questions. Example: replace \"Methods\" with \"What methods did we use?\" and \"Limitations\" with \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\".\n2. **Passive voice** – Rewrite passive sentences in active voice. Example: \"The average age of the participants was about 85 years.\" → \"Participants were on average 85 years old.\".\n3. **Simplify long, noun‑heavy sentences** – Break them into shorter sentences and use more verbs. Example: \"Organisational interventions probably reduce the overall use of physical restraints slightly and probably lead to a large reduction in the use of belt restraints.\" → \"Organisational interventions probably lower overall restraint use a little and they greatly cut belt use.\".\n4. **Explain jargon** – Add brief definitions for specialised terms. Example: after \"least‑restraint approach\" add \"(a policy that aims to use as few restraints as possible)\"; after \"psychotropic medications\" add \"(drugs that affect mood or behaviour)\".\n5. **Reduce complex/long words and nominalisations** – Replace words like \"implementation\" with \"putting into practice\", \"intervention\" with \"action\", and avoid noun‑forms such as \"assessment\" → \"we assessed\".\n\nMetrics support these suggestions: the draft shows 27 passive constructions (high), 24 nominalisations (beyond typical PLS), 159 complex words and 231 long words (both beyond typical ranges), and a SMOG index of 15.1 (higher than the usual 10‑15 range). Reducing these will lower the reading grade level and improve clarity for patients.",

However, several metrics deviate strongly from typical PLS patterns: nominalisations (24, beyond P90), nouns (230, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.1, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.21, beyond P90), complex words (159, beyond P90), complex words (DC) (316, beyond P90) and long words (231, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many long, complex words than usual PLS, supporting the need for simplification and more active phrasing."
