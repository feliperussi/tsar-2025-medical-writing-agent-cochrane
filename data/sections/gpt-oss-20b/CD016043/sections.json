  "key_messages": [
    "The review found several ways to provide eye‑care services (vision tests and glasses) in community settings and primary‑care clinics: in community settings the most common models were school‑based programmes (services delivered at schools), pharmacy‑based services (offered in drugstores), and outreach (mobile teams that travel to communities); in primary‑care clinics the main approaches were vision centres (dedicated spaces within health facilities for eye exams and glasses), health‑centre‑based vision services, and door‑to‑door delivery (services brought directly to people’s homes). No harmful effects of these delivery models were reported, but the evidence on their benefits is limited because few studies evaluated how well they work.",
    "The type of delivery model reported varied by region – school‑based and outreach models were most frequently described in the African region, outreach was dominant in the Americas, and very few models were reported from the Eastern Mediterranean region. Overall, there were notable gaps in the systematic evaluation of these approaches.",
    "Future work should focus on robust evaluation of the different delivery models, including their impact on access to eye‑care, quality of vision testing, and any unintended consequences, to provide clearer guidance for WHO member states and other stakeholders."

      "subheading": "Why is uncorrected refractive error a problem?",
      "content": "Many people have trouble seeing clearly because the shape of their eyes does not focus light properly – this is called a \"refractive error\" (think of it like a camera that is out of focus). When these errors are not corrected, they become a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. The good news is that most of these problems can be fixed easily with glasses or contact lenses. However, millions of people still do not have access to eye tests or affordable spectacles, especially in low‑resource communities. This lack of correction can limit a person’s ability to learn, work, and enjoy daily activities, and it contributes to the global target set by the World Health Assembly to increase the number of people who receive effective eye care by 40 percentage points by 2030."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to map out all the different ways that eye‑care services – from testing vision to providing glasses – are being delivered outside of hospitals, specifically in community settings (such as schools, pharmacies, or mobile outreach teams) and primary‑care settings (like health‑centre vision clinics or door‑to‑door visits). They also looked at how these delivery models have been evaluated, to see which approaches have been studied and where evidence is missing. In short, the review aimed to answer: which service‑delivery models exist for refractive and optical care in community and primary‑care environments, and how have researchers measured their success?"

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 402 records that met the inclusion criteria, including 175 primary observational or interventional studies, 146 organisational reports and 81 website records. The review does not give the total number of participants, nor details on study duration, age, gender or severity of refractive error. The records came from several WHO regions: school‑based and outreach delivery models were most common in the African region, outreach models predominated in the Americas, and very few reports came from the Eastern Mediterranean region. Funding sources for the individual studies were not reported. The interventions described a range of service‑delivery approaches – school‑based, pharmacy, outreach, vision‑centre, health‑centre and door‑to‑door programmes – but the abstract provides no details on how these were implemented or compared. Importantly, only a small number of the identified studies actually evaluated how well these delivery models work, so it remains unclear whether any of the described approaches improve vision outcomes."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people we were interested in.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to November 2022 of search."
