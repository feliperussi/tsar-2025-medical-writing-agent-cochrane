  "draft": "What are the different ways to deliver eye‑care services (vision tests and glasses) in community settings and primary‑care clinics?\n\n**Key messages**\n- The review found several ways to provide eye‑care services (vision tests and glasses) in community settings and primary‑care clinics: in community settings the most common models were school‑based programmes (services delivered at schools), pharmacy‑based services (offered in drugstores), and outreach (mobile teams that travel to communities); in primary‑care clinics the main approaches were vision centres (dedicated spaces within health facilities for eye exams and glasses), health‑centre‑based vision services, and door‑to‑door delivery (services brought directly to people’s homes). No harmful effects of these delivery models were reported, but the evidence on their benefits is limited because few studies evaluated how well they work.\n- The type of delivery model reported varied by region – school‑based and outreach models were most frequently described in the African region, outreach was dominant in the Americas, and very few models were reported from the Eastern Mediterranean region. Overall, there were notable gaps in the systematic evaluation of these approaches.\n- Future work should focus on robust evaluation of the different delivery models, including their impact on access to eye‑care, quality of vision testing, and any unintended consequences, to provide clearer guidance for WHO member states and other stakeholders.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is uncorrected refractive error a problem?\nMany people have trouble seeing clearly because the shape of their eyes does not focus light properly – this is called a \"refractive error\" (think of it like a camera that is out of focus). When these errors are not corrected, they become a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. The good news is that most of these problems can be fixed easily with glasses or contact lenses. However, millions of people still do not have access to eye tests or affordable spectacles, especially in low‑resource communities. This lack of correction can limit a person’s ability to learn, work, and enjoy daily activities, and it contributes to the global target set by the World Health Assembly to increase the number of people who receive effective eye care by 40 percentage points by 2030.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to map out all the different ways that eye‑care services – from testing vision to providing glasses – are being delivered outside of hospitals, specifically in community settings (such as schools, pharmacies, or mobile outreach teams) and primary‑care settings (like health‑centre vision clinics or door‑to‑door visits). They also looked at how these delivery models have been evaluated, to see which approaches have been studied and where evidence is missing. In short, the review aimed to answer: which service‑delivery models exist for refractive and optical care in community and primary‑care environments, and how have researchers measured their success?\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched databases, grey literature and organisational reports for evidence on community and primary‑care delivery of refractive and optical services, extracted and combined the findings into tables, figures and case studies, and appraised the confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWe identified 402 records that met the inclusion criteria, including 175 primary observational or interventional studies, 146 organisational reports and 81 website records. The review does not give the total number of participants, nor details on study duration, age, gender or severity of refractive error. The records came from several WHO regions: school‑based and outreach delivery models were most common in the African region, outreach models predominated in the Americas, and very few reports came from the Eastern Mediterranean region. Funding sources for the individual studies were not reported. The interventions described a range of service‑delivery approaches – school‑based, pharmacy, outreach, vision‑centre, health‑centre and door‑to‑door programmes – but the abstract provides no details on how these were implemented or compared. Importantly, only a small number of the identified studies actually evaluated how well these delivery models work, so it remains unclear whether any of the described approaches improve vision outcomes.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people we were interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions. Current subheadings (e.g., \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\") are statements, which does not meet the Master Style Guide requirement. Additionally, the draft contains excessive passive voice (31 instances, well beyond the typical PLS range) and a very high noun count (226, also beyond typical). These issues reduce readability for patients. Recommended improvements: 1. Rewrite subheadings as questions (e.g., \"Why is uncorrected refractive error a problem?\", \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"). 2. Convert passive sentences to active voice, e.g., change \"The review does not give the total number of participants\" to \"We do not have the total number of participants.\" 3. Reduce noun‑heavy phrasing by using more verbs, e.g., replace \"The interventions described a range of service‑delivery approaches\" with \"We described several service‑delivery approaches.\" These changes will bring the draft into better alignment with the style guide and improve the readability metrics (active_voice, passive_voice, nouns).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit (716 words) and has average sentence length (24.7 words). However, several metrics deviate strongly: passive_voice (31, BEYOND_P90), nouns (226, BEYOND_P90), smog_index (15.2, BEYOND_P90), dale_chall_readability (8.37, P90), complex_words_dc (324, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (159, BEYOND_P90), and long_words (230, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than typical PLS, supporting the need to reduce passive constructions and simplify vocabulary."
