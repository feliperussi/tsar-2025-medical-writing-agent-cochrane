  "draft": "What are the different ways to deliver eye‑care services (vision tests and glasses) in community settings and primary‑care clinics?\n\nKey messages\n- We identified several models for delivering eye‑care outside hospitals. In community settings the most common were school‑based programmes, pharmacy‑based services, and mobile outreach teams. In primary‑care clinics the main models were dedicated vision centres, health‑centre vision services, and door‑to‑door visits.\n- No harmful effects were reported, but only a few studies measured how well these models work. Evidence is especially limited in the Eastern Mediterranean region.\n- Future research should evaluate each model’s impact on access, quality of vision testing, and any unintended consequences to guide WHO member states and other stakeholders.\n\nWhy is uncorrected refractive error a problem?\nMany people cannot see clearly because the shape of their eyes does not focus light properly – a condition called refractive error (like a camera that is out of focus). When the error is not corrected, it becomes a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. Glasses or contact lenses can fix most cases, yet millions lack eye tests or affordable spectacles, especially in low‑resource communities. This limits learning, work, and daily activities and hinders the World Health Assembly target to increase effective coverage of refractive error by 40 percentage points by 2030.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to map all the ways eye‑care services – from vision testing to providing glasses – are delivered outside hospitals. Specifically we looked at community settings (schools, pharmacies, mobile outreach) and primary‑care settings (health‑centre vision clinics, door‑to‑door visits). We also examined how researchers have evaluated these delivery models and where evidence gaps exist.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched four major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health), grey literature, and reports from organisations involved in eye‑care. We included studies, reports, and website records published between Jan 2002 and Nov 2022 that described refractive or optical services for children or adults in community or primary‑care settings. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full texts, extracted data, and resolved disagreements through discussion.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe screened 402 records that met our criteria: 175 primary studies, 146 organisational reports, and 81 website records. The most common community models were school‑based programmes, pharmacy‑based services, and outreach teams that travel to villages. In primary‑care clinics, the main approaches were dedicated vision centres, health‑centre vision services, and door‑to‑door delivery. Regional patterns emerged – school‑based and outreach models were frequent in the African region, outreach dominated in the Americas, and very few models were reported from the Eastern Mediterranean region. Only a small number of studies actually evaluated the effectiveness of these models, so we cannot say which improve vision outcomes. No harmful effects were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because few studies measured outcomes and the data do not cover all populations of interest. Details such as total participant numbers, ages, genders, or severity of refractive error were often missing.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence reflects searches completed up to November 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, title format, factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but three significant clarity problems remain that could confuse readers. 1) Passive constructions obscure who did what (e.g., “No harmful effects were reported”). 2) Technical terms are not explained for a lay audience (e.g., “effective coverage”, “refractive error”, “door‑to‑door visits”). 3) A long, dense sentence packs multiple ideas together, making it hard to follow (e.g., “This limits learning, work, and daily activities and hinders the World Health Assembly target to increase effective coverage of refractive error by 40 percentage points by 2030.”). These issues, combined with the metric profile (22 passive voice instances, 174 nouns, 257 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words, 117 complex words, 181 long words), indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and passive than typical PLSs, reducing readability. Suggested rewrites are provided below to bring the summary into clearer, active, patient‑friendly language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is 530 words (within the 850‑word limit) and shows good overall readability scores (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 49, FKGL 10.5). However, six metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: passive_voice (22, beyond typical range), nouns (174), dale_chall_readability (8.48), complex_words_dc (257), complex_words (117) and long_words (181). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun density, and complex vocabulary, supporting the need to simplify language, increase active voice, and reduce jargon."
