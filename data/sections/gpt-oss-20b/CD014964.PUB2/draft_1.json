  "draft": "Is using ultrasound (sound imaging) better than feeling for landmarks to give spinal or epidural anaesthesia (numbing the back) in adults?\n\n- Using ultrasound guidance (using sound waves to see the spine) instead of feeling for landmarks reduces the number of needle attempts needed and shortens the time taken for the procedure, and it probably increases the chance of getting the needle in the right place on the first try (first‑attempt success); no increase in harmful side effects (adverse events) was reported, and the evidence supporting these benefits is strong.\n- The evidence is strong for the procedural benefits, but it is uncertain for how ultrasound affects patient satisfaction, the chance that the procedure fails to work (technical failure), pain during the procedure, and other possible unwanted effects, because the available studies were limited or of lower quality for these outcomes.\n- Future research should include well‑designed studies that focus on pain, patient satisfaction, rare adverse events, and longer‑term outcomes to provide clearer information for patients and clinicians.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy can giving spinal or epidural anaesthesia be difficult and why does it matter?\nNeuraxial anaesthesia – the injection of medicine into the space around the spinal cord – is a common way to numb the lower part of the body for surgeries or during childbirth. Doctors usually find the right spot by feeling the patient’s back (using \"anatomical landmarks\"). However, the spot they feel may not match the actual location inside the spine, leading to several needle insertions. Each extra attempt can increase the risk of complications such as bleeding or infection, cause more discomfort, and lower the patient’s satisfaction with the procedure. Finding a way to place the needle more accurately on the first try could make the experience safer and more pleasant.\nWhat did the review set out to discover about using ultrasound for neuraxial anaesthesia?\nThe authors wanted to compare two approaches: using an ultrasound machine to visualise the spine before or during the injection versus the traditional method of feeling the back’s landmarks. They examined whether ultrasound guidance reduces the number of needle attempts, shortens the time needed for the procedure, and improves how patients feel about the experience. They also looked at other outcomes such as success on the first try, technical failures, pain during the procedure, and any adverse events, to determine if ultrasound is both effective and safe.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared ultrasound guidance with anatomical‑landmark techniques for neuraxial anaesthesia in adults, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 65 randomised controlled trials that together involved 6,823 adults (aged 18 years and older). The studies were carried out in many parts of the world – Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and Oceania – and were published between 2001 and 2023. About half of the trials (32 studies, 3,149 participants) focused on obstetric patients undergoing labour epidural or caesarean‑section anaesthesia, while the rest involved non‑obstetric surgical patients receiving neuraxial anaesthesia. All trials compared the use of ultrasound guidance (including pre‑procedural scans, real‑time imaging, or a combination of both) with the traditional method of locating anatomical landmarks to place the neuraxial block. None of the studies reported a specific source of funding.\n\nThe review found that using ultrasound guidance makes the procedure easier in several ways. It probably increases the chance that the block is successful on the first attempt, reduces the number of attempts needed to achieve a successful block, and shortens the overall time taken to perform the neuraxial procedure. The evidence suggests that patients’ satisfaction with the procedure and the likelihood of technical failure are probably not changed much by ultrasound guidance, and it is still unclear whether ultrasound affects the amount of pain felt during the procedure or the risk of any adverse events.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are confident that ultrasound guidance reduces the number of attempts needed and shortens the procedure time. Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about the evidence. We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small. We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical checks: (1) Subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"), violating the Master Style Guide. (2) The required \"Key messages\" heading is missing; the bullet list is not labelled. (3) Several clarity issues would confuse readers: long, noun‑heavy sentences, excessive nominalisation, and passive constructions. Suggested top improvements: \n1. Rewrite subheadings as questions (e.g., \"Why can giving spinal or epidural anaesthesia be difficult and why does it matter?\", \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"). \n2. Add a clear \"Key messages\" heading before the bullet points. \n3. Shorten and simplify long sentences, e.g., replace \"The review found that using ultrasound guidance makes the procedure easier in several ways. It probably increases the chance that the block is successful on the first attempt, reduces the number of attempts needed to achieve a successful block, and shortens the overall time taken to perform the neuraxial procedure.\" with \"We found that ultrasound guidance probably increases first‑attempt success, reduces the number of attempts, and shortens the procedure time.\". \n4. Convert passive phrasing to active voice, e.g., change \"The evidence is strong for the procedural benefits\" to \"We have strong evidence for the procedural benefits\". \n5. Reduce noun‑heavy and nominalised language (e.g., replace \"confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about the evidence\" with \"We are moderately confident because of concerns about the studies\").\nThese changes address the most impactful readability problems and bring the draft into alignment with the style guide. Metrics support the need for revision: words_per_sentence is 24.8 (P90), nominalizations 34 and nouns 207 (both BEYOND_P90), SMOG 15.2 (BEYOND_P90), and complex‑word counts are all far above typical PLS ranges, indicating the draft is overly dense and noun‑heavy.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate overall conformity but highlights six key deviations: words per sentence (24.8, P90), nominalizations (34, BEYOND_P90), noun count (207, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15.2, BEYOND_P90), complex words (154, BEYOND_P90) and long words (248, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the draft is longer, more noun‑heavy, and uses more complex vocabulary than typical Cochrane plain language summaries, supporting the recommended edits."
