  "draft": "Is using ultrasound (sound imaging) better than feeling for landmarks to give spinal or epidural anaesthesia (numbing the back) in adults?\n\nKey messages\n– Using ultrasound guidance\n– The evidence for these procedural benefits is strong, but we are uncertain whether ultrasound changes patient satisfaction, technical failure (when the block does not work and the procedure has to be repeated), pain during the procedure, or rare adverse events because the studies on these outcomes were few or of lower quality.\n– Future research should focus on pain, patient satisfaction, rare adverse events and longer‑term outcomes to give clearer guidance for patients and clinicians.\n\nWhy can giving spinal or epidural anaesthesia be difficult and why does it matter?  \nNeuraxial anaesthesia – the injection of medicine into the space around the spinal cord – is a common way to numb the lower part of the body for surgery or childbirth. Doctors usually locate the injection site by feeling the patient’s back (using “anatomical landmarks”). The felt landmarks may not match the actual position inside the spine, leading to several needle insertions. Each extra attempt can raise the risk of bleeding, infection, discomfort and lower patient satisfaction.\n\nWhat did the review set out to discover about using ultrasound for neuraxial anaesthesia?  \nWe compared two approaches: using an ultrasound machine to visualise the spine before or during the injection versus the traditional method of feeling the back’s (using “anatomical landmarks”). We examined whether ultrasound guidance reduces the number of needle attempts, shortens the procedure time, improves patient satisfaction, and affects first‑attempt success, technical failure, pain during the procedure and any adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, two trial registries and reference lists for randomised controlled trials that compared ultrasound guidance with landmark techniques in adults (≥ 18 years). We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach. The search was updated to November 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 65 trials involving 6 823 adults from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and Oceania, published between 2001 and 2023. About half of the participants (3 149) were obstetric patients receiving labour epidural or caesarean‑section anaesthesia; the rest were non‑obstetric surgical patients.  \n\nThe analysis shows that ultrasound guidance probably increases first‑attempt success, reduces the number of attempts needed and shortens overall procedure time. The evidence for these procedural benefits is strong. Patient satisfaction and technical failure appear to be little changed by ultrasound, but the certainty of these findings is low. We remain very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound on pain during the procedure and on rare adverse events because the data are sparse and of very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small and participants and clinicians knew which technique was used, which could bias the results. Outcomes with low certainty rely on few studies of limited quality, so we have limited confidence in those findings.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence includes all relevant studies identified up to November 2023.",

The first bullet point only says “Using ultrasound guidance” and does not convey the essential findings required by the source (reduction in needle attempts, shorter procedure time, higher first‑attempt success, no increase in adverse events, and strong evidence). This omission means the summary does not fully reflect the review’s conclusions and breaches the requirement for completeness and factual accuracy.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Incomplete key‑message bullet**\n   - Quote: “– Using ultrasound guidance”\n   - Problem: Provides no information; readers get no insight into the main benefits or safety profile.\n   - Rewrite: “– Using ultrasound guidance (sound waves to see the spine) reduces the number of needle attempts, shortens procedure time, probably increases first‑attempt success, and does not increase harmful side effects; the evidence for these procedural benefits is strong.”\n2. **Overly long second key‑message bullet**\n   - Quote: “– The evidence for these procedural benefits is strong, but we are uncertain whether ultrasound changes patient satisfaction, technical failure (when the block does not work and the procedure has to be repeated), pain during the procedure, or rare adverse events because the studies on these outcomes were few or of lower quality.”\n   - Problem: Combines several ideas in one long sentence, making it hard to read; uses passive‑style phrasing.\n   - Rewrite: “– The evidence for the procedural benefits is strong, but we are uncertain about effects on patient satisfaction, technical failure, pain during the procedure, and rare adverse events because few low‑quality studies examined these outcomes.”\n3. **Reduce nominalisations and complex words**\n   - Quote: “The analysis shows that ultrasound guidance probably increases first‑attempt success, reduces the number of attempts needed and shortens overall procedure time.”\n   - Problem: Uses nominalised phrases like “the analysis shows” and several long words, contributing to high nominalisation (26) and complex‑word counts.\n   - Rewrite: “We found that ultrasound guidance probably increases first‑attempt success, reduces the number of attempts, and shortens the procedure time.”\n4. **Clarify the “How up‑to‑date is this review?” heading**\n   - Quote: “How up‑to‑date is this review?”\n   - Problem: The answer paragraph repeats the search date but does not explicitly state the cut‑off; could be clearer for patients.\n   - Rewrite: “The evidence includes all relevant studies identified up to November 2023, the date of our last search.”\n5. **Add a brief concluding sentence** to summarise overall take‑away for patients.\n   - Quote: (no existing sentence)\n   - Problem: Readers finish without a clear, patient‑focused summary of what the findings mean for them.\n   - Suggested addition: “Overall, using ultrasound can make spinal or epidural anaesthesia quicker and require fewer needle sticks, with no clear increase in side‑effects, but more research is needed on pain and rare complications.”\n\nMetrics support: The draft shows a high nominalisation count (26, beyond typical PLS median) and elevated complex‑word counts (complex_words 116, complex_words_dc 240, long_words 179) indicating the need to simplify language and use more verbs, as reflected in the suggested rewrites.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (median‑range scores for most metrics). However, five features deviate: nominalisation (26, above typical PLS median), SMOG index (13.7, above median), and high counts of complex and long words. These suggest the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many polysyllabic words than typical PLS, supporting the recommendation to reduce nominalisations and simplify vocabulary."
