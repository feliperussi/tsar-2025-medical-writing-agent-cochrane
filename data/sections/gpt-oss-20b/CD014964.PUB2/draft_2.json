  "draft": "\"Is using ultrasound (sound imaging) better than feeling for landmarks to give spinal or epidural anaesthesia (numbing the back) in adults?\"\n\nKey messages\n– Using ultrasound guidance reduces the number of needle attempts and shortens the time needed for the procedure; we have strong evidence that it probably increases first‑attempt success and does not raise the risk of harmful side effects.  \n– The evidence for procedural benefits is strong, but we are uncertain whether ultrasound changes patient satisfaction, technical failure, pain during the procedure, or rare adverse events because the studies on these outcomes were few or of lower quality.  \n– Future research should focus on pain, patient satisfaction, rare adverse events and longer‑term outcomes to give clearer guidance for patients and clinicians.\n\nWhy can giving spinal or epidural anaesthesia be difficult and why does it matter?  \nNeur: Neuraxial anaesthesia (injection of medicine into the space around the spinal cord) is commonly used to numb the lower body for surgery or childbirth. Clinicians usually locate the injection site by feeling the patient’s back – the “anatomical landmarks”. Those felt landmarks may not match the actual position of the spinal space, leading to multiple needle insertions. Each extra attempt can increase the risk of bleeding, infection, discomfort and lower patient satisfaction.\n\nWhat did the review set out to discover about using ultrasound for neuraxial anaesthesia?  \nWe compared two approaches: using an ultrasound machine to visualise the spine before or during the injection versus the traditional landmark technique. We examined whether ultrasound guidance reduces needle attempts, shortens procedure time, improves patient satisfaction, and affects first‑attempt success, technical failure, pain during the procedure and any adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, two trial registries and reference lists for randomised controlled trials that compared ultrasound guidance with landmark techniques in adults (≥ 18 years). We combined the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach. The search was updated to November 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 65 trials involving 6 823 adults from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and Oceania, published between 2001 and 2023. About half of the participants (3 149) were obstetric patients receiving labour epidural or caesarean‑section anaesthesia; the rest were non‑obstetric surgical patients.  \n\nWe found that ultrasound guidance probably increases first‑attempt success, reduces the number of attempts needed, and shortens the overall procedure time. The evidence for these procedural benefits is strong. Patient satisfaction and technical failure appear to be little‑changed by ultrasound, but the certainty is low. We remain very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound on pain during the procedure and on rare adverse events because the data are sparse and of very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident about the procedural benefits, but concerns remain. Many trials were small and participants and clinicians were aware of the technique used, which could bias results. The low‑certainty outcomes rely on few studies of limited quality.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence includes all relevant studies identified up to November 2023.",

Key‑message sentence: \"Using ultrasound guidance reduces the number of needle attempts and shortens the time needed for the procedure; we have strong evidence that it probably increases first‑attempt success and does not raise the risk of harmful side effects.\" – the phrase “strong evidence that it probably” is contradictory and may mislead readers.\n3. The same bullet mixes several ideas with a semicolon, making it hard to follow. It should be split into two short sentences.\n4. The term “technical failure” appears in the results and key messages without any definition; patients may not understand what it means.\n5. A few passive constructions (e.g., \"The evidence for these procedural benefits is strong\") reduce immediacy; active voice would be clearer.\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Remove the stray label and introduce the term: \"Neuraxial anaesthesia – the injection of medicine into the space around the spinal cord – is commonly used to numb the lower body for surgery or childbirth.\"\n- Rewrite the key‑message: \"Using ultrasound guidance reduces the number of needle attempts, shortens the time needed for the procedure, and probably increases the chance of success on the first try. We have strong evidence that it does not increase the risk of harmful side effects.\"\n- Split the bullet: \"Using ultrasound guidance reduces the number of needle attempts and shortens the procedure time. We have strong evidence that it probably increases first‑attempt success and does not raise the risk of harmful side effects.\"\n- Define technical failure: \"Technical failure (when the block does not work and the procedure has to be repeated) appears to be little changed by ultrasound.\"\n- Change passive to active: \"The evidence shows strong procedural benefits.\"\nThese changes will make the summary easier for patients to understand.\n\nPLS evaluation shows the draft is within word limit and has good sentence length (19.2 words per sentence, P25). Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading Ease 47, P50). However, several language‑complexity metrics are outside typical ranges (high nominalisation, SMOG, Dale‑Chall, complex‑word counts), reflecting the issues noted above and supporting the need to simplify wording and reduce noun‑heavy constructions.",
