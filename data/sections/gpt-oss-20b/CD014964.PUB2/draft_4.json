  "draft": "Is using ultrasound (sound imaging) better than feeling for landmarks to give spinal or epidural anaesthesia (numbing the back) in adults?\n\nKey messages\n– Using ultrasound guidance (sound waves to see the spine) reduces the number of needle attempts, shortens the time needed for the procedure, probably increases first‑attempt success, and does not increase harmful side effects; the evidence for these procedural benefits is strong.  \n– The evidence for the procedural benefits is strong, but we are uncertain about effects on patient satisfaction, technical failure, pain during the procedure, and rare adverse events because few low‑quality studies examined these outcomes.  \n– Future research should focus on pain, patient satisfaction, rare adverse events and longer‑term outcomes to give clearer guidance for patients and clinicians.\n\nWhy can giving spinal or epidural anaesthesia be difficult and why does it matter?  \nNeuraxial anaesthesia (the injection of medicine into the space around the spinal cord) is a common way to numb the lower body for surgery or childbirth. Doctors usually locate the injection site by feeling the patient’s back (using “anatomical landmarks”). The felt landmarks may not match the actual position inside the spine, leading to several needle insertions. Each extra attempt can raise the risk of bleeding, infection, discomfort and lower patient satisfaction.\n\nWhat did the review set out to discover about using ultrasound for neuraxial anaesthesia?  \nWe compared two approaches: using an ultrasound machine to visualise the spine before or during the injection versus the traditional method of feeling the back’s landmarks. We examined whether ultrasound guidance reduces the number of needle attempts, shortens the procedure time, improves patient satisfaction, and affects first‑attempt success, technical failure, pain during the procedure and any adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, two trial registries and reference lists for randomised controlled trials that compared ultrasound guidance with landmark techniques in adults (≥ 18 years). We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach. The search was updated to November 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 65 trials involving 6 823 adults from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and Oceania, published between 2001 and 2023. About half of the participants (3 149) were obstetric patients receiving labour epidural or caesarean‑section anaesthesia; the rest were non‑obstetric surgical patients.  \n\nWe found that ultrasound guidance probably increases first‑attempt success, reduces the number of attempts, and shortens the procedure time. The evidence for these procedural benefits is strong. Patient satisfaction and technical failure appear to be little changed by ultrasound, but the certainty of these findings is low. We remain very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound on pain during the procedure and on rare adverse events because the data are sparse and of very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small and participants and clinicians knew which technique was used, which could bias the results. Outcomes with low certainty rely on few studies of limited quality, so we have limited confidence in those findings.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence includes all relevant studies identified up to November 2023, the date of our last search.\n\nOverall, using ultrasound can make spinal or epidural anaesthesia quicker and require fewer needle sticks, with no clear increase in side‑effects. More research is needed on pain, patient satisfaction and rare complications to strengthen the guidance for patients and clinicians.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural and factual checks, but several clarity problems would likely confuse patients:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – the term “technical failure” appears in the key messages and results without any definition, leaving readers unsure what it means. Suggested rewrite: replace with a brief explanation, e.g., “technical failure (when the block does not work and has to be redone)”.\n2. **Over‑loaded key‑message bullet** – the first bullet packs four separate ideas (fewer needle attempts, shorter time, higher first‑attempt success, no increase in side‑effects) into one long sentence, making it hard to digest. Suggested rewrite: split into two bullets, e.g.,\n   - “Using ultrasound reduces the number of needle attempts, shortens the procedure time, and probably increases the chance of success on the first try.”\n   - “It does not appear to increase harmful side‑effects, and the evidence for these benefits is strong.”\n3. **Noun‑heavy, nominalised sentences** – many sentences rely on nouns rather than verbs, which reduces readability (e.g., “The evidence for these procedural benefits is strong.”). Suggested rewrite to active voice: “We have strong evidence that ultrasound improves the procedure.”\n4. **“Adverse events” not clarified** – the phrase is used in the key messages and results without explaining that it means any unwanted side‑effects. Suggested rewrite: “adverse events (any unwanted side‑effects such as bleeding or infection)”.\n5. **Long, dense sentence in the methods** – “We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, two trial registries and reference lists for randomised controlled trials that compared ultrasound guidance with landmark techniques in adults (≥ 18 years).” can be broken for clarity. Suggested rewrite: “We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, two trial registries, and reference lists. We looked for randomised controlled trials that compared ultrasound guidance with landmark techniques in adults (≥ 18 years).”\nThese issues are supported by the metric analysis, which shows a high nominalisation count (29, beyond the 90th percentile) and elevated noun count (175, also beyond the 90th percentile). Reducing noun‑heavy constructions and clarifying jargon will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on overall readability (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 48.6, Grade 11.4) and stays within word limits, but deviates on several lexical metrics: nominalisations (29, BEYOND_P90), nouns (175, P90), SMOG (14.1, P90), Dale‑Chall (8.2, P90), complex words (127, P90) and long words (200, P90). These indicate excessive noun‑heavy language and complex vocabulary, supporting the need to simplify and use more active verbs."
