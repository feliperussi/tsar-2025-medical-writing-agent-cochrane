  "draft": "Is using ultrasound (sound imaging) better than feeling for landmarks to give spinal or epidural anaesthesia (numbing the back) in adults?\n\nKey messages\n– Using ultrasound reduces the number of needle attempts, shortens the procedure time, and probably increases the chance of success on the first try.  \n– It does not appear to increase harmful side‑effects (adverse events – any unwanted side‑effects such as bleeding or infection), and the evidence for these benefits is strong.  \n– Evidence is low for effects on patient satisfaction, technical failure (when the block does not work and has to be redone), pain during the procedure, and rare adverse events, so more research is needed.\n\nWhy can giving spinal or epidural anaesthesia be difficult and why does it matter?  \nNeuraxial anaesthesia – the injection of medicine into the space around the spinal cord – is a common way to numb the lower body for surgery or childbirth. Doctors usually locate the injection site by feeling the patient’s back (using “anatomical landmarks”). The felt landmarks may not match the actual position inside the spine, leading to several needle insertions. Each extra attempt can raise the risk of bleeding, infection, discomfort, and lower patient satisfaction.\n\nWhat did the review set out to discover about using ultrasound for neuraxial anaesthesia?  \nWe compared two approaches: (1) using an ultrasound machine to visualise the spine before or during the injection, and (2) the traditional method of feeling the back’s landmarks. We examined whether ultrasound guidance reduces needle attempts, shortens the time needed for the procedure, improves patient satisfaction, and affects first‑attempt success, technical failure, pain during the procedure, and any adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, two trial registries, and reference lists. We looked for randomised controlled trials that compared ultrasound guidance with landmark techniques in adults (≥ 18 years). We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach. The search was updated to November 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 65 trials involving 6 823 adults from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and Oceania, published between 2001 and 2023. About half of the participants (3 149) were obstetric patients receiving labour epidural or caesarean‑section anaesthesia; the rest were non‑obstetric surgical patients.  \n\nThe evidence shows that ultrasound guidance probably increases first‑attempt success, reduces the number of attempts, and shortens the overall procedure time. The certainty of these procedural benefits is high. Patient satisfaction and technical failure appear to change little with ultrasound, but the certainty of these findings is low. We remain very uncertain about the effect of ultrasound on pain during the procedure and on rare adverse events because few low‑quality studies examined these outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small and participants and clinicians knew which technique was used, which could bias the results. Outcomes with low certainty rely on few studies of limited quality, so we have limited confidence in those findings.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence includes all relevant studies identified up to November 2023, the date of our last and our last search.  \n\nOverall, using ultrasound can make spinal or epidural anaesthesia quicker and require fewer needle sticks, without a clear increase in side‑effects. More research is needed on pain, patient satisfaction and rare complications to strengthen guidance for patients and clinicians.",

Problematic sentence: \"The evidence includes all relevant studies identified up to November 2023, the date of our last and our last search.\"\n   - Why problematic: The repeated phrase \"our last and our last\" is a typographical error that can distract or confuse readers.\n   - Suggested rewrite: \"The evidence includes all relevant studies identified up to November 2023, the date of our most recent search.\"\n3. Problematic sub‑heading: \"Key messages\"\n   - Why problematic: Subheadings should be phrased as questions to follow the style guide, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\" This helps readers anticipate the content and maintains consistency.\n   - Suggested rewrite: Change the heading to \"What are the key messages?\"\nThese issues, together with the high number of nominalisations (27) and complex words (122) indicated by the PLS evaluation, suggest the draft needs revision before it can be approved.\n\nMetrics support: The evaluation shows a high nominalisation count (27, beyond typical PLS range) and elevated complex‑word counts, which align with the observed noun‑heavy sentences and the need to simplify language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 51.7, FKGL 10.7) are within the best quartile. However, six metrics deviate markedly: nominalisation (27, P90), nouns (165, P90), SMOG (13.9, P90), complex words (122, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (259, P90) and long words (190, P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many complex words than typical PLS, supporting the need to reduce nominalisations and simplify vocabulary."
