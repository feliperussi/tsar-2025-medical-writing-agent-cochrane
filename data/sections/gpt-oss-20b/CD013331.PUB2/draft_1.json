  "draft": "Does transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS – a mild electric pad treatment) lower period pain in women compared with no treatment or other pain‑relief methods?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (a mild electric pad treatment) may reduce period pain (primary dysmenorrhoea, PD) compared with no treatment or an inactive placebo, and both high‑frequency TENS (delivers rapid electrical pulses) and low‑frequency TENS (delivers slower pulses) showed some benefit; the studies did not report any unwanted side effects, so it is unclear whether harms occur.\n- It is uncertain whether TENS is more effective than other pain‑relief methods such as medication, acupressure (pressing specific points on the body), or other electrical therapies, because the available research was limited and the results were inconclusive.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that compare TENS with standard treatments, monitor possible side effects, and evaluate outcomes important to patients such as the need for additional pain medication, impact on daily activities, and overall quality of life.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea, often called period pain or menstrual cramps, is pain that many women experience during their monthly periods. It can be strong enough to interfere with daily activities, school, work, and overall quality of life. Because the pain comes from the uterus itself (not from another medical condition), it is called \"primary\" dysmenorrhoea. Managing this pain is important so that women can go about their lives without unnecessary suffering.\n\nWhat is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and how might it help?\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS, is a non‑drug treatment that uses a small device to send gentle electrical currents through electrodes placed on the skin over the painful area. The currents can be delivered at a high frequency (many pulses per second) or a low frequency (fewer pulses per second). TENS is thought to work by blocking pain signals, encouraging the body to release its own natural pain‑relieving chemicals (called endogenous opioids), and improving blood flow to the uterus. Because it does not involve medication, TENS could be an alternative or addition to common painkillers for period cramps.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to know whether TENS actually reduces period pain and whether it is safe to use. Specifically, they compared high‑frequency TENS and low‑frequency TENS with placebo or no treatment, and with other common treatments such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) or non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Their goal was to assess both the effectiveness (how well it eases pain) and the safety (any side‑effects) of TENS for women with primary dysmenorrhoea.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared high‑ or low‑frequency TENS with placebo, no treatment or other therapies in women with primary dysmenorrhoea, combined the results from the identified randomized controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to groups), and assessed the certainty of the evidence using standard criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWe looked at 20 randomised controlled trials that together included 585 women aged 12 to 49 years who had primary dysmenorrhoea. The trials compared high‑frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and low‑frequency TENS with placebo or no treatment, with each other, and with other interventions such as acupressure, acetaminophen (paracetamol), non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and interferential current therapy. The abstract did not provide information about how long each study lasted, where the studies were conducted, or who funded them. The review found that both high‑frequency TENS and low‑frequency TENS may reduce menstrual pain compared with placebo or no treatment. It is unclear whether high‑frequency TENS works better than low‑frequency TENS, or whether either type of TENS is more effective than other treatments such as acupressure, acetaminophen or interferential current therapy. No clear evidence of harmful side‑effects from TENS was identified.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical style requirement: all subheadings must be phrased as questions, but sections such as \"Key messages\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are not questions. This breaches the Master Style Guide and therefore the PLS cannot be approved. In addition, several clarity issues would confuse readers:\n1. Long, jargon‑heavy bullet – \"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (a mild electric pad treatment) may reduce period pain (primary dysmenorrhoea, PD) compared with no treatment or an inactive placebo, and both high‑frequency TENS (delivers rapid electrical pulses) and low‑frequency TENS (delivers slower pulses) showed some benefit; the studies did not report any unwanted side effects, so it is unclear whether harms occur.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words, mixes several ideas, and uses technical terms without simple explanation.\n   *Rewrite:* \"TENS (a mild electric pad) may lower period pain compared with no treatment or a placebo. Both high‑frequency (fast pulses) and low‑frequency (slow pulses) TENS showed some benefit, and the studies did not report side‑effects, so we do not know if harms occur.\"\n2. Passive‑voice heavy paragraph – \"The abstract did not provide information about how long each study lasted, where the studies were conducted, or who funded them.\" Passive constructions make it harder for readers to see who did what.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We could not find information in the abstract about study duration, locations, or funding.\"\n3. Noun‑heavy wording in Results – \"The review found that both high‑frequency TENS and low‑frequency TENS may reduce menstrual pain compared with placebo or no treatment. It is unclear whether high‑frequency TENS works better than low‑frequency TENS, or whether either type of TENS is more effective than other treatments such as acupressure, acetaminophen or interferential current therapy.\"\n   *Rewrite:* \"We found that both high‑ and low‑frequency TENS may lower menstrual pain compared with placebo or no treatment. We are unsure whether one type works better than the other, or whether TENS is more effective than treatments like acupressure, acetaminophen, or interferential therapy.\"\n4. Missing question‑style subheadings – The sections should be renamed to follow the guide, e.g.,\n   * \"Key messages\" → \"What are the main findings?\"\n   * \"Methods\" → \"How did we find and analyse the studies?\"\n   * \"Results\" → \"What did we find?\"\n   * \"Limitations\" → \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n   * \"Currency\" → \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"\nThese changes will improve readability, reduce passive voice (currently 19 passive constructions, well above the typical P90 range), lower nominalisation (29 instances, beyond P90), and bring complex‑word counts (170 complex words, 305 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words) closer to typical PLS levels. By addressing the subheading format and the highlighted clarity issues, the PLS can meet the required standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but shows several deviations from typical PLS patterns: passive voice (19 instances, P90), nominalisations (29, beyond P90), nouns (189, P90), SMOG index (15, beyond P90), and high counts of complex/Dale‑Chall words and long words (all beyond P90). These metrics confirm the need to simplify language, reduce passive constructions, and lower noun density."
