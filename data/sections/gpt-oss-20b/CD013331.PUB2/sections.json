  "plain_title": "Does transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS – a mild electric pad treatment) lower period pain in women compared with no treatment or other pain‑relief methods?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (a mild electric pad treatment) may reduce period pain (primary dysmenorrhoea, PD) compared with no treatment or an inactive placebo, and both high‑frequency TENS (delivers rapid electrical pulses) and low‑frequency TENS (delivers slower pulses) showed some benefit; the studies did not report any unwanted side effects, so it is unclear whether harms occur.",
    "It is uncertain whether TENS is more effective than other pain‑relief methods such as medication, acupressure (pressing specific points on the body), or other electrical therapies, because the available research was limited and the results were inconclusive.",
    "Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that compare TENS with standard treatments, monitor possible side effects, and evaluate outcomes important to patients such as the need for additional pain medication, impact on daily activities, and overall quality of life."

      "subheading": "What is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?",
      "content": "Primary dysmenorrhoea, often called period pain or menstrual cramps, is pain that many women experience during their monthly periods. It can be strong enough to interfere with daily activities, school, work, and overall quality of life. Because the pain comes from the uterus itself (not from another medical condition), it is called \"primary\" dysmenorrhoea. Managing this pain is important so that women can go about their lives without unnecessary suffering."

      "subheading": "What is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and how might it help?",
      "content": "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS, is a non‑drug treatment that uses a small device to send gentle electrical currents through electrodes placed on the skin over the painful area. The currents can be delivered at a high frequency (many pulses per second) or a low frequency (fewer pulses per second). TENS is thought to work by blocking pain signals, encouraging the body to release its own natural pain‑relieving chemicals (called endogenous opioids), and improving blood flow to the uterus. Because it does not involve medication, TENS could be an alternative or addition to common painkillers for period cramps."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to know whether TENS actually reduces period pain and whether it is safe to use. Specifically, they compared high‑frequency TENS and low‑frequency TENS with placebo or no treatment, and with other common treatments such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) or non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Their goal was to assess both the effectiveness (how well it eases pain) and the safety (any side‑effects) of TENS for women with primary dysmenorrhoea."

      "content": "We searched for studies that compared high‑ or low‑frequency TENS with placebo, no treatment or other therapies in women with primary dysmenorrhoea, combined the results from the identified randomized controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to groups), and assessed the certainty of the evidence using standard criteria."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at 20 randomised controlled trials that together included 585 women aged 12 to 49 years who had primary dysmenorrhoea. The trials compared high‑frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and low‑frequency TENS with placebo or no treatment, with each other, and with other interventions such as acupressure, acetaminophen (paracetamol), non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and interferential current therapy. The abstract did not provide information about how long each study lasted, where the studies were conducted, or who funded them. The review found that both high‑frequency TENS and low‑frequency TENS may reduce menstrual pain compared with placebo or no treatment. It is unclear whether high‑frequency TENS works better than low‑frequency TENS, or whether either type of TENS is more effective than other treatments such as acupressure, acetaminophen or interferential current therapy. No clear evidence of harmful side‑effects from TENS was identified."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2024 of search."
