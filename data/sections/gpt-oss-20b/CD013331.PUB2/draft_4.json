  "draft": "Does transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS – a mild electric pad treatment) lower period pain in women compared with no treatment or other pain‑relief methods?\n\nKey messages\n- TENS (a mild electric pad) may reduce period pain compared with no treatment or an inactive placebo. Both high‑frequency TENS (fast pulses) and low‑frequency TENS (slow pulses) showed some benefit, and the studies did not report side‑effects, so we cannot be sure whether harms occur.\n- We could not tell whether one type of TENS works better than the other, or whether TENS is more effective than acupressure, acetaminophen (paracetamol), NSAIDs, or interferential current therapy (a type of electrical treatment that uses two overlapping currents to try to relieve pain).\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that compare TENS with standard treatments, monitor possible side‑effects, and measure outcomes that matter to patients such as the need for extra pain medication, impact on daily activities, and overall quality of life.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?  \nPrimary dysmenorrhoea, often called period pain or menstrual cramps, is pain that many women feel during their monthly periods. The pain comes from the uterus itself, not from another medical condition, so it is called “primary”. The pain can be strong enough to interfere with school, work, and everyday life, making effective relief important.\n\nWhat is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and how might it help?  \nTENS is a non‑drug treatment that uses a small device to send gentle electrical currents through electrodes placed on the skin over the painful area. The currents can be delivered at a high frequency (many pulses per second) or a low frequency (fewer pulses of electricity per second). TENS may work by blocking pain signals, encouraging the body to release its own natural pain‑relieving chemicals (called endogenous opioids), and improving blood flow to the uterus. Because it does not involve medication, TENS could be an alternative or addition to common painkillers.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether TENS reduces period pain and whether it is safe. We compared high‑frequency and low‑frequency TENS with placebo or no treatment, and with other common treatments such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) and non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\nHow did we find and analyse the studies?  \nWe searched multiple databases up to 9 April 2024 for randomised controlled trials that enrolled women aged 12–49 years with primary dysmenorrhoea. Two reviewers screened the records, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE system – a method that rates how confident we can be in the results.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 20 trials involving 585 women. Both high‑frequency and low‑,frequency TENS may lower menstrual pain compared with placebo or no treatment. We could not determine whether one type of TENS works better than the other. We also could not tell if TENS is more effective than acupressure, acetaminophen, NSAIDs, or interferential current therapy. The trials did not report any side‑effects, so we cannot say whether harms occur.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the results because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies involved different populations and delivery methods, and most trials were very small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence searched up to April 2024.",
