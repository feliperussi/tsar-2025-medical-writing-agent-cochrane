  "draft": "Does transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS – a mild electric pad treatment) lower period pain in women compared with no treatment or other pain‑relief methods?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- TENS (a mild electric pad) may lower period pain compared with no treatment or a placebo. Both high‑frequency TENS (fast pulses) and low‑frequency TENS (slow pulses) showed some benefit, and the studies did not report side‑effects, so we do not know if harms occur.\n- We are unsure whether TENS works better than other methods such as medication, acupressure, or interferential electrical therapy because the available research was limited and the results were inconclusive.\n- Future trials should be larger, compare TENS with standard treatments, track possible side‑effects, and measure outcomes that matter to patients, such as the need for extra pain medication, impact on daily activities, and overall quality of life.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea, often called period pain or menstrual cramps, is pain that many women feel during their monthly periods. The pain comes from the uterus itself, not from another medical condition. It can be strong enough to interfere with school, work, and everyday life, so finding effective relief is important.\n\nWhat is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and how might it help?\nTENS is a non‑drug treatment that uses a small device to send gentle electrical currents through electrodes placed on the skin over the painful area. The currents can be delivered at a high frequency (many pulses per second) or a low frequency (fewer pulses per second). TENS may block pain signals, trigger the release of natural pain‑relieving chemicals (endogenous opioids), and improve blood flow to the uterus. Because it does not involve medication, TENS could be an alternative or addition to common painkillers.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether TENS reduces period pain and whether it is safe. We of compared high‑frequency and low‑frequency TENS with placebo or no treatment, and with other common treatments such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) and non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\nHow did we find and analyse the studies?\nWe searched multiple databases up to 9 April 2024 for randomised controlled trials that enrolled women aged 12–49 years with primary dysmenorrhoea. We included trials that compared high‑ or low‑frequency TENS with placebo, no treatment, or other therapies. Two reviewers screened the records, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 20 trials involving 585 women. Both high‑frequency and low‑frequency TENS may lower menstrual pain compared with placebo or no treatment. We could not determine whether one type of TENS works better than the other, or whether TENS is more effective than acupressure, acetaminophen, NSAIDs, or interferential current therapy. The trials did not report any side‑effects, so we cannot say whether harms occur.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe the little confidence in the results because some participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies used different populations and delivery methods, and most trials were small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence searched up to April 2024.",

The PLS evaluation shows a high count of difficult words (complex_words_dc = 231, beyond the typical PLS range), confirming that many specialised terms are present. Reducing jargon and breaking long sentences will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most PLS metrics (e.g., readability scores, active voice, pronoun use). However, the complex_words_dc metric is unusually high (231, P90), indicating many unfamiliar words. This aligns with the identified jargon issues. Overall, the text is within word‑count limits and scores well on readability indices, but the high difficult‑word count and a few clarity problems warrant revision."
