  "draft": "Does psychedelic‑assisted therapy (using drugs such as psilocybin or LSD) reduce anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with life‑threatening illnesses?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Psychedelic‑assisted therapy (a treatment that combines a psychedelic drug such as psilocybin or LSD with psychotherapy) may reduce anxiety and depression and possibly lessen existential distress (feelings of meaninglessness and fear about dying) in people with life‑threatening illnesses, and it was generally well tolerated with no serious side effects reported, although participants did experience temporary mild to moderate effects such as increased blood pressure, nausea, anxiety, or jaw clenching; the overall evidence is limited and not very reliable.\n- Evidence on whether this therapy improves overall quality of life or spiritual wellbeing is mixed and uncertain, and the same applies to MDMA‑assisted therapy, where benefits remain very unclear.\n- Because the studies were small, often could not keep participants blinded (keeping participants and researchers unaware of which treatment is given), and only followed people for a short time, larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm any benefits and to better understand possible harms.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy are anxiety, depression and existential distress a problem for people with life‑threatening illnesses?\nWhen someone is diagnosed with a serious disease such as cancer, they often experience strong feelings of worry (anxiety), sadness (depression) and a sense of meaninglessness or fear about the future (existential distress). These emotional problems can reduce quality of life, make it harder to follow medical treatments, and increase the risk of physical complications. Standard care usually includes medicines such as antidepressants or counselling, but many patients still struggle with persistent symptoms despite these options.\n\nWhat is psychedelic‑assisted therapy and how might it help?\nPsychedelic‑assisted therapy is a treatment in which a person takes a psychedelic drug – for example psilocybin (the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms”), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or 3,4‑methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, sometimes called “Ecstasy”) – under close supervision of trained therapists. The drug induces a special mental state, and the surrounding therapy sessions (before, during and after the experience) aim to help the person process emotions and find new perspectives. Researchers think this approach could lower anxiety, depression and existential distress, but the drugs are illegal in most countries and may cause side‑effects such as temporary blood‑pressure rise, nausea or mild emotional upset.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether psychedelic‑assisted therapy is safe and effective for people with life‑threatening diseases. Specifically, they compared the therapy to placebo or other active treatments (like standard antidepressants) to see if it reduces anxiety, depression and existential distress, and to identify any harms that might occur.\n\n**Methods**\nSearch Strategy\nWe systematically searched databases for studies evaluating psychedelic‑assisted therapy in adults with life‑threatening illnesses who experienced anxiety, depression, or existential distress.\n\nData Synthesis\nRelevant findings were extracted, grouped by therapeutic outcome, and combined to summarise the overall effect of the interventions across the identified studies.\n\nConfidence Assessment\nEach body of evidence was appraised for methodological quality, sample size, and consistency; a confidence rating (high, moderate, low, very low) was assigned to reflect the certainty of the conclusions.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included six randomised controlled trials with a total of 149 participants (outcome data for 140) aged 36 to 64 years who had life‑threatening illnesses such as cancer. The studies were carried out in outpatient settings in the United States and Switzerland and lasted between six and twelve months. Funding came from organisations that support psychedelic‑assisted therapy, with no drug‑company involvement. Two types of psychedelic‑assisted therapy were tested: (1) classical psychedelics – psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) – and (2) 3,4‑methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). In all trials the experimental treatment was compared with an active placebo or a low‑dose psychedelic control.\n\nThe findings suggest that psychedelic‑assisted therapy with psilocybin or LSD may reduce anxiety and may also reduce depression in people with life‑threatening illnesses. It is unclear whether this therapy reduces existential distress, improves overall quality of life, or enhances spiritual experiences. Evidence is also unclear about any benefit of MDMA‑assisted therapy for anxiety or depression. The therapy appeared to be well tolerated, with no serious harms reported, although the evidence on minor side‑effects is very uncertain.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024 of search.",

Several headings (e.g., “Key messages”, “Methods”, “Search Strategy”, “Data Synthesis”, “Confidence Assessment”, “Limitations”, “Currency”) are not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the draft contains a number of clarity and style problems that would confuse readers: a very long, jargon‑heavy bullet in the Key messages, excessive passive constructions, and noun‑heavy sentences. These issues are reflected in the PLS evaluation (33 passive voice instances, 214 nouns, and very high scores for Gunning Fog, LIX, SMOG, and complex‑word counts), indicating the text is more difficult than typical Cochrane PLSs. The most important improvements are: 1) rewrite non‑question sub‑headings as questions; 2) split the long key‑message bullet into shorter, plain‑language points; 3) change passive sentences to active voice; 4) replace noun‑heavy phrasing with clearer verbs; and 5) reduce technical jargon or add brief definitions. Addressing these will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability.",

These indicate the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than usual, supporting the need for the suggested edits."
