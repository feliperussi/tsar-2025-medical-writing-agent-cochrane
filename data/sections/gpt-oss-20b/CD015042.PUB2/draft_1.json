  "draft": "Do counseling (psychosocial) and medication help pregnant women quit or cut back on alcohol?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Brief psychosocial counselling (short, supportive conversations aimed at changing drinking behaviour) may increase the chance that pregnant women stop drinking completely, but the evidence is limited, no studies examined medication, and no information on side‑effects was reported.\n- The same counselling did not clearly reduce the amount of alcohol consumed per day, and it did not affect how many women stayed in the programme; overall, the quality of the evidence is uncertain.\n- More well‑designed research is needed, especially studies that test medicines for alcohol use disorder in pregnancy, use consistent ways of measuring drinking, and report any harms or other health outcomes.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is drinking alcohol during pregnancy a concern?\nMany pregnant people continue to drink alcohol even though it can harm the developing baby. About 10 % of pregnancies worldwide involve alcohol use, and the rate can be as high as one in four in some European countries. Alcohol can increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and a range of lifelong problems for the child, such as growth restriction and neurodevelopmental disorders. Because of these serious risks, health professionals try to help pregnant people stop or cut down their drinking. The main approaches used are **psychosocial interventions** – brief counselling or support sessions that aim to change behaviour – and, in some cases, medications that might reduce cravings. (Psychosocial interventions are non‑drug strategies, such as advice, counseling, or brief educational sessions, that target thoughts, feelings, and social factors influencing drinking.)\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether these psychosocial approaches, and any medicines, are effective at helping pregnant people stop drinking or reduce the amount they drink. Specifically, they looked for evidence on how well these interventions achieve continuous **abstinence** (not drinking at all), lower the number of drinks per day, keep people engaged in treatment, and whether they cause any adverse effects.\n\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared psychosocial (or medication) interventions with usual care or no treatment to reduce or stop alcohol use in pregnant women. We combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight randomised controlled trials that together included 1,369 pregnant women. Six of the trials were carried out in the United States, with one each in Spain and the Netherlands. All of the studies tested brief psychosocial programmes – ranging from a single session lasting 10 to 60 minutes to up to five 10‑minute sessions – that were delivered roughly at the end of the first trimester. The comparison groups received usual care or a similar level of attention, such as a thorough alcohol‑use assessment and advice to stop drinking. Most participants were women of unspecified age; one study reported that almost half of its participants had a current diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, and another said that 40 % had a lifetime diagnosis, indicating a range of severity. No trials of medication treatments for alcohol use disorder in pregnancy were found, and the abstract did not mention funding sources or any adverse events.\n\nMain results: Effect on alcohol abstinence\nBrief psychosocial interventions may increase the number of pregnant women who stay completely abstinent from alcohol. For roughly every 100 women, about 34 may remain abstinent with the intervention compared with about 25 without it. We are very uncertain whether these brief interventions change how many drinks a day pregnant women consume; they may have little or no effect. The interventions probably make little or no difference to whether pregnant women complete the treatment programme. No studies evaluated medication treatments for reducing alcohol use during pregnancy.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and because studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024 of search.",

This breaches the Master Style Guide (5.3 Structure). In addition, several clarity problems would confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Jargon without definition** – \"psychosocial counselling\" and \"continuous abstinence\" appear without plain‑language explanations. *Rewrite:* \"short, supportive conversations (called psychosocial counselling) that help people stop drinking completely (continuous abstinence).\"\n2. **Overly long, compound sentence** – \"Brief psychosocial counselling (short, supportive conversations aimed at changing drinking behaviour) may increase the chance that pregnant women stop drinking completely, but the evidence is limited, no studies examined medication, and no information on side‑effects was reported.\" *Rewrite:* \"Brief psychosocial counselling – short, supportive conversations that aim to change drinking behaviour – may increase the chance that pregnant women stop drinking completely. However, the evidence is limited: no studies looked at medication and no information on side‑effects was reported.\"\n3. **Unclear uncertainty statement** – \"We are very uncertain whether these brief interventions change how many drinks a day pregnant women consume; they may have little or no effect.\" *Rewrite:* \"We are very uncertain whether these brief counselling sessions change the number of drinks a day a pregnant woman has. The best evidence suggests they probably have little or no effect.\"\n4. **Complex, passive wording** – \"We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\" *Rewrite:* \"We have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received.\"\n5. **High noun‑heavy and nominalised language** – the draft contains 199 nouns and 27 nominalisations, making sentences dense and harder to follow. Re‑writing sentences to use active verbs (e.g., \"We found\" instead of \"The number of women who stayed abstinent increased\") will improve readability.\nThese issues, combined with the metric analysis (high nominalisation, noun count, SMOG index 14.8, many complex and long words), indicate the draft needs substantial revision before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate overall conformity. Readability scores are near the median (Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 11.8, Reading Ease 47), but several linguistic features deviate strongly: nominalisation (27, beyond P90), noun count (199, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.8, beyond P90), complex words (144, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall complex words (292, beyond P90), and long words (231, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many complex terms than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
