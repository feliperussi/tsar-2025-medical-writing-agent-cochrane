  "draft": "Do counseling (draft) (psychosocial) and medication help pregnant women quit or cut back on alcohol?\n\nKey messages\n– Brief psychosocial counseling (short, supportive conversations that aim to change drinking behaviour) may increase the chance that pregnant women stop drinking completely, but the evidence is limited and no study tested medication.\n– The same counseling does not clearly reduce the number of drinks per day, and it does not affect how many women stay in the programme. Our confidence in these findings is low.\n– Better research is needed, especially trials that test medicines, use consistent ways of measuring drinking, and report any harms.\n\nWhy is drinking alcohol during pregnancy a concern?\nAlcohol can damage a developing baby. About 10 % of pregnancies worldwide involve alcohol use, and in some European countries the rate is as high as one in four. Drinking raises the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, poor growth and lifelong brain problems for the child. Because of these serious risks, health professionals try to help pregnant people stop or reduce their drinking. The main approaches are psychosocial interventions (non‑drug strategies such as advice, counseling or brief educational sessions) and, in some cases, medication that might lessen cravings.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\n– We wanted to know whether psychosocial approaches, and any medicines, help pregnant people stop drinking or drink less. Specifically, we looked for evidence on continuous abstinence (not drinking at all), the number of drinks per day, staying in treatment, and any adverse events (harmful side‑effects).\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases and trial registries for randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial (or medication) interventions with usual care or no treatment. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight trials that together included 1 369 pregnant women. Six trials were done in the United States, one in Spain and one in the Netherlands. All trials tested brief psychosocial programmes ranging from a single 10‑ to 60‑minute session to up to five 10‑minute sessions. The programmes were delivered around the end of the first trimester. Control groups received usual care or a similar level of attention, such as a thorough alcohol‑use assessment and advice to stop drinking. No trial evaluated medication for alcohol use disorder in pregnancy.\n\nBrief psychosocial counseling may increase the number of women who stay completely abstinent. For roughly every 100 women, about 34 may remain abstinent with the intervention compared with about 25 without it. We are very uncertain whether these brief interventions change how many drinks a day pregnant women consume; the best data suggest little or no difference. The interventions probably make little or no difference to whether pregnant women complete the treatment programme. No study reported side‑effects or adverse events, and no medication was tested.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants likely knew which treatment they received, the studies were small, and not all outcomes were reported.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe review includes studies up to January 2024.",

Current subheadings such as \"Why is drinking alcohol during pregnancy a concern?\" are statements, not questions, violating the Master Style Guide. Additionally, the draft contains a high level of nominalisation (26 instances, P90) and many Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (222, P90), which make the text harder for patients to read. The most important improvements are: 1) Re‑write every subheading as a clear question; 2) Reduce nominalisations by turning noun‑phrases into verbs (e.g., change \"The interventions probably make little or no difference\" to \"The interventions probably do not change\"); 3) Replace complex or unfamiliar words with everyday language (e.g., change \"heterogeneous\" to \"different\"). These changes will bring the PLS into full compliance with the style guide and improve readability for the target audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows strong overall conformity (77.8% of features in the best quartile). Most metrics are within typical ranges, but two features deviate: nominalisation (26, P90) and complex_words_dc (222, P90), indicating excessive noun‑heavy phrasing and many unfamiliar words. Addressing these will further align the draft with typical PLS patterns."
