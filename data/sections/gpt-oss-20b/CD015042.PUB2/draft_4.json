  "draft": "Do counseling (psychosocial) and medication help pregnant women quit or cut back on alcohol?\n\nKey messages\n– Brief psychosocial interventions (short, supportive conversations that aim to change drinking behaviour) may increase the chance that pregnant women stop drinking completely, but the evidence is limited and no studies tested medication.\n– The same interventions probably do not reduce the number of drinks per day and probably do not affect how many women stay in the programme; our confidence in the evidence is low.\n– More well‑designed research is needed, especially studies that test medicines, use consistent ways of measuring drinking, and report any harms.\n\nWhy is drinking alcohol during pregnancy a concern?  \nAlcohol can harm a developing baby. About 10 % of pregnancies worldwide involve alcohol use, and in some European countries the rate is as high as one in four. Drinking increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, poor growth and lifelong neurodevelopmental problems for the child. Because of these serious risks, health professionals try to help pregnant people stop or cut down their drinking. The main approaches are psychosocial interventions (non‑drug strategies such as advice, counseling or brief educational sessions) and, in some cases, medication that might reduce cravings.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether psychosocial interventions and any medicines help pregnant people stop drinking or reduce how much they drink. We looked for evidence on continuous abstinence (not drinking at all), the number of drinks per day, staying in treatment, and any adverse effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases and trial registries for randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial (or medication) interventions with usual care or no treatment. We combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eight trials that together included 1 369 pregnant women. Six trials were conducted in the United States, one in Spain and one in the Netherlands. All trials tested brief psychosocial programmes ranging from a single 10‑ to 60‑minute session to up to five 10‑minute sessions. The programmes were delivered around the end of the first trimester. Control groups received usual care or a similar level of attention, such as a thorough alcohol‑use assessment and advice to stop drinking. No trial evaluated medication for alcohol use disorder in pregnancy.\n\nBrief psychosocial interventions may increase the number of women who stay completely abstinent. For roughly every 100 women, about 34 may remain abstinent with the intervention compared with about 25 without it. We are very uncertain whether these interventions change how many drinks a day pregnant women consume; they probably make little or no difference. The interventions also probably make little or no difference to whether women complete the treatment programme. No study reported side‑effects or adverse events, and no medication was tested.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants likely knew which treatment they received, the studies were small, and not all outcomes were reported.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe updated the evidence with searches completed in January 2024.",

These issues, combined with the metric‑driven high nominalisation (28 instances) and many long/complex words, indicate the PLS needs revision before approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS meets word‑count limits and most readability metrics (e.g., FKGL 10.6, Flesch‑Reading Ease 50.9) are within the best quartile. However, three metrics deviate markedly: nominalisation (28, beyond P90), complex_words_dc (221, beyond P90) and long_words (167, beyond P90). These suggest the text is noun‑heavy and uses many unfamiliar or long words, supporting the need to simplify phrasing and reduce nominalisations."
