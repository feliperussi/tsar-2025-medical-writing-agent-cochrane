  "draft": "Do counseling (psychosocial) and medication help pregnant women quit or cut back on alcohol?\n\nKey messages\n– Brief psychosocial counseling (short, supportive conversations) may increase the number of pregnant women who remain completely abstinent (i.e., do not drink any alcohol at all), but the evidence is limited and no studies examined medication or side‑effects.  \n– The same counseling did not clearly reduce the number of drinks per day, and it did not affect how many women stayed in the programme; overall confidence in the evidence is low.  \n– More well‑designed research is needed, especially studies that test medicines for alcohol use disorder in pregnancy, use consistent ways of measuring drinking, and report any harms.\n\nWhy is drinking alcohol during pregnancy a concern?  \nAlcohol can harm a developing baby. About 10 % of pregnancies worldwide involve alcohol use, and in some European countries the rate is as high as one in four. Drinking increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, poor growth and lifelong neurodevelopmental problems for the child. Because of these serious risks, health professionals try to help pregnant women stop or cut down their drinking.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether psychosocial approaches (brief counseling or support sessions) and any medicines help pregnant women stop drinking or reduce how much they drink. We looked for evidence on remaining completely abstinent, the number of drinks per day, staying in treatment, and any adverse effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched multiple databases and trial registries for randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial or medication interventions with usual care or no treatment in pregnant women. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eight trials that together included 1 369 pregnant women. Six trials were conducted in the United States, one in Spain and one in the Netherlands. All trials tested brief psychosocial programmes – from a single 10‑ to 60‑minute session to up to five 10‑minute sessions – delivered around the end of the first trimester. Control groups received usual care or a similar level of attention, such as a thorough alcohol‑use assessment and advice to stop drinking. No trial evaluated medication for alcohol use disorder in pregnancy.\n\nBrief psychosocial counseling may increase the number of pregnant women who remain completely abstinent. For roughly every 100 women, about 34 may stay abstinent with counseling compared with about 25 without it. We are not sure that counseling reduces the number of drinks per day; the best evidence shows it probably makes little or no difference. The counseling also probably makes little or no difference to whether pregnant women complete the treatment programme. No study reported side‑effects or adverse events, and no medication was tested.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received. The studies were also small, and not all outcomes were reported.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date with searches completed in January 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails to meet plain‑language clarity standards despite passing the structural checks. Three key clarity problems were identified: (1) a long, compound key‑message sentence that mixes two ideas and can confuse readers – \"The same counseling did not clearly reduce the number of drinks per day, and it did not affect how many women stayed in the programme; overall confidence in the evidence is low.\" (2) passive construction in the currency statement – \"The evidence is up to date with searches completed in January 2024.\" (3) heavy nominalisation and complex wording throughout (e.g., \"assessment\", \"intervention\", \"evidence\"), reflected by the metric scores (nominalization = 26 → P90, complex_words_dc = 220 → P90). These issues reduce readability and may leave patients uncertain about the findings. Suggested revisions: split the key‑message into two short sentences, rewrite the currency line in active voice, and replace nominalised nouns with verbs and simpler words. The draft also uses the term “psychosocial counseling” inconsistently with the source’s “psychosocial interventions”, which could cause confusion. Addressing these points will bring the summary into line with Cochrane plain‑language guidelines.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows strong overall conformity (77.8% of features in best quartile). However, two metrics deviate markedly: nominalisation (26, P90) and complex_words_dc (220, P90), indicating excessive noun‑heavy phrasing and many unfamiliar words. All other readability and style metrics are within typical ranges."
