  "draft": "Do counseling (psychosocial) and medication help pregnant women quit or cut back on alcohol?\n\nKey messages\n– Brief counselling that focuses on changing drinking habits may increase the chance that pregnant women stop drinking completely, but the evidence is limited and no study tested medication.  \n– The same counselling does not clearly lower the number of drinks per day and does not affect how many women stay in the programme; we are uncertain about these results.  \n– Better research is needed, especially trials that test medicines, use the same way of measuring drinking, and report any harms.\n\nWhy is drinking alcohol during pregnancy a concern?  \nMany pregnant people continue to drink even though alcohol can harm the developing baby. About 10 % of pregnancies worldwide involve alcohol use, and in some European countries the rate is as high as one in four. Alcohol can raise the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, poor growth and lifelong brain problems for the child. Because of these serious risks, health professionals try to help pregnant people stop or cut down their drinking. The main approaches are psychosocial interventions (non‑drug counselling or support sessions that aim to change behaviour) and, in some cases, medication that might reduce cravings.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether psychosocial approaches, and any medicines, help pregnant people stop drinking or drink less. Specifically, we looked for evidence on continuous abstinence (not drinking at all), the number of drinks per day, staying in treatment, and any adverse events (harmful side‑effects).\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases and trial registries for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to groups) that compared psychosocial (or medication) interventions with usual care or no treatment. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eight trials that together included 1 369 pregnant women. Six trials were done in the United States, one in Spain and one in the Netherlands. All trials tested brief psychosocial programmes ranging from a single 10‑ to 60‑minute session to up to five 10‑minute sessions. The programmes were delivered around the end of the first trimester. Control groups received usual care or a similar level of attention, such as a thorough alcohol‑use assessment and advice to stop drinking. No trial evaluated medication for alcohol use disorder in pregnancy.\n\nBrief psychosocial counselling may increase the number of women who stay completely abstinent. For roughly every 100 women, about 34 may remain abstinent with the counselling compared with about 25 without it. We are very uncertain whether these brief programmes change how many drinks a day pregnant women consume; the best data suggest little or no difference. The programmes probably do not change whether pregnant women complete the treatment programme. No study reported side‑effects or adverse events, and no medication was tested.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants likely knew which treatment they received, the studies were small, and not all outcomes were reported.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe review includes studies up to January 2024.",

Minor clarity improvements are recommended: (1) define “psychosocial” early (e.g., add definition in the first key‑message or introduction); (2) split the long limitation sentence into two shorter sentences for easier reading; (3) rephrase the ambiguous statement about treatment completion to a clearer form; (4) consider simplifying the phrase “The programmes probably do not change whether pregnant women complete the treatment programme” to “The programmes probably do not affect whether women finish the programme.” These tweaks will enhance readability without altering content. Metrics show the text is overall well‑aligned with typical PLS patterns, but nominalisations (23) and Dale‑Chall complex words (218) are higher than median, reflecting the repeated use of terms like “psychosocial interventions”. Reducing a few nominalisations and replacing some technical terms with everyday language (as suggested) will bring those metrics closer to typical ranges.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows strong overall conformity (77.8% of features in best quartile). Readability scores are good (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 55, Grade 9.9). Two metrics deviate: nominalisation (23, beyond typical median) and complex Dale‑Chall words (218, also beyond median). These indicate opportunities to replace noun‑heavy phrasing and simplify uncommon words, but they do not prevent approval."
