  "draft": "Do counseling (psychosocial) and medication help pregnant women quit or cut back on alcohol?\n\nKey messages\n– Short, supportive conversations (called psychosocial counselling) may increase the chance that pregnant women stop drinking completely, but the evidence is limited and no studies looked at medication or side‑effects.  \n– The same counselling did not clearly reduce the number of drinks per day, and it did not affect how many women stayed in the programme; overall confidence in the evidence is low.  \n– More well‑designed research is needed, especially studies that test medicines for alcohol use disorder in pregnancy, use consistent ways of measuring drinking, and report any harms.\n\nWhy is drinking alcohol during pregnancy a concern?\nWe know that alcohol can harm a developing baby. About 10 % of pregnancies worldwide involve alcohol use, and in some European countries the rate can be as high as one in four. Alcohol increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, growth problems and lifelong neurodevelopmental disorders for the child. Because of these serious risks, health professionals try to help pregnant people stop or cut down their drinking.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether psychosocial approaches (brief counselling or support sessions) and any medicines help pregnant people stop drinking or reduce how much they drink. We looked for evidence on continuous abstinence (not drinking at all), the number of drinks per day, staying in treatment, and any adverse effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases and trial registries for randomised controlled trials that compared psychosocial or medication interventions with usual care or no treatment in pregnant women. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight trials that included 1 369 pregnant women. Six trials were conducted in the United States, one in Spain and one in the Netherlands. All trials tested brief psychosocial programmes – from a single 10‑ to 60‑minute session to up to five 10‑minute sessions – delivered around the end of the first trimester. Control groups received usual care or a similar level of attention, such as a thorough alcohol‑use assessment and advice to stop drinking. No trial evaluated medication for alcohol use disorder in pregnancy.\n\nBrief psychosocial counselling may increase the number of women who stay completely abstinent. For roughly every 100 women, about 34 remain abstinent with the counselling compared with about 25 without it. We are very uncertain whether the counselling changes the number of drinks a day; the best evidence suggests it probably has little or no effect. The counselling also probably makes little or no difference to whether women complete the treatment programme. No study reported side‑effects or adverse events, and no medication was tested.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were small, and not all outcomes were reported.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date with searches completed in January 2024.",

This can make readers wonder whether the review includes all genders. *Rewrite*: Use \"pregnant women\" consistently throughout.\n2. **Unexplained term “continuous abstinent”** – The phrase \"stay completely abstinent\" and \"continuous abstinent\" are not defined for a lay audience. *Rewrite*: \"remain completely abstinent (i.e., not drink any alcohol at all)\".\n3. **Complex uncertainty sentence** – \"We are very uncertain whether the counselling changes the number of drinks a day; the best evidence suggests it probably has little or no effect.\" This double‑negative wording is hard to follow. *Rewrite*: \"We are not sure that counselling reduces the number of drinks per day; the best evidence shows it probably makes little or no difference.\"\n4. **Long, packed sentence about confidence** – \"We have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were small, and not all outcomes were reported.\" This sentence crams three reasons together. *Rewrite*: \"We have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received. The studies were also small, and not all outcomes were reported.\"\nThese issues affect reader understanding and should be addressed before approval. The PLS evaluation shows high nominalisation (26, beyond typical range) and a very high count of Dale‑Chall complex words (219), supporting the need to simplify language and use more verbs instead of noun‑forms.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most PLS metrics (e.g., readability scores, sentence length, active voice). However, nominalisation is unusually high (26, P90) and the count of Dale‑Chall complex words is also high (219, P90), indicating the text uses more noun‑heavy and unfamiliar words than typical PLSs. These metric deviations align with the identified clarity issues."
