  "draft": "Which dose, length of use, and form (patch, gum, spray, etc.) of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) helps people quit smoking the most?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Using a combination of a fast‑acting nicotine product (such as gum, lozenge or spray) together with a nicotine patch (known as combination NRT) tends to increase the chance of quitting compared with using a single product alone; higher‑dose patches (patches that deliver more nicotine) may work better than lower‑dose patches, and starting NRT before the quit day (preloading) also appears to improve quit rates, while fast‑acting products alone give similar results to patches. These findings come from fairly reliable studies, though some uncertainty remains.\n- Serious heart problems and other serious side effects were rare, and overall safety data were limited; one study found more people stopped treatment because of side effects (withdrawals due to treatment) when using a nasal spray (a spray that delivers nicotine through the nose) compared with a patch, and higher‑dose patches were linked to more treatment discontinuations, but the evidence on harms remains limited.\n- More well‑designed, longer‑term studies are needed to clarify the best duration of NRT use, compare different fast‑acting forms, and provide clearer information on safety and side‑effects, especially for newer or higher‑dose products.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is quitting smoking important and how is nicotine replacement therapy used?\nSmoking kills millions of people each year and makes it hard for many to stay healthy. When people try to stop, they often feel strong cravings and uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms because their bodies miss the nicotine that cigarettes deliver. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a set of products – such as patches, gum, lozenges, sprays or inhalers – that give a small, controlled amount of nicotine without the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke. The idea is to ease cravings and withdrawal, making it easier for a person to move from smoking to being completely nicotine‑free. While we know that NRT can help people quit, we are not sure whether the type of product, the dose, how long it is used, or when it is started (for example, before the quit day) changes how well it works or how safe it is.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\nThe authors wanted to compare the different ways NRT can be given to see which ones work best and are safest for helping people stay smoke‑free for at least six months. Specifically, they looked at:\n- Different forms of NRT (patches versus fast‑acting products like gum, lozenges, sprays, or inhalers)\n- Different doses (how much nicotine each product delivers)\n- Different lengths of treatment (how many weeks or months the product is used)\n- Different schedules, such as starting NRT before the quit day (called “preloading”) versus starting on the quit day itself.\nTheir goal was to find out which combinations give the highest chances of long‑term quitting and whether any of these approaches cause more side effects, serious health problems, or lead people to stop using the therapy.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared different forms, doses, durations and schedules of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 68 randomised trials with a total of 43,327 adult participants who were motivated to quit smoking. Most participants were recruited from community settings or health‑care clinics, and all trials had at least six months of follow‑up. The abstract does not report the countries where the trials were conducted or the sources of funding. The interventions compared different forms, doses, durations and schedules of nicotine‑replacement therapy (NRT), such as combination NRT (fast‑acting form plus patch) versus single‑form NRT, various nicotine‑patch strengths (14 mg, 21 mg, 42/44 mg), preloading (using NRT before the quit day) versus starting on the quit day, and fast‑acting NRT (gum, lozenge, nasal spray) versus patch. No studies compared NRT with non‑pharmacological interventions.\n\nMain results: Combination nicotine replacement therapy\nCombination nicotine replacement therapy increases long‑term quit rates compared with a single form (high certainty, moderate effect). Higher‑dose nicotine patches probably increase quit rates slightly compared with lower‑dose patches (moderate certainty, small effect). 21‑mg patches probably increase quit rates compared with 14‑mg patches (moderate certainty, moderate effect). 25‑mg patches probably increase quit rates slightly compared with 15‑mg patches (moderate certainty, small effect). Using nicotine replacement therapy before the quit day probably improves quit rates (moderate certainty, moderate effect). Fast‑acting nicotine replacement therapy makes little to no difference to quit rates compared with nicotine patches (high certainty, trivial effect). The length of time a nicotine patch is used may make little to no difference to quit rates (low certainty). How long combination nicotine replacement therapy is used may make little to no difference to quit rates (low certainty). It is unclear whether the specific type of fast‑acting nicotine replacement therapy (gum, lozenge, spray) affects quit rates (very low certainty). Safety outcomes show little to no clear differences between forms or doses of nicotine replacement therapy (low to very low certainty).\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022 of search.",

Aim for ≤850 words.\n3) **Convert passive voice to active** – e.g., replace \"The review included 68 randomised trials…\" with \"We included 68 randomised trials…\". The draft has 30 passive constructions (well beyond the typical ≤23), which hampers readability.\n4) **Reduce nominalisations and noun‑heavy sentences** – change \"Combination nicotine replacement therapy increases long‑term quit rates\" to \"Using combination NRT helps more people quit in the long term\". The draft contains 36 nominalisations and 292 nouns, far above typical ranges, making the text feel dense.\n5) **Simplify long sentences and explain jargon** – e.g., the sentence \"Combination nicotine replacement therapy increases long‑term quit rates compared with a single form (high certainty, moderate effect).\" can be split and clarified: \"Using a fast‑acting product together with a patch (combination NRT) leads to more people staying quit than using a single product alone. This finding is based on high‑certainty evidence and shows a moderate benefit.\" This addresses the 23‑word average sentence length (P75) and improves comprehension.\n\nSupporting metrics: passive_voice = 30 (BEYOND_P90), nominalization = 36 (BEYOND_P90), nouns = 292 (BEYOND_P90), smog_index = 16.1 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words_dc = 423 (BEYOND_P90), long_words = 288 (BEYOND_P90).

Overall conformity is moderate, but the identified deviations indicate the text is too dense, passive, and wordy for a plain‑language summary."
