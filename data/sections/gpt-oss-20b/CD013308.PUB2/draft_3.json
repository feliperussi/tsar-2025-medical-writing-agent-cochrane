  "draft": "Which dose, length of use, and form (patch, gum, spray, etc.) of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) helps people quit smoking the most?\n\nKey messages\n- Using a fast‑acting NRT product (gum, lozenge or nasal spray) together with a nicotine patch – called combination NRT – makes about 27 % more people stay quit than using a single product alone. The evidence is strong and we are very confident in this result.  \n- Higher‑dose patches (for example 21 mg or 25 mg) probably increase quit rates a little compared with lower‑dose patches (14 mg). Starting NRT a few days before the quit day (preloading) also gives a moderate boost.  \n- Serious heart problems and other serious side effects are rare. One study found more people stopped treatment because of side effects when they used a nasal spray, and a few more stopped when they used higher‑dose patches, but overall safety data are limited.\n\nWhy is quitting smoking important and how is nicotine replacement therapy used?\nSmoking kills millions of people each year and makes it hard to stay healthy. When people try to stop, they often feel strong cravings and uncomfortable withdrawal because their bodies miss nicotine. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a set of products – such as patches, gum, lozenges, nasal sprays or inhalers – that give a small, controlled amount of nicotine without the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. The idea is to ease cravings and withdrawal, making it easier to move from smoking to being nicotine‑free.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\nWe wanted to compare the different ways NRT can be given to see which work best and are safest for keeping people smoke‑free for at least six months. Specifically we looked at:\n- Different forms (patches versus fast‑acting products such as gum, lozenges, sprays or inhalers)  \n- Different doses (how much nicotine each product delivers)  \n- Different lengths of treatment (how many weeks or months the product is used)  \n- Different schedules, such as starting NRT before the quit day (preloading) versus starting on the quit day.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for randomised trials that compared one type of NRT with another. We included studies that enrolled adults motivated to quit, used at least six months of follow‑up and measured smoking abstinence. We combined the results and rated our confidence in each finding.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 68 randomised trials with 43,327 participants. Most participants were recruited from community settings or health‑care clinics. The main comparisons were:\n\n- **Combination NRT vs single‑form NRT** – Adding a fast‑acting product to a patch increased long‑term quit rates. The risk ratio was 1.27, which means people were about 27 % more likely to stay quit. The evidence is high‑certainty (we are very confident the result is true).  \n\n- **Higher‑dose vs lower‑dose patches** – Patches delivering 21 mg nicotine probably work better than 14 mg patches (moderate‑certainty, moderate effect). Patches delivering 25 mg probably work slightly better than 15 mg patches (moderate‑certainty, small effect).  \n\n- **Preloading** – Starting NRT a few days before the quit day probably improves quit rates (moderate‑certainty, moderate effect).  \n\n- **Fast‑acting NRT vs patch** – Using a fast‑acting product alone gave similar quit rates to using a patch (high‑certainty, trivial difference).  \n\n- **Duration of use** – The length of time a patch or combination NRT is used probably makes little or no difference to quit rates (low‑certainty).  \n\n- **Type of fast‑acting product** – We could not tell whether gum, lozenge or spray works better (very low‑certainty).  \n\nSafety outcomes showed little or no clear differences between forms or doses. Serious heart problems were rare. One study reported more treatment‑related withdrawals with nasal spray, and higher‑dose patches led to a few more withdrawals, but overall evidence on harms is limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings. Many participants knew which product they were using, which can influence results. Some studies were small and did not report all outcomes we wanted. These factors add uncertainty, especially for the effects of treatment duration and specific fast‑acting products.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe review updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to the April 2022 search date.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required completeness, sub‑heading format, factual accuracy and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that could confuse a lay reader. 1. **Overly long sentence** – \"Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a set of products – such as patches, gum, lozenges, sprays or inhalers – that give a small, controlled amount of nicotine without the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke.\" (32 words). Long sentences are hard to follow for non‑experts. *Rewrite*: \"Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) includes products such as patches, gum, lozenges, sprays or inhalers. These give a small, controlled amount of nicotine but do not contain the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke.\" 2. **Passive construction** – \"The length of time a patch or combination NRT is used probably makes little or no difference to quit rates (low‑certainty).\" (passive verb \"is used\"). Passive voice hides who is doing the action. *Rewrite*: \"Using a patch or combination NRT for a certain length probably makes little or no difference to quit rates (low‑certainty).\" 3. **Noun‑heavy phrasing / nominalisation** – \"Serious heart problems and other serious side effects are rare.\" (noun‑heavy, contributes to high nominalisation count of 24). A verb‑focused sentence is clearer. *Rewrite*: \"Serious heart problems and other serious side effects happen rarely.\" 4. **Technical jargon without plain explanation** – Terms like \"high‑certainty\" and \"moderate‑certainty\" appear several times (e.g., \"The evidence is high‑certainty (we are very confident)\"). While the meaning is later clarified, the repeated jargon can still distract readers. *Rewrite*: Replace with plain language such as \"We are very confident in this result\" or \"We have moderate confidence in this finding\". These issues are supported by the metric report, which shows a high number of passive constructions (18, P75), a high nominalisation count (24, beyond P90), and many complex/long words (complex_words = 132, long_words = 187, both beyond P90). Reducing these will improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (66.7% of features in best quartile) but deviates on five metrics: nominalisation, noun count, complex words (Dale‑Chall), total complex words, and long words – all beyond the P90 range. Passive voice is also high (P75). These deviations suggest the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than usual for plain‑language summaries."
