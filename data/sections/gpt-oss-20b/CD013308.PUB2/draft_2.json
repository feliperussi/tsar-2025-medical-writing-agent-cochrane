  "draft": "Which dose, length of use, and form (patch, gum, spray, etc.) of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) helps people quit smoking the most?\n\nKey messages\n- Using a fast‑acting NRT product (gum, lozenge or nasal spray) together with a nicotine patch – called combination NRT – helps more people stay quit than using a single product alone. The evidence is strong and shows a moderate benefit.  \n- Higher‑dose patches (delivering more nicotine) probably improve quit rates a little compared with lower‑dose patches, and starting NRT before the quit day (preloading) also gives a moderate boost.  \n- Serious heart problems and other serious side effects are rare. One study found more people stopped treatment because of side effects when using a nasal spray, and higher‑dose patches led to a few more drop‑outs, but overall safety data are limited.\n\nWhy is quitting smoking important and how is nicotine replacement therapy used?\nSmoking kills millions of people each year and makes it hard to stay healthy. When people try to stop, they often feel strong cravings and uncomfortable withdrawal because their bodies miss nicotine. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) provides a small, controlled amount of nicotine without the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. Products include patches, gum, lozenges, nasal sprays and inhalers. NRT eases cravings and withdrawal, helping people move from smoking to being nicotine‑free.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\nWe wanted to compare different ways of delivering NRT to see which work best and are safest for keeping people smoke‑free for at least six months. Specifically we looked at:\n- Different forms (patches versus fast‑acting products such as gum, lozenges, sprays or inhalers)  \n- Different doses (how much nicotine each product delivers)  \n- Different lengths of treatment (how many weeks or months the product is used)  \n- Different schedules, such as starting NRT before the quit day (preloading) versus starting on the quit day.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for randomised trials that compared one type of NRT with another. We included studies that enrolled adults motivated to quit, used at least six months of follow‑up and measured smoking abstinence. We combined the results and rated our confidence in each finding.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 68 randomised trials with 43,327 participants. Most participants were recruited from community settings or health‑care clinics. The main comparisons were:\n\n- **Combination NRT vs single‑form NRT** – Using a fast‑acting product plus a patch increased long‑term quit rates (risk ratio ≈ 1.27). The evidence is high‑certainty and shows a moderate benefit.  \n- **Higher‑dose vs lower‑dose patches** – Patches delivering 21 mg nicotine probably work better than 14 mg patches (moderate‑certainty, moderate effect). Patches delivering 25 mg probably work slightly better than 15 mg patches (moderate‑certainty, small effect).  \n- **Preloading** – Starting NRT before the quit day probably improves quit rates (moderate‑certainty, moderate effect).  \n- **Fast‑acting NRT vs patch** – Fast‑acting products alone gave similar quit rates to patches (high‑certainty, trivial difference).  \n- **Duration of use** – The length of time a patch or combination NRT is used probably makes little or no difference to quit rates (low‑certainty).  \n- **Type of fast‑acting product** – We could not tell whether gum, lozenge or spray works better (very low‑certainty).  \n\nSafety outcomes showed little or no clear differences between forms or doses. Serious heart problems were rare. One study reported more treatment‑related withdrawals with nasal spray, and higher‑dose patches led to a few more withdrawals, but overall evidence on harms is limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings. Many participants knew which product they were using, which can influence results. Some studies were small and did not report all outcomes we wanted. These factors add uncertainty, especially for the effects of treatment duration and specific fast‑acting products.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe review updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to the April 2022 search date.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required structural and factual checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader. 1) Statistical jargon such as “risk ratio ≈ 1.27” is presented without explanation, leaving readers unsure what the number means. 2) The certainty language (high‑certainty, moderate‑certainty, low‑certainty) is not defined, so readers cannot gauge how much confidence to place in the findings. 3) Phrases like “moderate benefit” are vague and do not convey the actual size of the effect. These three issues meet the threshold of three significant clarity problems. Suggested rewrites are provided below. The metrics support the need for simplification: the draft has 24 nominalisations (well above the typical median) and 202 nouns, contributing to a noun‑heavy style that can be made more verb‑focused for readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well overall (overall pattern conformity HIGHLY CONFORMS). However, six metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisations (24, beyond typical), noun count (202, beyond typical), SMOG index (13.8, higher than median), complex words (137) and long words (194) are all above typical ranges, and the Dale‑Chall complex word count is far beyond typical (306). These indicate the text is more noun‑ and complex‑word heavy than usual, supporting the recommendation to reduce nominalisations and simplify language."
