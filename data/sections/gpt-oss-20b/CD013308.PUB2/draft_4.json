  "draft": "Which dose, length of use, and form (patch, gum, spray, etc.) of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) helps people quit smoking the most?\n\nKey messages\n- Using a fast‑acting NRT product (gum, lozenge or nasal spray) together with a nicotine patch – called combination NRT – makes about 27 % more people stay quit than using a single product alone. We are very confident in this result.  \n- Higher‑dose patches (for example 21 mg or 25 mg) probably increase quit rates a little compared with lower‑dose patches (14 mg). Starting NRT a few days before the quit day (preloading) also gives a moderate boost.  \n- Serious heart problems and other serious side effects happen rarely. One study found more people stopped treatment because of side effects when they used a nasal spray, and a few more stopped when they used higher‑dose patches, but overall safety data are limited.\n\nWhy is quitting smoking important and how is nicotine replacement therapy used?\nSmoking kills millions of people each year and makes it hard to stay healthy. When people try to stop, they often feel strong cravings and uncomfortable withdrawal because their bodies miss the nicotine that cigarettes deliver. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) includes products such as patches, gum, lozenges, sprays or inhalers. These give a small, controlled amount of nicotine but do not contain the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke. The idea is to ease cravings and withdrawal, making it easier to move from smoking to being nicotine‑free.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\nWe wanted to compare the different ways NRT can be given to see which work best and are safest for keeping people smoke‑free for at least six months. Specifically we looked at:\n- Different forms (patches versus fast‑acting products such as gum, lozenges, sprays or inhalers)  \n- Different doses (how much nicotine each product delivers)  \n- Different lengths of treatment (how many weeks or months the product is used)  \n- Different schedules, such as starting NRT before the quit day (preloading) versus starting on the quit day.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for randomised trials that compared one type of NRT with another. We included studies that enrolled adults motivated to quit, used at least six months of follow‑up and measured smoking abstinence. We combined the results and rated our confidence in each finding.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 68 randomised trials with 43 327 participants. Most participants were recruited from community settings or health‑care clinics. The main comparisons were:\n\n- Combination NRT vs single‑form NRT – Adding a fast‑acting product to a patch increased long‑term quit rates. The risk ratio was 1.27, meaning people were about 27 % more likely to stay quit. We are very confident this result is true.  \n\n- Higher‑dose vs lower‑dose patches – Patches delivering 21 mg nicotine probably work better than 14 mg patches (moderate confidence, moderate effect). Patches delivering 25 mg probably work slightly better than 15 mg patches (moderate confidence, small effect).  \n\n- Preloading – Starting NRT a few days before the quit day probably improves quit rates (moderate confidence, moderate effect).  \n\n- Fast‑acting NRT vs patch – Using a fast‑acting product alone gave similar quit rates to using a patch (very high confidence, trivial difference).  \n\n- Duration of use – Using a patch or combination NRT for a longer or shorter period probably makes little or no difference to quit rates (low confidence).  \n\n- Type of fast‑acting product – We could not tell whether gum, lozenge or spray works better (very low confidence).  \n\nSafety outcomes showed little or no clear differences between forms or doses. Serious heart problems were rare. One study reported more treatment‑related withdrawals with nasal spray, and higher‑dose patches led to a few more withdrawals, but overall evidence on harms is limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings. Many participants knew which product they were using, which can influence results. Some studies were small and did not report all outcomes we wanted. These factors add uncertainty, especially for the effects of treatment duration and specific fast‑acting products.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe review updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to the April 2022 search date.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required completeness, title/subheading format, factual accuracy and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader.\n\n1. **Technical confidence language is unexplained** – e.g., \"We are very confident this result is true\" and \"moderate confidence, moderate effect\". Readers do not know what \"moderate confidence\" means. \n   *Rewrite:* \"We are very sure this result is correct\" or \"We are fairly sure (moderate confidence) that this finding is true\" and add a brief note such as \"(confidence tells us how sure we are about the evidence)\".\n\n2. **Noun‑heavy, nominalised sentences** – e.g., \"Combination NRT vs single‑form NRT – Adding a fast‑acting product to a patch increased long‑term quit rates.\" This construction uses a noun phrase as a heading and a nominalisation that makes the sentence harder to follow.\n   *Rewrite:* \"When we added a fast‑acting product to a patch, more people stayed quit in the long term (risk ratio 1.27).\"\n\n3. **Inconsistent confidence phrasing** – the key‑message bullet says \"very high confidence\" which is not used elsewhere (the source says \"high certainty\"). This inconsistency can mislead readers.\n   *Rewrite:* Change to \"high confidence\" to match the rest of the summary.\n\n4. **Jargon without clear definition** – the term \"preloading\" appears in the results without a simple reminder of its meaning. Although defined earlier, many readers may forget it.\n   *Rewrite:* Add a brief reminder: \"preloading (starting NRT a few days before the quit day)\".\n\n5. **Wordy phrasing** – e.g., \"Serious heart problems and other serious side effects happen rarely.\" The repetition of \"serious\" is unnecessary and the verb \"happen\" is vague.\n   *Rewrite:* \"Serious heart problems and other side effects are rare.\"\n\n**Metric support:** The PLS evaluation shows a high number of nominalisations (28, beyond the typical range) and an excess of nouns (207) and complex words (132) – both contributing to the noun‑heavy style noted above. The smog index (14.1) and complex‑word counts are also above typical PLS levels, confirming the need to simplify language and reduce technical jargon. Addressing these five points will bring the summary into line with Cochrane plain‑language standards and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (e.g., Flesch‑Kincaid grade 8.6, reading ease 64). However, it deviates markedly in nominalisation (28, beyond P90), noun count (207, beyond P90), complex words (132, beyond P90) and smog index (14.1, beyond P90). These metrics indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than typical Cochrane PLS, supporting the recommended simplifications."
