  "draft": "Which dose, length of use, and form (patch, gum, spray, etc.) of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) helps people quit smoking the most?\n\nKey messages  \n– Adding a fast‑acting NRT product (gum, lozenge or nasal spray) to a nicotine patch raises the chance of staying quit by about 27 %. We are very sure about this result.  \n– Higher‑dose patches may improve quit rates a little, and starting NRT a few days before the quit day (preloading) may also help. We think this is probably true.  \n– Serious heart problems and other serious side‑effects are rare. One study found more people stopped treatment because of side‑effects when they used a nasal spray, and a few more stopped when they used higher‑dose patches, but overall safety data are limited.\n\nWhy is quitting smoking important and how is nicotine replacement therapy used?  \nSmoking kills millions of people each year and makes it hard to stay healthy. When people try to stop, they often feel strong cravings and uncomfortable withdrawal because their bodies miss the nicotine that cigarettes deliver. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a set of products – such as patches, gum, lozenges, sprays or inhalers – that give a small, controlled amount of nicotine without the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke. It helps ease cravings and withdrawal, making it easier to move from smoking to being completely nicotine‑free.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?  \nWe wanted to compare different ways of giving NRT to see which work best and are safest for keeping people smoke‑free for at least six months. Specifically we looked at:  \n– Different forms (patches versus fast‑acting products like gum, lozenges, sprays or inhalers)  \n– Different doses (how much nicotine each product delivers)  \n– Different lengths of treatment (how many weeks or months the product is used)  \n– Different schedules, such as starting NRT before the quit day (preloading) versus starting on the quit day.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for randomised trials that compared one type of NRT with another. We included studies that enrolled adults motivated to quit, used at least six months of follow‑up and measured smoking abstinence. We combined the results and rated how sure we are about each finding.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 68 randomised trials with a total of 43 327 adult participants who were motivated to quit smoking. Most participants were recruited from community settings or health‑care clinics. The main comparisons were:\n\n– Combination NRT versus single‑form NRT: Adding a fast‑acting product to a nicotine patch increased quit rates by about 27 %. We are very sure about this result.  \n\n– Higher‑dose versus lower‑dose patches: Patches delivering 21 mg nicotine probably work better than 14 mg patches, and patches delivering 25 mg probably work slightly better than 15 mg patches. We think this is probably true.  \n\n– Preloading: Starting NRT a few days before the quit day probably improves quit rates. We think this is probably true.  \n\n– Fast‑acting NRT versus patch: Using a fast‑acting product alone gave similar quit rates to using a patch. We are very sure about this result.  \n\n– Duration of use: Using a patch or combination NRT for a longer or shorter period probably makes little or no difference to quit rates. We are not sure about this result.  \n\n– Type of fast‑acting product: We could not tell whether gum, lozenge or spray works better. We are not sure about this result.  \n\nSafety outcomes showed little or no clear differences between forms or doses. Serious heart problems were rare. One study reported more treatment‑related withdrawals with nasal spray, and higher‑dose patches led to a few more withdrawals, but overall evidence on harms is limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the overall findings. Many participants knew which product they were using, which can influence results. Some studies were small and did not report all outcomes we wanted. These factors add uncertainty, especially for the effects of treatment duration and specific fast‑acting products.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe updated our previous review and added all studies that were published up to April 2022.",

Metric analysis shows strong overall conformity (83% of features in best quartile). However, three metrics deviate: noun count (190, above typical range), complex Dale‑Chall words (290, beyond P90) and long words (179, above typical). These suggest the text is noun‑heavy and contains many complex words, but readability scores are excellent (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 67, grade level ~8). Minor stylistic tweaks could reduce noun density and simplify vocabulary, though the current version already meets readability and clarity standards for patients."
