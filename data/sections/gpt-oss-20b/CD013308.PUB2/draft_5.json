  "draft": "\"Which dose, length of use, and form (patch, gum, spray, etc.) of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) helps people quit smoking the most?\"\n\nKey messages\n- Adding a fast‑acting NRT product (gum, lozenge or nasal spray) to a nicotine patch (combination NRT) makes about 27 % more people stay quit than using a single product alone. We are very sure this result is correct (high confidence).  \n- Higher‑dose patches (for example 21 mg or 25 mg) probably increase quit rates a little compared with lower‑dose patches (moderate confidence). Starting NRT a few days before the quit day – called preloading – also gives a moderate boost (moderate confidence).  \n- Serious heart problems and other side effects are rare. One study found more people stopped treatment because of side effects when they used a nasal spray, and a few more stopped when they used higher‑dose patches, but overall safety data are limited.\n\nWhy is quitting smoking important and how is nicotine replacement therapy used?\nSmoking kills millions of people each year and makes it hard to stay healthy. When people try to stop, they often feel strong cravings and uncomfortable withdrawal because their bodies miss the nicotine that cigarettes deliver. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a set of products – such as patches, gum, lozenges, sprays or inhalers – that give a small, controlled amount of nicotine without the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke. The idea is to ease cravings and withdrawal, making it easier to move from smoking to being completely nicotine‑free.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\nWe wanted to compare the different ways NRT can be given to see which work best and are safest for keeping people smoke‑free for at least six months. Specifically we looked at:\n- Different forms (patches versus fast‑acting products such as gum, lozenges, sprays or inhalers)  \n- Different doses (how much nicotine each product delivers)  \n- Different lengths of treatment (how many weeks or months the product is used)  \n- Different schedules, such as starting NRT before the quit day (preloading) versus starting on the quit day.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for randomised trials that compared one type of NRT with another. We included studies that enrolled adults motivated to quit, used at least six months of follow‑up and measured smoking abstinence. We combined the results and rated our confidence in each finding.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 68 randomised trials with 43 327 participants. Most participants were recruited from community settings or health‑care clinics. The main comparisons were:\n\n- **Combination NRT vs single‑form NRT** – When we added a fast‑acting product to a patch, more people stayed quit in the long term (risk ratio 1.27). This finding is supported by high confidence.  \n\n- **Higher‑dose vs lower‑dose patches** – Patches delivering 21 mg nicotine probably work better than 14 mg patches (moderate confidence, moderate effect). Patches delivering 25 mg probably work slightly better than 15 mg patches (moderate confidence, small effect).  \n\n- **Preloading** – Starting NRT a few days before the quit day probably improves quit rates (moderate confidence, moderate effect).  \n\n- **Fast‑acting NRT vs patch** – Using a fast‑acting product alone gave similar quit rates to using a patch (high confidence, trivial difference).  \n\n- **Duration of use** – Using a patch or combination NRT for a longer or shorter period probably makes little or no difference to quit rates (low confidence).  \n\n- **Type of fast‑acting product** – We could not tell whether gum, lozenge or spray works better (very low confidence).  \n\nSafety outcomes showed little or no clear differences between forms or doses. Serious heart problems were rare. One study reported more treatment‑related withdrawals with nasal spray, and higher‑dose patches led to a few more withdrawals, but overall evidence on harms is limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the overall findings. Many participants knew which product they were using, which can influence results. Some studies were small and did not report all outcomes we wanted. These factors add uncertainty, especially for the effects of treatment duration and specific fast‑acting products.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe review updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to the April 2022 search date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the subheading format check: the section titled \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, which the style guide requires for all subheadings. Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – terms like “risk ratio”, “high confidence”, and “moderate confidence” appear without plain‑language explanation. *Rewrite*: “Adding a fast‑acting product to a patch increased the chance of staying quit by about 27% (we are very sure about this result).”\n2. **Passive‑voice heavy sentences** – the draft contains many passive constructions (19 instances, well above the typical PLS range). Passive voice hides who did what and makes the text harder to follow. *Rewrite*: Change “The review updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to the April 2022 search date.” to “We updated our previous review and added all studies that were published up to April 2022.”\n3. **Nominalisations and noun‑heavy phrasing** – phrases such as “the main comparisons were” and “the evidence is up to date” use abstract nouns instead of clear verbs, contributing to a high nominalisation count (32, beyond typical). *Rewrite*: Replace “The main comparisons were:” with “We compared the following:” and “The evidence is up to date to April 2022” with “We included studies up to April 2022.”\n4. **Missing context for statistical language** – the statement “makes about 27 % more people stay quit” could be misread; clarify that it refers to the relative increase in quit rates. *Rewrite*: “About 27% more people stayed quit when a fast‑acting product was added to a patch, compared with using a single product alone.”\n5. **Subheading phrasing** – change the heading “Key messages” to a question to meet the style guide. *Rewrite*: “What are the key messages?”\nThese changes will reduce jargon, lower passive‑voice and nominalisation counts, and bring the subheading format into compliance, improving overall readability for patients.\n\nMetrics support these suggestions: the draft shows high passive voice (19, P90), excessive nominalisation (32, beyond P90), many nouns (211, beyond P90) and complex words (139, P90). Reducing these will align the text with typical PLS patterns and enhance clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit and scores well on most readability indices (e.g., Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 63, grade level ~9). However, it deviates on several metrics: passive voice (19, P90), nominalisation (32, beyond P90), noun count (211, beyond P90), complex words (139, P90), long words (203, P90) and Dale‑‑Chall complex words (318, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex language than typical PLS, supporting the need to simplify phrasing and increase active voice."
