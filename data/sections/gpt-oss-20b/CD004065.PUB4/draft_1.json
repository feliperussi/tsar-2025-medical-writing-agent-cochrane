  "draft": "Are steroid medicines and new biologic drugs (lab-made immune-targeting proteins) effective for treating eosinophilic esophagitis (a chronic allergic inflammation of the esophagus)?\n\nKey messages\n- Steroid medicines (corticosteroids) may improve symptoms and clearly reduce the number of eosinophils (a type of inflammatory cell) in the esophagus, while possibly causing fewer people to stop treatment because of side effects; biologic drugs (lab‑made, immune‑targeting proteins) appear to reduce eosinophil numbers but show little or uncertain benefit for symptoms, and they do not seem to increase side‑effect‑related stopping of treatment, although the overall evidence is limited.\n- Both steroids and biologics show uncertain effects on the visual healing of the esophagus when examined with a camera (endoscopic improvement), and the existing studies provide little information about long‑term benefits or harms.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed studies that examine how these medicines affect symptoms, tissue healing, endoscopic appearance, and safety over longer periods, especially to clarify the role of biologic drugs.\n\nINTRODUCTION/AIMS\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis and why does it matter?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long‑lasting inflammation of the esophagus, the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach. The inflammation is driven by eosinophils, a type of white‑blood cell that normally fights parasites but can cause damage when it builds up in the esophageal lining. People with EoE often experience trouble swallowing, food getting stuck, chest pain that feels like heartburn, and sometimes vomiting. Over time the repeated inflammation can scar the esophagus, making it narrower and harder to use, which lowers quality of life. Because there is no cure, treatment must be continued for years and aims to relieve symptoms, reduce eosinophil counts seen under a microscope (histology), and prevent strictures. Common medical options include corticosteroids (anti‑inflammatory steroids taken as swallowable pills or liquids), proton‑pump inhibitors (medications that lower stomach acid and can help some patients), and newer biologic drugs that target specific immune pathways.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about medical treatment for EoE?\nThe authors of the review set out to evaluate how effective and safe the various medicines used for EoE are. Specifically, they wanted to know whether these drugs, compared with a placebo (an inactive pill used as a control), can:\n- Improve patients' swallowing symptoms and overall quality of life;\n- Reduce the number of eosinophils in esophageal tissue, indicating healing;\n- Produce visible improvement of the esophagus during endoscopic examination;\n- Be tolerated without causing serious side‑effects that would make patients stop treatment.\nIn short, the goal was to assess the efficacy (how well the drugs work) and safety of medical interventions—especially steroids and biologic agents—for people living with eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\nMETHODS\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched databases for studies of medical interventions for eosinophilic esophagitis, combined their results to assess symptom, tissue and endoscopic outcomes, and rated confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 41 randomised controlled trials with a total of 3,253 participants. Eleven trials enrolled only children, while the remaining trials included both children and adults. Four trials enrolled participants with inactive disease and the rest enrolled participants with active eosinophilic oesophagitis. The studies compared medical interventions—principally corticosteroids and biologic agents—with placebo, representing 14 corticosteroid‑versus‑placebo comparisons and nine biologic‑versus‑placebo comparisons among 19 different intervention pairings. The abstract did not provide information on the duration of the interventions or follow‑up periods, funding sources, geographic settings, gender distribution, or other demographic characteristics.\n\nMain results: Histological improvement\nCorticosteroids cause a large increase in histological improvement. For roughly every three people treated, one additional person achieves histological remission compared with placebo. Biologics probably cause a large increase in histological improvement. For about every two people treated, one extra person achieves histological remission compared with placebo. Corticosteroids may improve clinical symptoms slightly, may make little to no difference to endoscopic appearance, and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse events slightly. Biologics may make little to no difference to clinical symptom improvement when measured as a simple yes/no outcome, probably increase clinical symptom improvement when measured on a scale, may make little to no difference to endoscopic improvement, and may make little to no difference to withdrawals due to adverse events.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the studies were very small, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.\n\nCURRENCY\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft is missing the required question‑style subheadings. Sections such as \"INTRODUCTION/AIMS\", \"LIMITATIONS\" and \"CURRENCY\" are presented as plain headings rather than phrased as questions (e.g., \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"), which violates the Master Style Guide. In addition, several clarity problems would confuse readers:\n1. **Long, dense sentence** – \"Corticosteroids cause a large increase in histological improvement. For roughly every three people treated, one additional person achieves histological remission compared with placebo.\" This packs two ideas into one sentence and uses the abstract noun \"remission\" without explanation. *Rewrite*: \"Corticosteroids greatly improve tissue findings. About one extra person out of three treated shows a normal eosinophil count compared with placebo.\"\n2. **Unexplained jargon** – the term \"NNTB\" appears only in the source, not in the draft, but the draft uses phrases like \"large increase\" without quantifying for lay readers. Adding a simple explanation helps: *Rewrite*: \"This means that for every three people given steroids, one more will have the disease cleared than if they received a dummy pill.\"\n3. **Passive voice and noun‑heavy phrasing** – \"The review included 41 randomised controlled trials with a total of 3,253 participants.\" (passive, noun‑heavy). *Rewrite*: \"We found 41 trials that together enrolled 3,253 people.\"\n4. **Missing paragraph breaks** – several sections (e.g., the whole \"Results\" paragraph) are a single block of text, making it hard to scan. Insert a blank line before each new idea or bullet point.\n5. **Bullet formatting** – the list under \"Key messages\" is a single long paragraph rather than separate bullet lines. Split each key message onto its own line starting with a dash.\nThese issues, together with the subheading problem, prevent the PLS from meeting the required style and readability standards.\n\nMetrics support the editorial judgment: the draft has 21 passive constructions (well above the typical 9‑23 range), 39 instances of nominalisation (far beyond the typical 8‑27), a very low Flesch reading ease (26.9 vs typical 32‑48), and a high average sentence length (26.3 words, beyond the typical 19‑28). These numbers explain why the text feels dense and hard to read.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is 790 words (within the 850‑word limit) but deviates markedly from typical Cochrane PLS patterns. Key metric outliers include very long sentences (26.3 words, P90), many passive constructions (21, P90), excessive nominalisation (39, BEYOND_P90), high noun count (234, BEYOND_P90), and low readability scores (Flesch reading ease 26.9, P10). These indicate the draft is considerably more complex than usual, confirming the need for shorter sentences, more active voice, and reduced noun‑heavy language."
