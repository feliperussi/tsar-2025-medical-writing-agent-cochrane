  "draft": "Are steroid medicines and new biologic drugs (lab‑made immune‑targeting proteins) effective for treating eosinophilic esophagitis (a chronic allergic inflammation of the esophagus)?\n\nKey messages\n– Corticosteroids probably improve swallowing problems and clearly lower the number of eosinophils (a type of inflammatory white‑blood cell) in the esophagus; they may also cause slightly fewer people to stop treatment because of side‑effects.  \n– Biologic drugs probably lower eosinophil numbers but show little or uncertain benefit for swallowing symptoms; they do not appear to increase side‑effect‑related stopping of treatment, although the evidence is limited.  \n– We are not sure whether corticosteroids or biologics improve the visual healing of the esophagus that doctors see during an endoscopy. The studies also give little information about long‑term benefits or harms.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis and why does it matter?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long‑lasting inflammation of the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. The inflammation is driven by eosinophils, a type of white‑blood cell that normally fights parasites but can damage the esophageal lining when it builds up. People with EoE often have trouble swallowing, feel food stuck, experience chest pain that feels like heartburn, and may vomit. Over time the repeated inflammation can scar the esophagus, making it narrower and reducing quality of life. Because there is no cure, treatment must be continued for years.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about medical treatment for EoE?\nWe wanted to know whether medicines, compared with a placebo (an inactive pill), can:\n– improve swallowing symptoms and overall quality of life,  \n– reduce the number of eosinophils in esophageal tissue (histology – the tissue test that counts eosinophils),  \n– produce visible improvement of the esophagus during endoscopy (a camera view of the esophagus), and  \n– be tolerated without causing serious side‑effects that make patients stop treatment (withdrawals because of side‑effects).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP databases up to 3 March 2023 for randomised trials that compared a medical treatment for EoE with another treatment or a placebo. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results as risk ratios or mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE system.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 41 randomised controlled trials with 3 253 participants. Fourteen trials compared corticosteroids with placebo and nine trials compared biologic drugs with placebo.\n\nCorticosteroids  \n– Probably improve swallowing symptoms (about 20 % more people improve).  \n– Clearly increase histological remission (meaning a low number of eosinophils in tissue) – about 64 % more people achieve this.  \n– May lead to slightly fewer withdrawals because of side‑effects.  \n– The effect on endoscopic appearance is uncertain.\n\nBiologic drugs  \n– Probably increase histological remission (about 55 % more people achieve a low eosinophil count).  \n– Show little or uncertain benefit for swallowing symptoms.  \n– Do not appear to change the rate of withdrawals because of side‑effects.  \n– The effect on endoscopic appearance is uncertain.\n\nOverall, the evidence for both drug classes on endoscopic healing and long‑term outcomes is limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in many findings because some studies were small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the trials varied in how the medicines were given and in the types of patients studied.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe summarised evidence up to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft is missing a required subheading phrased as a question for the key‑messages section and does not include the required \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\" currency section. Several sentences are overly long or noun‑heavy, contributing to high nominalisation (24), noun count (169), SMOG index (14.45) and complex‑word metrics, which reduce readability for patients. Suggested fixes: (1) change the \"Key messages\" heading to a question (e.g., \"What are the main findings?\"); (2) add a new subheading \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\" with the statement that the evidence is current to March 2023; (3) split the long methods sentence into two shorter sentences; (4) replace nominalised phrases such as \"We combined the results as risk ratios or mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE system\" with a more active, concise version; (5) reduce noun‑heavy phrasing throughout (e.g., \"We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP databases up to 3 March 2023 for randomised trials comparing a medical treatment for EoE with placebo\" → \"We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP up to 3 March 2023 for randomised trials that compared a medical treatment for EoE with placebo.\") These changes will bring the draft into compliance with the Master Style Guide and improve patient‑readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets the word‑count limit (601 words) and has good active‑voice (68) and pronoun use (30). However, it deviates markedly on nominalisation (24, beyond typical P90), noun count (169, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.45, beyond P90), and complex‑word metrics (complex_words 138, complex_words_dc 270, long_words 198), indicating the text is more noun‑ and jargon‑heavy than typical Cochrane PLSs. Addressing these metric outliers by reducing nominalisations and simplifying language will enhance readability."
