  "draft": "Are steroid medicines and new biologic drugs (lab‑made immune‑targeting proteins) effective for treating eosinophilic esophagitis (a chronic allergic inflammation of the esophagus)?\n\nKey messages\n– Steroid medicines (corticosteroids) probably improve swallowing problems. They also clearly reduce the number of eosinophils (a type of inflammatory white‑blood cell) in the esophagus and may lead to slightly fewer people stopping treatment because of side‑effects.  \n– Biologic drugs (lab‑made proteins that target the immune system) probably lower eosinophil numbers but show little or uncertain benefit for swallowing symptoms. They do not appear to increase side‑effect‑related stopping of treatment, although the evidence is limited.  \n– We are uncertain whether either drug class improves the visual healing of the esophagus when doctors look with an endoscope (a camera view), and the studies give little information about long‑term benefits or harms.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis and why does it matter?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long‑lasting inflammation of the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach. The inflammation is driven by eosinophils, a type of white‑blood cell that normally fights parasites but can damage the esophageal lining when it builds up. People with EoE often have trouble swallowing, feel food stuck, experience chest pain that feels like heartburn, and may vomit. Repeated inflammation can scar the esophagus, making it narrower and reducing quality of life. Because there is no cure, treatment must continue for years.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about medical treatment for EoE?\nWe wanted to know whether medicines, compared with a placebo (an inactive pill), can:\n– improve swallowing symptoms and overall quality of life,  \n– reduce the number of eosinophils in esophageal tissue (histology),  \n– produce visible improvement of the esophagus during endoscopy, and  \n– be tolerated without causing serious side‑effects that make patients stop treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP up to 3 March 2023 for randomised trials that compared a medical treatment for EoE with placebo. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results as risk ratios or mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE system.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 41 randomised controlled trials with 3 253 participants. Fourteen trials compared corticosteroids with placebo and nine trials compared biologic drugs with placebo.\n\nCorticosteroids  \n– Probably improve swallowing symptoms (about 20 % more people improve).  \n– Clearly increase histological remission (about 64 % more people achieve a low eosinophil count).  \n– May lead to slightly fewer withdrawals because of side‑effects.  \n– The effect on endoscopic appearance is uncertain.\n\nBiologic drugs  \n– Probably increase histological remission (about 55 % more people achieve a low eosinophil count).  \n– Show little or uncertain benefit for swallowing symptoms.  \n– Do not appear to change the rate of withdrawals because of side‑effects.  \n– The effect on endoscopic appearance is uncertain.\n\nOverall, the evidence for both drug classes on endoscopic healing and long‑term outcomes is limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany findings have low confidence because some studies were small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the trials varied in how the medicines were given and in the types of patients studied.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to March 2023.",

The PLS evaluation also shows high levels of nominalisation, long words and complex vocabulary (e.g., nominalisation = 23, long_words = 192, complex_words = 132), confirming that the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many technical terms. Reducing nominalisations and substituting simpler words will further improve readability. Overall, while the draft meets structural and factual requirements, the identified clarity problems prevent it from being approved as a patient‑friendly Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on word count (581 words) and active voice (67, P75) but deviates on several complexity metrics: nominalisation (23, P90), nouns (166, P90), SMOG (14.2, P90), Dale‑Chall (8.2, P90), complex words (132, P90), long words (192, P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many long, complex words than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need to simplify terminology and reduce nominalisations."
