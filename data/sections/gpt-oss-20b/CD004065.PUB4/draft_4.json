  "draft": "Are steroid medicines and new biologic drugs (lab‑made immune‑targeting proteins) effective for treating eosinophilic esophagitis (a chronic allergic inflammation of the esophagus)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n\n– Steroid medicines (corticosteroids) probably improve swallowing problems and clearly lower the number of eosinophils (a type of inflammatory white‑blood cell) in the esophagus. They may also cause slightly fewer people to stop treatment because of side‑effects.  \n– Biologic drugs probably lower eosinophil numbers but show little or uncertain benefit for swallowing symptoms. They do not appear to increase side‑effect‑related stopping of treatment, although the evidence is limited.  \n– Both steroids and biologics have uncertain effects on the visual healing of the esophagus seen during a camera view (endoscopy), and the studies give little information about long‑term benefits or harms.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis and why does it matter?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long‑lasting inflammation of the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. The inflammation is driven by eosinophils, a type of white‑blood cell that normally fights parasites but can damage the esophageal lining when it builds up. People with EoE often have trouble swallowing, feel food stuck, experience chest pain that feels like heartburn, and may vomit. \nOver time the repeated inflammation can scar the esophagus, making it narrower and reducing quality of life. Because there is no cure, treatment must be continued for years.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about medical treatment for EoE?\nWe wanted to know whether medicines, compared with a placebo (an inactive pill), can:\n– improve swallowing symptoms and overall quality of life,  \n– reduce the number of eosinophils in esophageal tissue (histology – the tissue test that counts eosinophils),  \n– produce visible improvement of the esophagus during endoscopy (a camera view of the esophagus), and  \n– be tolerated without causing serious side‑effects that make patients stop treatment (withdrawals – stopping the medicine because of side‑effects).\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP up to 3 March 2023 for randomised trials that compared a medical treatment for the condition with another treatment or a placebo. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results as risk ratios or mean differences, added 95 % confidence intervals, and judged how certain the evidence is using the GRADE system.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 41 randomised controlled trials with 3 253 participants. Fourteen trials compared corticosteroids with placebo and nine trials compared biologic drugs with placebo.\n\n– Steroids: Steroids probably improve swallowing symptoms (about 20 % more people improve) and clearly increase histological remission (about 64 % more people achieve low eosinophil counts). The effect on endoscopic appearance is uncertain, and steroids may lead to slightly fewer withdrawals because of side‑effects.  \n– Biologics: Biologics probably increase histological remission (about 55 % more people achieve low eosinophil counts) but show little or uncertain benefit for swallowing symptoms and for endoscopic appearance. Withdrawals because of side‑effects were similar to placebo.  \n\nOverall, the evidence for both drug classes on endoscopic healing and long‑term outcomes is limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in many findings because some studies were small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the trials varied in how the medicines were given and in the types of patients studied.\n\nHow up‑  to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised is current to the search date of March 2023.",
