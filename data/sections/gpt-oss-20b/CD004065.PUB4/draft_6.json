  "draft": "Are steroid medicines and new biologic drugs (lab‑made immune‑targeting proteins) effective for treating eosinophilic esophagitis (a chronic allergic inflammation of the esophagus)?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n– Steroid medicines (corticosteroids) probably improve swallowing problems and clearly lower the number of eosinophils (a type of inflammatory white‑blood cell) in the esophagus; they may also cause slightly fewer people to stop treatment because of side‑effects.  \n– Biologic drugs probably lower eosinophil numbers but show little or uncertain benefit for swallowing symptoms; they do not appear to increase side‑effect‑related stopping of treatment, although the evidence is limited.  \n– Both drug classes have uncertain effects on the visual healing of the esophagus seen during endoscopy, and the studies give little information about long‑term benefits or harms.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis and why does it matter?\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long‑lasting inflammation of the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. The inflammation is driven by eosinophils, a type of white‑blood cell that normally fights parasites but can damage the esophageal lining when it builds up. People with EoE often have trouble swallowing, feel food stuck, experience chest pain that feels like heartburn, and may vomit. Over time the repeated inflammation can scar the esophagus, making it narrower and reducing quality of life. Because there is no cure, treatment must continue for years.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about medical treatment for EoE?\nWe wanted to know whether medicines, compared with a placebo (an inactive pill), can:\n– improve swallowing symptoms and overall quality of life,  \n– reduce the number of eosinophils in esophageal tissue (histology),  \n– produce visible improvement of the esophagus during endoscopy (a camera view), and  \n– be tolerated without causing serious side‑effects that make patients stop treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP up to 3 March 2023 for randomised trials that compared a medical treatment for EoE with placebo. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results as risk ratios or mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE system.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 41 randomised controlled trials with 3 253 participants. Fourteen trials compared corticosteroids with placebo and nine trials compared biologic drugs with placebo.\n\nCorticosteroids  \n– Probably improve swallowing symptoms (about 20 % more people improve).  \n– Clearly increase histological remission (about 64 % more people achieve a low eosinophil count).  \n– May lead to slightly fewer withdrawals because of side‑effects.  \n– The effect on endoscopic appearance is uncertain.\n\nBiologic drugs  \n– Probably increase histological remission (about 55 % more people achieve a low eosinophil count).  \n– Show little or uncertain benefit for swallowing symptoms.  \n– Do not appear to change the rate of withdrawals because of side‑effects.  \n– The effect on endoscopic appearance is uncertain.\n\nOverall, the evidence for both drug classes on endoscopic healing and long‑term outcomes is limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany findings have low confidence because some studies were small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the trials varied in how the medicines were given and in the types of patients studied.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to March 2023.",

They also clearly reduce the number of eosinophils in the esophagus and may lead to slightly fewer people stopping treatment because of side‑effects.\"\n2. **Jargon without immediate definition** – the term \"biologic drugs\" appears in the key‑findings bullet before the earlier explanation is recalled, which can leave readers unsure what it means. *Rewrite*: \"Biologic drugs (lab‑made proteins that target the immune system) probably lower eosinophil numbers …\"\n3. **Vague wording** – phrases such as \"clearly lower\" and \"cause slightly fewer people to stop\" are imprecise. *Rewrite*: \"clearly reduce the number of eosinophils\" and \"may lead to slightly fewer people stopping treatment because of side‑effects.\"\n4. **Nominalised, noun‑heavy sentences** – e.g., \"Both drug classes have uncertain effects on the visual healing of the esophagus seen during endoscopy…\" This uses several nouns and a passive tone. *Rewrite*: \"We are uncertain whether either drug class improves the visual healing of the esophagus when doctors look with an endoscope.\"\nThese issues reduce readability for a lay audience. The PLS evaluation also shows high nominalisation (23, P90) and a high noun count (163, P90), confirming the draft is noun‑heavy. Reducing nominalisations and breaking long sentences will improve the Flesch‑Reading‑Ease (currently 49.99, already good) and bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns. Overall, the draft needs the above edits before it can be approved for patient‑facing use.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑limit (574 words) and shows moderate overall conformity. Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 49.99, FKGL 11.38). However, several metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisation (23, P90), total nouns (163, P90), SMOG index (14.1, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.25, P90), and counts of complex/long words are all above the median, indicating the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex words. These metric signals align with the identified clarity issues. The draft therefore requires revision before approval."
