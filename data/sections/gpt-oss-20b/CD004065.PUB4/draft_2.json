  "draft": "Are steroid medicines and new biologic drugs (lab‑made immune‑targeting proteins) effective for treating eosinophilic esophagitis (a chronic allergic inflammation of the esophagus)?\n\nKey messages\n– Steroid medicines (corticosteroids) probably improve swallowing symptoms and clearly lower the number of eosinophils (a type of white‑blood cell) in the esophagus. They may also cause slightly fewer people to stop treatment because of side‑effects.  \n– Biologic drugs probably reduce eosinophil numbers but show little or uncertain benefit for symptoms. They do not appear to increase side‑effect‑related stopping of treatment, but the evidence is limited.  \n– Both steroids and biologics have uncertain effects on the visual healing of the esophagus seen during endoscopy, and the studies give little information about long‑term benefits or harms.\n\nWhat is eosinophilic...

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "Critical checks failed: the draft is missing required sections (Background/Aims, Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency) and does not use question‑style subheadings for those sections. The title is a question, but the rest of the document lacks the mandated subheadings. Additionally, the draft contains very few first‑person plural pronouns (only 3, below the P10 benchmark) and too few active‑voice sentences (13, also below P10), making the text feel impersonal and less engaging for readers. The Dale‑Chall readability score (8.9) is beyond the typical PLS range, indicating the use of uncommon words that patients may not understand. These factual and structural gaps outweigh the minor style issues, so the PLS cannot be approved in its current form.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Add missing sections with question‑style subheadings** – e.g., \"What did we aim to find out?\" for Background/Aims, \"How did we carry out the review?\" for Methods, \"What did we find?\" for Results, \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" for Limitations, and \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\" for Currency. This will satisfy the completeness requirement.\n2. **Increase use of first‑person plural pronouns** – replace generic statements with \"we\" and \"our\" (e.g., \"We searched the literature…\" instead of \"The review included…\"). This will raise the pronoun count to the typical range.\n3. **Convert passive constructions to active voice** – rewrite sentences such as \"Steroid medicines (corticosteroids) probably improve…\" to \"We found that steroid medicines (corticosteroids) probably improve…\" to boost active‑voice instances.\n4. **Simplify jargon to improve Dale‑Chall readability** – define terms like \"eosinophils\" and \"endoscopy\" in plain language or replace them with simpler equivalents (e.g., \"a type of white‑blood cell\" and \"camera view of the esophagus\").\n5. **Provide the missing content for the background, methods, results, limitations, and currency sections** – use the information from the SOURCE_OF_TRUTH to populate these sections, ensuring numbers and findings match the original abstract.\n\nSupporting evidence: The PLS evaluation shows active_voice = 13 (below P10) and pronouns = 3 (below P10), indicating a need for more active, author‑centric language. The Dale‑Chall readability score of 8.9 is beyond the typical PLS range (7‑9), confirming that the draft uses too many unfamiliar words for a lay audience. These metric deviations align with the editorial observations above.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but deviates on three key metrics: active_voice (13, below P10), pronouns (3, below P10), and dale_chall_readability (8.9, beyond P90). These indicate insufficient first‑person language, too few active constructions, and higher‑than‑typical jargon complexity, supporting the need for the improvements listed."
