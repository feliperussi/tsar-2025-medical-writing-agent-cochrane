  "draft": "\"Are steroid medicines and new biologic drugs (lab‑made immune‑targeting proteins) effective for treating eosinophilic esophagitis (a chronic allergic inflammation of the esophagus)?\\n\\nKey messages\\n– We found that steroid medicines (corticosteroids) probably improve swallowing problems and clearly lower the number of eosinophils (a type of white‑blood cell) in the esophagus; they may also cause slightly fewer people to stop treatment because of side‑effects.  \\n– We found that biologic drugs probably lower eosinophil numbers but show little or uncertain benefit for swallowing symptoms; they do not appear to increase side‑effect‑related stopping of treatment, although the evidence is limited.  \\n– Both steroids and biologics have uncertain effects on the visual healing of the esophagus seen during a camera view (endoscopy), and the studies give little information about long‑term benefits or harms.\\n\\nWhat is eosinophilic esophagitis and why does it matter?  \\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a long‑lasting inflammation of the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. The inflammation is driven by eosinophils, a type of white‑blood cell that normally fights parasites but can damage the lining of the esophagus when it builds up. People with EoE often have trouble swallowing, feel food stuck, experience chest pain that feels like heartburn, and may vomit. Over time the repeated inflammation can scar the esophagus, making it narrower and reducing quality of life. Because there is no cure, treatment must be continued for years.\\n\\nWhat did we aim to find out?  \\nWe set out to evaluate how well the medicines used for EoE work and how safe they are. Specifically, we wanted to know whether steroids or biologic drugs, compared with a placebo (an inactive pill), can:  \\n– improve swallowing symptoms and overall quality of life,  \\n– reduce the number of eosinophils seen under a microscope (histology),  \\n– produce visible improvement of the esophagus during endoscopy, and  \\n– be tolerated without causing serious side‑effects that make patients stop treatment.\\n\\nHow did we carry out the review?  \\nWe searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP databases up to 3 March 2023 for randomised controlled trials that compared any medical treatment for EoE with another treatment or placebo. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results using risk ratios or mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals and rated the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach.\\n\\nWhat did we find?  \\nWe included 41 trials involving 3 253 participants. Fourteen trials compared corticosteroids with placebo and nine trials compared biologic drugs with placebo.  \\n\\n– **Steroids:** We found that steroids probably improve swallowing symptoms (about 20 % more people improve) and clearly increase histological remission (about 64 % more people achieve low eosinophil counts). The effect on endoscopic appearance was uncertain, and steroids may lead to slightly fewer withdrawals because of side‑effects.  \\n\\n– **Biologics:** We found that biologics probably increase histological remission (about 55 % more people achieve low eosinophil counts) but show little or uncertain benefit for swallowing symptoms and for endoscopic appearance. Withdrawals because of side‑effects were similar to placebo.  \\n\\nOverall, the evidence for both drug classes on endoscopic healing and long‑term outcomes is limited.\\n\\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \\nWe have low confidence in many findings because some studies were small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the trials varied in how the medicines were given and in the types of patients studied.\\n\\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \\nThe evidence we summarised is current to the search date of March 2023.\"",

      "feedback": "The draft is missing a required question‑style subheading for the Key messages section (it is labelled simply “Key messages”). This breaches the Master Style Guide’s rule that subheadings should be phrased as questions where possible. In addition, several clarity issues would likely confuse readers:\n1. **Long, dense sentence** – “We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP databases up to 3 March 2023 for randomised controlled trials that compared any medical treatment for EoE with another treatment or placebo.” This 33‑word sentence packs multiple ideas and uses several technical terms. *Rewrite:* “We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP up to 3 March 2023 for randomised trials that compared a medical treatment for the condition with another treatment or a placebo.”\n2. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as “histology”, “endoscopy”, “withdrawals due to adverse events” appear without plain‑language definitions. *Rewrite:* “histology (the tissue test that counts eosinophils)”, “endoscopy (a camera view of the esophagus)”, “withdrawals (stopping the medicine because of side‑effects)”.\n3. **Wordy phrasing** – “We combined results using risk ratios or mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals and rated the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach.” *Rewrite:* “We combined the results as risk ratios or mean differences, added 95 % confidence intervals, and judged how certain the evidence is using the GRADE system.”\n4. **Bullet‑point formatting** – the Key messages list uses long sentences and a mix of commas; breaking each point into a short, stand‑alone sentence improves readability. *Rewrite example for first bullet:* “Steroid medicines (corticosteroids) probably improve swallowing problems and clearly lower eosinophil numbers in the esophagus. They may also cause slightly fewer people to stop treatment because of side‑effects.”\n5. **Missing question for Key messages** – change the heading to a question, e.g., “What are the key messages?” to meet the style guide.\nThese changes address the most critical clarity problems and bring the draft into compliance with the style guide.\n\n**Critical issue:** Subheading “Key messages” is not phrased as a question, violating the Master Style Guide.\n\n**Overall:** Because the critical subheading requirement is not met, the draft cannot be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (603 words) and shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns (50 % of features in the best quartile). Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading Ease ≈ 50, FKGL ≈ 12). However, several metrics deviate strongly: nominalizations (23, P90), noun count (172, P90), SMOG (14.1, P90), Dale‑Chall (8.35, P90), and counts of complex/long words are all above typical ranges, indicating a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style that reduces plain‑language clarity."
