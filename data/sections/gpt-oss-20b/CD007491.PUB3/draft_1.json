  "draft": "Is avoiding a hospital stay by receiving acute care at home (hospital‑at‑home) as safe and less costly as being admitted to the hospital for older adults?\n\n- For many older adults, receiving acute care at home (hospital‑at‑home) appears to be about as safe as a hospital stay, with little difference in death rates or the chance of being readmitted (admitted again) to hospital, and it probably reduces the likelihood of moving into residential care (a care home) while also lowering health‑service costs (money spent by the health system); the evidence is reasonably reliable but not definitive, and no specific harmful effects were reported.\n- Patients’ overall health status seems similar whether they are treated at home or in hospital, but they may feel more satisfied (more pleased) with the care received at home, and the time spent in hospital (length of stay) is shorter when care is provided at home; the evidence supporting these observations is moderate.\n- Further research is needed, especially studies that follow patients for longer periods, examine impacts on caregivers (people who look after the patient), and use consistent methods to measure costs, to confirm these findings and address remaining uncertainties.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\n\nWhy might some patients want to avoid a hospital stay?\nWhen a person becomes seriously ill, the usual response is to admit them to a hospital where doctors and nurses can give intensive treatment. However, staying in a hospital can be stressful, especially for older adults, and it can increase the risk of infections and loss of independence. \"Admission avoidance hospital at home\" is a model of care where a team of health‑care professionals provides the same active treatment that would normally be given in a hospital, but they do it in the patient’s own home for a short, defined period. This approach aims to give patients the benefits of hospital‑level care while keeping them in a familiar environment and potentially reducing the need for a full hospital admission.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review authors set out to compare this \"hospital at home\" model with the traditional option of staying in an acute hospital. Specifically, they wanted to know whether treating patients at home is as effective as, or better than, hospital care in terms of important outcomes such as survival (mortality), the chance of having to be readmitted to hospital, the need for moving into a residential care home, patients’ own sense of health, and overall satisfaction with care. In addition, they examined whether the home‑based approach costs less for the health service and for society as a whole.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched databases for studies that compared admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home with usual inpatient care in adults, combined their results in meta‑analyses, and used the GRADE approach to rate our confidence in the evidence on effectiveness and cost.\n\n**Results**\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 20 randomised controlled trials that together involved 3,100 participants aged 18 years or older. All of the trials compared admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home (where active treatment is delivered at the patient’s home for a limited period) with standard acute hospital inpatient care. The participant groups varied: four trials enrolled people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, two recruited individuals recovering from stroke, seven focused on older adults with acute medical conditions, and the remaining trials included mixed‑condition cohorts. The abstract did not report details such as the length of follow‑up, the countries or settings where the studies were carried out, sources of funding, gender distribution, or severity grading of the conditions.\n\nMain results: Impact of admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home\nAdmission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home probably makes little or no difference to mortality in older adults. It probably makes little or no difference to the chance of being readmitted to hospital. It probably reduces the likelihood of moving into residential care. It probably makes little or no difference to patients' self‑reported health status. It may improve satisfaction with the care received. It may reduce the length of stay in hospital. It probably reduces health‑service costs.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all studies provided all the data we wanted, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we are interested in, and the studies were very small or there were few events.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is required by the Master Style Guide. Specifically, the subheadings \"Main results: Impact of admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are statements rather than questions. In addition, the opening bullet point is a single, very long sentence that combines multiple ideas and uses a semicolon, making it hard for a patient reader to follow. The draft also contains a high number of passive constructions (24) and nominalisations (29), contributing to noun‑heavy, less‑readable prose. Suggested rewrites: 1. Change \"Main results: Impact of admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home\" to \"What are the main results of admission‑avoidance hospital‑at‑home?\". 2. Change \"Limitations\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\". 3. Change \"Currency\" to \"How up to date is this review?\". 4. Rewrite the opening bullet as: \"- For many older adults, receiving acute care at home (hospital‑at‑home) appears to be as safe as a hospital stay. It makes little difference to death rates or the chance of being readmitted, and it probably reduces the chance of moving into a care home while lowering health‑service costs. The evidence is reasonably reliable but not definitive, and no specific harmful effects were reported.\". 5. Rephrase the sentence about the search date to active voice: \"We searched up to February 2022, so the evidence is current to that date.\". These changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: words per sentence (25.13, beyond the P90 range), passive voice (24, beyond P90), nominalisation (29, beyond P90), noun count (222, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.25, beyond P90), and high counts of complex and long words. These metrics confirm the editorial observations of overly long sentences, excessive passive constructions, and noun‑heavy language, supporting the recommended revisions."
