  "draft": "Is bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotic treatment better than standard throat‑swab treatment for children with cystic fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n- Bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotics do not give clear benefits over standard throat‑swab treatment. Lung function, CT‑scan scores, quality of life and bacterial clearance are similar, but bronchoscopy can increase hospital stays and cause a temporary worsening of cough.\n- The evidence comes from only two small trials that enrolled preschool‑aged children. The bronchoscopy procedure can briefly increase cough and, in rare cases, lead to rapid health deterioration shortly after the test.\n- Because the evidence is limited, we need larger, longer‑term studies that include older children, adolescents and adults to determine any long‑term benefits, costs and safety of bronchoscopy‑guided treatment.\n\nWhy is treating lung infections in cystic fibrosis challenging?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that makes thick, sticky mucus build up in the airways. The mucus creates a niche where bacteria thrive, causing chronic lung infections that damage lung tissue over time. Early detection and targeted antibiotics are essential to preserve lung function. Many young children cannot produce sputum (spit) samples, which are the usual source for identifying the infecting bacteria. When sputum is unavailable, clinicians often rely on oropharyngeal (mouth‑throat) swabs, which may miss bacteria living deeper in the lungs and lead to suboptimal antibiotic choices.\n\nWhat is bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and how might they improve infection detection?\nBronchoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure in which a flexible tube (bronchoscope) is passed through the nose or mouth into the lower airways. During bronchoscopy, clinicians introduce sterile fluid into a small lung region and then recollect it; this process is called bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The recovered fluid contains cells and microbes directly from the lower respiratory tract, providing a more accurate picture of the bacterial population than upper‑airway samples. Using BAL results to guide antibiotic selection—bronchoscopy‑guided antimicrobial therapy—has the potential to target the true pathogens more precisely.\n\nWhat did the systematic review aim to determine about bronchoscopy‑guided therapy?\nWe set out to evaluate whether choosing antibiotics based on BAL findings leads to better clinical outcomes than selecting drugs based on symptoms and oropharyngeal cultures. We focused on lung function, frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, quality of life, adverse events and healthcare costs in children and adults with CF.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, three study registries and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest search was on 1 November 2023. We included randomised controlled trials that compared bronchoscopy‑guided antimicrobial therapy with standard sampling‑based therapy in people with CF. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two randomised controlled trials that together enrolled about 200 children with CF. One large trial followed 170 infants (under 6 months old) from birth until age 5 years, providing data for 157 children. The smaller trial randomised 30 children aged 5–18 years. Both trials compared BAL‑guided therapy with standard care based on clinical signs and throat or oropharyngeal cultures. The studies did not report gender, disease severity or funding sources. Follow‑up lasted about five years in the larger trial; the follow‑up length for the smaller trial was not stated.\n\nWhat did the studies show about lung function?\nBronchoscopy‑directed therapy probably makes little or no difference to lung function after two years and after five years. The measured outcomes (forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity) were similar between groups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the evidence. Participants may have known which treatment they received, some data are missing, the trials are small, and the participants and interventions differed across studies.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to November 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several passages that would likely confuse a patient‑focused audience. 1) Technical terms such as “BAL”, “CT‑scan scores”, “bacterial clearance”, and “forced expiratory volume (FEV1)” appear without plain‑language explanations, leaving readers unsure what is being measured. 2) A number of sentences are long, dense, and written in passive voice, making it hard to see who did what (e.g., “The measured outcomes … were similar between groups”). 3) The key‑message bullet mixes several ideas in one long sentence, and the phrase “bronchoscopy can increase hospital stays” is vague – readers need to know that it may lead to more hospitalisations. These issues reduce understandability despite the draft meeting length and factual‑accuracy requirements. Reducing jargon, shortening sentences, and converting passive constructions to active voice will bring the summary in line with the Cochrane plain‑language style and improve readability.\\n\\nSuggested revisions (selected examples):\\n- Original: “Bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotics do not give clear benefits over standard throat‑swab treatment. Lung function, CT‑scan scores, quality of life and bacterial clearance are similar, but bronchoscopy can increase hospital stays and cause a temporary worsening of cough.”\\n  Rewrite: “Bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotics do not show clear benefits compared with treatment based on throat‑swab samples. Lung function, detailed chest‑scan (CT) scores, quality of life and the amount of bacteria in the lungs are similar, and the bronchoscopy procedure may lead to more hospital admissions and a short‑term increase in cough.”\\n- Original: “The measured outcomes (forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity) were similar between groups.”\\n  Rewrite: “We found that the two groups had similar lung‑function test results – the amount of air exhaled in one second (FEV1) and the total amount of air the lungs can hold (FVC).”\\n- Original: “Bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotics do not give clear benefits …” (passive)\\n  Rewrite: “We did not find clear benefits of bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotics …”\\n\\nMetrics support these edits: the draft has 26 passive‑voice constructions (well beyond the typical PLS range of 9‑23), 26 nominalisations, 196 nouns, and high complexity scores (SMOG 15.1, complex words 152, long words 217). Reducing passive voice and simplifying vocabulary will lower these metrics toward the median ranges and improve the reading‑ease score (currently 49.7, already good, but can be further enhanced).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits and has good active‑voice (73) and pronoun use (29), but it deviates strongly on several readability‑related metrics: passive voice (26, beyond P90), nominalisation (26, beyond P90), noun count (196, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.1, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall score (8.35, beyond P90), complex words (152, beyond P90) and long words (217, beyond P90). These deviations indicate the text is more noun‑heavy, uses many complex and long words, and contains excessive passive constructions, all of which can hinder patient understanding."
