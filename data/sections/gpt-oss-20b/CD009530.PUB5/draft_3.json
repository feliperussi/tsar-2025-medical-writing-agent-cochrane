  "draft": "Is bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotic treatment better than standard throat‑swab treatment for children with cystic fibrosis?\n\nKey messages\n– Bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotics do not show clear advantages over treatment based on throat‑swab samples. Lung function, detailed chest‑scan (CT) scores, quality of life and the amount of bacteria in the lungs are similar, and the bronchoscopy procedure may lead to more hospital admissions and a short‑term increase in cough.  \n– The evidence comes from two small randomised trials that together enrolled about 200 preschool‑aged children. Bronchoscopy can cause a temporary worsening of cough and, in rare cases, rapid health deterioration shortly after the test.  \n– Because the evidence is limited, we need larger, longer‑term studies that include older children, adolescents and adults to determine any long‑term benefits, costs and safety of bronchoscopy‑guided treatment.\n\nWhy is the treatment of lung infections in cystic fibrosis challenging?  \nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that makes thick, sticky mucus build up in the airways. The mucus creates a niche where bacteria thrive, leading to chronic lung infections that damage lung tissue over time. Early detection and targeted antibiotics are essential to preserve lung function. Many young children cannot produce sputum (spit) samples, which are the usual source for identifying the infecting bacteria. When sputum is unavailable, clinicians often rely on oropharyngeal (mouth‑throat) swabs, which may miss bacteria living deeper in the lungs and result in suboptimal antibiotic choices.\n\nWhat is bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and how might they improve infection detection?  \nBronchoscopy is a minimally invasive, lung‑looking procedure in which a flexible tube (bronchoscope) is passed‑through the nose or mouth into the lower airways. During bronchoscopy, clinicians introduce a small amount of sterile fluid into a lung region and then recollect it; this process is called bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The recovered fluid contains cells and microbes directly from the lower respiratory tract, providing a more accurate snapshot of the bacterial population than upper‑airway samples. Using BAL results to guide antibiotic selection—bronchoscopy‑guided antimicrobial therapy—has the potential to target the true pathogens more precisely.\n\nWhat did the systematic review aim to determine about bronchoscopy‑guided therapy?  \nWe set out to evaluate whether choosing antibiotics based on BAL findings leads to better clinical outcomes than selecting drugs based on symptoms and oropharyngeal cultures. We focused on lung function, frequency of pulmonary exacerbations (worsening of lung symptoms), quality of life, adverse events and healthcare costs in children and adults with CF.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, three study registries and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest search was on 1 November 2023. We included randomised controlled trials that compared bronchoscopy‑guided antimicrobial therapy with standard sampling‑based therapy. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified two randomised controlled trials that together included about 200 children with CF. One large trial followed  – 170 infants (under 6 months old) from birth until age 5 years, providing data for 157 children. The smaller trial randomised 30 children aged 5–18 years. Both trials compared BAL‑guided therapy with standard care based on clinical signs and throat or oropharyngeal cultures. The studies did not report gender, disease severity or funding sources. Follow‑up lasted about five years in the larger trial; the follow‑up length for the smaller trial was not stated.\n\nWhat did the studies show about lung function?  \nWe found that the two groups had similar lung‑function test results. The amount of air exhaled in one second (FEV1) and the total amount of air the lungs can hold (FVC) were alike after two years and after five years. This suggests that bronchoscopy‑directed therapy probably makes little or no difference to lung function.\n\nWhat other outcomes were reported?  \nCT scan scores, which of course are detailed X‑ray images of the lungs, were similar between groups. Quality‑of‑life measures showed no difference. The number of bacteria cleared from the lungs (bacterial clearance) was also comparable. However,  the bronchoscopy group experienced more hospital admissions per year and a temporary increase in cough after about 29 % of procedures. In rare cases (about 5 % of procedures) children showed rapid clinical deterioration within 24 hours of BAL.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence in the evidence because the trials were small, participants may have known which treatment they received, some data were missing, and the studies involved different ages and interventions. These factors limit how certain we can be about the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to November 2023.",
