  "draft": "Is bronchoscopy (a lung‑looking procedure that collects fluid)‑guided antibiotic treatment better than standard throat swab‑based treatment for children with cystic fibrosis?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotic treatment (using fluid collected from the lower airways) does not show clear advantages over standard treatment based on throat swabs for children with cystic fibrosis; key outcomes such as lung function (how well the lungs work), computed tomography (CT) scan scores (detailed X‑ray images of the lungs), quality of life, and bacterial clearance are similar, while the invasive procedure may lead to more hospital stays and some side effects like temporary worsening of cough.\n- The findings come from a small number of studies that enrolled preschool‑aged children, and the bronchoscopy procedure (a lung‑looking test) can cause a temporary increase in cough and, in rare cases, serious clinical deterioration (a rapid worsening of health) shortly after the test.\n- Because the current evidence is limited, further well‑designed research involving larger groups, longer follow‑up, and a broader age range (including adolescents and adults) is needed to determine any long‑term benefits, costs, and safety of bronchoscopy‑guided treatment.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is treating lung infections in cystic fibrosis challenging?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes thick, sticky mucus to accumulate in the airways. This mucus creates a niche where bacteria can thrive, leading to chronic lung infections that progressively damage lung tissue. Early detection and targeted antibiotic treatment are essential to preserve lung function. However, many patients—especially young children—cannot produce sputum samples, which are the usual source for identifying the infecting organisms. When sputum is unavailable, clinicians often rely on oropharyngeal (mouth‑throat) swabs, which may miss bacteria residing deeper in the lungs, resulting in suboptimal antimicrobial choices.\n\nWhat is bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and how might they improve infection detection?\nBronchoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure in which a flexible tube (bronchoscope) is passed through the nose or mouth into the lower airways. During the procedure, a sterile fluid is introduced into a small region of the lung and then recollected; this process is called bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The recovered fluid contains cells and microbes directly from the lower respiratory tract, providing a more accurate snapshot of the bacterial population than upper‑airway samples. Using BAL results to guide antibiotic selection—referred to as bronchoscopy‑guided antimicrobial therapy—has the potential to target the true pathogens more precisely.\n\nWhat did the systematic review aim to determine about bronchoscopy‑guided therapy?\nThe authors set out to evaluate whether choosing antibiotics based on BAL findings leads to better clinical outcomes compared with the standard practice of selecting drugs based on symptoms and oropharyngeal cultures. Specifically, they examined effects on lung function, frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, quality of life, adverse events, and healthcare costs in children and adults with cystic fibrosis.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared bronchoscopy‑guided antimicrobial therapy with standard sampling‑based therapy in people with cystic fibrosis, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence using established criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two randomised controlled trials that together included about 200 children with cystic fibrosis. One large trial followed 170 infants (under six months old) from birth until they were five years old, providing data for 157 children. The smaller trial randomised 30 children aged 5 to 18 years. Both studies compared broncho‑alveolar lavage‑guided antimicrobial therapy with standard care based on clinical signs and throat or oropharyngeal cultures. The trials were conducted in unspecified locations, and funding sources were not reported. The participants were young children, but details on gender and disease severity were not given. Follow‑up lasted about five years in the larger study; the follow‑up length for the smaller study was not stated.\n\nMain results: Lung function\nBronchoscopy‑directed therapy probably makes little to no difference to lung function after two years, and probably makes little to no difference after five years.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all data were provided, because the studies were very small and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2023 of search.",

Sections such as \"Methods\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\" and \"Main results: Lung function\" are headings, not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text contains several clarity problems that would confuse readers:\n1. **Long, complex sentence** – \"Bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotic treatment (using fluid collected from the lower airways) does not show clear advantages over standard treatment based on throat swabs for children with cystic fibrosis; key outcomes such as lung function (how well the lungs work), computed tomography (CT) scan scores (detailed X‑ray images of the lungs), quality of life, and bacterial clearance are similar, while the invasive procedure may lead to more hospital stays and some side effects like temporary worsening of cough.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words, mixes several ideas, and uses many nouns.\n   *Rewrite:* \"Bronchoscopy‑guided antibiotics do not give clear benefits over standard throat‑swab treatment. Lung function, CT‑scan scores, quality of life and bacterial clearance are similar, but the bronchoscopy can increase hospital stays and cause a temporary worsening of cough.\"\n2. **Passive‑voice heavy paragraph** – \"We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all data were provided, because the studies were very small and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results, and because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.\" The sentence is passive‑heavy, long, and hard to follow.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We have low confidence in the evidence. Participants may have known which treatment they received, some data are missing, the studies are small, and the participants and interventions differed across trials.\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy wording** – \"The findings come from a small number of studies that enrolled preschool‑aged children, and the bronchoscopy procedure (a lung‑looking test) can cause a temporary increase in cough and, in rare cases, serious clinical deterioration (a rapid worsening of health) shortly after the test.\" This sentence relies on many nouns (findings, procedure, deterioration).\n   *Rewrite:* \"Only a few studies of preschool‑aged children exist. The bronchoscopy can temporarily increase cough and, rarely, cause rapid health worsening right after the test.\"\n4. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – Replace non‑question headings with question forms, e.g.:\n   - \"Methods\" → \"How did we find and evaluate the studies?\"\n   - \"Limitations\" → \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n   - \"Currency\" → \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"\n   - \"Main results: Lung function\" → \"What did the studies show about lung function?\"\n5. **Bullet‑point formatting** – Ensure all list items start with a dash (‑) and that there is a blank line before and after each list.\n\nThese changes address the most critical clarity and style issues and bring the draft into alignment with the Master Style Guide. The metrics support these observations: the draft has 37 passive constructions (well beyond the typical ≤23), 29 nominalizations, 216 nouns, and a SMOG index of 15.6, all indicating excessive noun‑density and complexity. Reducing passive voice, nominalizations, and long sentences will lower these scores toward the typical PLS range and improve readability for patients.\nOverall, because the subheading requirement is not met and several major clarity problems remain, the draft cannot be approved in its current form.",
