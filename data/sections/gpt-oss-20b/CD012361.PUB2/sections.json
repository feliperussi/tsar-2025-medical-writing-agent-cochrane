  "key_messages": [
    "We could not determine whether dexmedetomidine (a sedating pain pain‑relief medicine) is effective or safe for sedation (calming) and analgesia (pain relief) in newborns receiving mechanical ventilation (a breathing machine) because no eligible studies were found, so there is no information on benefits or harmful effects.",
    "A few studies are currently underway that will compare dexmedetomidine with other drugs such as fentanyl, morphine, or ketamine, but the results are not yet available.",
    "Future research needs well‑designed randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatments) to assess both short‑term effectiveness and safety, as well as long‑term outcomes, to fill the current evidence gap."

      "subheading": "Why do newborn babies on breathing machines need safe pain relief and calmness?",
      "content": "Some newborn infants (babies younger than four weeks) become so ill that they need a machine to help them breathe – this is called mechanical ventilation. While on the machine, they often feel pain or become restless, so doctors give medicines to keep them calm (sedation) and free from pain (analgesia). The most common drugs used are morphine and other strong opioids. Although these medicines work, they can also cause problems such as low blood pressure, breathing difficulties, and other side‑effects that can be especially risky for tiny babies. Dexmedetomidine is a different type of drug that works by activating a specific part of the nervous system called the \"alpha‑2\" receptors. It is thought to calm babies without dropping their blood pressure as much, and it is being used more often even though it is not officially approved (licensed) for this use in newborns."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out about dexmedetomidine?",
      "content": "The review authors set out to discover whether dexmedetomidine is effective and safe for providing sedation and pain relief in newborn infants who are on mechanical ventilation. Specifically, they wanted to compare dexmedetomidine with other non‑opioid medicines, with opioids such as morphine or fentanyl, and with no active drug (placebo) to see which option works best and has the fewest harms."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found no eligible studies, so no participants were enrolled and we have no information about study duration, funding sources, population characteristics, settings, or the specific interventions and comparisons. Because no studies met the review criteria, we cannot determine whether dexmedetomidine is effective or safe for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation."
