  "draft": "Is dexmedetomidine (a sedating pain‑relief medicine) effective and safe for calming and pain relief in newborns on a breathing machine?\n\n**Key messages**\n- We could not determine whether dexmedetomidine (a sedating pain‑relief medicine) is effective or safe for sedation (calming) and analgesia (pain relief) in newborns receiving mechanical ventilation (a breathing machine) because no eligible studies were found, so there is no information on benefits or harmful effects.\n- A few studies are currently underway that will compare dexmedetomidine with other drugs such as fentanyl, morphine, or ketamine, but the results are not yet available.\n- Future research needs well‑designed randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatments) to assess both short‑term effectiveness and safety, as well as long‑term outcomes, to fill the current evidence gap.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy do newborn babies on breathing machines need safe pain relief and calmness?\nSome newborn infants (babies younger than four weeks) become so ill that they need a machine to help them breathe – this is called mechanical ventilation. While on the machine, they often feel pain or become restless, so doctors give medicines to keep them calm (sedation) and free from pain (analgesia). The most common drugs used are morphine and other strong opioids. Although these medicines work, they can also cause problems such as low blood pressure, breathing difficulties, and other side‑effects that can be especially risky for tiny babies. Dexmedetomidine is a different type of drug that works by activating a specific part of the nervous system called the \"alpha‑2\" receptors. It is thought to calm babies without dropping their blood pressure as much, and it is being used more often even though it is not officially approved (licensed) for this use in newborns.\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about dexmedetomidine?\nThe review authors set out to discover whether dexmedetomidine is effective and safe for providing sedation and pain relief in newborn infants who are on mechanical ventilation. Specifically, they wanted to compare dexmedetomidine with other non‑opioid medicines, with opioids such as morphine or fentanyl, and with no active drug (placebo) to see which option works best and has the fewest harms.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared dexmedetomidine with other analgesic or sedative options (or placebo) in newborns on mechanical ventilation, combined any results we found, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWe found no eligible studies, so no participants were enrolled and we have no information about study duration, funding sources, population characteristics, settings, or the specific interventions and comparisons. Because no studies met the review criteria, we cannot determine whether dexmedetomidine is effective or safe for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the required style rule that all subheadings must be phrased as questions. Current subheadings (Key messages, Introduction/Aims, Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency) are statements, not questions, so the review does not meet the Master Style Guide. In addition, several clarity issues would confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Over‑long, jargon‑heavy sentence** – \"We could not determine whether dexmedetomidine (a sedating pain‑relief medicine) is effective or safe for sedation (calming) and analgesia (pain relief) in newborns receiving mechanical ventilation (a breathing machine) because no eligible studies were found, so there is a no information on benefits or harmful effects.\" This sentence packs multiple ideas and repeats definitions, making it hard to follow.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We could not find any studies that tested dexmedetomidine, so we do not know whether it helps or harms newborns on a breathing machine.\"\n2. **Passive construction** – \"The evidence is up to date to September 2023 of search.\" Passive voice obscures who performed the search.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We searched for studies up to September 2023.\"\n3. **Unnecessary wordiness** – \"We are not confident in the evidence because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\" This repeats \"evidence\" and uses a long list of abstract terms.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We are not confident in the evidence because it does not include all the people, treatments, or outcomes we wanted, and there are too few studies to be sure of the results.\"\n4. **Long‑word density** – The metric report shows 176 long words (7+ characters), well above the typical PLS range (<122). Replacing many long words with shorter alternatives will improve readability (e.g., change \"mechanical ventilation\" to \"breathing machine\", \"administration\" to \"giving\").\n5. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – Convert each heading into a question to guide the reader, for example:\n   * \"What did we find?\" instead of \"Results\"\n   * \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" instead of \"Limitations\"\n   * \"How current is the evidence?\" instead of \"Currency\"\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and make it clearer for patients. Overall, the draft meets the word‑count limit and is factually accurate, but the subheading format violation and the identified clarity issues prevent approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms to most PLS metrics (e.g., reading ease 38.75, grade level ~13.7) and falls within the typical percentile ranges, but it deviates on the long_words metric (176 vs typical <122), indicating excessive use of long words. Active voice and pronoun usage are good, but the subheading style requirement is not met, leading to a not approved judgment."
