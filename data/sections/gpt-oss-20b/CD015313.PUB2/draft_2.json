  "draft": "Do mucus‑thinning medicines (mucolytics) reduce flare‑ups and improve lung function in children with chronic wet cough conditions such as bronchiectasis?\n\nKey messages\n– We found one small study that gave children with non‑cystic‑fibrosis bronchiectasis a nebulised salty mist (hypertonic saline, a medicine that thins mucus) before chest physiotherapy. The study suggested fewer flare‑ups and better lung function, and no side‑effects were reported, but the evidence is very uncertain because the study was tiny and had several design problems.  \n– The review could not look at quality‑of‑life outcomes, and we found no studies of other mucolytics, oral forms, or use during an acute flare‑up.  \n– Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to test different mucolytic medicines, follow children for longer, and record quality of life and any harms.\n\nWhat is chronic suppurative lung disease in children and why does it matter?\nSome children have a long‑lasting lung problem that causes a wet, sticky cough. Doctors call this group of conditions “chronic suppurative lung disease” (CSLD). It includes:  \n– Bronchiectasis – the airways become widened and damaged, making it hard for mucus to be cleared.  \n– Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) – a persistent bacterial infection that keeps the airways inflamed.  \n\nThese conditions fill the lungs with thick mucus, which traps germs and leads to repeated flare‑ups (exacerbations). Each flare‑up can mean more doctor visits, antibiotics, missed school, and a lower quality of life. Current care usually involves chest physiotherapy (special breathing exercises) and antibiotics, but families and clinicians want more treatment options.\n\nWhat did the review authors aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving mucolytic medicines to children with CSLD can:  \n– Reduce the number of lung flare‑ups.  \n– Improve lung function (how well the lungs move air in and out).  \n– Enhance overall quality of life.  \n– Do so safely, without causing harmful side effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases and journal collections for randomised controlled trials that compared a mucolytic with no treatment in children with CSLD. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified a single randomised controlled trial that enrolled 52 children (average age 9.5 years, about 40 % male) with non‑cystic‑fibrosis bronchiectasis. The study compared nebulised 3 % hypertonic saline (a salty mist that thins mucus) given before chest physiotherapy with chest physiotherapy alone. We analysed only the first eight‑week treatment period.  \n\nThe study reported:  \n– A lower rate of flare‑ups: children receiving the saline had an average of 2.5 exacerbations per child‑year versus 7.8 in the control group.  \n– Better lung function: the increase in predicted FEV1 (the amount of air a child can force out in one second) was 14.1 % with saline versus 5.0 % with control; the increase in predicted FVC (the total amount of air exhaled after a deep breath) was 13.8 % versus 7.5 %.\n\nNo quality‑of‑life measures were collected, and the authors reported no dropouts due to adverse events. The trial had a high risk of bias because participants and staff knew which treatment was given, some data were missing, and outcome reporting was incomplete.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in these findings. The study was small, unblinded, and had missing data. It only examined one type of mucolytic, one delivery method (inhaled), and only during stable disease. We have no information on oral mucolytics, other inhaled agents, use during an acute flare‑up, or effects on quality of life.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nOur search covered studies published up to September 2024. No new eligible trials have been reported since then.\n\nWhat next?\nWe need larger, multi‑centre randomised trials that test different mucolytic medicines, follow children for longer periods, and include quality‑of‑life and safety outcomes. Only such evidence can tell us whether regular mucolytic therapy truly benefits children with chronic wet cough conditions.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required structural checks, but three key clarity problems remain that could confuse patients:\n1. **Unexplained technical terms** – The sentence \"the increase in predicted FEV1 (the amount of air a child can force out in one second) was 14.1 % with saline versus 5.0 % with control; the increase in predicted FVC (the total amount of air exhaled after a deep breath) was 13.8 % versus 7.5 %\" uses the abbreviations FEV1 and FVC without clear lay definitions. Patients may not understand what these lung‑function measures represent.\n   *Rewrite:* \"The amount of air a child could force out in one second (called FEV1) improved by 14.1 % with the salty mist, compared with a 5.0 % improvement without it. The total amount of air a child could exhale after a deep breath (called FVC) improved by 13.8 % versus 7.5 %.\"\n2. **Passive‑voice construction** – The sentence \"No quality‑of‑life measures were collected\" hides who did the action and adds unnecessary distance.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We did not collect any quality‑of‑life measures.\"\n3. **Long, noun‑heavy sentence** – \"We identified a single randomised controlled trial that enrolled 52 children (average age 9.5 years, about 40 % male) with non‑cystic‑fibrosis bronchiectasis, a type of chronic suppurative lung disease.\" packs many details into one clause, making it hard to follow.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We found one randomised controlled trial. It enrolled 52 children with non‑cystic‑fibrosis bronchiectasis. The children were on average 9.5 years old, and about 40 % were boys. This condition is a form of chronic suppurative lung disease.\"\nThese three issues are the most likely to hinder patient understanding. The PLS evaluation also flags a high number of passive constructions (22, P90), an excessive noun count (203, BEYOND_P90), and many complex/long words (complex_words_dc = 305, complex_words = 142, long_words = 186, all beyond typical ranges). Reducing passive voice, simplifying noun‑heavy phrasing, and replacing technical jargon with plain explanations will bring the summary in line with Cochrane plain‑language standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (e.g., Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 57, Grade ≈ 10). However, it deviates on several key metrics: passive_voice (22, P90), nouns (203, BEYOND_P90), complex_words_dc (305, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (142, P90), long_words (186, P90) and smog_index (13.95, P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun density, and technical vocabulary, supporting the need for the clarity improvements noted above."
