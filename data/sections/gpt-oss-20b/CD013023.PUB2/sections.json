  "key_messages": [
    "Current research does not show that using special dressings or securement devices (products that cover the insertion site or hold the tube in place) clearly reduces the chance that a peripheral arterial catheter (a thin tube placed in an artery) fails or leads to a catheter‑related bloodstream infection (an infection that can spread through the blood); no additional harmful effects were reported.",
    "The few studies that compared different products—such as polyurethane dressings with tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane dressings, sutureless securement devices, and integrated securement dressings—found little or no difference in outcomes, but the evidence is very uncertain because the trials were small and had methodological problems.",
    "Because the available trials are limited and of low quality, more well‑designed, larger studies are needed to determine whether any dressing or securement device truly improves catheter safety or reduces infections."

      "subheading": "Why are peripheral arterial catheters and their complications a concern?",
      "content": "In operating rooms and intensive‑care units, doctors often insert a thin tube called a peripheral arterial catheter (or AC) into an artery. This tube lets them take frequent blood samples and continuously monitor blood pressure, which is vital for patients who are very sick or undergoing surgery. However, these catheters can fail – they may become blocked, move out of place, or cause an infection that spreads into the bloodstream (known as a catheter‑related bloodstream infection, or CRBSI). When a catheter fails, it has to be taken out and a new one inserted, which is uncomfortable for the patient and increases the risk of further complications."

      "subheading": "What are dressings and securement devices, and how might they help?",
      "content": "To keep a catheter working and reduce the chance of it moving or becoming infected, hospitals use special dressings (sticky coverings) and securement devices (things that hold the tube in place). Some examples are:\n- Standard polyurethane (SPU) dressings, a common clear film that sticks to the skin.\n- Bordered polyurethane (BPU) dressings, which have an extra adhesive border for extra grip.\n- Tissue adhesive (TA), a medical glue that can be applied around the catheter.\n- Sutureless securement devices (SSD), small clips that lock the catheter to the skin without stitches.\n- Integrated securement dressings, which combine a dressing and a securement clip in one product.\nThese products are intended to keep the catheter stable, prevent it from being pulled out (dislodgement), reduce blockages (occlusion), and lower the risk of infection."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether any of these dressings or securement devices are better than others at preventing catheter failure and related complications in hospital patients. Specifically, they set out to compare the different products to see if they reduce the rates of catheter failure, bloodstream infection, dislodgement, blockage, and any adverse events."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified five randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,228 people who had a peripheral arterial catheter. The studies compared different dressing and securement methods – such as standard polyurethane dressings with tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane dressings, standard polyurethane dressings plus sutureless securement devices, and integrated securement dressings – against standard polyurethane dressings alone. The abstract does not give details about how long participants were followed, where the studies were done, who funded them, or the participants’ ages, genders or illness severity.\n\nThe review could not determine whether using these alternative dressings or securement devices changes the risk of catheter failure, bloodstream infection, catheter dislodgement, blockage, or any adverse events compared with standard polyurethane dressings. The available evidence is very uncertain, and any possible benefit or harm is likely to be small or nonexistent."

  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search."
