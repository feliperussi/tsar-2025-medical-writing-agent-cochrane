  "draft": "Do special dressings or tube‑holding devices (securement devices) lower the risk of failure or infection for artery catheters (thin tubes placed in an artery) in hospital patients?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Current research does not show that using special dressings or securement devices (products that cover the insertion site or hold the tube in place) clearly reduces the chance that a peripheral arterial catheter (a thin tube placed in an artery) fails or leads to a catheter‑related bloodstream infection (an infection that can spread through the blood); no additional harmful effects were reported.\n- The few studies that compared different products—such as polyurethane dressings with tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane dressings, sutureless securement devices, and integrated securement dressings—found little or no difference in outcomes, but the evidence is very uncertain because the trials were small and had methodological problems.\n- Because the available trials are limited and of low quality, more well‑designed, larger studies are needed to determine whether any dressing or securement device truly improves catheter safety or reduces infections.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy are peripheral arterial catheters and their complications a concern?\nIn operating rooms and intensive‑care units, doctors often insert a thin tube called a peripheral arterial catheter (or AC) into an artery. This tube lets them take frequent blood samples and continuously monitor blood pressure, which is vital for patients who are very sick or undergoing surgery. However, these catheters can fail – they may become blocked, move out of place, or cause an infection that spreads into the bloodstream (known as a catheter‑related bloodstream infection, or CRBSI). When a catheter fails, it has to be taken out and a new one inserted, which is uncomfortable for the patient and increases the risk of further complications.\n\nWhat are dressings and securement devices, and how might they help?\nTo keep a catheter working and reduce the chance of it moving or becoming infected, hospitals use special dressings (sticky coverings) and securement devices (things that hold the tube in place). Some examples are:\n- Standard polyurethane (SPU) dressings, a common clear film that sticks to the skin.\n- Bordered polyurethane (BPU) dressings, which have an extra adhesive border for extra grip.\n- Tissue adhesive (TA), a medical glue that can be applied around the catheter.\n- Sutureless securement devices (SSD), small clips that lock the catheter to the skin without stitches.\n- Integrated securement dressings, which combine a dressing and a securement clip in one product.\nThese products are intended to keep the catheter stable, prevent it from being pulled out (dislodgement), reduce blockages (occlusion), and lower the risk of infection.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether any of these dressings or securement devices are better than others at preventing catheter failure and related complications in hospital patients. Specifically, they set out to compare the different products to see if they reduce the rates of catheter failure, bloodstream infection, dislodgement, blockage, and any adverse events.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched multiple medical databases for studies comparing different dressing and securement devices for peripheral arterial catheters, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWe identified five randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,228 people who had a peripheral arterial catheter. The studies compared different dressing and securement methods – such as standard polyurethane dressings with tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane dressings, standard polyurethane dressings plus sutureless securement devices, and integrated securement dressings – against standard polyurethane dressings alone. The abstract does not give details about how long participants were followed, where the studies were done, who funded them, or the participants’ ages, genders or illness severity.\n\nThe review could not determine whether using these alternative dressings or securement devices changes the risk of catheter failure, bloodstream infection, catheter dislodgement, blockage, or any adverse events compared with standard polyurethane dressings. The available evidence is very uncertain, and any possible benefit or harm is likely to be small or nonexistent.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical style checks: all section subheadings are not phrased as questions, which the Master Style Guide requires (e.g., \"Why are peripheral arterial catheters a concern?\"). This alone makes the PLS non‑compliant. Additionally, the text contains several clarity problems: (1) very long sentences exceeding 30 words, such as the first key‑message bullet, making the main point hard to grasp; (2) excessive passive constructions (29 instances) and nominalisations (38 instances) that obscure who performed actions; (3) noun‑heavy paragraphs with 209 nouns, leading to dense, difficult‑to‑read prose. These issues are reflected in the metrics – words per sentence = 27.8 (beyond typical PLS), passive_voice = 29, nominalisation = 38, and a low Flesch Reading Ease of 31.7. To meet Cochrane PLS standards the draft needs to (a) rewrite every subheading as a question, (b) split long sentences into shorter, active‑voice statements, and (c) replace noun‑heavy phrases with verb‑based wording. Until these changes are made, the PLS cannot be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is 750 words (within limit) but deviates strongly from typical PLS patterns: 13 of 16 measured features are beyond the P90 percentile. Key deviations include words_per_sentence (27.8, BEYOND_P90), passive_voice (29, BEYOND_P90), nominalization (38, BEYOND_P90), nouns (209, BEYOND_P90), and low readability scores (Flesch Reading Ease 31.7, FKGL 15.7). These metrics confirm the editorial observations of overly long, passive, noun‑heavy sentences and the need for substantial simplification."
