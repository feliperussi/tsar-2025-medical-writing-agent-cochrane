  "draft": "Do skin‑applied insect repellents (topical repellents) prevent malaria?\n\nKey messages\n– Applying skin‑applied insect repellents may slightly reduce new malaria infections and illness, but the evidence is limited.  \n– The possible benefit was seen mainly in high‑risk groups such as refugees who lack other mosquito‑control tools.  \n– The products appear safe; about 0.6 % of users (roughly 1 in 200) reported mild skin irritation and no serious harms were reported.\n\nWhat is malaria and how is it usually prevented?  \nMalaria is caused by tiny parasites (mainly *Plasmodium falciparum*) that enter people when an infected mosquito bites them. The disease is common in many tropical regions and can be severe, especially for children and pregnant women. The main ways to stop mosquito bites are:  \n– Long‑lasting insecticide‑treated nets (LLINs) – bed nets coated with insecticide that stay effective after many washes.  \n– Indoor residual spraying (IRS) – spraying insecticide on interior walls to kill mosquitoes that rest indoors.  \nThese methods work best when mosquitoes bite and rest inside homes. They do not protect people who are outdoors at night, work in forests, or live in places without nets or spraying, such as refugee camps or military bases. Topical repellents – creams, lotions, or sprays applied to the skin – could fill this protection gap.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether applying topical repellents, alone or together with LLINs and/or IRS, reduces the number of new malaria infections. We looked at both high‑risk groups (refugees, forest workers, military personnel) and the general population in malaria‑endemic areas. We also examined whether the repellents cause any side‑effects.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched major medical databases and trial registries up to 11 January 2023. We included randomized and cluster‑randomized trials that tested repellents proven to keep mosquitoes away. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results in meta‑analyses and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eight trials reported in 13 articles. Six trials (about 61 000 participants) provided data for meta‑analysis. The combined results hinted at a small drop in the number of people who got infected, but when we looked at infection and illness separately, the findings did not line up. The evidence is of low certainty, meaning we have limited confidence in the size of the effect. Adverse events were rare; only 0.6 % of users experienced mild skin reactions, and no serious harms were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany studies did not blind participants, so people knew whether they used repellent, which could influence results. Some trials lacked complete data on the outcomes we wanted. Because of these issues, the overall certainty of the evidence is low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence base is up to date with searches completed in January 2023.",
