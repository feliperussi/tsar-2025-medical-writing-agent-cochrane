    "Topical insect repellents applied to the skin may lead to a small reduction in new malaria infections and illness, but the evidence is limited and not strong; the products appear safe, with very few mild skin reactions and no serious harms reported.",
    "A possible benefit was observed mainly in high‑risk groups such as refugees who do not have access to other mosquito‑control measures.",
    "More large, well‑designed studies are needed—especially in high‑risk settings and using individual‑level designs—to determine whether topical repellents provide meaningful personal protection and how they affect overall malaria transmission."

      "subheading": "Why is malaria a problem and how is it usually prevented?",
      "content": "Malaria is a disease caused by tiny parasites (mainly Plasmodium falciparum) that are spread to people when an infected mosquito bites them. In many parts of the world the disease is common and can lead to severe illness or death, especially in children and pregnant women. The main ways to stop mosquitoes from biting people are:\n\n* **Long‑lasting insecticide‑treated nets (LLINs)** – bed nets that are coated with insecticide and stay effective for many washes, so people can sleep under them safely.\n* **Indoor residual spraying (IRS)** – spraying the inside walls of homes with insecticide, which kills mosquitoes that rest indoors.\n\nThese methods work well when mosquitoes prefer to bite and rest inside homes. However, they do not protect people who are outdoors at night, work in the forest, or live in places where the usual measures are not available (for example, refugee camps or military bases). This leaves a \"gap\" in protection that could keep malaria transmission going.\n\nOne possible way to fill that gap is the use of **topical repellents** – creams, lotions, or sprays that are applied to the skin and make it harder for mosquitoes to land and bite. They could be especially useful for groups that are not well covered by nets or indoor spraying."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to determine whether applying topical repellents, either by themselves or together with existing measures such as LLINs and/or IRS, can lower the number of new malaria infections. They wanted to see if these repellents work for people who are at high risk of getting malaria (for example, refugees, forest workers, or deployed military personnel) as well as for people in the general population living in malaria‑endemic areas. The review also looked at whether the repellents cause any side‑effects."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review identified eight trials (reported in 13 articles) that evaluated topical mosquito repellents for malaria prevention. Across the six trials that contributed data to the meta‑analysis, about 61,000 participants were enrolled, with individual trial sample sizes ranging from roughly 12,000 to nearly 49,000. The studies included high‑risk groups such as refugees living in camps, forest‑going populations, and deployed military personnel, as well as broader community populations. All trials were conducted in malaria‑endemic settings; specific countries were not listed, although two trials took place in refugee camps. The intervention was the application of topical repellents, either alone or together with standard vector‑control measures (long‑lasting insecticide‑treated nets and/or indoor residual spraying), compared with no repellent (or standard control). The abstract did not provide details on participants’ age, gender, disease severity, duration of follow‑up, or funding sources."

      "subheading": "Main results: Effect on malaria infection and disease",
      "content": "Topical repellents may reduce malaria infection and clinical cases slightly, but the evidence is uncertain. When considered alone, topical repellents may make it little to no difference to malaria infection rates and to clinical malaria case rates. They may reduce the proportion of people infected with malaria slightly, but the certainty of this effect is low. Adverse events appear to be rare, with only a very small number of mild skin reactions (about 1 in 200 users)."
