  "draft": "Do skin‑applied insect repellents (topical repellents) prevent malaria?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– Applying skin‑applied insect repellents may lower new malaria infections and illness a little, but the evidence is limited and not strong.  \n– The possible benefit appears mainly in high‑risk groups such as refugees who lack other mosquito‑control tools.  \n– The products seem safe; only about 0.6 % of users (roughly 1 in 200) reported mild skin irritation, and no serious harms were reported.\n\nWhat is malaria and how is it usually prevented?  \nMalaria is caused by tiny parasites, mainly *Plasmodium falciparum*, that enter people when an infected mosquito bites them. The disease is common in many tropical regions and can be severe, especially for children and pregnant women. The main ways to stop mosquito bites are:  \n– Long‑lasting insecticide‑treated nets (LLINs) – bed nets that stay effective after many washes.  \n– Indoor residual spraying (IRS) – applying insecticide to interior walls to kill resting mosquitoes.  \nThese methods work best when mosquitoes bite and rest indoors. They do not protect people who are outdoors at night, work in forests, or live in places without nets or spraying, such as refugee camps or military bases. Topical repellents – creams, lotions, or sprays applied to the skin – could fill this protection gap.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether using topical repellents, alone or together with LLINs and/or IRS, reduces the number of new malaria infections. We looked at both high‑risk groups (refugees, forest workers, military personnel) and the general population in malaria‑endemic areas. We also examined whether the repellents cause any side‑effects.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched major medical databases and trial registries up to 11 January 2023. We included randomized and cluster‑randomized trials that tested repellents proven to keep mosquitoes away. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We combined results in meta‑analyses and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eight trials reported in 13 articles. Six trials (about 61 000 participants) provided data for meta‑analysis. The studies included refugees, forest‑going populations, military personnel, and broader community groups. Compared with no repellent, topical repellents may slightly reduce malaria infection and clinical disease, but the confidence in this effect is low. The pooled estimate suggested a modest reduction in infection rates, but results were not consistent when infection and disease were examined separately. Adverse events were rare; only 0.6 % of users experienced mild skin reactions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany studies did not blind participants, so people knew whether they used repellent, which could influence results. Some trials lacked complete data on outcomes we wanted to assess. Overall, the low certainty of the evidence means we have little confidence in the effect size.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence base is up to date with searches completed in January 2023.",

The phrase is vague (“a little”) and repeats the idea of limited evidence; a more direct version is \"Applying skin‑applied insect repellents may slightly reduce new malaria infections and illness, but the evidence is limited.\" These issues, together with the metric report showing higher than typical scores for Dale‑Chall readability, complex words (DC) and overall complex words, indicate the draft needs simplification before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to most typical patterns (77.8% of features in the best quartile). However, three metrics deviate: dale_chall_readability (8.24, P90), complex_words_dc (242, P90) and complex_words (116, P90), indicating the text uses more difficult and unfamiliar words than usual for a plain‑language summary. Reducing these will improve readability."
