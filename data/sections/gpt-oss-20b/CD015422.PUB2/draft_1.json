  "draft": "Do skin-applied insect repellents (topical repellents) prevent malaria?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Topical insect repellents applied to the skin may lead to a small reduction in new malaria infections and illness, but the evidence is limited and not strong; the products appear safe, with very few mild skin reactions and no serious harms reported.\n- A possible benefit was observed mainly in high‑risk groups such as refugees who do not have access to other mosquito‑control measures.\n- More large, well‑designed studies are needed—especially in high‑risk settings and using individual‑level designs—to determine whether topical repellents provide meaningful personal protection and how they affect overall malaria transmission.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is malaria a problem and how is it usually prevented?\nMalaria is a disease caused by tiny parasites (mainly Plasmodium falciparum) that are spread to people when an infected mosquito bites them. In many parts of the world the disease is common and can lead to severe illness or death, especially in children and pregnant women. The main ways to stop mosquitoes from biting people are:\n* Long‑lasting insecticide‑treated nets (LLINs) – bed nets that are coated with insecticide and stay effective for many washes, so people can sleep under them safely.\n* Indoor residual spraying (IRS) – spraying the inside walls of homes with insecticide, which kills mosquitoes that rest indoors.\nThese methods work well when mosquitoes prefer to bite and rest inside homes. However, they do not protect people who are outdoors at night, work in the forest, or live in places where the usual measures are not available (for example, refugee camps or military bases). This leaves a \"gap\" in protection that could keep malaria transmission going.\nOne possible way to fill that gap is the use of topical repellents – creams, lotions, or sprays that are applied to the skin and make it harder for mosquitoes to land and bite. They could be especially useful for groups that are not well covered by nets or indoor spraying.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors set out to determine whether applying topical repellents, either by themselves or together with existing measures such as LLINs and/or IRS, can lower the number of new malaria infections. They wanted to see if these repellents work for people who are at high risk of getting malaria (for example, refugees, forest workers, or deployed military personnel) as well as for people in the general population living in malaria‑endemic areas. The review also looked at whether the repellents cause any side‑effects.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that evaluated topical repellents for preventing malaria in endemic populations (including high‑risk groups), combined their findings in meta‑analyses, and assessed the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE framework of evidence certainty.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review identified eight trials (reported in 13 articles) that evaluated topical mosquito repellents for malaria prevention. Across the six trials that contributed data to the meta‑analysis, about 61,000 participants were enrolled, with individual trial sample sizes ranging from roughly 12,000 to nearly 49,000. The studies included high‑risk groups such as refugees living in camps, forest‑going populations, and deployed military personnel, as well as broader community populations. All trials were conducted in malaria‑endemic settings; specific countries were not listed, although two trials took place in refugee camps. The intervention was the application of topical repellents, either alone or together with standard vector‑control measures (long‑lasting insecticide‑treated nets and/or indoor residual spraying), compared with no repellent (or standard control). The abstract did not provide details on participants’ age, gender, disease severity, duration of follow‑up, or funding sources.\n\nMain results: Effect on malaria infection and disease\nTopical repellents may reduce malaria infection and clinical cases slightly, but the evidence is uncertain. When considered alone, topical repellents may make it little to no difference to malaria infection rates and to clinical malaria case rates. They may reduce the proportion of people infected with malaria slightly, but the certainty of this effect is low. Adverse events appear to be rare, with only a very small number of mild skin reactions (about 1 in 200 users).\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search.",

Sections such as \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are presented as statements rather than questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. Additionally, the draft contains several clarity and style issues that would hinder patient understanding:\n1. **Passive voice** – e.g., \"The review identified eight trials…\" obscures who did the action.\n2. **Long, noun‑heavy sentences** – e.g., \"Across the six trials that contributed data to the meta‑analysis, about 61,000 participants were enrolled, with individual trial sample sizes ranging from roughly 12,000 to nearly 49,000.\" is difficult to follow.\n3. **Bullet formatting** – the key messages use commas instead of dashes, and there is inconsistent use of blank lines between headings and paragraphs.\n4. **Jargon without definition** – terms like \"incidence rate ratio (IRR)\" appear in the background but are not explained for a lay audience.\n5. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – readers benefit from headings that directly ask the question the paragraph answers.\nSuggested concrete rewrites are provided below for each issue. Metrics support these observations: the draft has 19 passive constructions (P90), 22 nominalizations (P90), and a very high noun count (217, BEYOND_P90), indicating a noun‑heavy, passive style that reduces readability. The readability indices (Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 11.2, SMOG 15.4) are higher than typical PLS values, confirming the need for shorter sentences and simpler words.",

Readability scores are relatively good (Flesch Reading Ease 52, P75) but still above the usual PLS range, indicating the text is more complex than typical patient‑focused summaries."
