  "draft": "Do different ways of arranging work shifts (shift work) improve sleep quality, increase sleep time, or reduce sleepiness for shift workers?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Changing shift patterns such as using forward rotation (where the order of shifts moves from morning to evening to night) or faster rotation (where workers change to a new shift more quickly) may reduce how sleepy workers feel during their shifts, but they do not appear to improve sleep quality or quantity, and faster rotation may slightly reduce total sleep time; limiting daily shift length to about 16 hours (the maximum length of each work period) can increase total sleep time and also reduce sleepiness, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Other adjustments, such as making shifts a few hours shorter, compressing workweeks, or spreading shifts out more, showed little or no effect on sleep quality, sleep duration, or sleepiness, but the evidence for these findings is very limited.\n- More well‑designed, larger randomised trials (studies where participants are assigned to groups by chance) are needed to determine which shift‑schedule changes reliably improve sleep and reduce sleepiness, especially over longer periods and in different types of shift work.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat problems do shift workers face with sleep and safety?\nMany jobs require people to work at times that do not match the normal day‑night cycle, such as night shifts or rotating schedules. This \"shift work\" often leads to not getting enough sleep or having poor‑quality sleep. When workers are sleepy, they are less alert, which can increase mistakes, accidents, and long‑term health problems. Employers sometimes try to improve sleep by changing how shifts are organised – for example, making shifts shorter, changing the direction of rotation (forward = morning‑afternoon‑night, backward = night‑afternoon‑morning), or limiting how many hours are worked in a day. These changes are called \"shift schedule adaptations\".\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about changing shift schedules?\nThe authors wanted to discover whether adapting shift schedules can improve three key outcomes for shift workers: (1) how good their sleep feels (sleep quality), (2) how many hours they actually sleep when they are off work (sleep duration), and (3) how sleepy they feel while they are on duty (sleepiness). To do this, they looked at studies that compared different ways of organising shifts – such as forward versus backward rotation, faster versus slower rotation, limiting shift length to 16 hours, shorter versus longer shifts, and more compressed versus more spread‑out workweeks – and measured the impact on sleep and alertness.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that examined how adapting shift schedules influences sleep quality, sleep duration, or sleepiness in shift workers; we combined and summarized the results, and we rated our confidence in the evidence using standard assessment criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 11 studies involving a total of 2,125 shift‑workers. The trials compared different shift‑schedule adaptations such as forward versus backward rotation, faster versus slower rotation, limiting daily shift length to 16 hours versus no limit, shorter (8–10 h) versus longer shifts, and more compressed versus more spread‑out schedules. One laboratory study was excluded from the effectiveness conclusions. The abstract did not give details on how long the interventions lasted, who funded the studies, the participants’ ages, genders, health status, or the countries where the research was carried out.\n\nMain results: Limiting shift length to 16 hours reduces sleepiness\nLimiting the daily shift length to 16 hours probably reduces sleepiness during shifts. This finding is more certain than the other schedule changes, which were judged to be very uncertain.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups, which means differences could be due to who was in each group; it is possible that participants knew which schedule they were getting and not all needed data were reported; the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the schedule changes; and the studies were very small with few participants, so we cannot be certain about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the section subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement (5.3 Structure). In addition, several clarity and readability issues were identified:\n1. **Long, dense sentences** – many sentences exceed 30 words, making them hard to follow (e.g., \"The review included 11 studies involving a total of 2,125 shift‑workers…\").\n2. **Noun‑heavy, complex wording** – the text contains a high proportion of nouns and complex words (metrics show 218 nouns (BEYOND_P90) and 308 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (BEYOND_P90)), which reduces readability.\n3. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as \"forward rotation\", \"faster rotation\", \"SMD\", and \"GRADE\" appear without simple definitions, potentially confusing lay readers.\n4. **Passive constructions** – although the active‑voice count is acceptable, the draft still includes passive phrasing that obscures who did what (e.g., \"One laboratory study was excluded from the effectiveness conclusions\").\n\nSuggested concrete rewrites:\n- Change subheadings to questions, e.g., \"What did the review find?\" instead of \"Results\".\n- Break long sentences into shorter ones, aiming for <22 words per sentence. Example rewrite: \"The review looked at 11 studies with a total of 2,125 shift‑workers. These studies compared different ways of organising shifts, such as forward versus backward rotation, faster versus slower rotation, and limiting daily shift length to 16 hours.\"\n- Replace noun‑heavy phrases with active verbs: \"We excluded one laboratory study from the effectiveness conclusions\" instead of \"One laboratory study was excluded…\".\n- Define jargon in plain language: \"forward rotation (changing from morning to afternoon to night shifts)\" and \"SMD (a statistical measure that shows the size of an effect)\".\n\nThese changes address the most impactful clarity problems and bring the draft into alignment with the style guide and typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit but deviates on several readability metrics: words per sentence (27.4, P90) exceeds the typical range; nouns (218, BEYOND_P90) and complex Dale‑Chall words (308, BEYOND_P90) are far above median levels; complex words (120, P90) and long words (195, P90) are also high. These metric deviations support the identified issues of long sentences, noun‑heavy language, and high lexical complexity."
