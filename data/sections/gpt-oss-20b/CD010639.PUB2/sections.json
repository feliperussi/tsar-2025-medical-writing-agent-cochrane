  "key_messages": [
    "Changing shift patterns such as using forward rotation (where the order of shifts moves from morning to evening to night) or faster rotation (where workers change to a new shift more quickly) may reduce how sleepy workers feel during their shifts, but they do not appear to improve sleep quality or quantity, and faster rotation may slightly reduce total sleep time; limiting daily shift length to about 16 hours (the maximum length of each work period) can increase total sleep time and also reduce sleepiness, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "Other adjustments, such as making shifts a few hours shorter, compressing workweeks, or spreading shifts out more, showed little or no effect on sleep quality, sleep duration, or sleepiness, but the evidence for these findings is very limited.",
    "More well‑designed, larger randomised trials (studies where participants are assigned to groups by chance) are needed to determine which shift‑schedule changes reliably improve sleep and reduce sleepiness, especially over longer periods and in different types of shift work."

      "subheading": "What problems do shift workers face with sleep and safety?",
      "content": "Many jobs require people to work at times that do not match the normal day‑night cycle, such as night shifts or rotating schedules. This \"shift work\" often leads to not getting enough sleep or having poor‑quality sleep. When workers are sleepy, they are less alert, which can increase mistakes, accidents, and long‑term health problems. Employers sometimes try to improve sleep by changing how shifts are organised – for example, making shifts shorter, changing the direction of rotation (forward = morning‑afternoon‑night, backward = night‑afternoon‑morning), or limiting how many hours are worked in a day. These changes are called \"shift schedule adaptations\"."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out about changing shift schedules?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to discover whether adapting shift schedules can improve three key outcomes for shift workers: (1) how good their sleep feels (sleep quality), (2) how many hours they actually sleep when they are off work (sleep duration), and (3) how sleepy they feel while they are on duty (sleepiness). To do this, they looked at studies that compared different ways of organising shifts – such as forward versus backward rotation, faster versus slower rotation, limiting shift length to 16 hours, shorter versus longer shifts, and more compressed versus more spread‑out workweeks – and measured the impact on sleep and alertness."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that examined how adapting shift schedules influences sleep quality, sleep duration, or sleepiness in shift workers; we combined and summarized the results, and we rated our confidence in the evidence using standard assessment criteria."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 11 studies involving a total of 2,125 shift‑workers. The trials compared different shift‑schedule adaptations such as forward versus backward rotation, faster versus slower rotation, limiting daily shift length to 16 hours versus no limit, shorter (8–10 h) versus longer shifts, and more compressed versus more spread‑out schedules. One laboratory study was excluded from the effectiveness conclusions. The abstract did not give details on how long the interventions lasted, who funded the studies, the participants’ ages, genders, health status, or the countries where the research was carried out."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Limiting shift length to 16 hours reduces sleepiness",
      "content": "Limiting the daily shift length to 16 hours probably reduces sleepiness during shifts. This finding is more certain than the other schedule changes, which were judged to be very uncertain."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because people in the studies were not randomly placed into the different treatment groups, which means differences could be due to who was in each group; it is possible that participants knew which schedule they were getting and not all needed data were reported; the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the schedule changes; and the studies were very small with few participants, so we cannot be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to April 2022 of search."
