  "draft": "Is giving back (re‑feeding) the stomach contents (gastric residuals) taken out during tube feeding better than discarding them for helping early‑born babies grow?\n\nKey messages\n- Re‑feeding gastric residuals (giving back the stomach contents taken out during tube feeding) appears to have little or no effect on key outcomes such as how quickly preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) regain their birth weight, the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious intestinal infection), death before leaving the hospital, the time needed to reach full enteral feeds, the number of days on parenteral nutrition (nutrition given through a vein), and growth at discharge; no clear increase in harmful effects was reported.\n- Only one small, unblinded trial involving 72 preterm infants was found, so the overall evidence is limited and does not allow firm conclusions about the benefits or risks of re‑feeding versus discarding gastric residuals.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed randomised trials that assess both short‑term and longer‑term outcomes, including safety and growth, to provide more reliable information for clinicians and families.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhat health challenges do preterm infants face with feeding?\nBabies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (preterm infants) often need help getting nutrition because their stomachs and digestive systems are not fully developed. In many neonatal intensive care units, these babies receive milk through a small tube that goes into their stomach. Nurses regularly check how much milk is left in the stomach after a feed—this is called a \"gastric residual.\" The practice is meant to guide when and how quickly to increase feeding. However, there is no agreement on what to do with the milk that is taken out: should it be given back to the baby (re‑feeding) or thrown away (discarding)? Re‑feeding might help digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones, and growth‑promoting substances, but it could also increase the risk of problems such as vomiting, a serious gut infection called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), or bloodstream infection (sepsis).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to discover about re‑feeding gastric residuals?\nThe review aimed to find out whether giving back the aspirated gastric residuals (re‑feeding) is more effective and safer than discarding them in preterm infants. Specifically, the authors wanted to compare the two approaches on important outcomes such as how quickly babies regain their birth weight, the risk of NEC or intestinal perforation, overall death before leaving the hospital, the time needed to reach full enteral feeding (feeding through the gut), the number of days infants need nutrition through an IV (parenteral nutrition), and growth status at discharge.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified one small, unmasked randomised trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants in a neonatal intensive‑care setting. The study compared two feeding‑residual strategies: re‑feeding gastric residuals versus discarding them. No details were given about the study’s duration, funding, country, or the infants’ exact ages, gender or severity beyond prematurity. The findings suggest that re‑feeding gastric residuals probably makes little or no difference to a range of important outcomes, including the time it takes babies to regain their birth weight, the risk of serious intestinal problems such as necrotising enterocolitis or intestinal perforation, the chance of dying before discharge, how quickly they reach full enteral feeding volumes, the number of days they need total parenteral nutrition, and the risk of extra‑uterine growth restriction at discharge. It is unclear whether re‑feeding affects the number of episodes where feeding is stopped for 12 hours or more.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",

Sections such as \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are presented as statements, not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text contains several clarity and style problems that would hinder a patient’s understanding:\n1. **Long, complex sentence** – \"We identified one small, unmasked randomised trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants in a neonatal intensive‑care setting. The study compared two feeding‑residual strategies: re‑feeding gastric residuals versus discarding them. No details were given about the study’s duration, funding, country, or the infants’ exact ages, gender or severity beyond prematurity.\" This 45‑word sentence overloads the reader. *Rewrite*: \"We found one small, unmasked trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants. The trial compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals. The report did not give details about the study’s length, funding, country, or the infants’ exact ages or gender.\"\n2. **Passive voice** – \"The findings suggest that re‑feeding gastric residuals probably makes little or no difference to a range of important outcomes...\" Passive constructions hide who performed the action. *Rewrite*: \"Our findings show that re‑feeding gastric residuals probably makes little or no difference to important outcomes...\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – \"the number of days infants need nutrition through an IV (parenteral nutrition)\" uses several nouns in a row. *Rewrite*: \"the number of days infants need IV nutrition (parenteral nutrition)\"\n4. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – The sections are labelled with nouns (e.g., \"Methods\"). According to the style guide they should be questions. *Rewrite examples*: \"How did we find the studies?\" for Methods, \"What did we find?\" for Results, \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" for Limitations, and \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\" for Currency.\nThese changes address the most confusing elements for readers and bring the draft closer to the required style.\n\nMetrics support these suggestions: the draft has a very high words_per_sentence score (30.36, BEYOND_P90) indicating overly long sentences; passive_voice is 23 (P90) and nominalization 25 (P90), showing excessive passive and noun‑based constructions; complex_words (137, P90) and long_words (219, BEYOND_P90) confirm heavy vocabulary. Reducing sentence length, active voice, and noun density will improve readability scores toward typical PLS ranges.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit but deviates from typical PLS patterns on many metrics: words per sentence (30.36, BEYOND_P90), passive voice (23, P90), nominalizations (25, P90), nouns (190, P90), and readability indices (FKGL 15.05, GFI 20.35, SMOG 13.86, all P90). These indicate the text is longer, more passive, and more complex than usual PLS, supporting the need for shorter, active, and clearer phrasing."
