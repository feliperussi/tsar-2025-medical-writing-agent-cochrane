  "draft": "Does giving back stomach contents (re‑feeding) help preterm babies grow better than discarding them?\n\nKey messages\n– Re‑feeding gastric residuals (giving back the stomach contents taken out during tube feeding) probably makes little or no difference to how quickly preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) regain their birth weight, the risk of serious gut infection called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), death before leaving the hospital, the time needed to reach full enteral feeds (≥120 mL/kg / day), the number of days they need nutrition through a vein (parenteral nutrition), or growth at discharge.  \n– The evidence comes from one small, open‑label trial (researchers and families knew which babies were re‑fed or had the residuals discarded) that enrolled 72 infants, so we have low confidence in these results.  \n– Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to confirm whether re‑feeding is truly safe and effective.\n\nWhat feeding problems do preterm infants face?  \nBabies born before 37 weeks often cannot feed by mouth because their stomachs and digestive systems are immature. In many neonatal intensive‑care units they receive milk through a thin tube that goes into the stomach. Nurses regularly check how much milk remains after a feed – the “gastric residual.” This check helps decide when to increase feeding volumes. Clinicians disagree about whether to give the residual back to the baby (re‑feeding) or to discard it. Re‑feeding might help digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones and growth‑promoting substances, but it could also increase the risk of vomiting, NEC or bloodstream infection (sepsis).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether re‑feeding gastric residuals is more effective and safer than discarding them for preterm infants. We compared the two approaches on outcomes such as time to regain birth weight, risk of NEC or intestinal perforation, overall death before discharge, time to reach full enteral feeds, days on parenteral nutrition, and growth status at discharge.\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases in February 2022. We also screened trial registries, conference reports and reference lists for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Two reviewers independently screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified one eligible trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants in a NICU. The trial was open‑label (researchers and families knew which babies were re‑fed or had the residuals discarded) but otherwise well conducted. Compared with discarding, re‑feeding probably made little or no difference to:  \n\n– Time to regain birth weight (mean difference 0.4 days; low‑certainty evidence)  \n– Risk of NEC stage ≥ 2 or spontaneous intestinal perforation (risk ratio 0.71; low‑certainty)  \n– All‑cause mortality before discharge (risk ratio 0.50; low‑certainty)  \n– Time to reach full enteral feeds (mean difference ‑1.3 days; low‑certainty)  \n– Total days on parenteral nutrition (mean difference ‑0.3 days; low‑certainty)  \n– Risk of extra‑uterine growth restriction at discharge (extra‑uterine growth restriction means a baby’s growth is slower than expected for their age) (risk ratio 1.29; low‑certainty)  \n\nWe are uncertain about the effect on the number of episodes where feeding was stopped for ≥ 12 hours (very low‑certainty evidence).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the findings because the single trial was small and not blinded, which may have introduced bias. The limited sample size prevents firm conclusions about benefits or harms.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe last searched for studies in February 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the mandatory checks (all required sections are present, subheadings are phrased as questions, facts match the source, and word count is under 850). However, several clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Over‑long, dense key‑message bullet** – the first bullet packs many outcomes into one 45‑word sentence, making it hard to follow. *Problem*: Readers may lose track of which outcome is being described. *Rewrite*: \"Re‑feeding gastric residuals probably makes little or no difference to:\n   - how quickly babies regain their birth weight,\n   - the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC),\n   - death before leaving the hospital,\n   - the time needed to reach full feeds (≥120 mL/kg / day),\n   - the number of days they need nutrition through a vein (parenteral nutrition),\n   - and growth at discharge.\"\n2. **Technical terms not immediately explained** – terms such as “parenteral nutrition”, “extra‑uterine growth restriction”, and the phrase “low‑certainty evidence” appear without plain‑language definitions. *Problem*: Readers unfamiliar with medical jargon may not understand what these outcomes mean. *Rewrite*: Introduce brief definitions the first time they appear, e.g., \"parenteral nutrition (nutrition given through a vein)\" and \"extra‑uterine growth restriction (slower‑than‑expected growth while in hospital)\". Replace “low‑certainty evidence” with “we have limited confidence in this result because it comes from only one small study”.\n3. **High use of passive voice and nominalisations** – sentences like “The trial was open‑label …” and “The evidence is up to date to February 2022” obscure who performed the actions. *Problem*: Passive constructions make the text feel detached and harder to read. *Rewrite*: Use active voice – \"We conducted the trial without blinding (researchers and families knew which babies were re‑fed or had the residuals discarded) but otherwise followed good methods.\" and \"We last searched for studies in February 2022.\"\n4. **Very long sentences (>30 words)** – e.g., the opening sentence of the background paragraph runs 38 words. *Problem*: Long sentences tax reading stamina and reduce comprehension. *Rewrite*: Split into two sentences – \"Babies born before 37 weeks often cannot feed by mouth because their stomachs and digestive systems are immature. In many neonatal intensive‑care units they receive milk through a thin tube that goes into the stomach.\"\n5. **Unexplained abbreviation “NEC”** – although defined once, later mentions omit the definition. *Problem*: Readers may forget the meaning. *Rewrite*: Keep the definition on first use and add a reminder later, e.g., \"the risk of necrotising (NEC), a serious gut infection\".\nThese issues are reflected in the metric report: passive voice (19, P90), nominalisations (25, P90), complex words (129, P90), long words (169, P90) and especially complex‑word‑density (278, BEYOND_P90). Reducing these will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns and improve readability for patients. Overall, the draft needs the above revisions before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on word count and overall readability (Flesch reading ease 64, P75) but shows high deviation in several linguistic features: passive voice (19 instances, P90), nominalisation (25, P90), noun count (174, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.2, P90), complex words (129, P90), long words (169, P90) and especially complex‑word‑density (278, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need to simplify language, increase active voice, and reduce jargon."
