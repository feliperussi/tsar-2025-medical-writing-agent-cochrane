  "draft": "Is giving back (re‑feeding) the stomach contents (gastric residuals) taken out during tube feeding better than discarding them for helping early‑born babies grow?\n\nKey messages\n– Re‑feeding gastric residuals probably makes little or no difference to how quickly preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) regain their birth weight, the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious gut infection), death before hospital discharge, the time needed to reach full enteral feeds, the number of days on parenteral nutrition (nutrition given through a vein), and growth at discharge.  \n– The evidence comes from one small, unblinded randomised trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants, so we have limited confidence in these results.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to confirm whether re‑feeding is truly safe and effective.\n\nWhat health challenges do preterm infants face with feeding?  \nBabies born before 37 weeks often cannot feed by mouth because their stomachs and digestive systems are immature. In many neonatal intensive‑care units they receive milk through a small tube that goes into the stomach. Nurses regularly check how much milk remains in the stomach after a feed – this is called a gastric residual. The practice is meant to guide when and how quickly to increase feeding. However, clinicians disagree about what to do with the removed milk: give it back (re‑feeding) or discard it. Re‑feeding might help digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones, and growth‑promoting substances, but it could also increase the risk of vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis, or bloodstream infection (sepsis).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to discover about re‑feeding gastric residuals?  \nWe aimed to find out whether giving back the aspirated gastric residuals is more effective and safer than discarding them in preterm infants. We focused on outcomes such as time to regain birth weight, risk of necrotising enterocolitis or intestinal perforation, overall death before discharge, time to reach full enteral feeding (≥120 mL kg⁻¹ day⁻¹), number of days on total parenteral nutrition, and growth status at discharge.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched Cochrane CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. We also checked trial registries, conference proceedings, and reference lists. Two reviewers screened studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data in duplicate. We combined results where possible and rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified one eligible trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants in a neonatal intensive‑care setting. The trial compared re‑feeding gastric residuals with discarding them. The study was unmasked (participants and staff knew the assigned treatment) but otherwise well conducted. The results suggest that re‑feeding probably makes little or no difference to:\n– time to regain birth weight,\n– risk of necrotising enterocolitis or spontaneous intestinal perforation,\n– all‑cause mortality before discharge,\n– time to reach full enteral feeds,\n– total days of parenteral nutrition,\n– risk of extra‑uterine growth restriction at discharge.  \nThe trial did not show a clear effect on the number of feeding interruptions lasting 12 hours or more.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the findings because the trial was small and unblinded, which could introduce bias. The single study provides low‑certainty evidence for all outcomes.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe searches were last run in February 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

The main deviations are higher nominalizations, noun count, and complex‑word measures, reflecting a noun‑heavy style, but these do not impede understanding. Minor style tweaks could further improve clarity, yet the summary is clear and suitable for patients."
