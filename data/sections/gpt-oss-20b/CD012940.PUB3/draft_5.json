  "draft": "Is giving back (re‑feeding) the stomach contents (gastric residuals) taken out during tube feeding better than discarding them for helping early‑born babies grow?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \nOur main take‑aways are:  \n– Re‑feeding gastric residuals probably makes little or no difference to how fast preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) regain their birth weight, the risk of serious gut infection called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), death before leaving the hospital, the time needed to reach full enteral feeds (≥120 mL/kg/day), the number of days they need nutrition through a vein (parenteral nutrition), or growth at discharge.  \n– The evidence comes from one small open‑label trial that enrolled 72 infants, so we have low confidence in these results.  \n– Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to confirm whether re‑feeding is truly safe and effective.\n\nWhat health challenges do preterm infants face with feeding?  \nBabies born before 37 weeks often cannot feed by mouth because their stomachs and digestive systems are immature. In many special baby care units (NICUs) they receive milk through a thin tube that goes into the stomach. Nurses regularly check how much milk is left after a feed – the “gastric residual.” This check helps decide when to increase feeding volumes. Clinicians disagree about whether to give the residual back to the baby (re‑feeding) or to discard it. Re‑feeding might help digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones and growth‑promoting substances, but it could also increase the risk of vomiting, NEC or bloodstream infection (sepsis).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to discover about re‑feeding gastric residuals?  \nWe wanted to know whether re‑feeding gastric residuals is more effective and safer than discarding them for preterm infants. We compared the two approaches on outcomes such as time to regain birth weight, risk of NEC or intestinal perforation, overall death before discharge, time to reach full enteral feeds, days on parenteral nutrition, and growth status at discharge.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases in February 2022. We also screened trial registries, conference reports and reference lists for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Two reviewers independently screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified one eligible trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants in a NICU. The trial was open‑label but otherwise well conducted. Compared with discarding, re‑feeding gastric residuals probably made little or no difference to:  \n\n– Time to regain birth weight (mean difference 0.4 days; low‑certainty evidence)  \n– Risk of NEC stage ≥ 2 or spontaneous intestinal perforation (risk ratio 0.71; low‑certainty)  \n– All‑cause mortality before discharge (risk ratio 0.50; low‑certainty)  \n– Time to reach full enteral feeds (≥120 mL/kg/day) (mean difference ‑1.30 days; low‑certainty)  \n– Total days on parenteral nutrition (mean difference ‑0.3 days; low‑certainty)  \n– Risk of extra‑uterine growth restriction at discharge (risk ratio 1.29; low‑certainty)  \n\nWe are uncertain about the effect on the number of episodes where feeding was stopped for ≥ 12 hours (very low‑certainty evidence).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the findings because the single trial was small and not blinded, which may have introduced bias. The limited sample size prevents firm conclusions about benefits or harms.\n\nHow up to date is this review?  \nWe last searched in February 2022.",

Readability scores are good (Flesch‑Reading Ease 67, grade ~9), but the high noun and nominalisation counts indicate the text is still noun‑heavy, supporting the need to rewrite sentences into more active, verb‑focused language."
