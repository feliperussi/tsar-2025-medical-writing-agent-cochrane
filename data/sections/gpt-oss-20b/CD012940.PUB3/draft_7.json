  "draft": "Is giving back (re‑feeding) the stomach contents (gastric residuals) taken out during tube feeding better than discarding them for helping early‑born babies grow?\n\nKey messages\n– Re‑feeding gastric residuals probably makes little or no difference to:\n   – how quickly babies regain their birth weight,\n   – the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gut infection,\n   – death before leaving the hospital,\n   – the time needed to reach full feeds (≥120 mL/kg / day),\n   – the number of days they need nutrition given through a vein (parenteral nutrition),\n   – and growth at discharge (extra‑uterine growth restriction, meaning slower‑than‑expected growth while in hospital).\n– The evidence comes from one small, unblinded trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants, so we have limited confidence in these results.\n– Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to confirm whether re‑feeding is truly safe and effective.\n\nWhat health challenges do preterm infants face with feeding?\nBabies born before 37 weeks often cannot feed by mouth because their stomachs and digestive systems are immature. In many neonatal intensive‑care units they receive milk through a thin tube that goes into the stomach. Nurses regularly check how much milk remains after a feed – the “gastric residual.” This check helps decide when to increase feeding volumes. Clinicians disagree about whether to give the residual back to the baby (re‑feeding) or to discard it. Re‑feeding might help digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones and growth‑promoting substances, but it could also increase the risk of vomiting, NEC, or bloodstream infection (sepsis).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving back the aspirated gastric residuals (re‑feeding) is more effective and safer than discarding them for preterm infants. We compared the two approaches on outcomes such as time to regain birth weight, risk of NEC or intestinal perforation, death before discharge, time to reach full enteral feeding, days on parenteral nutrition, and growth status at discharge.\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases in February 2022. We also screened trial registries, conference reports and reference lists. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified one eligible randomised trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants in a neonatal intensive‑care setting. The researchers did not blind participants, but they followed good methods. Compared with discarding, re‑feeding probably made little or no difference to:\n– time to regain birth weight (average 0.4 days longer),\n– risk of NEC stage ≥ 2 or spontaneous intestinal perforation (risk ratio 0.71),\n– all‑cause mortality before discharge (risk ratio 0.50),\n– time to reach full enteral feeds (average 1.3 days sooner),\n– total days on parenteral nutrition (average 0.3 days fewer),\n– risk of extra‑uterine growth restriction at discharge (risk ratio 1.29).\n\nWe are uncertain about the effect on the number of episodes where feeding was stopped for 12 hours or more because the evidence is very limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the findings because the single trial was small and not blinded, which may have introduced bias. The sample size does not allow firm conclusions about benefits or harms.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe last searched for studies in February 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because not all subheadings are phrased as questions – the \"Key messages\" heading is a statement, not a question. This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement. In addition, the text is heavy on nominalisations and noun‑dense phrasing (21 nominalisations, 162 nouns – both in the P90 range) and contains many unfamiliar or long words (dale‑chall score 8.26, complex_words_dc 260 – also P90). These features reduce readability for a lay audience.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Subheading format – Change \"Key messages\" to a question, e.g., \"What are the main findings?\".\n2. Reduce nominalisations – Replace noun‑heavy phrases with verbs. Example: original \"The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.\" Rewrite as \"We searched for studies in February 2022.\".\n3. Simplify complex/long words – Replace terms like \"extra‑uterine growth restriction\" with \"slower growth while in hospital\" (already partly done, but ensure consistency) and avoid words such as \"unblinded\" by saying \"the trial did not hide the treatment from participants\".\n4. Cut down on unfamiliar words – Use everyday language for \"parenteral nutrition\" (already defined) and avoid overly technical phrasing.\n5. Break up dense bullet list – Split the long bullet list under the results into two shorter lists or add brief explanatory sentences to aid scanning.\n\nThese changes address the major clarity and style issues while also bringing the metrics (nominalisation, noun count, Dale‑Chall score, complex word count) back into the typical PLS range.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights four outlier metrics: nominalisation (21, P90), nouns (162, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.26, P90) and complex words (DC) (260, P90). These indicate the draft is more noun‑heavy and uses more unfamiliar, long words than typical Cochrane PLS texts, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
