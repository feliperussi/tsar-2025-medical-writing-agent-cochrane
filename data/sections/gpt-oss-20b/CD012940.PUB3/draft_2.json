  "draft": "Is giving back‑feeding (re‑feeding) the stomach contents (gastric residuals) taken out during tube feeding better than discarding them for helping early‑born babies grow?\n\nKey messages\n– Re‑feeding gastric residuals (giving back the stomach contents taken out during tube feeding) appears to have little or no effect on how quickly preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) regain their birth weight, on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious intestinal infection), on death before leaving the hospital, on the time needed to reach full enteral feeds, on the number of days they need IV nutrition (parenteral nutrition), and on growth at discharge; no clear increase in harmful effects was reported.  \n– Only one small, unblinded trial involving 72 preterm infants was found, so the overall evidence is limited and does not allow firm conclusions about the benefits or risks of re‑feeding versus discarding gastric residuals.  \n– Future research should include larger, well‑designed randomised trials that assess both short‑term and longer‑term outcomes, including safety and growth, to provide more reliable information for clinicians and families.\n\nWhat health challenges do preterm infants face with feeding?\nPreterm infants often have under‑developed stomachs and digestive systems. In many neonatal intensive‑care units they receive milk through a small tube that goes into the stomach. Nurses regularly check how much milk remains after a feed – this is called a gastric residual. The residual helps guide when and how quickly to increase feeding. However, clinicians disagree about whether to give the residual back to the baby (re‑feeding) or to discard it. Re‑feeding could aid digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones, and growth‑promoting substances, but it might also increase the risk of vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), or bloodstream infection (sepsis).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to discover about re‑feeding gastric residuals?\nWe aimed to find out whether re‑feeding aspirated gastric residuals is more effective and safer than discarding them in preterm infants. We focused on outcomes such as the speed of regaining birth weight, the risk of NEC or intestinal perforation, overall death before discharge, the time to reach full enteral feeding (feeding through the gut), the number of days infants need IV nutrition, and growth status at discharge.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\n\nWe searched major databases (Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL) and trial registers up to February 2022. We looked for randomised controlled trials that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Two reviewers screened records, assessed eligibility, and extracted data in duplicate. We combined results where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one small, unmasked trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants. The trial compared re‑feeding gastric residuals with discarding them. The report did not give details about the study’s length, funding, country, or the infants’ exact ages or gender. Our analysis shows that re‑feeding probably makes little or no difference to important outcomes, including time to regain birth weight, risk of NEC or intestinal perforation, chance of dying before discharge, time to reach full enteral feeds, number of days of IV nutrition, and risk of extra‑uterine growth restriction at discharge. The effect on the number of feeding interruptions lasting 12 hours or more remains uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the trial was unblinded (participants and staff knew the assigned treatment) and because it involved only a small number of infants. These factors increase the risk of bias and limit the reliability of the findings.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence base was searched up to February 2022, so the summary reflects all studies available at that time.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft passes the required completeness, title/subheading format, factual accuracy, and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a patient‑focused audience. \n\n1. **Overly long key‑messages sentence** – \"Re‑feeding gastric residuals (giving back the stomach contents taken out during tube feeding) appears to have little or no effect on key outcomes such as how quickly preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) regain their birth weight, the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious intestinal infection), death before leaving the hospital, the time needed to reach full enteral feeds, the number of days on parenteral nutrition (nutrition given through a vein), and growth at discharge; no clear increase in harmful effects was reported.\" This single sentence packs many ideas, uses many commas and a semicolon, and exceeds 30 words, making it hard to follow. **Rewrite:** Break it into a short introductory sentence followed by a bullet list:\n   - \"Re‑feeding gastric residuals appears to have little or no effect on:\n   - how quickly preterm infants (born before 37 weeks) regain their birth weight;\n   - the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious gut infection);\n   - death before hospital discharge;\n   - the time needed to reach full enteral feeds;\n   - the number of days on parenteral nutrition (nutrition given through a vein);\n   - growth at discharge. No clear increase in harmful effects was reported.\"\n\n2. **Unexplained jargon** – Terms such as \"parenteral nutrition\", \"enteral feeds\", and \"extra‑uterine growth restriction\" are used without plain‑language definitions. This can leave readers unsure what the interventions or outcomes mean. **Rewrite example:** \"parenteral nutrition (nutrition given through a vein)\" is already defined, but \"enteral feeds\" should be clarified as \"feeding through the gut (using a tube into the stomach)\" and \"extra‑uterine growth restriction\" as \"poor growth while the baby is in the hospital\".\n\n3. **Use of the word \"unmasked\"** – The draft says \"one small, unmasked trial\". \"Unmasked\" is a technical term that most readers will not recognise; the source uses \"unblinded\" which is clearer. **Rewrite:** \"one small, unblinded trial (where the staff and families knew which treatment was given)\".\n\nThese three issues alone would likely impede understanding for a lay audience. The PLS evaluation also flags high lexical complexity (complex_words_dc = 286, complex_words = 136, long_words = 204) and a high noun count (180), confirming that the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words. Reducing noun density and simplifying vocabulary would further improve readability.\n\n**Suggested priority edits**:\n- Break the long key‑messages sentence into shorter sentences and bullet points.\n- Add brief plain‑language definitions for all technical terms.\n- Replace \"unmasked\" with \"unblinded\" and add a short explanation.\n- Where possible, replace noun‑heavy phrases with active verbs (e.g., \"We found\" instead of \"The trial compared\").\n\nAddressing these points should bring the draft into line with Cochrane plain‑language standards and improve its suitability for patients and families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets length limits (631 words) and shows good active‑voice (87) and pronoun use (32). However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns in several lexical metrics: nouns (180 > median 116), SMOG (13.6 > 12.1), Dale‑Chall readability (8.24 > 7.7), complex_words_dc (286 >> 160), complex_words (136 >> 84) and long_words (204 >> 122). These indicate a noun‑heavy, high‑complexity text, supporting the need to simplify wording and reduce long, technical terms."
