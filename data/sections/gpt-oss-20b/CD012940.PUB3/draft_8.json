  "draft": "Is giving back the stomach contents (gastric residuals) taken out during tube feeding better than discarding them for helping early‑born babies grow?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n– Re‑feeding the stomach contents probably makes little or no difference to how fast babies regain their birth weight, the chance of a serious gut infection called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), death before leaving the hospital, the time needed to reach full feeds (≥120 mL per kg per day), the number of days they need nutrition given through a vein, and growth speed while in hospital.  \n– The evidence comes from one small trial that included 72 preterm infants and did not hide which treatment babies received, so we have limited confidence in these results.  \n– Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to confirm whether re‑feeding is truly safe and effective.\n\nWhat health challenges do preterm infants face with feeding?\nBabies born before 37 weeks often cannot feed by mouth because their stomachs and digestive systems...

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical completeness check: it does not include all required sections (Methods, Limitations, Currency) and therefore lacks the corresponding question‑style subheadings. While the title and two subheadings are present, the PLS is missing the standard sections that explain how the review was done, what the limitations are, and how up‑to‑date the evidence is. This omission prevents readers from understanding the scope and reliability of the findings. In addition, several clarity issues were identified: (1) the opening question is overly long and contains jargon (“gastric residuals”) without a simple definition; (2) the bullet‑point list contains sentences that exceed 30 words, making them hard to follow; (3) the phrase “the evidence comes from one small trial that... did not hide which treatment babies received” is passive and wordy, obscuring who performed the trial. Suggested rewrites: – Define “gastric residual” in plain language before using the term; – Break each bullet into shorter sentences (e.g., “Re‑feeding probably makes little or no difference to how quickly babies regain their birth weight.”); – Use active voice: “The trial was unblinded, so we have limited confidence in the results.” The PLS evaluation metrics support these observations: words_per_sentence is 35.8 (BEYOND_P90), indicating sentences are too long; passive_voice count is 9 (P25) but the draft still uses passive constructions that reduce clarity; readability indices (Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 15.25, Gunning Fog 20.35) are well above typical PLS ranges, confirming the need for simpler language and shorter sentences. These issues must be addressed before the PLS can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit but deviates markedly on several readability metrics: words per sentence (35.8, BEYOND_P90), Flesch‑Kincaid grade (15.25, P90), Gunning Fog (20.35, P90), LIX (61.5, P90) and RIX (9.2, P90) are all higher than typical PLS values, indicating overly long sentences and complex language. Passive voice is within range, but the overall sentence length and grade level suggest the text is too difficult for the intended audience."
