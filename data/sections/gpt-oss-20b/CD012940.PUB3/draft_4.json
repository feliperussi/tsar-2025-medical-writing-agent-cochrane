  "draft": "\"Is giving back (re‑feeding) the stomach contents (gastric residuals) taken out during tube feeding better than discarding them for helping early‑born babies grow?\"\n\nKey messages\n– Re‑feeding gastric residuals probably makes little or no difference to how quickly preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) regain their birth weight, the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious gut infection), death before hospital discharge, the time needed to reach full enteral feeds, the number of days on parenteral nutrition (nutrition given through a vein), or growth at discharge.  \n– The evidence comes from only one small, unblinded trial that enrolled 72 infants, so we have low confidence in these results.  \n– Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to determine whether re‑feeding is truly safe and effective.\n\nWhat health challenges do preterm infants face with feeding?  \nBabies born before 37 weeks often cannot feed by mouth because their stomachs and digestive systems are immature. In neonatal intensive‑care units they receive milk through a small tube placed in the stomach. Nurses regularly check the amount of milk left after a feed – the “gastric residual.” This check helps decide when to increase feeding volumes. However, clinicians disagree about whether to give the residual back to the baby (re‑feeding) or to discard it. Re‑feeding might aid digestion by returning partially digested milk, enzymes, hormones and growth‑promoting substances, but it could also increase the risk of vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) or bloodstream infection (sepsis).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to discover about re‑feeding gastric residuals?  \nWe aimed to find out whether re‑feeding gastric residuals is more effective and safer than discarding them for preterm infants. Specifically, we compared the two approaches on outcomes such as time to regain birth weight, risk of NEC or intestinal perforation, overall mortality before discharge, time to reach full enteral feeding, days on total parenteral nutrition, and growth status at discharge.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases in February 2022. We also screened trial registries, conference proceedings and reference lists for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared re‑feeding with discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Two reviewers independently screened studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We combined results using risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes, and we graded the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified one eligible trial that enrolled 72 preterm infants in a neonatal intensive‑care setting. The trial was unmasked but otherwise well conducted. Compared with discarding, re‑feeding gastric residuals probably made little or no difference to:  \n\n– Time to regain birth weight (mean difference 0.4 days; low‑certainty evidence)  \n– Risk of NEC stage ≥ 2 or spontaneous intestinal perforation (risk ratio 0.71; low‑certainty)  \n– All‑cause mortality before discharge (risk ratio 0.50; low‑certainty)  \n– Time to reach full enteral feeds of ≥120 m,  \n– Total days on parenteral nutrition (mean difference ‑0.3 days; low‑certainty)  \n– Risk of extra‑uterine growth restriction at discharge (risk ratio 1.29; low‑certainty)  \n\nWe are uncertain about the effect on the number of episodes where feeding was stopped for ≥ 12 hours (very low‑certainty evidence).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the findings because the single trial was small and unblinded, which may have introduced bias. The limited sample size prevents firm conclusions about benefits or harms.\n\nHow up to date is this review?  \nThe evidence is current to February 2022, the date of our last search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical checks: (1) The subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, violating the style guide requirement that all section subheadings be questions. (2) The results section omits the mean difference for the outcome “time to reach full enteral feeds” (original MD –1.30 days) and does not specify the unit (≥120 mL/kg/d), which is a factual inaccuracy compared with the source. (3) The text contains excessive nominalisation and noun‑heavy phrasing (25 nominalisations, 176 nouns – both in the P90 range) and an unusually high count of difficult words (282 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words, well beyond the typical range). These issues reduce readability for patients. Suggested priority improvements: \n1. Change heading to a question, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\". \n2. Complete the missing result: rewrite the bullet to \"Time to reach full enteral feeds (≥120 mL/kg/d) – mean difference ‑1.30 days; low‑certainty evidence\". \n3. Reduce nominalisations and noun density: rewrite \"The evidence is current to February 2022, the date of our last search\" as \"We last searched in February 2022\". \n4. Shorten long sentences and replace complex words (e.g., replace \"unblinded\" with \"not blinded\", \"unmasked\" with \"open‑label\"). \n5. Add a brief introductory sentence before the bullet list to improve flow and use more active voice. These changes address the most serious clarity and style problems while bringing the metrics closer to typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (614 words) and has good readability scores (FRE 57.4, FKGL 10.7). However, several linguistic metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisations (25, P90), noun count (176, P90), SMOG index (13.9, P90), Dale‑Chall score (8.34, P90), complex words (143, P90) and especially complex Dale‑Chall words (282, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words than usual, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisation."
