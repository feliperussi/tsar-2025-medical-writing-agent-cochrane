  "plain_title": "How well do hormone medicines that lower estrogen (GnRH analogues) relieve endometriosis pain, and what effect do they have on bone density?",
  "key_messages": [
    "GnRH analogues (hormone medicines that lower estrogen) may reduce overall pelvic pain, menstrual pain, pain during intercourse and pelvic tenderness after about three months of use, compared with no active treatment, but the evidence is of low certainty so the true benefit is uncertain.",
    "These medicines can cause unwanted effects such as hot flushes (sudden feelings of warmth) and may lead to a small loss of bone mineral density (a measure of bone strength), especially when not given together with calcium‑regulating agents (substances that help maintain calcium levels in the body); the evidence for these harms is also of low certainty.",
    "Because the existing studies are few, often have methodological problems, and provide imprecise results, further well‑designed, longer‑term research is needed to clarify how effective GnRH analogues are for pain relief, their impact on bone health, and how they compare with other hormonal treatments."

      "subheading": "What is endometriosis and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Endometriosis is a common condition that affects about 6 % to 11 % of women of child‑bearing age. It occurs when tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus grows outside the uterus, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or the pelvic lining. This misplaced tissue can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), chronic pelvic pain and can make it harder to become pregnant (infertility). These symptoms reduce quality of life, limit daily activities and cause emotional distress.\\n\\nTreatments aim to relieve pain and improve fertility. Options include pain‑relieving medicines (analgesics), hormonal drugs such as danazol or progestogen‑containing devices placed inside the uterus (intra‑uterine progestogens), and a class of drugs called gonadotropin‑releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas). GnRHas temporarily switch off the body’s production of estrogen, which can shrink endometriosis lesions and lessen pain. However, because estrogen also helps keep bones strong, GnRHas can lead to a loss of bone mineral density (BMD), meaning the bones become weaker and more prone to fractures."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to answer two main questions: 1) How effective and safe are GnRH analogues for reducing the painful symptoms of endometriosis compared with other hormonal treatments, placebo or no treatment? 2) What impact do GnRH analogues have on bone mineral density in women with endometriosis, and how do they compare with other treatments or with GnRH analogues used together with calcium‑regulating agents (often called “add‑back therapy” to protect the bones). In other words, the authors wanted to know whether GnRHas relieve pain and improve quality of life, and whether any benefit is outweighed by side‑effects such as bone loss or hot‑flushes."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at 72 randomised controlled trials that together included 7,355 women with endometriosis. All participants were women of reproductive age who experienced painful symptoms. The trials were carried out in various (unspecified) countries and compared gonadotropin‑releasing hormone analogues (GnRH analogues) with placebo, danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, calcium‑regulating agents, or other hormonal options. Follow‑up periods ranged from three to twelve months. Funding sources were not reported in the abstract."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and because the studies were very small.",
