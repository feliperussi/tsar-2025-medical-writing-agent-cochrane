  "draft": "How well do hormone medicines that lower estrogen (GnRH analogues) relieve endometriosis pain, and what effect do they have on bone density?\n\nKey messages  \n– GnRH analogues (hormone medicines that lower estrogen) may reduce overall pelvic pain, menstrual pain, pain during intercourse and pelvic tenderness after about 3 months of use, but the evidence is low certainty so the true benefit is unclear.  \n– These medicines can cause hot flushes (suddenom) and may lead to a small loss of bone mineral density (a measure of bone strength), especially when they are not given together with calcium‑regulating agents (substances that help keep calcium levels stable); the evidence for these harms is also low certainty.  \n– Because the studies are few, often have methodological problems and give imprecise results, we need more well‑designed, longer‑term research to clarify how effective GnRH analogues are for pain relief, how they affect bone health, and how they compare with other hormonal options.\n\nWhat is endometriosis and why is it a problem?  \nEndometriosis is a common condition that affects about 6 % to 11 % of women of child‑bearing age. It occurs when tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus grows outside the uterus, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or the pelvic lining. This misplaced tissue can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), chronic pelvic pain and can make it harder to become pregnant (infertility). These symptoms reduce quality of life, limit daily activities and cause emotional distress.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nWe aimed to answer two questions: (1) How effective and safe are GnRH analogues for reducing the painful symptoms of endometriosis compared with other hormonal treatments, placebo or no treatment? (2) What impact do GnRH analogues have on bone mineral density in women with endometriosis, and how do they compare with other treatments or with GnRH analogues used together with calcium‑regulating agents?\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and trial registries in May 2022. We also checked reference lists and contacted study authors and experts to locate additional trials that compared GnRH analogues with other treatments or placebo in women with endometriosis.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 72 randomised controlled trials that together included 7 355 women with endometriosis. All participants were of reproductive age and experienced painful symptoms. The trials compared GnRH analogues with placebo, danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, calcium‑regulating agents or other hormonal options, and followed women for 3 to 12 months. Compared with placebo, GnRH analogues may reduce overall pelvic pain, painful periods, pain during sex and the feeling of pelvic tenderness after about three months of treatment, but the evidence for this benefit is uncertain. When GnRH analogues are used without calcium‑regulating agents, we observed a small decrease in bone mineral density after 12 months, indicating weaker bones.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants may have known which treatment they received, not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, and the studies were very small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence is current to the May 2022 search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions. The heading \"Key messages\" is not a question, which breaches the style guide requirement. In addition, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Key messages\" should be re‑phrased as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\").\n2. **Typographical error / unclear jargon** – \"hot flushes (suddenom)\" contains a typo and an unexplained term. Rewrite as \"hot flushes (sudden feelings of warmth)\".\n3. **Long, noun‑heavy sentence** – \"We identified 72 randomised controlled trials that together included 7 355 women with endometriosis. All participants were of reproductive age and experienced painful symptoms.\" can be simplified to \"We found 72 trials involving 7,355 women of reproductive age who had painful endometriosis symptoms.\"\n4. **Complex wording** – Phrases like \"methodological problems\" and \"participants may have known which treatment they received\" could be made clearer: \"the studies often had design flaws, and participants sometimes knew which treatment they were getting.\"\n5. **Sentence length** – The sentence in the Results section exceeds 30 words: \"Compared with placebo, GnRH analogues may reduce overall pelvic pain, painful periods, pain during sex and the feeling of pelvic tenderness after about three months of treatment, but the evidence for this benefit is uncertain.\" Break it into two sentences: \"Compared with placebo, GnRH analogues may reduce overall pelvic pain, painful periods, pain during sex and pelvic tenderness after about three months. However, the evidence for this benefit is uncertain.\"\nThese changes will improve readability, meet the style guide, and address the metric‑identified issues of high noun count and complex words.",

However, three metrics deviate: nouns (160, above typical median), complex_words_dc (223) and complex_words (117), indicating the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many complex words. The suggested rewrites aim to reduce noun density and simplify vocabulary, bringing the text closer to typical PLS patterns."
