  "draft": "How well do hormone medicines that lower estrogen (GnRH analogues) relieve endometriosis pain, and what effect do they have on bone density?\n\n**Key messages**\n- GnRH analogues (hormone medicines that lower estrogen) may reduce overall pelvic pain, menstrual pain, pain during intercourse and pelvic tenderness after about three months of use, compared with no active treatment, but the evidence is of low certainty so the true benefit is uncertain.\n- These medicines can cause unwanted effects such as hot flushes (sudden feelings of warmth) and may lead to a small loss of bone mineral density (a measure of bone strength), especially when not given together with calcium‑regulating agents (substances that help maintain calcium levels in the body); the evidence for these harms is also of low certainty.\n- Because the existing studies are few, often have methodological problems, and provide imprecise results, further well‑designed, longer‑term research is needed to clarify how effective GnRH analogues are for pain relief, their impact on bone health, and how they compare with other hormonal treatments.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is endometriosis and why is it a problem?\nEndometriosis is a common condition that affects about 6 % to 11 % of women of child‑bearing age. It occurs when tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus grows outside the uterus, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or the pelvic lining. This misplaced tissue can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), chronic pelvic pain and can make it harder to become pregnant (infertility). These symptoms reduce quality of life, limit daily activities and cause emotional distress.\n\nTreatments aim to relieve pain and improve fertility. Options include pain‑relieving medicines (analgesics), hormonal drugs such as danazol or progestogen‑containing devices placed inside the uterus (intra‑uterine progestogens), and a class of drugs called gonadotropin‑releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas). GnRHas temporarily switch off the body’s production of estrogen, which can shrink endometriosis lesions and lessen pain. However, because estrogen also helps keep bones strong, GnRHas can lead to a loss of bone mineral density (BMD), meaning the bones become weaker and more prone to fractures.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review set out to answer two main questions: 1) How effective and safe are GnRH analogues for reducing the painful symptoms of endometriosis compared with other hormonal treatments, placebo or no treatment? 2) What impact do GnRH analogues have on bone mineral density in women with endometriosis, and how do they compare with other treatments or with GnRH analogues used together with calcium‑regulating agents (often called “add‑back therapy” to protect the bones). In other words, the authors wanted to know whether GnRHas relieve pain and improve quality of life, and whether any benefit is outweighed by side‑effects such as bone loss or hot‑flushes.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared GnRH analogues with other treatments or placebo in women with endometriosis, pooled the findings on pain relief and bone mineral density, and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 72 randomised controlled trials that together included 7,355 women with endometriosis. All participants were women of reproductive age who experienced painful symptoms. The trials were carried out in various (unspecified) countries and compared gonadotropin‑releasing hormone analogues (GnRH analogues) with placebo, danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, calcium‑regulating agents, or other hormonal options. Follow‑up periods ranged from three to twelve months. Funding sources were not reported in the abstract.\n\nMain results: Pain relief\nCompared with placebo, GnRH analogues may reduce overall pelvic pain, painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia) and pelvic tenderness after about three months of treatment, but the evidence for this benefit is uncertain.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "Critical checks failed: several subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Methods\", \"Main results: Pain relief\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"), and the first key message contains a factual error – the review found no studies comparing GnRH analogues with \"no active treatment\". These issues must be corrected before the PLS can be approved. Additionally, the draft is dense (high noun count, long sentences, many complex words) which reduces readability for patients.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Incorrect subheading format** – Quote: \"Methods\". Why: Subheadings must be phrased as questions per the Master Style Guide. Suggested rewrite: \"How did we find the evidence?\".\n2. **Incorrect subheading format** – Quote: \"Main results: Pain relief\". Why: Not a question. Suggested rewrite: \"What did we find about pain relief?\".\n3. **Incorrect subheading format** – Quote: \"Limitations\". Why: Not a question. Suggested rewrite: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\".\n4. **Incorrect subheading format** – Quote: \"Currency\". Why: Not a question. Suggested rewrite: \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n5. **Factual inaccuracy in key message** – Quote: \"... compared with no active treatment, but the evidence is of low certainty so the true benefit is uncertain.\" Why: The review found no studies comparing GnRH analogues with no treatment; the statement is misleading. Suggested rewrite: \"... compared with placebo or other hormonal treatments, but the evidence is of low certainty so the true benefit is uncertain.\"\n\nMetrics support these edits: the draft has a high average sentence length (25.44 words, P90) and a very high noun count (212, beyond P90), indicating noun‑heavy, long sentences that hinder readability. Reducing sentence length and using more active verbs will lower the words_per_sentence and noun metrics, bringing the text closer to typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is within the 850‑word limit but shows moderate conformity overall. Notable deviations include words_per_sentence (25.44, P90), nouns (212, beyond P90), smog_index (14.4, P90), complex_words_dc (291, P90), complex_words (146, P90) and long_words (208, P90). These suggest the draft is more complex and noun‑heavy than typical Cochrane PLSs, reinforcing the need for shorter, more active sentences and fewer technical terms."
