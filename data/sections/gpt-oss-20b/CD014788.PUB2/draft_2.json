  "draft": "How well do hormone medicines that lower estrogen (GnRH analogues) relieve endometriosis pain, and what effect do they have on bone density?\n\nKey messages\n– GnRH analogues (hormone medicines that lower estrogen) may reduce overall pelvic pain, painful periods, pain during sex and pelvic tenderness after about three months, compared with placebo or other hormonal treatments; the evidence is of low certainty, so the true benefit is uncertain.  \n– These medicines can cause unwanted effects such as hot flushes (sudden feelings of warmth) and may lead to a small loss of bone mineral density (a measure of bone strength), especially when they are not given together with calcium‑regulating agents (substances that help keep calcium levels stable); the evidence for these harms is also of low certainty.  \n– Because the existing studies are few, often have methodological problems, and provide imprecise results, we need more well‑designed, longer‑term research to clarify how effective GnRH analogues are for pain relief, their impact on bone health, and how they compare with other hormonal options.\n\nWhat is endometriosis and why is it a problem?\nEndometriosis is a common condition that affects about 6 % to 11 % of women of child‑bearing age. Tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus grows outside the uterus, often on the ovaries, fallopian tubes or the pelvic lining. This misplaced tissue can cause painful periods (dysmenorrhoea), pain during sex (dyspareunia), chronic pelvic pain and difficulty becoming pregnant (infertility). These symptoms lower quality of life, limit daily activities and cause emotional distress.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether GnRH analogues relieve painful symptoms of endometriosis and whether they affect bone mineral density. We also wanted to compare GnRH analogues with placebo, other hormonal treatments, and with GnRH analogues used together with calcium‑regulating agents (add‑back therapy).\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and trial registries up to May 2022. We looked for randomised and bone density, and judged the certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 72 randomised controlled trials that together included 7 355 women with endometriosis. The trials compared GnRH analogues with placebo, danazol, oral or injectable progestogens, calcium‑regulating agents or other hormonal options. Follow‑up periods ranged from three to twelve months. No trial compared GnRH analogues with “no treatment”.\n\nWhat did we find about pain relief?\nCompared with placebo, GnRH analogues may reduce overall pelvic pain, painful periods, pain during sex and pelvic tenderness after about three months of treatment. The evidence is of low certainty, so the true size of the benefit is unclear.\n\nWhat did we find about bone health?\nWhen GnRH analogues were used without calcium‑regulating agents, there may be a small loss of bone mineral density after 12 months. Adding calcium‑regulating agents (add‑back therapy) appears to protect bone density. The certainty of this evidence is also low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were small and had a high risk of bias, for example because participants often knew which treatment they received. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in. These problems reduce our confidence in the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised is current to the May 2022 search. New studies published after that date are not included.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the required subheading format: the heading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, which breaches the Master Style Guide. Additionally, there are several clarity problems that could confuse readers:\n1. Problematic sentence (Methods section): \"We looked for randomised and bone density, and judged the certainty of the evidence.\" This is garbled and leaves the reader unsure what was searched for. Suggested rewrite: \"We looked for randomised controlled trials that reported pain outcomes and bone-density measurements, and we assessed the certainty of the evidence.\"\n2. Long, dense bullet points in the Key messages section make it hard to grasp the main points. Suggested rewrite: split each bullet into two shorter sentences or use simpler phrasing, e.g., \"GnRH analogues may reduce overall pelvic pain, painful periods, pain during sex and pelvic tenderness after about three months. However, the evidence is of low certainty, so the true benefit is uncertain.\"\n3. The heading \"Key messages\" should be rephrased as a question to meet the style guide, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\".\n4. Some sentences exceed 30 words, reducing readability, for example the paragraph under \"What did we find about bone health?\" could be broken up: \"When GnRH analogues are used without calcium-regulating agents, bone mineral density may decrease slightly after 12 months. Adding calcium-regulating agents (add-back therapy) appears to protect bone density.\"\n5. The draft contains a high number of nouns (174) and complex words (123) compared with typical PLS ranges, contributing to the dense style (metrics show nouns in the P90 range, SMOG index 13.68, complex_words 123 – all above median). Reducing noun-heavy phrasing and replacing complex words with simpler alternatives will improve readability.\nOverall, the draft needs to address the subheading format and the identified clarity issues before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights deviations: nouns (174, P90), SMOG index (13.68, P90), complex_words_dc (234, P90), complex_words (123, P90), and long_words (171, P90) are higher than typical PLS ranges, indicating a noun-heavy and complex vocabulary. Readability scores are strong (Flesch Reading Ease 52.6, P75), but the identified clarity and style issues should be corrected."
