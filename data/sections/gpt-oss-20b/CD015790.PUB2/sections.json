  "key_messages": [
    "Current research shows that self‑management programs (teaching people how to manage their vision loss) provide little or no clear improvement in overall quality of life (how a person feels and functions day‑to‑day) or vision‑related quality of life (how vision problems affect daily activities) for adults with visual impairment (significant loss of sight), and there is no evidence of increased harmful effects (unwanted side effects). The evidence is limited and uncertain.",
    "Most of the studies involved older adults with age‑related macular degeneration, and no eligible studies examined people with dual sensory impairment (loss of both sight and hearing), so the findings may not apply to all groups with visual loss.",
    "More high‑quality research is needed, using more sensitive ways to measure quality of life and including a wider range of participants and longer follow‑up periods, to determine whether self‑management programs can be beneficial."

      "subheading": "Why is visual impairment a health concern for many adults?",
      "content": "Loss of vision, whether from age‑related eye diseases or other causes, affects more than 2.2 billion people worldwide. Most of those affected are older adults. When vision gets worse, everyday tasks such as reading, cooking, or moving around become harder, and people may feel less independent. This can lead to a drop in mood, confidence, and overall well‑being, making visual impairment a major public‑health problem."

      "subheading": "What are self‑management interventions for people with visual impairment?",
      "content": "Self‑management interventions are programs that teach people how to cope with their condition on their own. For vision loss, these programmes may include training in the use of low‑vision aids, strategies to stay active, problem‑solving skills, and support for emotional health. The goal is to help individuals maintain daily activities and improve their overall quality of life."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether these self‑management programmes actually improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment. Specifically, they compared the programmes to doing nothing (a wait‑list) or to usual care, looking at two types of quality of life: health‑related quality of life (how health affects everyday life) and vision‑related quality of life (how vision problems affect daily activities and well‑being). They also checked whether the programmes caused any unwanted side effects."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared self‑management programmes with usual care or no treatment in adults with visual impairment, combined their quality‑of‑life results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 20 parallel‑group randomized controlled trials with a total of 3,151 older adults (mean age 60‑84) who had acquired visual impairment, most commonly age‑related macular degeneration. The studies were conducted in Asia, Australia, Europe and North America in settings such as academic medical centres, hospitals, low‑vision clinics, private practices, rehabilitation centres and Veterans Affairs facilities. Interventions were multifaceted self‑management programmes aimed at improving daily functioning and well‑being, compared with wait‑list or active controls (usual care, optical aids or low‑vision rehabilitation). Follow‑up ranged from 6 to 24 months, and funding was mainly non‑industry. The self‑management interventions may make little to no difference to health‑related quality of life, vision‑related quality of life, or the risk of adverse events in adults with visual impairment."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to May 2024 of search."
