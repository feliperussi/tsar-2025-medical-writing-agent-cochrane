  "draft": "Do self‑management programs (teaching people to manage their vision loss) improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment?\n\nKey messages\n– Current research shows that self‑management programs probably do not improve overall quality of life (how a person feels and functions day‑to‑day) or vision‑related quality of life (how vision problems affect daily activities) for adults with visual impairment, and we found no evidence of harmful side effects. The evidence is limited and uncertain.  \n– Most of the studies involved older adults with age‑related macular degeneration, and none examined people who have both sight and hearing loss, so the findings may not apply to all groups with visual loss.  \n– More high‑quality research is needed. Future studies should use more sensitive ways to measure quality of life, include a broader range of participants, and follow people for longer periods.\n\nWhy is visual impairment a health concern for many adults?\nLoss of vision (significant loss of sight) affects more than 2.2 billion people worldwide, most of them older adults. When vision worsens, everyday tasks such as reading, cooking, or moving around become harder. This can reduce independence, lower mood, and lower overall well‑being, making visual impairment a major public‑health problem.\n\nWhat are self‑management interventions for people with visual impairment?\nSelf‑management interventions are programmes that teach people how to cope with their vision loss on their own. They may include training in low‑vision aids (devices that help people see better), strategies to stay active, problem‑solving skills, and emotional support. The goal is to help individuals maintain daily activities and improve their overall quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether these self‑management programmes actually improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment. We compared the programmes with doing nothing (a wait‑list) or with usual care, looking at two outcomes: health‑related quality of life (how health affects everyday life) and vision‑related quality of life (how vision problems affect daily activities and well‑being). We also checked whether the programmes caused any unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?\nWe searched several databases and trial registries up to May 2024 for randomised controlled trials that compared self‑management programmes with usual care or no treatment in adults with visual impairment. We combined the quality‑of‑life results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 20 parallel‑group randomised controlled trials. Together they enrolled 3 151 older adults (mean age 60–84 years) with visual impairment, most often caused by age‑related macular degeneration. The trials were carried out in Asia, Australia, Europe and North America in settings such as hospitals, low‑vision clinics, rehabilitation centres and Veterans Affairs facilities. The programmes were multiple‑component self‑management interventions aimed at improving daily functioning and well‑being. Compared with wait‑list or usual‑care controls, the programmes probably make little or no difference to health‑related quality of life, vision‑related quality of life, or the risk of adverse events. The evidence is of low certainty because the studies were small and varied in participants and delivery methods.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence. The studies were generally small, involved different types of participants, and used varied ways of delivering the interventions. This heterogeneity reduces the reliability of the overall findings.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised is current to May 2024, the date of our most recent search.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required structural checks, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a patient audience. 1) Technical jargon such as “GRADE approach” and “parallel‑group randomised controlled trials” is not explained, making the methods hard to follow. 2) A very long sentence in the Methods section bundles three ideas together, exceeding 30 words and reducing readability. 3) The key result sentence uses the vague phrase “make little or no difference”, which can be unclear for non‑experts. 4) The draft contains many nominalisations and noun‑heavy constructions (e.g., “the programmes probably make little or no difference”), contributing to a high noun count (181, P90) and nominalisation count (31, BEYOND_P90). Reducing these will improve flow and align the text with typical PLS patterns. Suggested rewrites are provided below.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Jargon – “GRADE approach”**\n   - Problem: “...rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.”\n   - Why: Readers may not know what GRADE means.\n   - Rewrite: “...rated how confident we are in the evidence using a standard system (GRADE) that grades the quality of research.”\n2. **Long sentence in Methods**\n   - Problem: “We searched several databases and trial registries up to May 2024 for randomised controlled trials that compared self‑management programmes with usual care or no treatment in adults with visual impairment, combined the quality‑of‑life results from the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.”\n   - Why: Over 30 words, multiple ideas jammed together.\n   - Rewrite: “We searched several databases and trial registries up to May 2024 for randomised trials that compared self‑management programmes with usual care or no treatment in adults with visual impairment. We then combined the quality‑of‑life results from the studies and rated how confident we are in the evidence using a standard system (GRADE).”\n3. **Unclear result phrasing**\n   - Problem: “The programmes probably make little or no difference to health‑related quality of life, vision‑related quality of life, or the risk of adverse events.”\n   - Why: “make little or no difference” is vague for patients.\n   - Rewrite: “The programmes probably do not improve health‑related or vision‑related quality of life, and they do not increase the risk of side effects.”\n4. **Technical trial description**\n   - Problem: “We included 20 parallel‑group randomised controlled trials.”\n   - Why: “parallel‑group randomised controlled trials” is technical.\n   - Rewrite: “We included 20 randomised trials that compared groups of participants receiving the programme with groups receiving usual care or no treatment.”\n5. **Nominalisation / noun‑heavy language**\n   - Problem: Frequent use of nouns such as “intervention”, “assessment”, “evaluation”.\n   - Why: High noun count (181, P90) and nominalisation (31, BEYOND_P90) make sentences feel dense.\n   - Rewrite: Replace nouns with verbs where possible, e.g., change “The assessment of the evidence showed low certainty” to “We found the evidence was of low certainty.”\n\nThese changes will lower the noun and nominalisation counts, bring the text closer to typical PLS ranges, and make the summary easier for patients to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 10, Flesch Reading Ease 56). However, it deviates strongly in noun‑heavy and nominalised language (nouns 181 → P90, nominalisations 31 → BEYOND_P90) and in complex‑word metrics (complex_words 128 → P90, long_words 166 → P90). These suggest the text is more dense than typical Cochrane PLSs and would benefit from reducing noun density and simplifying terminology."
