  "draft": "Do self‑management programs (teaching people to manage their vision loss) improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Current research shows that self‑management programs (teaching people how to manage their vision loss) provide little or no clear improvement in overall quality of life (how a person feels and functions day‑to‑day) or vision‑related quality of life (how vision problems affect daily activities) for adults with visual impairment (significant loss of sight), and there is no evidence of increased harmful effects (unwanted side effects). The evidence is limited and uncertain.\n- Most of the studies involved older adults with age‑related macular degeneration, and no eligible studies examined people with dual sensory impairment (loss of both sight and hearing), so the findings may not apply to all groups with visual loss.\n- More high‑quality research is needed, using more sensitive ways to measure quality of life and including a wider range of participants and longer follow‑up periods, to determine whether self‑management programs can be beneficial.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is visual impairment a health concern for many adults?\nLoss of vision, whether from age‑related eye diseases or other causes, affects more than 2.2 billion people worldwide. Most of those affected are older adults. When vision gets worse, everyday tasks such as reading, cooking, or moving around become harder, and people may feel less independent. This can lead to a drop in mood, confidence, and overall well‑being, making visual impairment a major public‑health problem.\n\nWhat are self‑management interventions for people with visual impairment?\nSelf‑management interventions are programs that teach people how to cope with their condition on their own. For vision loss, these programmes may include training in the use of low‑vision aids, strategies to stay active, problem‑solving skills, and support for emotional health. The goal is to help individuals maintain daily activities and improve their overall quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether these self‑management programmes actually improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment. Specifically, they compared the programmes to doing nothing (a wait‑list) or to usual care, looking at two types of quality of life: health‑related quality of life (how health affects everyday life) and vision‑related quality of life (how vision problems affect daily activities and well‑being). They also checked whether the programmes caused any unwanted side effects.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared self‑management programmes with usual care or no treatment in adults with visual impairment, combined their quality‑of‑life results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 20 parallel‑group randomized controlled trials with a total of 3,151 older adults (mean age 60‑84) who had acquired visual impairment, most commonly age‑related macular degeneration. The studies were conducted in Asia, Australia, Europe and North America in settings such as academic medical centres, hospitals, low‑vision clinics, private practices, rehabilitation centres and Veterans Affairs facilities. Interventions were multifaceted self‑management programmes aimed at improving daily functioning and well‑being, compared with wait‑list or active controls (usual care, optical aids or low‑vision rehabilitation). Follow‑up ranged from 6 to 24 months, and funding was mainly non‑industry. The self‑management interventions may make little to no difference to health‑related quality of life, vision‑related quality of life, or the risk of adverse events in adults with visual impairment.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because several section subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., the \"Methods\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" headings). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement that all subheadings be question‑style. In addition, the text contains a number of clarity and style problems that would hinder a patient’s understanding:\n1. **Passive voice** – many sentences hide the actor (e.g., \"The review included 20 parallel‑group randomized controlled trials…\"). Rewrite in active voice: \"We included 20 parallel‑group randomized controlled trials…\".\n2. **Nominalisations and noun‑heavy phrasing** – phrases such as \"self‑management interventions may make little to no difference to health‑related quality of life\" are noun‑dense. Use a verb‑focused rewrite: \"Self‑management programmes probably do not improve health‑related quality of life\".\n3. **Complex / long words** – words like \"multifaceted\" and \"acquired\" increase reading difficulty. Replace with simpler alternatives: \"multifaceted\" → \"multiple\"; \"acquired\" → \"developed\".\n4. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – change headings to questions, e.g., \"Methods\" → \"How did we find and assess the evidence?\", \"Limitations\" → \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"Currency\" → \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n5. **Long sentences** – the sentence \"The review included 20 parallel‑group randomized controlled trials with a total of 3,151 older adults (mean age 60‑84) who had acquired visual impairment, most commonly age‑related macular degeneration.\" exceeds 30 words. Split it: \"We included 20 parallel‑group randomized controlled trials. Together they enrolled 3,151 older adults (mean age 60‑84) with visual impairment, most often due to age‑related macular degeneration.\"\nThese changes address the high passive‑voice count (20, beyond the typical P90 range), the excessive nominalisations (37, beyond P90), the over‑use of nouns (197, beyond P90) and the high complex‑word counts (complex_words = 134, long_words = 175, complex_words_dc = 291) identified in the PLS evaluation. Reducing these will improve readability (Flesch Reading Ease = 53, already above typical but can be raised) and bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns. Overall, the draft needs revision of subheading format and reduction of passive, noun‑heavy, and complex language before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (614 words) and has a good Flesch Reading Ease (53, P75). However, several metrics deviate strongly from typical PLS patterns: passive_voice (20, P90), nominalization (37, BEYOND_P90), nouns (197, P90), complex_words (134, P90), long_words (175, P90), and complex_words_dc (291, BEYOND_P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy sentences, and high lexical complexity, which should be reduced to improve clarity and align with standard PLS style."
