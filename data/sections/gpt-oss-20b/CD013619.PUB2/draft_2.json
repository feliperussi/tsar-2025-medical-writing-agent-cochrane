  "draft": "\"Does having family members present during emergency resuscitation (CPR) affect their risk of post‑traumatic stress and other mental health problems?\"\n\nWhat are the main findings?  \n– Small studies suggest that letting relatives watch CPR may reduce later symptoms of post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression and intense grief, compared with keeping them outside. The evidence is weak because the studies were few, small and had methodological problems.  \n– One pilot study also looked at whether family presence changed the length of the resuscitation effort or increased stress for health‑care staff; it found no clear differences.  \n– Because the current evidence is limited, we need larger, well‑designed randomised trials to confirm any benefits or harms for relatives, patients and staff.\n\nWhy might families want to be present during resuscitation?  \nWhen a loved one suffers a sudden, life‑threatening emergency such as cardiac arrest, families often want to stay close. They may wish to be involved in treatment decisions, to say goodbye, or simply to offer support. Health‑care teams sometimes ask relatives to wait outside because they fear the sight of resuscitation (the attempts to restart breathing and the heart) could be upsetting. Understanding how family presence influences stress reactions helps shape policies that respect everyone’s well‑being.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe asked two main questions: (1) Does offering relatives the choice to watch resuscitation lower the chance that they will later develop PTSD‑related symptoms? (2) Does family presence affect other mental‑health outcomes for relatives (such as anxiety, depression or complicated grief), patient health outcomes (illness severity or survival), the way emergency care is delivered, or the stress and attitudes of health‑care professionals?\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL) and trial registries up to 22 March 2022. We included randomised controlled trials that offered relatives the option to be present during resuscitation in emergency departments or pre‑hospital settings and that reported psychological outcomes for relatives, patient outcomes or staff effects. Two reviewers extracted the data and we summarised the results narratively because meta‑analysis was not possible.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified two randomised trials involving 595 adult relatives (ages 19‑78, 56‑64 % women). One large cluster‑randomised trial in France (2013) offered a systematic option to witness CPR and followed relatives for up to one year. The other small pilot trial in the United Kingdom (1998) compared family presence with usual practice. Both trials measured PTSD symptoms and, in the larger study, also measured anxiety, depression and complicated grief. The larger trial reported fewer PTSD‑related symptoms and lower anxiety, depression and grief scores in the family‑presence group after 12 months. The UK pilot found no difference in resuscitation duration or staff stress. Both studies had high risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence was judged very low for all outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in these results because participants knew whether they were allowed to be present, which can influence responses. The trials were small, had methodological flaws and did not report all outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe searches were up to date as of March 2022. New studies may have been published since then.",

These metrics confirm the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many technical terms, which aligns with the clarity issues identified above. Reducing nominalisations and simplifying vocabulary will improve readability. Addressing these points will bring the summary in line with the Cochrane plain‑language style guide and make it fully understandable for patients and the public.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (72% of features in best quartile), but five metrics deviate: nominalisation, noun count, complex Dale‑Chall words, overall complex words, and long words—all higher than the median. These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many technical terms, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
