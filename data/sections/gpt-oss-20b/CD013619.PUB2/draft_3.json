  "draft": "\"How might families want to be present during resuscitation (CPR) affect their risk of post‑traumatic stress and other mental‑health problems?\"\n\nKey messages\n– Small studies suggest that letting relatives watch CPR may reduce later symptoms of post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD – distressing memories, anxiety and flash‑backs), anxiety, depression and intense, prolonged sorrow after a loss (sometimes called complicated grief). The studies were few, small and had important weaknesses, so we are not very confident that the findings are reliable.  \n– One small pilot study also looked at whether family presence changed how long resuscitation lasted or increased stress for health‑care staff; it found no clear differences.  \n– Because the existing evidence is limited, larger and well‑designed randomised (randomly assigned) trials are needed to confirm any benefits or harms for relatives, patients and staff.\n\nWhy might families want to be present during resuscitation?  \nWhen a loved one suffers a sudden, life‑threatening emergency such as a heart stop, families often want to stay close. They may wish to be involved in treatment decisions, to say goodbye, or simply to offer support. Health‑care teams sometimes ask relatives to wait outside because they fear that seeing the emergency procedures (called resuscitation – attempts to restart breathing and the heart) could be upsetting. Understanding how family presence influences stress reactions helps shape policies that respect everyone’s well‑being.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe asked two main questions. First, does offering relatives the choice to watch resuscitation lower the chance that they will later develop PTSD‑related symptoms? Second, does family presence affect other mental‑health outcomes for relatives (such as anxiety, depression or complicated grief), patient health outcomes (how sick they become or whether they survive), the way emergency care is delivered, or the stress and attitudes of health‑care professionals?\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL) and trial registries up to 22 March 2022. We included studies where people were randomly assigned to either allow relatives to be present or not, either in the emergency department or at the scene of the emergency before the patient reached the hospital (pre‑hospital setting). Two reviewers extracted the data and we combined the results narratively because a meta‑analysis was not possible.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified two randomised trials involving 595 adult relatives (ages 19‑78, 56‑64 % women).  \n\n– One large study in France (2013) randomly assigned whole ambulance teams, rather than individual people, to either offer relatives the chance to watch CPR or to follow usual practice. This cluster‑randomised design followed relatives for up to one year.  \n\n– The other study was a small pilot trial in the United Kingdom (1998) that compared family presence with usual practice in an emergency department.  \n\nBoth trials measured PTSD symptoms. The French study also measured anxiety, depression and intense, prolonged sorrow after loss (complicated grief). After 12 months, relatives who watched CPR reported fewer PTSD symptoms, lower anxiety, lower depression and less intense sorrow. The UK pilot found no difference in how long resuscitation lasted or in staff stress. Both studies had important weaknesses that could affect the results, so we have little confidence in the findings for any outcome.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nParticipants knew whether they were allowed to be present, which can influence how they report feelings. The trials were small, had methodological flaws and did not report all outcomes we were interested in. Because of these weaknesses, the overall certainty of the evidence is judged very low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nOur searches were up to date as of March 2022. New studies may have been published since then.",

      "feedback": "Critical checks pass, but the draft contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse readers. The title is wordy and ambiguous, several sentences are overly long or noun‑heavy, and there is excessive nominalisation, all of which are reflected in the metric deviations (nominalisation 22 vs median 13, nouns 165 vs median 116, SMOG 13.9 vs median 12.1, complex words 132 vs median 84). These issues need to be fixed before the PLS can be approved.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Title wording** – \"How might families want to be present during resuscitation (CPR) affect their risk of post‑traumatic stress and other mental‑health problems?\" is confusing. Rewrite as a clear question, e.g., \"Does having family members present during emergency resuscitation (CPR) affect their risk of post‑traumatic stress and other mental‑health problems?\"\n2. **Long, jargon‑heavy sentence** – \"Health‑care teams sometimes ask relatives to wait outside because they fear that seeing the emergency procedures (called resuscitation – attempts to restart breathing and the heart) could be upsetting.\" This sentence is >30 words and mixes technical terms. Rewrite: \"Health‑care teams may ask relatives to wait outside because they worry that watching resuscitation – the attempts to restart breathing and the heart – could be upsetting.\"\n3. **Nominalisation / noun‑heavy phrasing** – \"Understanding how family presence influences stress reactions helps shape policies that respect everyone’s well‑being.\" This noun‑dense sentence reduces readability. Rewrite in active verb form: \"By studying how family presence affects stress reactions, we can create policies that respect everyone’s well‑being.\"\n4. **Overly long combined question sentence** – \"We asked two main questions. First, does offering relatives the choice to watch resuscitation lower the chance that they will later develop PTSD‑related symptoms? Second, does family presence affect other mental‑health outcomes for relatives (such as anxiety, depression or complicated grief), patient health outcomes (how sick they become or whether they survive), the way emergency care is delivered, or the stress and attitudes of health‑care professionals?\" Split into two separate paragraphs or bullet points for clarity.\n5. **Bullet dash style** – The draft uses an en‑dash (–) for bullet points, but the style guide requires a hyphen/dash (-). Replace each bullet with a simple hyphen.\n\nThese changes will reduce nominalisations, lower noun density, and bring sentence length into the recommended 15‑20 word range, improving readability and aligning the draft with the style guide and metric expectations.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (61% best‑quartile features) but shows six metric deviations: nominalisation (22, P90), nouns (165, P90), SMOG index (13.95, P90), complex_words_dc (266, P90), complex_words (132, P90) and long_words (182, P90). These indicate excessive noun‑heavy and complex language, supporting the need to simplify wording and reduce nominalisations."
