  "draft": "Does having family members present during emergency resuscitation (CPR) affect their risk of post‑traumatic stress and other mental health problems?\n\nKey messages\n- Small studies suggest that letting relatives watch emergency resuscitation (CPR) may reduce later symptoms of post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD – a condition that can cause flash‑backs, anxiety and trouble sleeping), anxiety, depression and deep, lasting sadness after the event (sometimes called complicated grief). The studies were few, small and had design problems, so we cannot be sure the results are reliable.\n- One small pilot study also looked at whether family presence changed how long resuscitation lasted or added stress for health‑care staff; it found no clear differences.\n. Because the existing trials have important limitations, larger and well‑designed randomised (randomly assigned) studies are needed to confirm any benefits or harms for relatives, patients and staff.\n\nWhy might families want to be present during resuscitation?\nWhen a loved one suffers a sudden, life‑threatening emergency such as a heart stop, families often want to stay close. They may wish to help with treatment decisions, to say goodbye, or simply to offer support. Health‑care teams may ask relatives to wait outside. They worry that seeing the emergency procedures – which tries to restart breathing and the heart – could be upsetting. Understanding how family presence influences stress reactions helps us create policies that respect everyone’s well‑being.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe asked two main questions. First, does offering relatives the choice to watch resuscitation reduce the chance that they will later develop PTSD‑related symptoms? Second, we examined whether family presence affects other outcomes:\n- mental‑health of relatives (anxiety, depression, complicated grief);\n- patient health (how sick they become – morbidity – and whether they survive – mortality);\n- how emergency care is delivered;\n- stress and attitudes of health‑care professionals.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and trial registries up to 22 March 2022. We included randomised trials that compared family presence during resuscitation with usual practice, either in emergency departments or in pre‑hospital settings (before the patient reaches the hospital). Two reviewers extracted the data and we combined the results narratively because a meta‑analysis was not possible.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two randomised trials involving 595 adult relatives (ages 19‑78, 56‑64 % women).\n- A large cluster‑randomised trial in France (2013) offered relatives a systematic option to witness CPR in pre‑hospital ambulance teams and followed them for up to one year. A cluster‑randomised trial assigns whole groups (here, ambulance teams) to the same option rather than assigning individuals.\n- A small pilot trial in the United Kingdom (1998) compared family presence with usual practice in an emergency department.\nBoth trials measured PTSD symptoms. The French study also measured anxiety, depression and complicated grief. After 12 months, relatives who watched CPR reported fewer PTSD symptoms, lower anxiety, lower depression and less intense sadness. The UK pilot found no difference in resuscitation duration or staff stress. Both studies were small and had design problems, so we are not confident that the findings are reliable.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nParticipants knew whether they were present, which may have influenced how they reported feelings. The trials were small, had risk of bias and did not report all outcomes we were interested in. Because of these weaknesses, we judge the overall certainty of the evidence as very low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur searches were up to date as of March 2022. New studies may have been published since then.",

      "feedback": "Critical checks pass (all required sections are present, subheadings are phrased as questions, facts and numbers match the source, word count is 610 < 850). However, the draft contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as “cluster‑randomised trial”, “pre‑hospital”, “morbidity”, “mortality”, and “per‑protocol analyses” are used without simple explanations.\n2. **Passive voice** – e.g., “the evidence … was assessed as very low certainty”, which hides who did the assessment.\n3. **Overly long sentence** – “Because the existing trials have important limitations, larger and well‑designed randomised (randomly assigned) studies are needed to confirm any benefits or harms for relatives, patients and staff.” packs multiple ideas together.\n4. **Heavy nominalisation** – many noun‑heavy constructions (e.g., “The review set out to answer two main questions”) reduce readability.\n5. **Missing brief definitions for technical concepts** – readers may not know what “cluster‑randomised” means or what “pre‑hospital” care entails.\nThese issues exceed the threshold of three significant clarity problems, so the PLS cannot be approved in its current form. The following concrete rewrites are recommended:\n- Replace jargon with plain language: “cluster‑randomised trial (a study where whole groups, like ambulance teams, are assigned together)”; “pre‑hospital (before the patient reaches the hospital)”; “morbidity (how sick a patient becomes)”; “mortality (whether the patient survives)”.\n- Change passive to active: “We judged the evidence as very low certainty.”\n- Split the long sentence into two: “The existing trials have important limitations. We need larger, well‑designed randomised (randomly assigned) studies to confirm any benefits or harms for relatives, patients, and staff.”\n- Use verbs instead of nouns: “We set out to answer two main questions.”\n- Add brief parenthetical explanations for any remaining technical terms.\nAddressing these points will improve readability and meet the Cochrane plain‑language standards.\n\nMetrics support these observations: nominalisation count is 23 (P90, far above the typical <13), noun count 171 (P90, above typical <116), SMOG index 13.7 (P90, higher than typical <12.1), and complex‑word counts are also in the P90 range. These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex words, confirming the need to simplify language and increase active verb usage.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (61% of features in best quartile), but six metrics deviate significantly: nominalisation, noun count, SMOG index, and counts of complex/Dale‑Chall words and long words are all in the P90 range, indicating the text is overly noun‑heavy and complex. Readability scores (Flesch‑Reading Ease 53.5, Grade 10.5) are better than average, yet the high nominalisation and complex‑word metrics suggest room for simplification."
