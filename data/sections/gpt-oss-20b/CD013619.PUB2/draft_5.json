  "draft": "Does having family members present during emergency resuscitation (CPR) affect their risk of post‑traumatic stress and other mental health problems?\n\nKey messages\n- Small studies suggest that letting relatives watch emergency resuscitation (CPR) may lower later PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression and intense sorrow (complicated grief). The studies were few, small and had important weaknesses, so we are not confident that the findings are reliable.\n- One small pilot study also looked at whether family presence changed how long resuscitation lasted or added stress for health‑care staff; it found no clear differences.\n- Because the existing trials have important limitations, larger and well‑designed randomised (randomly assigned) studies are needed to confirm any benefits or harms for relatives, patients and staff.\n\nWhy might families want to be present during resuscitation?\nWhen a loved one suffers a sudden, life‑threatening emergency such as cardiac arrest, families often want to stay close. They may wish to help with treatment decisions, to say goodbye, or simply to offer support. Health‑care teams sometimes ask relatives to wait outside because they fear that watching the emergency procedures (called resuscitation – the attempts to restart breathing and the heart) could be upsetting. Understanding how family presence influences stress reactions helps us create policies that respect everyone’s well‑being.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe asked two main questions. First, does offering relatives the choice to watch resuscitation reduce the chance that they will later develop PTSD‑related symptoms? Second, we examined whether family presence affects other outcomes:\n- mental‑health of relatives (anxiety, depression, complicated grief);\n- patient health (illness severity – morbidity – and survival – mortality);\n- how emergency care is delivered;\n- stress and attitudes of health‑care professionals.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and trial registries up to 22 March 2022. We included randomised trials that compared family presence during resuscitation with usual practice, either in emergency departments or in pre‑hospital settings. Two reviewers extracted data and we combined the results narratively because a meta‑analysis was not possible.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two randomised trials involving 595 adult relatives (ages 19‑78, 56‑64 % women).\n- A large cluster‑randomised trial in France (2013) offered relatives a systematic option to witness CPR in pre‑hospital ambulance teams and followed them for up to one year.\n- A small pilot trial in the United Kingdom (1998) compared family presence with usual practice in an emergency department.\nBoth trials measured PTSD symptoms. The French study also measured anxiety, depression and complicated grief. After 12 months, relatives who watched CPR reported fewer PTSD symptoms, lower anxiety, lower depression and less intense sorrow. The UK pilot found no difference in resuscitation duration or staff stress. Both studies had methodological weaknesses, so we have little confidence in the findings for any outcome.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nParticipants knew whether they were present, which may have influenced how they reported feelings. The trials were small, had risk of bias and did not report all outcomes we were interested in. Because of these weaknesses, we judge the overall certainty of the evidence as very low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur searches were up to date as of March 2022. New studies may have been published since then.",

PTSD (post‑traumatic stress disorder) is a condition that can cause flash‑backs, anxiety and trouble sleeping. ‘Complicated grief’ means a very intense, prolonged feeling of sadness after a loss.”\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – “Health‑care teams sometimes ask relatives to wait outside because they fear that watching the emergency procedures (called resuscitation – the attempts to restart breathing and the heart) could be upsetting.” This 29‑word sentence packs several ideas.\n   *Rewrite*: “Health‑care teams may ask relatives to wait outside. They worry that seeing the emergency procedures – called resuscitation, which tries to restart breathing and the heart – could be upsetting.”\n3. **Vague wording about study quality** – Phrases like “methodological weaknesses” and “we have little confidence in the findings for any outcome” are abstract for patients.\n   *Rewrite*: “Both studies were small and had problems with how they were done, so we cannot be sure the results are reliable.”\n4. **Technical phrase in key messages** – “intense sorrow (complicated grief)” is not everyday language.\n   *Rewrite*: “deep, lasting sadness after the event (sometimes called complicated grief).”\n5. **Nominalisations and noun‑heavy sentences** – the draft contains many noun‑based forms (e.g., “assessment”, “investigation”, “methodological weaknesses”) which increase reading difficulty. Re‑phrasing them as actions improves clarity.\n   *Example rewrite*: Change “Both studies had methodological weaknesses, so we have little confidence in the findings for any outcome.” to “Both studies were small and had design problems, so we are not confident that the findings are reliable.”\nThese changes address the most important readability issues and also bring the draft closer to the metric targets (reduce nominalisations, long words, and complex vocabulary).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit and has good active‑voice and pronoun use (both in the 75th percentile). However, several metrics are far from typical PLS patterns: nominalisations (23, P90), noun count (160, P90), SMOG index (13.7, P90), complex words (124, P90) and long words (175, P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many complex words than usual, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations as suggested above."
