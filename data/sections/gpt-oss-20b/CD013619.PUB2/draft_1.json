  "draft": "Does having family members present during emergency resuscitation (CPR) affect their risk of post‑traumatic stress and other mental health problems?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- The limited research available suggests that allowing relatives to be present during emergency resuscitation (CPR) may lower the relatives’ later symptoms of post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – a condition causing distressing memories and anxiety – as well as reduce anxiety, depression and complicated grief (intense sorrow over loss), compared with not being present; however, the studies were small, had methodological problems and the overall confidence in these findings is limited.\n- One small study also examined whether family presence affected the length of the resuscitation effort or caused additional stress for healthcare professionals, and it found no clear differences.\n- Because the existing trials have important limitations and provide only weak evidence, larger, well‑designed randomised (randomly assigned) studies are needed to determine whether family presence truly improves relatives’ mental health and to assess any effects on patients and healthcare teams.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nWhy might families want to be present during resuscitation?\nWhen a loved one suffers a sudden, life‑threatening emergency such as a heart stop, families often wish to stay close. They may want to be involved in decisions about treatment, to say goodbye, or simply to be there for support. Healthcare teams sometimes ask relatives to wait outside the emergency room or ambulance, fearing that seeing the emergency procedures (called resuscitation – the attempts to restart breathing and the heart) could be upsetting. However, the presence of family members can affect three groups at once: the patient, the relatives, and the medical staff. Some relatives may develop strong stress reactions after witnessing resuscitation, such as post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – a condition where a person feels intense fear, anxiety, or intrusive memories after a traumatic event. Understanding how family presence influences these outcomes is important for making policies that respect everyone’s well‑being.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe review set out to answer two main questions. First, it wanted to know whether offering relatives the choice to watch resuscitation reduces the chance that they will later experience PTSD‑related symptoms. Second, it looked at a range of other effects: whether family presence changes other mental‑health outcomes for relatives (such as anxiety, depression, or complicated grief), whether it influences the patient’s health results (including how sick they become – morbidity – or whether they survive – mortality), whether it alters the way medical care is delivered during the emergency, and how it affects the stress levels and attitudes of the healthcare professionals involved. By gathering evidence from randomised trials, the authors hoped to see if letting families be present is helpful, harmful, or neutral for everyone involved.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched databases for studies that offered relatives the option to be present during resuscitation and reported PTSD‑related or other psychological outcomes for relatives, as well as patient or staff effects. We extracted and narratively combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified two randomised trials involving a total of 595 adult relatives (aged 19 to 78 years, 56 %–64 % women) who were present when a loved one suffered cardiac arrest or another life‑threatening emergency. The larger study was a cluster‑randomised trial carried out in 2013 across pre‑hospital emergency medical service units in France; it offered relatives a systematic option to witness cardiopulmonary resuscitation and followed them for up to one year. The smaller pilot trial was conducted in 1998 in an emergency department in the United Kingdom. Both trials compared family presence during resuscitation (FPDR) with the usual practice of no family presence and examined psychological outcomes in relatives, as well as, in the UK study, resuscitation duration and staff stress. No information on funding sources was reported. The review could not determine whether offering relatives the chance to be present during resuscitation affects PTSD‑related symptoms, other psychological outcomes such as anxiety, depression or complicated grief, patient morbidity or mortality, or the stress experienced by healthcare professionals.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nCURRENCY\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.",

This alone prevents approval. In addition, several clarity and style issues make the summary hard for patients to read:\n1. **Long, complex sentences** – e.g., the first key‑message bullet runs over 50 words and mixes several ideas, which overwhelms readers.\n2. **Passive constructions and nominalisations** – e.g., “The larger study was a cluster‑randomised trial…”, “The review could not determine…”. These hide who did what and increase noun density.\n3. **High noun and long‑word density** – the draft contains 210 nouns and 257 long words, far above typical PLS levels, contributing to a very low Flesch Reading Ease (29) and a high grade‑level score (FKGL 16). \n4. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – the guide asks subheadings to be phrased as questions to guide readers; the current headings are statements.\n5. **Word‑per‑sentence average (28.15) exceeds the typical PLS range (19‑28) and is flagged as beyond the 90th percentile, confirming the need to break sentences into shorter ones.\nThese issues are reflected in the metric report: 21 passive voice instances (P90), 36 nominalisations (beyond P90), 210 nouns (beyond P90), and a Flesch Reading Ease of 29 (P10). Addressing the subheading format and the highlighted clarity problems will bring the summary into compliance and improve readability for patients.",

These metrics confirm the need to shorten sentences, reduce passive constructions and noun‑heavy language, and simplify vocabulary."
