  "draft": "Does having family members present during emergency resuscitation (CPR) affect their risk of post‑traumatic stress and other mental‑health problems?\n\nKey messages\n- Small studies suggest that allowing relatives to watch emergency resuscitation (CPR – attempts to restart breathing and the heart) may reduce later symptoms of post‑traumatic stress disorder (PTSD – distressing memories, anxiety and flash‑backs), as well as anxiety, depression and intense, prolonged sorrow (complicated grief). The studies were few, small and had important weaknesses, so we are not confident that the findings are reliable.\n- One small pilot study also examined whether family presence changed the length of the resuscitation effort or added stress for health‑care staff; it found no clear differences.\n- Because the existing trials have important limitations, larger and well‑designed randomised (randomly assigned) studies are needed to confirm any benefits or harms for relatives, patients and staff.\n\nWhy might families want to be present during resuscitation?\nWhen a loved one suffers a sudden, life‑threatening emergency such as a heart stop, families often want to stay close. They may wish to help with treatment decisions, to say goodbye, or simply to offer support. Health‑care teams may ask relatives to wait outside because they worry that watching resuscitation – the attempts to restart breathing and the heart – could be upsetting. Understanding how family presence affects stress reactions helps us create policies that respect everyone’s well‑being.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe asked two main questions. First, does offering relatives the choice to watch resuscitation lower the chance that they will later develop PTSD‑related symptoms? Second, does family presence influence other mental‑health outcomes for relatives (such as anxiety, depression or complicated grief), patient health outcomes (how sick they become or whether they survive), the way emergency care is delivered, or the stress and attitudes of health‑care professionals?\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and trial registries up to 22 March 2022. We included randomised trials that compared family presence during resuscitation with usual practice, either in emergency departments or in pre‑hospital settings. Two reviewers extracted data and we combined the results narratively because a meta‑analysis was not possible.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two randomised trials involving 595 adult relatives (ages 19‑78, 56‑64 % women).\n- A large cluster‑randomised trial in France (2013) offered relatives the systematic option to witness CPR in pre‑hospital ambulance teams and followed them for up to one year.\n- A small pilot trial in the United Kingdom (1998) compared family presence of relatives with usual practice in an emergency department.\nBoth trials measured PTSD symptoms. The French study also measured anxiety, depression and complicated grief. After 12 months, relatives who watched CPR reported fewer PTSD symptoms, lower anxiety, lower depression and less intense sorrow. The UK pilot found no difference in resuscitation duration or staff stress. Both studies had methodological weaknesses, so we have little confidence in the findings for any outcome.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nParticipants knew whether they were present, which may have influenced how they reported feelings. The trials were small, had risk of bias and did not report all outcomes we were interested in. Because of these weaknesses, we judge the overall certainty of the evidence as very low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nOur searches were up to date as of March 2022. New studies may have been published since then.",

Example: \"whether it alters the way medical care is delivered during the emergency\" can be changed to \"whether it changes how emergency care is delivered\". Reducing nominalisations and swapping long words for simpler alternatives will lower the SMOG (13.7, P90) and improve readability.\nOverall, these issues reduce readability despite the metrics showing acceptable sentence length and active‑voice use. Addressing them will bring the PLS in line with typical Cochrane plain‑language standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and shows good active‑voice (66, P75) and pronoun use (32, P75). However, several metrics deviate strongly: nominalisation (24, P90), nouns (165, P90), SMOG index (13.7, P90), complex words (127, P90) and long words (177, P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many multi‑syllable words, which aligns with the identified clarity issues."
