  "draft": "Is continued (maintenance) treatment better than just watching (observation) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)?\n\nKey messages\n- Maintenance therapy (ongoing low‑intensity treatment after remission) does not appear to extend overall survival (how long a person lives) compared with simply observing the patient, but it does keep the disease from getting worse for a longer period (progression‑free survival). This benefit comes with a higher chance of serious side effects, and the studies have several limitations, so our confidence in these findings is modest.\n- Both anti‑CD20 monoclonal‑antibody maintenance (lab‑made proteins that target cancer cells, such as rituximab) and lenalidomide maintenance (a drug that modifies the immune system) lengthen progression‑free survival, yet each increases side‑effects. Evidence on newer targeted drugs is very limited, and data on patients’ day‑to‑day wellbeing (health‑related quality of life) are scarce.\n- We need larger, high‑quality trials that compare maintenance treatment with observation for newer agents, follow patients for longer periods, monitor side‑effects carefully, and assess quality of life, so that patients and clinicians can make clearer decisions.\n\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why is it a problem?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common blood cancer in adults. It arises when a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte multiplies uncontrollably and builds up in the blood, bone‑marrow and sometimes the spleen. Current treatments cannot cure CLL, and each new line of therapy tends to work for a shorter time before the disease returns. After an initial treatment many people enter remission, a phase when the disease is not actively growing. However, remission often ends within a few years, and the cancer can come back, requiring further treatment. Doctors sometimes use maintenance therapy – a lower‑intensity treatment given after remission – to try to keep the disease under control for longer. Options include monoclonal antibodies (lab‑made proteins that target specific markers on cancer cells, such as CD20 or CD52), immunomodulatory drugs (medicines that help the immune system fight the cancer, e.g., lenalidomide), and newer targeted drugs that block signals the cancer cells need to survive.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about maintenance therapy for CLL?\nWe wanted to know whether maintenance treatments – specifically anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, anti‑CD52 antibodies, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, and B‑cell lymphoma‑2 (BCL‑2) inhibitors – improve important outcomes for people with CLL. We looked for effects on overall survival, progression‑free survival, health‑related quality of life, and the frequency of side‑effects or harms.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase) and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared a maintenance therapy with observation or another maintenance option. We included studies that randomly assigned participants to a treatment group and extracted data on survival, disease progression, side‑effects and quality of life. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using standard GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eleven randomised trials involving 2,393 participants with CLL. Most participants were men (≈60%) and their ages ranged from 54 to 72 years. The trials tested three types of maintenance:\n- Anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab or ofatumumab) versus observation (7 trials, 1,679 participants)\n- Lenalidomide versus placebo or observation (3 trials, 693 participants)\n- Alemtuzumab versus observation (1 small trial, 21 participants)\n\nNo trials evaluated newer targeted agents such as BTK or BCL‑2 inhibitors.\n\nOur analysis suggests that anti‑CD20 antibodies and lenalidomide probably make little or no difference to overall survival. Both treatments probably increase progression‑free survival substantially, meaning the disease stays stable for a longer time. However, they also probably raise the risk of serious side‑effects and overall adverse events, and lenalidomide may slightly increase treatment‑related mortality. Evidence on alemtuzumab’s effect on disease progression remains very uncertain, and we found almost no data on quality of life.\n\nHow certain are we about these findings?\nWe have moderate confidence in the results. Some trials were small, participants often knew which treatment they received, and the study populations varied, which reduces certainty. Because of these limitations, the true effect could be different from our estimates.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nWe last searched the literature in January 2022, so the summary reflects studies published up to that date. Newer trials may have been reported since then.",
