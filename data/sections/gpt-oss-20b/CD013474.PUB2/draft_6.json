  "draft": "Is continued (maintenance) treatment better than just watching (observation) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)?\n\nKey messages  \n– Maintenance therapy after remission probably does not help people live longer, but it does keep the disease from getting worse for a longer time.  \n– Both anti‑CD20 monoclonal‑antibody maintenance (e.g., rituximab or ofatumumab) and lenalidomide maintenance likely extend the period without disease progression, yet each raises the chance of serious side‑effects (the most severe type of side‑effects) and overall side‑effects. Lenalidomide may also slightly increase deaths that may be caused by the treatment.  \n– Evidence on newer targeted drugs is very limited, and we have little information about patients’ day‑to‑day wellbeing (health‑related quality of life).\n\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why is it a problem?  \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common blood cancer in adults. It occurs when a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte grows out of control and builds up in the blood, bone‑marrow and sometimes the spleen. Current treatments cannot cure CLL, and each new line of therapy tends to work for a shorter time before the disease returns. After an initial treatment many people enter remission – a period when the disease is not actively growing. Because remission often does not last long, doctors sometimes use maintenance therapy – a gentle, ongoing treatment given after remission to try to keep the disease under control for a longer time. Options include monoclonal antibodies (lab‑made proteins that target specific markers on cancer cells, such as CD20 or CD52), immunomodulatory drugs (medicines that help the immune system, e.g., lenalidomide), and newer targeted drugs that block signals the cancer cells need to survive.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about maintenance therapy for CLL?  \nWe set out to determine whether maintenance treatments – specifically anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, anti‑CD52 antibodies, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, and B‑cell lymphoma‑2 (BCL‑2) inhibitors – improve important outcomes for people with CLL. We looked at overall survival (how long people live), progression‑free survival (how long the disease stays stable), health‑related quality of life (day‑to‑day wellbeing), and the frequency of side‑effects or harms.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase) and trial registers. We looked for randomised trials that compared a maintenance treatment with simply watching the disease (observation) or with another maintenance option. We extracted data on survival, disease progression, side‑effects and quality of life, and we rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our search covered studies published up to January 2022.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eleven randomised trials that together enrolled 2,393 participants with CLL. Most participants were men (about 60%) and their ages ranged from 54 to 72 years. The trials examined three kinds of maintenance treatment:  \n– Anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab or ofatumumab) versus observation (7 trials, 1,679 participants)  \n– Lenalidomide versus placebo or observation (3 trials, 693 participants)  \n– Alemtuzumab versus observation (1 small trial, 21 participants)\n\nNo trials evaluated newer targeted agents such as BTK or BCL‑2 inhibitors.  \n\nOur analysis shows that anti‑CD20 antibodies and lenalidomide probably do not help people live longer. Both treatments probably extend the time before the disease progresses, meaning the disease stays stable for a longer period. However, each treatment probably raises the risk of serious side‑effects and overall side‑effects. Lenalidomide may also slightly increase deaths that may be caused by the treatment. Evidence on alemtuzumab’s effect on disease progression remains very uncertain, and we found almost no data on quality of life.\n\nHow certain are we about these findings?  \nWe have moderate confidence in the results. Some trials were small, participants often knew which treatment they received, and the study populations varied. These limitations mean the true effect could differ from our estimates.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?  \nWe last searched the literature in January 2022, so the summary reflects studies published up to that date. Newer trials may have been reported since then.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the style requirement that all subheadings be phrased as questions – the \"Key messages\" heading is a noun phrase, not a question. This breaks the Master Style Guide and may reduce navigability for readers. In addition, the text contains several clarity‑reducing features identified by the metrics: a very high number of nominalisations (30, beyond the typical range), an excessive noun count (204), and many complex/long words (145 complex words, 203 long words, SMOG 14.6). These make sentences harder to understand for a lay audience.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Key messages\". Problem: not a question. Rewrite as: \"What are the main findings?\".\n2. **Nominalisation / noun‑heavy sentence** – Quote: \"Maintenance therapy after remission probably does not help people live longer, but it does keep the disease from getting worse for a longer time.\" Problem: noun‑heavy and passive‑like. Rewrite: \"Does maintenance therapy after remission help people live longer? It probably does not, but it does keep the disease from getting worse for a longer time.\"\n3. **Complex wording** – Quote: \"anti‑CD20 monoclonal‑antibody maintenance (e.g., rituximab or ofatumumab) and lenalidomide maintenance likely extend the period without disease progression, yet each raises the chance of serious side‑effects (the most severe type of side‑effects) and overall side‑effects.\" Problem: long, technical phrase \"serious side‑effects (the most severe type of side‑effects)\". Rewrite: \"Both anti‑CD20 antibodies and lenalidomide likely keep the disease from progressing longer, but each also increases the risk of serious side‑effects and of any side‑effects overall.\"\n4. **Long sentence (>30 words)** – Quote: \"We searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase) and trial registers. We looked for randomised trials that compared a maintenance treatment with simply watching the disease (observation) or with another maintenance option.\" Problem: two dense sentences. Rewrite: \"We searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase) and trial registers for randomised trials that compared a maintenance treatment with simply watching the disease (observation) or with another maintenance option.\"\n5. **Passive voice** – Quote: \"Our analysis shows that anti‑CD20 antibodies and lenalidomide probably do not help people live longer.\" Problem: passive‑like phrasing. Rewrite: \"We found that anti‑CD20 antibodies and lenalidomide probably do not help people live longer.\"\n\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability, aligning the metrics with typical PLS patterns (reducing nominalisations, nouns, complex and long words, and lowering the SMOG index).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability scores (Flesch‑Kincaid 10.9, FRE 50.5) are within the best quartile, but it deviates markedly on several lexical metrics: nominalisations (30, beyond P90), noun count (204, beyond P90), SMOG (14.6, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall (8.4, beyond P90), complex words (145, beyond P90) and long words (203, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many complex words than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the suggested edits."
