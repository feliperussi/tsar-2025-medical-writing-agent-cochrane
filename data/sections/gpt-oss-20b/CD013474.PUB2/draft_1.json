  "draft": "Is continued (maintenance) treatment better than just watching (observation) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Maintenance therapy (ongoing treatment after remission) does not seem to increase overall survival (how long a person lives) compared with simply observing the patient, but it does appear to keep the disease from getting worse for a longer, and this comes with a higher chance of serious side effects (severe adverse events); because the studies had some limitations, the confidence in these findings is limited.\n- Both anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibody maintenance (lab‑made proteins that target cancer cells, such as rituximab) and lenalidomide maintenance (a drug that modifies the immune system) showed similar delays in disease progression, yet each was associated with more side effects; there is very little evidence on newer targeted drugs, and information on patients’ day‑to‑day wellbeing (health‑related quality of life) is scarce.\n- More high‑quality, larger trials are needed that compare maintenance treatment with observation for newer agents, include long‑term follow‑up of survival, monitor side effects, and assess quality of life, so that clearer answers can be provided for patients and clinicians.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why is it a problem?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common type of blood cancer in adults. It develops when a group of white blood cells called lymphocytes grows out of control and builds up in the blood, bone‑marrow and sometimes the spleen. CLL cannot be cured with current treatments, and each time a person receives a line of therapy the disease tends to come back sooner. After an initial treatment, many people enter a period called remission, where the disease is not actively growing. However, this remission often does not last long, and the cancer can return, leading to a need for further treatment. To try to keep the disease under control for a longer time, doctors sometimes use \"maintenance therapy\" – a lower‑intensity treatment given after remission to deepen or prolong the response. Options for maintenance include monoclonal antibodies (lab‑made proteins that target specific markers on cancer cells, such as CD20 or CD52), immunomodulatory drugs (medicines that help the immune system fight the cancer, e.g., lenalidomide), and newer targeted drugs that block signals the cancer cells need to survive.\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about maintenance therapy for CLL?\nThe review authors set out to determine whether maintenance treatments – specifically anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, anti‑CD52 antibodies, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and B‑cell lymphoma‑2 inhibitors – improve important outcomes for people with CLL. They wanted to know if these therapies help people live longer overall, stay free of disease progression for a longer time, maintain a good quality of life, and what kinds of side‑effects or harms might be associated with their use.\n\n**Methods**\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for trials (studies that randomly assigned participants to treatments) comparing maintenance therapy for CLL with observation or other maintenance options, pooled their results for outcomes such as survival, progression‑free survival and adverse events, and assessed confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eleven randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 2,393 people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). The participants were mostly men (about 60%) and their median ages ranged from 54 to 72 years. Five trials recruited patients with early‑stage symptomatic disease, three focused on advanced‑stage disease (Rai stage III/IV or Binet stage B/C), and most participants (around 70‑80%) had cytogenetic abnormalities at the start of the study. Follow‑up periods varied from about one year to six years. The trials were carried out in several countries (not specified). The interventions tested were: - Maintenance anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab CLL) versus observation (7 trials, 1,679 participants) - Lenalidomide versus placebo or observation (3 trials, 693 participants) - Alemtuzumab versus observation (1 small trial, 21 participants). No randomised trials were found for newer targeted maintenance drugs such as BTK inhibitors or B‑cell lymphoma‑2 inhibitors.\nMain results: Effect of maintenance therapy\nMaintenance treatment with anti‑CD20 antibodies or lenalidomide probably does not change overall survival – that is, it likely makes little or no difference to how long people with CLL live. However, both types of maintenance therapy probably lead to a large increase in progression‑free survival, meaning the disease is likely to stay stable for a longer period before getting worse. These treatments may also cause a slight rise in side‑effects, including serious adverse events and overall adverse events, and lenalidomide may slightly increase treatment‑related mortality. There is insufficient evidence to know whether alemtuzumab maintenance affects progression‑free survival.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the required subheading format: several section headings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Main results: Effect of maintenance therapy\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text contains several clarity problems that would confuse readers: (1) overly long, compound sentences that bundle multiple ideas (e.g., the first key‑message bullet); (2) frequent passive constructions and noun‑heavy phrasing that obscure who is doing what; (3) technical jargon without simple explanations (e.g., \"anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibody maintenance\" and \"lenalidomide maintenance\"). These issues are reflected in the metrics – passive voice (21 instances, P90), nominalizations (42, beyond P90), and high noun count (254, beyond P90) – confirming the need for more active, verb‑focused, concise language. To meet Cochrane PLS standards, the headings must be rewritten as questions, long sentences split, passive voice reduced, and technical terms defined in plain language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but shows moderate overall conformity. Several metrics deviate strongly from typical PLS patterns: passive_voice (21, P90), nominalization (42, beyond P90), nouns (254, beyond P90), smog_index (15.96, beyond P90), and complex word counts are all far above median values, indicating the text is overly dense and noun‑heavy. These metric signals support the editorial recommendations above."
