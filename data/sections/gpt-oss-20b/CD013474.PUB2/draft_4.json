  "draft": "Is continued (maintenance) treatment better than just watching (observation) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)?\n\nKey messages  \n- Maintenance therapy – a lower‑intensity treatment given after remission – does not seem to lengthen overall survival (how long a person lives).  \n- It does keep the disease from worsening for a longer time (progression‑free survival – the period during which the disease does not get worse), but it also raise the chance of serious side‑effects (these are called grade 3‑4 adverse events, the most severe types of side‑effects). The evidence for this is of moderate certainty.  \n- Both anti‑CD20 monoclonal‑antibody maintenance (lab‑made proteins that target the CD20 marker on cancer cells, such as rituximab or ofatumumab) and lenalidomide maintenance (a drug that modifies the immune system) increase progression‑free survival, yet each raises the risk of side‑effects. Evidence on newer targeted drugs is very limited, and data on health‑related quality of life (day‑to‑day wellbeing) are scarce.\n\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why is it a problem?  \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common blood cancer in adults. It occurs when a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte multiplies uncontrollably and builds up in the blood, bone‑marrow and sometimes the spleen. Current treatments cannot cure CLL, and each new line of therapy tends to work for a shorter time before the disease returns. After an initial treatment many people enter remission – a short period when the disease is not actively growing. We tested three types of maintenance: anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibodies, lenalidomide, and alemtuzumab (an anti‑CD52 antibody).\n\nWhat did we want to find out about maintenance therapy for CLL?  \nWe wanted to know whether maintenance treatments – specifically anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, anti‑CD52 antibodies, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, and B‑cell lymphoma‑2 (BCL‑2) inhibitors – improve important outcomes for people with CLL. We looked at overall survival, progression‑free survival, health‑related quality of life, and the frequency of side‑effects or harms.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase) and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that compared a maintenance therapy with observation or another maintenance option. We extracted data on survival, disease progression, side‑effects and quality of life, and we rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified eleven randomised trials involving 2,393 participants with CLL. Most participants were men (≈60%) and their ages ranged from 54 to 72 years. We tested three types of maintenance:  \n- Anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab or ofatumumab) versus observation (7 trials, 1,679 participants)  \n- Lenalidomide versus placebo or observation (3 trials, 693 participants)  \n- Alemtuzumab versus observation (1 small trial, 21 participants)  \n\nNo trials evaluated newer targeted agents such as BTK or BCL‑2 inhibitors.  \n\nOur analysis shows that anti‑CD20 antibodies and lenalidomide probably make little or no difference to overall survival. Both treatments probably increase progression‑free survival substantially, meaning the disease stays stable for a longer time. However, they also probably raise the risk of serious side‑effects (grade 3‑4 adverse events) and overall adverse events, and lenalidomide may slightly increase treatment‑related mortality (deaths that happen because of the treatment itself). Evidence on alemtuzumab’s effect on disease progression remains very uncertain, and we found almost no data on quality of life.\n\nHow certain are we about these findings?  \nWe have moderate confidence in the results. Some trials were small, participants often knew which treatment they received, and the study populations varied, which reduces certainty. Because of these limitations, the true effect could differ from our estimates.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?  \nWe last searched the literature in January 2022, so the summary reflects studies published up to that date. Newer trials may have been reported since then.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical style requirement: the subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, whereas the Master Style Guide mandates subheadings be written as questions where possible. Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Noun‑heavy, awkward sentence** – \"The evidence is up to date to January 2022 of search.\" This construction is difficult to parse and uses unnecessary nominalisation.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We searched the literature up to January 2022, so the evidence is current to that date.\"\n2. **Potentially confusing phrasing** – \"Our analysis shows that anti‑CD20 antibodies and lenalidomide probably make little or no difference to overall survival.\"\n   *Rewrite:* \"Our analysis shows that anti‑CD20 antibodies and lenalidomide do not appear to improve overall survival.\"\n3. **Long, dense sentence** – \"Both treatments probably increase progression‑free survival substantially, meaning the disease stays stable for a longer time before getting worse.\"\n   *Rewrite:* \"Both treatments likely extend the time before the disease progresses, keeping it stable for a longer period.\"\n4. **Passive‑style wording** – \"The evidence is up to date to January 2022 of search.\" (also covered in point 1) – rephrase to active voice as shown.\n5. **Bullet heading not a question** – Change the heading \"Key messages\" to a question such as \"What are the key messages?\".\n\nThese changes will reduce nominalisations, lower noun density, and improve readability. The PLS evaluation shows high counts of nominalisations (28, beyond P90), nouns (193, beyond P90), complex words, and long words, confirming the draft is more noun‑heavy than typical PLS texts. Reducing these will bring the draft closer to the median ranges and improve patient comprehension. Overall, because the mandatory subheading format is not met and several clarity issues remain, the draft cannot be approved in its current form.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and has good active‑voice (56, P75) and pronoun use (40, P75). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in nominalisations, noun count, SMOG, Dale‑Chall, complex words, and long words (all beyond P90). These metrics indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than usual, supporting the need to simplify wording and reduce nominalisations."
