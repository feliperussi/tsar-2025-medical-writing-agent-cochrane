  "key_messages": [
    "Customising the dose of FSH (follicle‑stimulating hormone, a medication used to stimulate the ovaries) based on ovarian reserve tests (blood or ultrasound tests that estimate a woman's egg supply) does not show a clear improvement in the chance of having a baby (live birth) and we cannot be sure whether it changes the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a condition where the ovaries become overly stimulated); the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological problems.",
    "The various dosing strategies tested – such as giving higher doses to women predicted to respond poorly, lower doses to women predicted to respond strongly, or using algorithms that adjust the dose – all gave mixed results, and no particular approach was proven to be better; some algorithms may reduce the chance of moderate or severe OHSS, but the size of this effect is unclear.",
    "Future research needs larger, well‑designed trials that use consistent dosing algorithms, report both pregnancy outcomes and safety, and consider costs, so we can determine whether individualising the FSH dose truly benefits women undergoing IVF/ICSI."

      "content": "In vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are assisted‑reproduction techniques where eggs are collected from a woman's ovaries, fertilised in the laboratory and then transferred back to the uterus. To obtain enough mature eggs, doctors give daily injections of a hormone called follicle‑stimulating hormone (FSH), a type of gonadotropin that tells the ovaries to grow multiple follicles. The amount of FSH given is important: a dose that is too low may lead to a \"poor response\" (few eggs retrieved, lower chance of pregnancy), while a dose that is too high can cause a \"hyper‑response\" and increase the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a condition that can cause abdominal pain, swelling, fluid accumulation and, in severe cases, organ dysfunction. Traditionally, clinicians chose the FSH dose mainly based on a woman's age, but age alone does not fully reflect how many eggs a woman has left (her ovarian reserve). Modern practice also uses ovarian‑reserve tests to guide dosing: \n• Basal (early‑cycle) FSH – a blood test measuring the natural level of FSH; high levels can indicate lower reserve. \n• Antral follicle count (AFC) – an ultrasound count of small follicles visible in the ovaries; fewer follicles suggest lower reserve. \n• Anti‑Müllerian hormone (AMH) – a blood test that correlates with the size of the egg supply; low AMH signals reduced reserve. The question is whether adjusting the starting FSH dose according to these markers improves outcomes such as live birth rates and reduces the incidence of OHSS."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The systematic review set out to determine whether using ovarian‑reserve markers (AMH, AFC, basal FSH) to individualise the initial dose of gonadotropins (FSH) changes the most important results for couples undergoing IVF/ICSI. Specifically, the authors examined whether this personalised dosing strategy affects: \n• Live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates – the ultimate goal of treatment; and \n• The occurrence of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). They compared studies that used dose selection based on these reserve tests with studies that used a standard (one‑size‑fits‑all) dose or other dosing approaches, to see if personalisation leads to better success and safety."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 26 randomised controlled trials involving 8,520 adult women undergoing IVF/ICSI. The trials compared strategies that individualise the daily dose of follicle‑stimulating hormone (FSH) using ovarian‑reserve markers (AMH, AFC, basal FSH) with either a uniform dose (commonly 150 IU) or other dosing algorithms. Some trials compared direct dose‑adjustments for women predicted to be low, normal or high responders, while eight trials tested an ovarian‑reserve‑test‑based algorithm against a non‑algorithm control. The abstract does not give details on follow‑up length, treatment duration, study locations or funding sources."

      "subheading": "Main results: Live birth and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome",
      "content": "It is unclear whether adjusting the FSH dose based on ovarian‑reserve tests changes the chance of having a baby for low, normal, or high responders. Using an ovarian‑reserve‑test‑based dosing algorithm may slightly increase the chance of a live birth, but the evidence is uncertain. The same algorithm may reduce the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, although this effect is also uncertain."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and because studies were very small.",
