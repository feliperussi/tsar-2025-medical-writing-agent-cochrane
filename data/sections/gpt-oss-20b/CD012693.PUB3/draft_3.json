  "draft": "Does customizing the dose of fertility hormone (FSH) based on ovarian‑reserve tests (blood or ultrasound tests that estimate a woman’s egg supply) improve pregnancy rates or reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in women undergoing IVF/ICSI?\n\nKey messages\n– Using ovarian‑reserve tests to set the FSH dose does not clearly increase the chance of a live birth, and we cannot be sure whether it changes the risk of OHSS.  \n– Different dosing strategies – higher doses for predicted poor responders, lower doses for predicted strong responders, or algorithm‑driven adjustments – all gave mixed results. Some algorithms may lower the risk of moderate or severe OHSS, but the size of this effect is uncertain.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials that use consistent dosing algorithms, report both pregnancy outcomes and safety, and consider costs are needed to determine whether individualising the FSH dose truly benefits women undergoing IVF/ICSI.\n\nWhat are the main findings?\nCustomising the FSH dose using ovarian‑reserve tests does not clearly increase the chance of a live birth. We also do not know whether it changes the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a condition that can cause painful swelling and, in severe cases, organ problems. Moderate OHSS causes noticeable abdominal discomfort and fluid buildup, while severe OHSS can lead to serious complications such as organ dysfunction.\n\nWhat is IVF/ICSI and why is ovarian stimulation needed?\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are assisted‑reproduction techniques. We collect eggs from a woman’s ovaries, fertilise them in the laboratory, and transfer the embryos back to the uterus. To obtain enough mature eggs, we give daily injections of follicle‑stimulating hormone (FSH), a medication that tells the ovaries to grow multiple follicles. A dose that is too low can lead to a “poor response” (few eggs and lower chance of pregnancy). A dose that is too high can cause a “hyper‑response” and increase the risk of OHSS. Traditionally we chose the FSH dose mainly based on a woman’s age, but age alone does not fully reflect how many eggs remain (her ovarian reserve). Modern practice also uses ovarian‑reserve tests:\n– Basal (early‑cycle) FSH – a blood test that measures natural FSH levels; high levels suggest lower reserve.  \n– Antral follicle count (AFC) – an ultrasound count of small follicles; fewer follicles suggest lower reserve.  \n– Anti‑Müllerian hormone (AMH) – a blood test that correlates with the size of the egg supply; low AMH signals reduced reserve.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe examined whether using ovarian‑reserve markers (AMH, AFC, basal FSH) to individualise the initial FSH dose changes two key outcomes for couples undergoing IVF/ICSI:\n– Live birth or ongoing pregnancy (the ultimate goal of treatment).  \n– The occurrence of severe OHSS.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers for randomised controlled trials up to February 2023. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the certainty of the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 26 randomised trials that enrolled 8 520 women undergoing IVF/ICSI. The trials compared:\n– Direct dose adjustments for women predicted to be low, normal, or high responders.  \n– Eight trials that used an ovarian‑reserve‑test‑based algorithm versus a non‑algorithm control.\n\nThe evidence does not show a clear effect of marker‑guided dosing on live‑birth rates for any responder group. An algorithm‑based approach may slightly increase the chance of a live birth, but the result is uncertain. The same algorithms may reduce the risk of moderate or severe OHSS, yet the size of this benefit is also unclear. Overall, the certainty of the evidence ranges from very low to low because many studies were small, lacked blinding, and reported outcomes inconsistently.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the findings. Participants and clinicians often knew which dosing strategy was used, which can bias results. Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted, and many studies were very small, leading to imprecise estimates.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched for studies up to February 2023, so the review reflects the evidence available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the required subheading format: the section heading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\"). This breaches the style rule that all subheadings must be questions. In addition, the text is noun‑heavy and contains many long, complex words, which the metrics flag as out‑of‑range (nouns = 188 → P90, smog_index = 13.95 → P90, complex_words = 131 → P90, long_words = 184 → P90, complex_words_dc = 320 → BEYOND_P90). These features make sentences harder to follow for a lay audience. The most important clarity improvements are:\n1. Subheading rewrite – change \"Key messages\" to a question, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. Reduce noun‑heavy phrasing – e.g., replace \"The evidence does not show a clear effect of marker‑guided dosing on live‑birth rates for any responder group\" with \"Marker‑guided dosing does not clearly affect live‑birth rates for any responder group\".\n3. Simplify complex terminology – introduce \"moderate or severe OHSS\" with a brief definition earlier, or replace with \"moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) – a condition that can cause painful swelling and, in severe cases, organ problems\".\n4. Break up long sentences – the sentence \"We included 26 randomised trials that enrolled 8 520 women undergoing IVF/ICSI. The trials compared: – Direct dose adjustments … – Eight trials …\" can be split into two shorter sentences for easier reading.\n5. Replace some long words – use \"use\" instead of \"utilise\", \"help\" instead of \"facilitate\", etc., to lower the long‑word count.\nAddressing these points will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits and has good active‑voice and pronoun use, but deviates on several lexical metrics: nouns (188, P90), SMOG index (13.95, P90), complex words (131, P90), long words (184, P90) and Dale‑Chall complex words (320, BEYOND_P90).
