  "draft": "Does customizing the dose of fertility hormone (FSH) based on ovarian‑reserve tests improve pregnancy rates or reduce ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women undergoing IVF/ICSI?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- Customising the FSH dose using ovarian‑reserve tests (blood or ultrasound measures of a woman’s egg supply) does not clearly increase the chance of a live birth, and we cannot be sure whether it changes the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological problems.  \n- Different dosing strategies – higher doses for predicted poor responders, lower doses for predicted strong responders, or algorithm‑driven adjustments – all gave mixed results. No single approach proved better. Some algorithms may lower the risk of moderate or severe OHSS, but the size of this effect is unclear.  \n- Larger, well‑designed trials that use consistent dosing algorithms, report both pregnancy outcomes and safety, and consider costs are needed to determine whether individualising the FSH dose truly benefits women undergoing IVF/ICSI.\n\nWhat is IVF/ICSI and why is ovarian stimulation needed?\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are assisted‑reproduction techniques. We collect eggs from a woman’s ovaries, fertilise them in the laboratory, and transfer the embryos back to the uterus. To obtain enough mature eggs, we give daily injections of follicle‑stimulating hormone (FSH), a medication that tells the ovaries to grow multiple follicles. A dose that is too low can lead to a “poor response” (few eggs and lower chance of pregnancy). A dose that is too high can cause a “hyper‑response” and increase the risk of OHSS, a condition that can cause abdominal pain, swelling, fluid buildup and, in severe cases, organ problems. Traditionally we chose the FSH dose mainly based on a woman’s age, but age alone does not fully reflect how many eggs remain (her ovarian reserve). Modern practice also uses ovarian‑reserve tests:\n- Basal (early‑cycle) FSH – a blood test that measures natural FSH levels; high levels suggest lower reserve.  \n- Antral follicle count (AFC) – an ultrasound count of small follicles; fewer follicles suggest lower reserve.  \n- Anti‑Müllerian hormone (AMH) – a blood test that correlates with the size of the egg supply; low AMH signals reduced reserve.  \nWe wanted to know whether adjusting the starting FSH dose according to these markers improves live‑birth rates or reduces OHSS.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to determine whether using ovarian‑reserve markers (AMH, AFC, basal FSH) to individualise the initial FSH dose changes two key outcomes for couples undergoing IVF/ICSI:\n- Live birth or ongoing pregnancy (the ultimate goal of treatment).  \n- The occurrence of severe OHSS.  \nWe compared studies that used marker‑guided dosing with studies that used a standard “one‑size‑fits‑all” dose or other dosing approaches.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers for randomised controlled trials up to February 2023. We selected trials that compared marker‑guided FSH dosing with standard dosing or other dosing algorithms. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed the certainty of the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 26 randomised trials that enrolled 8 520 women undergoing IVF/ICSI. The trials compared:\n- Direct dose adjustments for women predicted to be low, normal, or high responders.  \n- Eight trials that used an ovarian‑reserve‑test‑based algorithm versus a non‑algorithm control.  \n\nThe evidence does not show a clear effect of marker‑guided dosing on live‑birth rates for any responder group. An algorithm‑based approach may slightly increase the chance of a live birth, but the result is uncertain. The same algorithms may reduce the risk of moderate or severe OHSS, yet the size of this benefit is also unclear. Overall, the certainty of the evidence ranges from very low to low because many studies were small, lacked blinding, and reported outcomes inconsistently.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the findings. Participants and clinicians often knew which dosing strategy was used, which can bias results. Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted, and many studies were very small, leading to imprecise estimates.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched for studies up to February 2023, so the review reflects the evidence available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural and factual requirements, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a patient audience. 1) The first bullet under “What are the main findings?” is a long, dense sentence that mixes two ideas (live‑birth chance and OHSS risk) and uses the phrase “cannot be sure whether it changes the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)” without a simple explanation of OHSS. 2) The term “moderate or severe OHSS” appears without a brief definition of what “moderate” means, leaving readers unsure of the severity levels. 3) In the “What did the review aim to find out?” section the text switches to third‑person (“the authors examined”) instead of the required first‑person plural (“we examined”), breaking the style guide and making the narrative feel detached. These issues reduce readability despite the overall good metric scores. Suggested rewrites: • Replace the long bullet with two short sentences: “Customising the FSH dose using ovarian‑reserve tests does not clearly increase the chance of a live birth. We also do not know whether it changes the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a condition that can cause painful swelling and, in severe cases, organ problems.” • Add a brief definition after “moderate or severe OHSS”: “moderate OHSS causes noticeable abdominal discomfort and fluid buildup, while severe OHSS can lead to serious complications.” • Change “the authors examined” to “we examined” to keep the first‑person voice. These edits will make the summary clearer and fully compliant with the Master Style Guide.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to typical Cochrane PLS patterns (overall high conformity). Most metrics are in the best quartile (e.g., words per sentence 19.5, Flesch‑Kincaid grade 10.2). However, noun count (192) and lexical complexity metrics (smog index 14.1, complex words 138, long words 194, complex_words_dc 328) are above the typical range, indicating a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style that could be simplified for patients."
