To obtain enough mature eggs, doctors give daily injections of a hormone called follicle‑stimulating hormone (FSH), a type of gonadotropin that tells the ovaries to grow multiple follicles. The amount of FSH given is important: a dose that is too low may lead to a \"poor response\" (few eggs retrieved, lower chance of pregnancy), while a dose that is too high can cause a \"hyper‑response\" and increase the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a condition that can cause abdominal pain, swelling, fluid accumulation and, in severe cases, organ dysfunction. Traditionally, clinicians chose the FSH dose mainly? mainly based on a woman's age, but age alone does not fully reflect how many eggs a woman has left (her ovarian reserve). Modern practice also uses ovarian‑reserve tests to guide dosing: \n• Basal (early‑cycle) FSH – a blood test measuring the natural level of FSH; high levels can indicate lower reserve. \n• Antral follicle count (AFC) – an ultrasound count of small follicles visible in the ovaries; fewer follicles suggest lower reserve. \n• Anti‑Müllerian hormone (AMH) – a blood test that correlates with the size of the egg supply; low AMH signals reduced reserve. The question is whether adjusting the starting FSH dose according to these markers improves outcomes such as live birth rates and reduces the incidence of OHSS.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe systematic review set out to determine whether using ovarian‑reserve markers (AMH, AFC, basal FSH) to individualise the initial dose of gonadotropins (FSH) changes the most important results for couples undergoing IVF/ICSI. Specifically, the authors examined whether this personalised dosing strategy affects: \n• Live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates – the ultimate goal of treatment; and \n• The occurrence of severe? severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). They compared studies that used dose selection based on these reserve tests with studies that used a standard (one‑size‑fits‑all) dose or other dosing approaches, to see if personalisation leads to better success and safety.\n\nMethods\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared individualised gonadotropin dosing based on ovarian‑reserve markers with standard dosing in women undergoing IVF/ICSI, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 26 randomised controlled trials involving 8,520 adult women undergoing IVF/ICSI. The trials compared strategies that individualise the daily dose of follicle‑stimulating hormone (FSH) using ovarian‑reserve markers (AMH, AFC, basal FSH) with either a uniform dose (commonly 150 IU) or other dosing algorithms. Some trials compared direct dose‑adjustments for women predicted to be low, normal or high responders, while eight trials tested an ovarian‑reserve‑test‑based algorithm against a non‑algorithm control. The abstract does not give details on follow‑up length, treatment duration, study locations or funding sources.\n\nMain results: Live birth and ovarian hyperstimulation? hyperstimulation syndrome\nIt is unclear whether adjusting the FSH dose based on ovarian‑reserve tests changes the chance of having a baby for low, normal, or high responders. Using an ovarian‑reserve‑test‑based dosing algorithm may slightly increase the chance of a live birth, but the evidence is uncertain. The same algorithm may reduce the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, although this effect is also uncertain.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and because studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft does not meet the mandatory style and length requirements. 1) Several section headings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"), which violates the Master Style Guide. 2) The total word count is 895, exceeding the 850‑word limit. 3) The text contains many long, passive‑voice sentences and noun‑heavy constructions that reduce readability for patients. 4) Bullet points use a mix of hyphens and other symbols, and there are missing blank lines between some headings and paragraphs, breaking the required structure. 5) The high number of passive constructions (25, beyond the typical range) and excessive nominalisations (36) are reflected in the metric report and contribute to the clarity problems. To make the PLS acceptable, the headings must be rewritten as questions, the word count reduced by trimming redundant wording, and the prose simplified by converting passive sentences to active voice, shortening sentences to under 30 words, and replacing noun‑heavy phrases with verbs. Below are the top priority improvements with concrete rewrites.\n\n**Improvement 1 – Convert non‑question headings to questions**\n- Quote: \"Key messages\"\n- Issue: Heading is not a question, breaching the style guide.\n- Rewrite: \"What are the main findings?\"\n- Quote: \"Methods\"\n- Issue: Not a question.\n- Rewrite: \"How did we find the evidence?\"\n- Quote: \"Results\"\n- Issue: Not a question.\n- Rewrite: \"What did we find?\"\n- Quote: \"Limitations\"\n- Issue: Not a question.\n- Rewrite: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n- Quote: \"Currency\"\n- Issue: Not a question.\n- Rewrite: \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"\n\n**Improvement 2 – Reduce word count below 850 words**\n- Quote: \"The abstract does not give details on follow‑up length, treatment duration, study locations or funding sources.\"\n- Issue: Unnecessary detail that adds length without aiding patient understanding.\n- Rewrite: \"The report does not detail follow‑up length, study locations or funding.\"\n- Apply similar trimming throughout, especially in the long introductory paragraph and the repeated explanations of OHSS.\n\n**Improvement 3 – Shorten long, passive sentences**\n- Quote: \"It is unclear whether adjusting the FSH dose based on ovarian‑reserve tests changes the chance of having a baby for low, normal, or high responders.\"\n- Issue: 27‑word passive‑style sentence; hard to follow.\n- Rewrite: \"We do not know if changing the FSH dose based on ovarian‑reserve tests affects the chance of a baby for any responder type.\"\n- Quote: \"The same algorithm may reduce the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, although this effect is also uncertain.\"\n- Issue: Passive and long.\n- Rewrite: \"The algorithm might lower the risk of moderate or severe OHSS, but we are not sure.\"\n\n**Improvement 4 – Replace noun‑heavy phrases with active verbs**\n- Quote: \"The review included 26 randomised controlled trials involving 8,520 adult women undergoing IVF/ICSI.\"\n- Issue: Noun‑heavy; can be more direct.\n- Rewrite: \"We included 26 trials that enrolled 8,520 women undergoing IVF/ICSI.\"\n- Quote: \"The evidence is up to date to February 2023 of search.\"\n- Issue: Awkward noun phrase.\n- Rewrite: \"We searched for studies up to February 2023.\"\n\n**Improvement 5 – Fix bullet formatting and spacing**\n- Quote: \"• Basal (early‑cycle) FSH – a blood test measuring the natural level of FSH; high levels can indicate lower reserve.\"\n- Issue: Uses bullet dot; style guide requires a dash.\n- Rewrite: \"- Basal (early‑cycle) FSH – a blood test that measures natural FSH levels; high levels suggest lower reserve.\"\n- Ensure a blank line before and after each heading and paragraph.\n\nThese changes address the critical failures and align the draft with the Master Style Guide while improving readability for patients.\n\n**Metrics support**: The evaluation shows 25 passive constructions (beyond typical ≤13), 36 nominalisations (beyond typical ≤13), 250 nouns, and a words‑per‑sentence average of 26.3 (above the typical ≤22). The suggested edits directly target these out‑liers, which will lower the scores toward the median ranges and make the summary easier to read.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation flags several deviations: word count 895 (>850 limit); words per sentence 26.3 (P90, too long); passive voice 25 (BEYOND_P90); nominalisation 36 (BEYOND_P90); nouns 250 (BEYOND_P90); SMOG 15.6, Dale‑Chall 8.6, complex words and long words all far above typical ranges. These metrics confirm the draft is overly complex, noun‑heavy, and uses excessive passive constructions, supporting the need for the recommended simplifications."
