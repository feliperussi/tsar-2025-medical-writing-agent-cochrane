  "draft": "What is the best way to do pelvic floor muscle training (exercises that strengthen the muscles that stop urine leakage) for women with urinary incontinence?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– Doing direct pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), which means repeated, isolated squeezes of the pelvic floor muscles, probably gives a small improvement in how women feel about their leakage. Adding other types of exercise or coordinated movements (body movements performed together with pelvic floor squeezes) shows little or no extra benefit. Serious side‑effects are rare and mainly occur when a training device is used.  \n– Training more often (more days each week) and receiving supervision – either in a clinic or through e‑health (a mobile‑app link with clinicians) – may improve quality of life, but the evidence comes from only a few small studies and is therefore uncertain.  \n– Because many studies were small, had methodological problems, and gave inconsistent results, we need more well‑designed research to determine the optimal type, dose, and delivery of PFMT for women with urinary incontinence.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why does it matter for women?  \nMany women experience unwanted leakage of urine, called urinary incontinence. It can occur in three ways:  \n– Stress incontinence – leaking when coughing, sneezing, or lifting something heavy;  \n– Urgency incontinence – a sudden, strong need to urinate that cannot be held;  \n– Mixed incontinence – a combination of stress and urgency leakage.  \nThese leaks can be embarrassing, limit daily activities, and lower quality of life. Up to one in three women experience incontinence as they age, making effective management a public‑health priority.\n\nWhat is pelvic floor muscle training and how is it usually delivered?  \nThe pelvic floor is a group of muscles that support the bladder and help control urination. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) teaches women to repeatedly tighten (contract) these muscles, similar to Kegel exercises. Researchers have tried PFMT in several ways:  \n– **Exercise type** – some programmes use direct PFMT (isolated squeezes) while others add indirect exercises that involve other body movements or combine both approaches.  \n– **Exercise dose** – programmes may use resistance devices, vary the number of sessions per week, or use stronger (maximal) versus milder (sub‑maximal) squeezes.  \n– **Delivery method** – training can be supervised in a clinic, taught for home practice, delivered individually or in groups, or provided through e‑health tools such as smartphone apps that let women communicate with clinicians.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare different ways of delivering PFMT – changing the type of exercise, the amount (dose) of training, or the method of delivery – to see which approach improves women’s quality of life related to incontinence and whether any side‑effects occur.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP) up to 27 September 2023. We also hand‑searched journals, conference proceedings, and reference lists. We included randomised, quasi‑randomised, or cluster‑randomised trials that compared one PFMT approach with another in women with stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined results where possible and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 63 trials with 4,920 women, mostly aged 45–65 years, parous, and mainly having stress or stress‑predominant mixed incontinence. All trials compared a direct PFMT arm (repeated, isolated pelvic‑floor squeezes) with an alternative approach.  \n\n**Exercise type**  \n– Coordinated training (body movements with simultaneous pelvic‑floor squeezes) may improve quality of life slightly.  \n– Direct PFMT alone may improve quality of life moderately.  \n– Adding indirect exercises to direct PFMT makes little or no difference.  \n\n**Exercise dose**  \n– Using a resistance device versus no device gave uncertain results.  \n– Doing PFMT on more days per week may produce a large improvement in quality of life (based on one small trial).  \n\n**Delivery method**  \n– Clinic supervision may slightly improve quality of life, but evidence is very uncertain.  \n– Individual supervision probably makes little or no difference compared with group supervision.  \n– Supervision via e‑health may improve quality of life slightly.\n\nAdverse events were reported in nine trials. About six out of every 100 women experienced a mild event, mainly vaginal discharge, spotting, or discomfort linked to a training device. Serious side‑effects were rare.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small and had methodological problems, such as unclear allocation or lack of blinding, which reduces confidence in the results. Data were sparse for several comparisons, and results were often inconsistent across studies.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes all evidence up to September 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, title/subheading format, factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a patient reader. The most important issues are:\n1. **Long, complex sentence in the Methods** – \"We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP) up to 27 September 2023.\" This packs multiple ideas into one sentence and uses a parenthetical list that interrupts flow. *Rewrite*: \"We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register – which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP – up to 27 September 2023.\"\n2. **Passive voice and noun‑heavy wording in the adverse‑event paragraph** – \"Adverse events were reported in nine trials. About six out of every 100 women experienced a mild event, mainly vaginal discharge, spotting, or discomfort linked to a training device.\" The passive construction hides who reported the events and the sentence is dense. *Rewrite*: \"We found adverse‑event data in nine trials. In those studies, about six of every 100 women had a mild event, such as vaginal discharge, spotting, or discomfort from a training device.\"\n3. **Over‑packed information in the results summary** – \"We included 63 trials with 4,920 women, mostly aged 45–65 years, parous, and mainly having stress or stress‑predominant mixed incontinence.\" This combines three separate facts, making it hard to process. *Rewrite*: \"We included 63 trials involving 4,920 women. Most participants were aged 45–65 years, had given birth, and suffered mainly stress or stress‑predominant mixed incontinence.\"\n4. **Unclear magnitude language for the main finding** – \"Direct pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) – repeated, isolated squeezes of the pelvic floor muscles – probably gives a small improvement in how women feel about their leakage.\" The phrase \"small improvement\" is vague for a lay audience. *Rewrite*: \"Direct PFMT – repeated, isolated squeezes of the pelvic floor muscles – probably leads to a modest (about a 5‑point) improvement in quality‑of‑life scores that measure how women feel about their leakage.\"\nThese issues are supported by the metric analysis, which shows a high number of passive constructions (23, well above the typical P90 range), many nominalisations (33, beyond the P90 range), and a very high noun count (230, beyond the P90 range). Reducing passive voice, breaking long sentences, and using more verbs will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns and improve readability for patients. To achieve approval, rewrite the quoted sentences as suggested, keep sentences under 30 words where possible, and replace noun‑heavy phrasing with active verbs.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on word count and overall readability (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 48.4, active voice 86) but deviates strongly on several metrics: passive voice (23, P90), nominalisation (33, BEYOND_P90), noun count (230, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15.7, BEYOND_P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.33, P90), complex words (176, BEYOND_P90) and long words (245, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy, uses many complex words and passive constructions, which aligns with the identified clarity issues."
