  "plain_title": "What is the best way to do pelvic floor muscle training (exercises that strengthen the muscles that stop urine leakage) for women with urinary incontinence?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Direct pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) – repeated, isolated voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles – probably gives a small improvement in how women feel about their urinary leakage, while adding other types of exercises or doing coordinated movements (body movements performed together with pelvic floor contractions) shows little or no extra benefit; serious side effects are rare and mainly occur when a training device is used.",
    "Training more often (more days each week) and receiving supervision (either in a clinic or through e‑health, which means communication with clinicians via a mobile app) may improve quality of life, but the evidence comes from only a few small studies and is therefore uncertain.",
    "Because many studies were small, had methodological problems, and gave inconsistent results, more well‑designed research is needed to determine the optimal type, dose, and delivery of pelvic floor muscle training for women with urinary incontinence."

      "subheading": "What is urinary incontinence and why does it matter for women?",
      "content": "Many women experience unwanted leakage of urine, a condition called urinary incontinence. It can happen in three main ways:\n- Stress incontinence – leaking when coughing, sneezing, or lifting something heavy;\n- Urgency incontinence – a sudden, strong need to urinate that can’t be held;\n- Mixed incontinence – a combination of both.\nThese leaks can be embarrassing, limit daily activities, and reduce quality of life. Because the problem is common—affecting up to one in three women as they get older—finding effective ways to manage it is a public‑health priority."

      "subheading": "What is pelvic floor muscle training and how is it usually delivered?",
      "content": "A first‑line treatment recommended by experts is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT). The pelvic floor is a group of muscles that support the bladder and help control urination. PFMT involves teaching women to repeatedly tighten (contract) these muscles, much like doing a Kegel exercise.\n\nResearchers have tried PFMT in many different ways:\n \"exercise type\" – some programmes use direct PFMT (isolated, voluntary pelvic floor squeezes) while others add indirect exercises that involve other body movements or combine both approaches.\n\"exercise dose\" – variations include using resistance devices, doing more or fewer sessions per week, or performing stronger (maximal) versus milder (sub‑maximal) squeezes.\n\"delivery method\" – training can be supervised in a clinic, taught for home practice, given individually or in groups, or delivered through e‑health tools such as smartphone apps that let women communicate with clinicians.\n\nUnderstanding which of these variations works best can help women regain confidence and improve their day‑to‑day wellbeing."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to compare the different ways PFMT can be performed. Specifically, they wanted to know whether changing the type of exercise, the amount (dose) of training, or the method of delivery leads to better outcomes for women with stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. The main outcome they looked at was how the training affected women’s quality of life related to incontinence, and they also recorded any side‑effects."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 63 randomised (including quasi‑randomised and cluster‑randomised) trials with a total of 4,920 women who had urinary incontinence. Participants were generally mid‑aged (about 45–65 years), parous, and mainly suffered from stress or stress‑predominant mixed urinary incontinence. They had not received prior incontinence treatment or pelvic surgery and did not have notable pelvic floor dysfunction. The trials were conducted worldwide, with 53 of them carried out in middle‑ or high‑income countries. All studies compared a “direct” pelvic‑floor‑muscle‑training (PFMT) arm—defined as repeated, isolated, voluntary pelvic‑floor contractions—with alternative approaches that varied by exercise type, dose, or delivery method. No information on the length of the intervention periods or on study funding sources was provided in the abstract."

      "subheading": "Main results: Effect of pelvic floor muscle training",
      "content": "Coordinated training may improve quality of life slightly. Direct pelvic floor muscle training may improve quality of life moderately. Adding indirect training to direct training may make little to no difference to quality of life. It is unclear if doing PFMT without a resistance device improves quality of life. Doing PFMT more days per week may cause a large improvement in quality of life. It is unclear if supervising PFMT in clinic improves quality of life. Individual supervision of PFMT probably makes little to no difference to quality of life compared with group supervision. It is unclear if supervising PFMT in clinic versus via e‑health makes any difference to quality of life. E‑health delivery of PFMT instructions may improve quality of life slightly. About six out of every one hundred women experienced a mild adverse event, mainly related to the training device."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people/used different ways of delivering intervention, and Studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023 of search."
