  "draft": "Is infliximab (a medicine that blocks inflammation) helpful for keeping Crohn’s disease in remission?\n\nKey messages\n– Infliximab (a medicine that blocks inflammation) probably helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission by reducing the chance of a flare‑up (clinical relapse) compared with placebo, and it works even better when given together with purine analogues (drugs that calm the immune system).  \n– The original infliximab may cause about 7 more relapses per 100 people than a biosimilar infliximab (a copy of the original biologic medicine), and it may also increase loss of response by about 17 more people per 100.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to confirm how well infliximab prevents flares, to clarify its safety profile, and to compare it directly with other active treatments over longer periods.\n\nWhat is Crohn’s disease and why does it matter?  \nCrohn’s disease is a long‑lasting (chronic) condition that causes inflammation – swelling and irritation – in the digestive tract. People may have pain, diarrhoea, weight loss and fatigue. Inflammation can also lead to serious complications such as bowel damage or fistulas (abnormal connections between organs). Because the disease often flares up and can disrupt daily life, keeping it under control is a major health challenge.\n\nHow might infliximab help keep Crohn’s disease in remission?  \nInfliximab is a biologic drug known as a monoclonal antibody (a lab‑made protein). It attaches to tumour necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑α), a chemical that drives inflammation and is found in high amounts in people with Crohn’s disease. By neutralising TNF‑α, infliximab reduces the inflammation that causes symptoms. We wanted to know whether giving infliximab after a patient has reached remission can stop the disease from flaring up again, and whether the drug is safe for this purpose.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe set out to determine how effective and safe infliximab is for maintaining remission in people with Crohn’s disease. Specifically, we compared infliximab with placebo or other active treatments to see whether it reduces the chance of disease returning (clinical relapse) and to assess serious side‑effects or withdrawals from treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major medical databases up to June 2023 for randomised controlled trials that compared infliximab with placebo or other treatments for maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified nine trials that together enrolled 1,257 participants aged 18–69 years. Seven trials recruited patients who had never received a biologic drug; two included a mix of biologic‑naïve and non‑naïve participants. At baseline, three trials enrolled people already in remission, five enrolled people with varying disease activity, one enrolled biologic responders with active disease, and one focused only on patients with fistulating disease. All studies allowed participants to take other medicines at the same time. Funding came from pharmaceutical companies, mixed commercial‑public sources, or public bodies.\n\nWhat are the main results?  \n– Infliximab probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo, with about 19 fewer relapses per 100 people treated.  \n– When infliximab is given together with purine analogues, it probably prevents about 47 more relapses per 100 people than using purine analogues alone.  \n– Compared with a biosimilar infliximab, the original infliximab may cause about 7 more relapses per 100 people and may increase loss of clinical response by about 17 more people per 100.  \n– The original infliximab may also lead to more withdrawals because of side‑effects when compared with a biosimilar. We are very uncertain whether serious adverse events differ between the two.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the findings. However, the studies were small and often not blinded, so participants may have known which treatment they received, which can influence results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?  \nWe searched for studies up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects research published until that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several reader‑confusing problems:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as “clinical relapse”, “loss of clinical response” and “purine analogues” appear in the main text without a simple definition (they are only explained in the key messages). This leaves patients unsure what the outcomes mean. *Suggested rewrite*: add brief parenthetical explanations, e.g., “clinical relapse (a flare‑up of symptoms)”.\n2. **Overly long, dense sentence** – the sentence describing the trial populations is >30 words and packs many details, making it hard to follow: “At baseline, three trials enrolled people already in remission, five enrolled people with varying disease activity, one enrolled biologic responders with active disease, and one focused only on patients with fistulating disease.” Split it into two shorter sentences for readability.\n3. **Excessive passive voice** – the draft uses many passive constructions (19 instances, P90), e.g., “when compared with a biosimilar”. Passive phrasing obscures who is doing the action. *Suggested rewrite*: “when we compare it with a biosimilar”.\n4. **Wordy phrasing** – some sentences are unnecessarily complex, such as “The original infliximab may also lead to more withdrawals because of side‑effects when compared with a biosimilar.” This can be shortened to “The original infliximab may cause more withdrawals due to side‑effects than a biosimilar.”\nThese issues together create at least three significant clarity barriers for a patient audience, so the PLS cannot be approved in its current form.\n\n**Metric support**: The evaluation shows high passive_voice (19, P90), very high complex_words (160, BEYOND_P90) and long_words (221, BEYOND_P90), confirming the editorial concerns about sentence complexity and jargon.",

These indicate the text is more passive, noun‑heavy and uses many long or complex words than most PLSs, which aligns with the identified clarity problems."
