  "draft": "Is infliximab (a medicine that blocks inflammation) helpful for keeping Crohn’s disease in remission?\n\nKey messages\n– Infliximab (a medicine that blocks inflammation) probably helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission by reducing the chance of a flare‑up compared with placebo, and it works even better when combined with purine analogues (drugs that calm the immune system).  \n– Infliximab appears to work similarly to biosimilar infliximab (a copy of the original biologic medicine), but current studies do not give clear evidence of any difference in safety or effectiveness.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to confirm how well infliximab prevents flares, to clarify its safety profile, and to compare it directly with other active treatments over longer periods.\n\nWhat is Crohn’s disease and why does it matter?  \nCrohn’s disease is a long‑lasting (chronic) condition that causes inflammation – swelling and irritation – in the digestive tract. People may have pain, diarrhoea, weight loss and fatigue. Inflammation can also lead to serious complications such as bowel damage or fistulas (abnormal connections between organs). Because the disease often flares up and can disrupt daily life, keeping it under control is a major health challenge.\n\nHow might infliximab help keep Crohn’s disease in remission?  \nInfliximab is a biologic drug known as a monoclonal antibody (a lab‑made protein). It attaches to tumour necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑α), a chemical that drives inflammation and is found in high amounts in people with Crohn’s disease. By neutralising TNF‑α, infliximab reduces the inflammation that causes symptoms. We wanted to know whether giving infliximab after a patient has reached remission can stop the disease from flaring up again, and whether the drug is safe for this purpose.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe set out to determine how effective and safe infliximab is for maintaining remission in people with Crohn’s disease. Specifically, we compared infliximab with placebo or other active treatments to see whether it reduces the chance of disease returning (clinical relapse) and to assess serious side‑effects or withdrawals from treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major medical databases up to June 2023 for randomised controlled trials that compared infliximab with placebo or other treatments for maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified nine trials that together enrolled 1,257 participants aged 18–69 years. Seven trials recruited patients who had never received a biologic drug; two included a mix of biologic‑naïve and non‑naïve participants. At baseline, three trials enrolled people already in remission, five enrolled people with varying disease activity, one enrolled biologic responders with active disease, and one focused only on patients with fistulating disease. All studies allowed some concomitant medication. Funding came from pharmaceutical companies, mixed commercial‑public sources, or public bodies.\n\nWhat are the main results?  \n– Infliximab probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo, with about 19 fewer relapses per 100 people treated.  \n– When infliximab is combined with purine analogues, it probably leads to a large reduction in relapse, about 47 fewer relapses per 100 people compared with purine analogues alone.  \n– Compared with biosimilar infliximab, the original infliximab may make little or no difference in preventing relapse (around 7 fewer relapses per 100) but may increase loss of clinical response slightly (about 17 more people per 100 may lose response).  \n– Infliximab may cause more people to stop treatment because of side‑effects when compared with a biosimilar, but evidence on serious adverse events remains very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because many studies were small and participants may have known which treatment they received, which can influence results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?  \nOur search covered studies published up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects the literature available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft contains several clarity problems that could confuse patients:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – the term “purine analogues” appears in the results without a lay definition, even though it is only explained in the key messages. Patients may not understand what these drugs are.\n2. **Contradictory confidence statement** – the limitation sentence says “We are moderately confident in the evidence because many studies were small and participants may have known which treatment they received,” which is confusing because small, possibly unblinded studies usually lower confidence. The wording suggests moderate confidence despite clear limitations.\n3. **Awkward, passive construction** – “The evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search.” This passive phrasing is hard to follow and adds unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Long, dense sentence in the main results** – “Infliximab may cause a large increase in withdrawals because of adverse events when compared with a biosimilar, but evidence on serious adverse events remains very uncertain.” This sentence exceeds 30 words and packs two ideas together, making it difficult for a lay reader.\n5. **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – “All studies allowed some form of concomitant medication during their duration.” The sentence is noun‑heavy and could be expressed more directly.\n\n**Suggested rewrites**:\n- *Original*: “When infliximab is combined with purine analogues, it probably leads to a large reduction in relapse, about 47 fewer relapses per 100 people compared with purine analogues alone.”\n  *Rewrite*: “When infliximab is given together with purine analogues – medicines that calm the immune system – it probably prevents about 47 more relapses per 100 people than using purine analogues alone.”\n- *Original*: “We are moderately confident in the evidence because many studies were small and participants may have known which treatment they received, which can influence results.”\n  *Rewrite*: “We have moderate confidence in some of the findings, but the evidence is limited because the studies were small and often not blinded, so participants may have known which treatment they received.”\n- *Original*: “The evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search.”\n  *Rewrite*: “We searched for studies up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects research published up to that date.”\n- *Original*: “Infliximab may cause a large increase in withdrawals because of adverse events when compared with a biosimilar, but evidence on serious adverse events remains very uncertain.”\n  *Rewrite*: “Compared with a biosimilar, infliximab may lead many more people to stop treatment because of side‑effects. We are very uncertain whether serious adverse events differ between the two.”\n- *Original*: “All studies allowed some form of concomitant medication during their duration.”\n  *Rewrite*: “All studies permitted participants to take other medicines at the same time.”\n\n**Metric support**: The PLS evaluation shows a high passive‑voice count (20, beyond the typical PLS range) and a high nominalisation count (25, also beyond typical limits). Noun count is 178 (well above the median), and readability metrics (SMOG 15.2, complex words 168) indicate the text is more complex than typical patient‑leaflet summaries. These numbers confirm the editorial observations of passive, noun‑heavy, and complex language. The identified issues need to be addressed before the summary can be considered ready for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: passive voice (20, beyond P90), nominalisations (25, beyond P90), nouns (178, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.2, beyond P90), complex words (168, beyond P90) and long words (228, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than usual, supporting the need for the clarity and style improvements listed above."
