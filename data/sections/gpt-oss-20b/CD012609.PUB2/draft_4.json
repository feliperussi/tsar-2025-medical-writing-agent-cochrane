  "draft": "Is infliximab (a medicine that blocks inflammation) helpful for keeping Crohn’s disease in remission?\n\nKey messages\n– Infliximab (a medicine that blocks inflammation) probably helps keep Crohn’s disease in remission by reducing the chance of a flare‑up compared with placebo, and it works even better when given together with purine analogues (drugs that calm the immune system).  \n– Infliximab appears to work similarly to biosimilar infliximab (a copy of the original biologic medicine), but current studies do not give clear evidence of any difference in safety or effectiveness.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to confirm how well infliximab prevents flares, to clarify its safety profile, and to compare it directly with other active treatments over longer periods.\n\nWhat is Crohn’s disease and why does it matter?  \nCrohn’s disease is a long‑lasting (chronic) condition that causes inflammation – swelling and irritation – in the digestive tract. People may have pain, diarrhoea, weight loss and fatigue. Inflammation can also lead to serious complications such as bowel damage or fistulas (abnormal connections between organs). Because the disease often flares up and can disrupt daily life, keeping it under control is a major health challenge.\n\nHow might infliximab help keep Crohn’s disease in remission?  \nInfliximab is a biologic drug known as a monoclonal antibody (a lab‑made protein). It attaches to tumour necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑α), a chemical that drives inflammation and is found in high amounts in people with Crohn’s disease. By neutralising TNF‑α, infliximab reduces the inflammation that causes symptoms. We wanted to know whether giving infliximab after a patient has reached remission can stop the disease from flaring up again, and whether the drug is safe for this purpose.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe set out to determine how effective and safe infliximab is for maintaining remission in people with Crohn’s disease. Specifically, we compared infliximab with placebo or other active treatments to see whether it reduces the chance of disease returning (clinical relapse) and to assess serious side‑effects or withdrawals from treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major medical databases up to June 2023 for randomised controlled trials that compared infliximab with placebo or other treatments for maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified nine trials that together enrolled 1,257 participants aged 18–69 years. Seven trials recruited patients who had never received a biologic drug; two included a mix of biologic‑naïve and non‑naïve participants. At baseline, three trials enrolled people already in remission, five enrolled people with varying disease activity, one enrolled biologic responders with active disease, and one focused only on patients with fistulating disease. All studies permitted participants to take other medicines at the same time. Funding came from pharmaceutical companies, mixed commercial‑public sources, or public bodies.\n\nWhat are the main results?  \n– Infliximab probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo, with about 19 fewer relapses per 100 people treated.  \n– When infliximab is given together with purine analogues – medicines that calm the immune system – it probably prevents about 47 more relapses per 100 people than using purine analogues alone.  \n– Compared with biosimilar infliximab, the original infliximab may make little or no difference in preventing relapse (around 7 fewer relapses per 100) but may increase loss of clinical response slightly (about 17 more people per 100 may lose response).  \n– Compared with a biosimilar, infliximab may lead many more people to stop treatment because of side‑effects. We are very uncertain whether serious adverse events differ between the two.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate confidence in some of the findings, but the evidence is limited because the studies were small and often not blinded, so participants may have known which treatment they received. This can influence results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?  \nWe searched for studies up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects research published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical checks because it contains a factual inaccuracy about the comparison with biosimilar infliximab: it states that the original infliximab results in “around 7 fewer relapses per 100” when the source data show the opposite (the original has about 7 more relapses per 100 than the biosimilar). This mis‑statement undermines the reliability of the summary. In addition, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Incorrect direction of effect** – \"around 7 fewer relapses per 100\" is wrong; it should convey that the original may cause about 7 more relapses per 100.\n2. **Complex, jargon‑heavy sentence** – \"Compared with biosimilar infliximab, the original infliximab may make little or no difference in preventing relapse (around 7 fewer relapses per 100) but may increase loss of clinical response slightly (about 17 more people per 100 may lose response).\" This sentence is long, uses nominalisations, and mixes two different outcomes, making it hard to follow.\n3. **Passive‑voice heavy sections** – The draft contains many passive constructions (e.g., \"The evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search\"), which obscure who performed the actions and increase reading difficulty. The PLS evaluation shows 20 passive instances (P90) and 23 nominalisations (P90), both well above typical PLS ranges.\n4. **Unexplained technical terms** – Terms such as \"biosimilar\", \"purine analogues\", and \"clinical relapse\" are introduced without simple definitions, which can leave patients confused.\n5. **Long sentences** – Several sentences exceed 30 words (e.g., the biosimilar comparison sentence above), exceeding the optimal 15‑20 word range (words_per_sentence = 19.71, already at the lower quartile but still containing dense information).\n\nSuggested concrete rewrites:\n- **Correct factual error:** \"Compared with biosimilar infliximab, the original infliximab may cause about 7 more relapses per 100 people, and it may increase loss of clinical response by about 17 more people per 100.\"\n- **Simplify the biosimilar sentence:** \"When we compared the original drug with a biosimilar, the original led to slightly more relapses (about 7 extra per 100) and a higher chance of losing response (about 17 extra per 100).\"\n- **Replace passive with active:** Change \"The evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search\" to \"We searched for studies up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects research published until that date.\"\n- **Define jargon:** After first use, add brief explanations, e.g., \"biosimilar (a copy of the original biologic medicine)\" and \"purine analogues (drugs that calm the immune system)\".\n- **Break long sentences:** Split the sentence about limitations into two: \"We are moderately confident in the findings. However, the studies were small and often not blinded, so participants may have known which treatment they received.\"\n\nThese changes address the factual error, improve readability, reduce passive voice and nominalisation, and ensure the summary meets the Cochrane Plain Language style guide. **Metrics support:** The draft shows high passive voice (20, P90) and nominalisation (23, P90) counts, as well as elevated complex‑word counts (complex_words = 163, BEYOND_P90) and long‑word counts (229, BEYOND_P90). Reducing passive constructions and simplifying vocabulary will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit (690 words) and has good overall readability scores (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 48, grade 11.4). However, several metrics deviate markedly: passive voice (20, P90), nominalisations (23, P90), nouns (181, P90), SMOG index (15, BEYOND_P90), and high counts of complex and long words (complex_words = 163, long_words = 229, both BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more difficult vocabulary than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need for simplification and active‑voice revisions."
