  "draft": "Is infliximab (a medicine that blocks inflammation) helpful for keeping Crohn's disease in remission?\n\nKey messages\n- Infliximab probably helps keep Crohn's disease in remission by lowering the chance of a flare‑up compared with placebo, and it works even better when combined with purine analogues (drugs that calm the immune system).  \n- Infliximab appears to work similarly to biosimilar infliximab (a copy of the original biologic medicine), but current studies do not give clear evidence of any difference in safety or effectiveness.  \n- Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to confirm how well infliximab prevents flares, to clarify its safety profile, and to compare it directly with other active treatments over longer periods.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease and why does it matter?\nCrohn's disease is a long‑lasting (chronic) condition that causes inflammation – swelling and irritation – in the digestive tract. People with the disease may experience pain, diarrhoea, weight loss and fatigue. Inflammation can also lead to serious complications such as bowel damage or fistulas (abnormal connections between organs). Because the disease often flares up and can disrupt daily life, keeping it under control is a major health challenge.\n\nHow might infliximab help keep Crohn's disease in remission?\nInfliximab is a biologic drug known as a monoclonal antibody (a lab‑made protein that blocks a specific part of the immune system). It binds to tumour necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑α), a chemical that drives inflammation and is found in high amounts in people with Crohn's disease. By neutralising TNF‑α, infliximab reduces the inflammation that causes symptoms. Researchers wanted to know whether giving infliximab after a patient has reached remission can prevent the disease from flaring again, and whether the drug is safe for this purpose.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to determine how effective and safe infliximab is for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease. Specifically, we compared infliximab with placebo or other active treatments to see whether it reduces the chance of disease returning (clinical relapse) and to assess serious side‑effects or withdrawals from treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases up to June 2023 for randomised controlled trials that compared infliximab with placebo or other treatments for maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified nine trials that together enrolled 1,257 participants aged 18–69 years. Seven trials recruited patients who had never received a biologic drug; two included a mix of biologic‑naïve and non‑naïve participants. At baseline, three trials enrolled people already in remission, five enrolled people with varying disease activity, one enrolled biologic responders with active disease, and one focused only on patients with fistulating disease. All studies allowed some concomitant medication. Funding came from pharmaceutical companies, mixed commercial‑public sources, or public bodies.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n- Infliximab probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo, with about 19 fewer relapses per 100 people treated.  \n- When infliximab is combined with purine analogues, it probably leads to a large reduction in relapse, about 47 fewer relapses per 100 people compared with purine analogues alone.  \n- Compared with biosimilar infliximab, the original infliximab may make little or no difference in preventing relapse (around 7 fewer relapses per 100) but may increase loss of clinical response slightly (about 17 more people per 100 may lose response).  \n- Infliximab may cause more withdrawals because of adverse events when compared with a biosimilar, but evidence on serious adverse events remains very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because many studies were small and participants may have known which treatment they received, which can influence results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nOur search covered studies published up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects the literature available at that time.",

Three to five key issues would likely confuse patients:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – terms like “purine analogues” and “biosimilar infliximab” appear in the main text without a simple definition, leaving readers unsure what they mean.\n2. **Passive‑voice heavy** – the sentence “The evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search.” is passive and awkward, contributing to the high passive‑voice count (20, P90) and making it harder to see who did what.\n3. **Noun‑heavy, abstract wording** – “Infliximab may cause a large increase in withdrawals because of adverse events when compared with a biosimilar.” uses many nouns and a complex structure, reducing readability (SMOG 15.2, BEYOND_P90).\n4. **Overly long sentence** – “Researchers wanted to know whether giving infliximab after a patient has reached remission can prevent the disease from flaring up again, and whether the drug is safe for this purpose.” (30 words) is difficult for a lay audience.\n5. **Wordy phrasing** – several sentences could be tightened (e.g., “We are moderately confident in the evidence because many studies were small and participants may have known which treatment they received, which can influence results.”).\n\nSuggested concrete rewrites:\n- Define jargon at first use: “purine analogues (drugs that calm the immune system)” and “biosimilar infliximab (a copy of the original biologic medicine)”.\n- Change passive to active: “We searched studies up to June 2023, so the evidence is current.”\n- Simplify noun‑heavy sentence: “People may be more likely to stop the drug because of side‑effects compared with a biosimilar.”\n- Split the long sentence: “Researchers wanted to know two things. First, can infliximab given after remission stop the disease from flaring up again? Second, is the drug safe for this purpose?”\n- Reduce wordiness: “We are moderately confident in the evidence, but many studies were small and participants may have known their treatment, which can affect results.”\n\nThese changes address the most confusing elements and also bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns (active‑voice <13, nominalisations <13, nouns <116, SMOG <12, complex words <84).",
