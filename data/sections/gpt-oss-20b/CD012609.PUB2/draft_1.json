  "draft": "Is infliximab (a medicine that blocks inflammation) helpful for keeping Crohn's disease in remission?\n\nKey messages\n- Infliximab (a medicine that blocks inflammation) probably helps keep Crohn's disease in remission by reducing the chance of clinical relapse (return of disease symptoms) compared with placebo (inactive treatment), and when used together with purine analogues (medicines that suppress the immune system) it likely works even better; however, the evidence on side‑effects such as serious or other adverse events is very uncertain.\n- Infliximab appears to work similarly to biosimilar infliximab (a copy of a biologic medicine), but the current studies do not provide clear evidence about any differences in effectiveness or safety.\n- More well‑designed, larger trials are needed to confirm how well infliximab prevents disease flare, to clarify its safety profile, and to compare it directly with other active treatments over longer periods.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhat is Crohn's disease and why does it matter?\nCrohn's disease is a long‑lasting (chronic) condition that causes inflammation – swelling and irritation – in the digestive tract. People with the disease can have pain, diarrhoea, weight loss and fatigue, and the inflammation can lead to serious complications such such as bowel damage or fistulas (abnormal connections between organs). Because the disease often flares up and can affect daily life, keeping it under control is a major health challenge. Standard treatments include medicines that reduce inflammation, but many patients still need stronger options to stay in a calm phase called \"remission\" – a period when symptoms are minimal or absent.\n\nHow might infliximab help keep Crohn's disease in remission?\nInfliximab is a type of biologic drug known as a monoclonal antibody. It works by attaching to a protein called tumour necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑α), which is a chemical that drives inflammation and is found in high amounts in people with Crohn's disease. By neutralising TNF‑α, infliximab can reduce the inflammation that causes symptoms. Researchers want to know whether giving infliximab after a patient has already reached remission can prevent the disease from flaring up again, and whether the drug is safe to use for this purpose.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors set out to determine how effective and safe infliximab is for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease. Specifically, they compared infliximab with placebo or other active treatments to see whether it reduces the chance of the disease returning (clinical relapse) and to assess any serious side‑effects or withdrawals from treatment.\n\nMethods\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared infliximab with placebo or other treatments for maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified nine randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,257 people with Crohn’s disease, aged 18 to 69 years. Seven trials recruited patients who had never received biologic therapy, and two included a mix of biologic‑naïve and non‑naïve participants. At the start of the studies, three trials enrolled people in remission, five enrolled people with varying levels of disease activity, one enrolled biologic responders who still had active disease, and one focused only on patients with fistulating disease. All studies allowed some concomitant medication. Funding was reported for eight trials: four were funded solely by pharmaceutical companies, two received a mix of commercial and public support, two were publicly funded, and one trial did not specify its funding source. The trials compared infliximab with placebo, infliximab plus purine analogues versus purine analogues alone, infliximab versus biosimilar agents (both intravenous and subcutaneous), and infliximab versus adalimumab. Details on the countries, settings, or follow‑up duration were not provided in the abstract.\n\nMain results: Infliximab reduces clinical relapse\nInfliximab probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo, with about 19 fewer relapses per 100 people treated. When infliximab is combined with purine analogues, it probably leads to a large reduction in relapse, about 47 fewer relapses per 100 people compared with purine analogues alone. Compared with biosimilar infliximab, the original infliximab may make little or no difference in preventing relapse (around 7 fewer relapses per 100) but may increase loss of clinical response slightly (about 17 more people per 100 may lose response). Infliximab may also cause a large increase in withdrawals because of adverse events when compared with a biosimilar. It is unclear whether infliximab affects serious adverse events compared with other active treatments such as purine analogues or adalimumab.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search.",

This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement that subheadings be question‑style. Additionally, the draft contains several clarity and style problems that would confuse readers:\n1. Jargon without plain‑language definitions (e.g., “monoclonal antibody”, “purine analogues”, “biosimilar”).\n2. Frequent passive constructions that hide who did what (e.g., “The evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search.”).\n3. Long, noun‑heavy sentences that are hard to follow (e.g., the paragraph under “Main results: Infliximab reduces clinical relapse”).\n4. Inconsistent use of bullet‑point dashes and missing blank lines between sections, making the layout dense.\nSuggested improvements:\n- Rewrite subheadings as questions (e.g., change \"Methods\" to \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"Limitations\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"Currency\" to \"How up‑to‑date is the evidence?\").\n- Replace technical terms with simple explanations: \"monoclonal antibody (a lab‑made protein that blocks a specific part of the immune system)\"; \"purine analogues (drugs that calm the immune system)\"; \"biosimilar (a copy of the original biologic medicine)\".\n- Convert passive sentences to active voice: \"We searched the literature up to June 2023\" instead of \"The evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search\".\n- Shorten long sentences and use more verbs: \"Infliximab probably cuts the chance of relapse. About 19 fewer out of 100 people relapsed compared with placebo.\"\n- Use dashes for bullet points and add blank lines between headings and paragraphs.\nThese changes will also address metric deviations (high passive_voice count, long words, complex words, and high noun count) and improve overall readability.",
