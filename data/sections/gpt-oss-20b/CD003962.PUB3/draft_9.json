  "draft": "Are non‑immune‑suppressing treatments (like blood‑pressure medicines, tonsil removal, and supplements) effective and safe for people with IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy)?\n\nKey messages\n- Blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS) usually lower protein in the urine (proteinuria), improve blood tests that show kidney damage (serum creatinine), and give a small boost to kidney filtering ability (creatinine clearance). Serious side‑effects were not reported more often, but the studies were small and short‑term (moderate‑certainty evidence).\n- Removing the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may raise the chance that protein and tiny amounts of blood disappear from the urine, but the evidence comes only from Japanese patients, so we cannot be sure it works for other groups (low‑certainty evidence).\n- Fish‑oil supplements, blood‑thinners (anticoagulants), traditional Chinese herbal products and the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine showed only modest or uncertain benefits. The evidence is low‑quality, and larger, longer studies are needed.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary kidney disease. It starts in the tiny filtering units called glomeruli, where a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up and causes inflammation and scarring. Over time the kidneys filter less blood, and about one‑in‑five to two‑in‑five people with IgAN will need dialysis or a kidney transplant within 25 years. Because the disease progresses slowly, many patients are diagnosed only after significant kidney damage has occurred.\n\nWhat treatments that do not suppress the immune system are used for IgA nephropathy?\nWe usually try non‑immune‑suppressing approaches first. They include:\n- Blood‑pressure medicines, especially drugs that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS), which help lower pressure and protect the kidneys.\n- Strategies that aim to reduce proteinuria (protein in the urine, a sign that the kidneys are leaking).\n- Dietary changes.\n- Surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy).\n- Supplements such as fish oil or certain herbal products.\nThese options aim to slow kidney damage while avoiding the side‑effects of long‑term immune‑suppressing drugs.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether these non‑immune‑suppressing treatments actually help people with IgAN. Specifically, we compared benefits such as lower proteinuria, better kidney‑function tests, and fewer cases of kidney failure, against any harms. We looked at all randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that tested antihypertensives, dietary measures, tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish oil, traditional herbal products and antimalarial drugs in children and adults with a confirmed diagnosis of IgAN.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register for studies up to December 2023. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed quality. We combined results with meta‑analysis and judged confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 80 trials involving 4,856 participants. The most common studies (37) looked at blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system. Other interventions tested were tonsillectomy, anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplements, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial drugs. \n- RAS‑blocking medicines usually reduced proteinuria, lowered serum creatinine and modestly improved creatinine clearance. \n- Tonsillectomy may substantially increase the chance that protein and microscopic blood disappear from the urine, but the studies were done only in Japanese patients, so the findings may not apply elsewhere. \n- Anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplements and traditional Chinese medicines each showed a small improvement in kidney function compared with placebo, but the benefits disappeared when compared with standard care. \n- One small study of hydroxychloroquine reported a large increase in patients achieving a major reduction in proteinuria, but it did not improve kidney‑function tests. \nOverall, RAS‑blocking blood‑pressure medicines appear to be the most beneficial non‑immune‑suppressing treatment for IgAN, and their benefits likely outweigh any harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany trials were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and several studies did not report all needed data. Follow‑up periods were short and participants were not diverse, so we have little confidence about long‑term benefits or harms.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence searched up to December 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because several sentences use unexplained medical jargon, contain overly long constructions, and use inconsistent terminology that would likely confuse a lay reader. Specific problems:\n1. **Jargon without definition** – \"proteinuria\", \"serum creatinine\" and \"creatinine clearance\" are mentioned in the key‑message bullet without any plain‑language explanation. *Rewrite*: \"proteinuria (protein in the urine), serum creatinine (a blood test that shows how well the kidneys are working), and creatinine clearance (a measure of how efficiently the kidneys filter waste).\"\n2. **Overly long sentence** – \"Blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS) usually lower protein in the urine (proteinuria), improve blood tests that show kidney damage (serum creatinine), and give a small boost to kidney filtering ability (creatinine clearance).\" (34 words). *Rewrite*: \"Blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS) usually lower protein in the urine, improve the blood test for kidney damage, and give a small boost to kidney filtering ability.\"\n3. **Inconsistent term** – The draft alternates between \"non‑immune‑suppressing\" and \"non‑immunosuppressive\". The phrase \"non‑immune‑suppressing\" is not standard and may confuse readers. *Rewrite*: Use \"non‑immunosuppressive\" throughout.\n4. **Unexplained drug name** – \"hydroxychloroquine\" is mentioned without stating that it is an antimalarial drug used off‑label. *Rewrite*: \"the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (used off‑label for kidney disease)\".\n5. **Noun‑heavy style** – The draft contains 201 nouns (well above the typical PLS range) and many complex words (159) and long words (212), making sentences feel dense. Re‑write sentences to use more active verbs and simpler words (e.g., replace \"anticoagulant therapy\" with \"blood‑thinning medicines\").\nThese issues need to be addressed before the PLS can be considered ready for patients.\n\n**Metrics support**: The evaluation shows noun count (201) and complex‑word counts (159) far beyond typical PLS ranges, confirming the noun‑heavy, jargon‑rich style. Passive voice (17) and words per sentence (18.7) are acceptable, but the identified long sentence and jargon outweigh the metric‑acceptable areas.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability metrics (words per sentence, reading grade, active voice). However, it deviates strongly on noun count, complex words, and long words (all beyond the 90th percentile), indicating a noun‑heavy, jargon‑rich text. These metric deviations align with the editorial finding of excessive technical language and dense phrasing."
