  "draft": "Are non‑immune‑suppressing treatments (like blood‑pressure medicines, tonsil removal, and supplements) effective and safe for people with IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– Blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS – a hormone system that controls blood pressure) usually lower protein in the urine and improve kidney‑function tests such as creatinine clearance. The studies were small and short‑term, and we did not see a clear rise in serious side‑effects.  \n– Removing the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may increase the chance that protein and tiny amounts of blood disappear from the urine, but the evidence comes only from Japanese patients, so we cannot be sure it works for other groups.  \n– Fish‑oil supplements, blood‑thinners (anticoagulants), traditional Chinese herbal products and the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine showed only modest or uncertain benefits. The evidence is low‑quality, and larger, longer studies are needed.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?  \nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary kidney disease. It starts in the tiny filtering units called glomeruli, where a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up, causing inflammation and scarring. Over time the kidneys filter less blood. About 1 in 5 to 2 in 5 people with IgAN will need dialysis or a kidney transplant within 25 years. The disease often progresses slowly, so many patients are not diagnosed until kidney damage is advanced.\n\nWhat treatments that do not suppress the immune system are used for IgA nephropathy?  \nWe usually try non‑immune‑suppressing approaches first. They include:  \n– Blood‑pressure medicines, especially drugs that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS).  \n– Strategies that aim to reduce proteinuria (protein in the urine).  \n– Dietary changes.  \n– Surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy).  \n– Supplements such as fish oil or certain herbal products.  \n\nThese options aim to slow kidney damage while avoiding the side‑effects of long‑term immune‑suppressing drugs.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether these treatments actually help people with IgAN. Specifically, we compared benefits such as lower protein in the urine, better kidney‑function tests, and fewer cases of kidney failure, against any harms. We examined all randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that tested antihypertensives, dietary measures, tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish oil, traditional herbal products and antimalarial drugs in children and adults with a confirmed diagnosis of IgAN.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register up to December 2023. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed quality. We combined results with meta‑analysis and judged confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 80 trials that enrolled 4 856 participants. The most frequently studied were blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (37 studies). Other interventions included tonsillectomy, anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplementation, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial therapy.  \n\n– RAS‑blocking medicines usually reduced protein loss in the urine, lowered blood markers of kidney damage and modestly improved kidney filtration.  \n– Tonsillectomy may substantially increase the chance that protein and microscopic blood disappear from the urine, but the studies were done only in Japanese patients, so the findings may not apply elsewhere.  \n– Anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplements and traditional Chinese medicines each showed a small improvement in kidney function compared with placebo, but the benefits disappeared when compared with standard care.  \n– One small study of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine reported a large increase in the number of people whose kidney function improved, but the evidence is very limited.  \n\nOverall, RAS‑blocking blood‑pressure medicines appear to be the most beneficial non‑immune‑suppressing treatment for IgAN, and their benefits likely outweigh any harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and several studies did not report all needed data. Follow‑up periods were short and participants were not diverse, so we have little confidence about long‑term benefits or harms.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence searched up to December 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical factual‑accuracy check: the sentence \"One small study of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine reported a large increase in the number of people whose kidney function improved\" misrepresents the source evidence, which reports only a large increase in protein‑urine reduction (RR 3.13) and does not show a kidney‑function benefit. This inaccuracy must be corrected. In addition, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – \"proteinuria\" appears without definition. Rewrite as \"proteinuria (protein in the urine)\" the first time it is used.\n2. **Long, dense sentences** – e.g., \"We examined all randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that tested antihypertensives, dietary measures, tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish oil, traditional herbal products and antimalarial drugs in children and adults with a confirmed diagnosis of IgAN.\" (30+ words). Split into two shorter sentences.\n3. **Passive voice** – many statements hide the actor, e.g., \"The most frequently studied were blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (37 studies).\" Change to active: \"We most frequently studied blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (37 studies).\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – the draft contains 196 nouns, far above typical PLS levels, making text feel abstract. Replace noun‑heavy phrases with verbs, e.g., change \"The benefits of RAS inhibition appear to outweigh the harms\" to \"RAS‑blocking medicines seem to give more benefit than harm.\"\n5. **Missing paragraph breaks** – some sections (e.g., the Methods paragraph) run into the next without a blank line, reducing readability. Insert a blank line before each new subheading.\nThese revisions, together with correcting the antimalarial claim, will bring the summary into full compliance with the style guide and improve patient‑facing clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits and overall conforms to typical PLS patterns, but deviates on several lexical metrics: nouns (196, >P90), SMOG index (14.5, >P90), complex words (151, >P90) and long words (206, >P90). These indicate a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style that should be simplified. Passive voice count (15) is high (P75), supporting the need to shift to active constructions."
