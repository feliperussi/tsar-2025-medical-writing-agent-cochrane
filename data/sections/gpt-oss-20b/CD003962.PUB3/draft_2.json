  "draft": "Are non‑immune‑suppressing treatments (like blood‑pressure medicines, tonsil removal, and supplements) effective and safe for people with IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Medicines that lower blood pressure, especially those that block the renin‑angiotensin system (a hormone system that controls blood pressure), usually reduce protein in the urine (proteinuria) and improve kidney‑function tests. No clear increase in serious side‑effects was reported, but the evidence comes from small, short‑term studies of limited quality.  \n– Removing the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may raise the chance that protein and tiny amounts of blood disappear from the urine in Japanese patients. Other approaches such as fish‑oil supplements, blood‑thinning medicines (anticoagulants), or traditional herbal products show only modest or uncertain benefits and no clear advantage over usual care.  \n– Because most trials were small and of uncertain quality, we need larger, longer‑lasting studies to confirm whether these non‑immune‑suppressing treatments can safely preserve kidney function and prevent kidney failure.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary kidney disease that starts in the tiny filtering units called glomeruli. In IgAN, a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in the kidneys, causing inflammation and scarring. Over time this can lead to a gradual loss of kidney function. About 20 % to 40 % of people with IgAN will need dialysis or a kidney transplant within 25 years. The disease often progresses slowly, so many patients do not notice it until kidney damage is advanced.\n\nWhat non‑immune‑suppressing treatments are used for IgA nephropathy?\nWe usually try treatments that do not suppress the immune system first. These include:  \n– Blood‑pressure medicines, especially those that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS), which help lower pressure and protect the kidneys.  \n– Strategies to reduce proteinuria (protein in the urine, a sign of kidney damage).  \n– Dietary changes.  \n– Tonsil removal (tonsillectomy).  \n– Supplements such as fish oil or certain herbal products.  \nThese approaches aim to slow kidney damage while avoiding the side‑effects of long‑term immune‑suppressing drugs.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether these non‑immune‑suppressing therapies actually help people with IgAN. Specifically, we compared the benefits (such as lower protein in the urine, better kidney function, and fewer cases of kidney failure) and any harms of each treatment. We looked at all randomised trials that tested medicines or procedures like antihypertensives, dietary measures, tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish oil, and traditional herbal products in children and adults with a confirmed diagnosis of IgAN.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register up to December 2023 for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials in adults and children with biopsy‑proven IgAN. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality. We combined results using meta‑analysis and judged confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 80 trials involving 4 856 participants. The most frequently studied were blood‑pressure medicines that block the RAS (37 studies). Other interventions included tonsillectomy, anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplementation, traditional Chinese medicines, and antimalarial therapy.  \n\n– RAS‑blocking medicines probably lower proteinuria, improve kidney‑function tests (such as creatinine clearance, a measure of how well the kidneys filter blood), and may slightly increase kidney filtration.  \n– Tonsillectomy may substantially increase the chance of proteinuria remission and disappearance of microscopic blood in the urine, but the studies were done only in Japanese patients, so the findings may not apply to other groups.  \n– Anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplements, and traditional Chinese medicines showed small improvements in kidney function, but these benefits disappeared when compared with standard care.  \n– Antimalarial therapy showed a large increase in the proportion of patients achieving a major reduction in proteinuria, but the evidence is based on a single small study.  \n\nOverall, blood‑pressure medicines that block the RAS appear to be the most beneficial non‑immune‑suppressing treatment for IgAN, and their benefits likely outweigh any harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many studies were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and several trials did not report all needed data. The short follow‑up periods and limited participant diversity also reduce our ability to judge long‑term benefits and harms.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence searched up to December 2023.",
