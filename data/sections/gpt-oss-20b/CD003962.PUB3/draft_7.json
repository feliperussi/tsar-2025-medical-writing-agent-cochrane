  "draft": "Are non‑immune‑suppressing treatments (like blood‑pressure medicines, tonsil removal, and supplements) effective and safe for people with IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy)?\n\nKey messages\n– Blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS – a hormone system that controls blood pressure) usually lower protein in the urine (proteinuria) and improve kidney‑function tests such as creatinine clearance. The studies were small and short‑term, and we did not see a clear rise in serious side‑effects.  \n– Removing the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may increase the chance that protein and tiny amounts of blood disappear from the urine, but the evidence comes only from Japanese patients, so we cannot be sure it works for other groups.  \n– Fish‑oil supplements, blood‑thinners (anticoagulants), traditional Chinese herbal products and the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine showed only modest or uncertain benefits. The evidence is low‑quality, and larger, longer studies are needed.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?  \nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary kidney disease. It starts in the tiny filtering units called glomeruli, where a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up, causing inflammation and scarring. Over time the kidneys filter less blood. About one‑in‑five to two‑in‑five people with IgAN will need dialysis or a kidney transplant within 25 years. The disease often progresses slowly, so many patients are not diagnosed until kidney damage is advanced.\n\nWhat non‑immune‑suppressing treatments are used for IgA nephropathy?  \nWe usually try non‑immune‑suppressing approaches first. They include:  \n– Blood‑pressure medicines, especially drugs that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS).  \n– Strategies that aim to reduce proteinuria (protein in the urine).  \n– Dietary changes.  \n– Surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectin).  \n– Supplements such as fish oil or certain herbal products.  \n\nThese options aim to slow kidney damage while avoiding the side‑effects of long‑term immune‑suppressing drugs.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether these treatments actually help people with IgAN. Specifically, we compared benefits such as lower proteinuria, better kidney‑function tests, and fewer cases of kidney failure, against any harms. We looked at all randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that tested antihypertensives, dietary measures, tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish oil, traditional herbal products and antimalarial drugs in children and adults with a confirmed diagnosis of IgAN.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register for studies up to December 2023. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed quality. We combined results with meta‑analysis and judged confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 80 trials that enrolled 4 856 participants. The most frequently studied were blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑or-angiotensin system (37 studies). Other interventions included tonsillectomy, anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplementation, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial therapy.  \n\n– RAS‑blocking medicines usually reduced proteinuria, lowered blood markers of kidney damage and modestly improved kidney filtration.  \n– Tonsillectomy may substantially increase the chance that protein and microscopic blood disappear from the urine, but the studies were done only in Japanese patients, so the findings may not apply elsewhere.  \n– Anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplements and traditional Chinese medicines each showed a small improvement in kidney function compared with placebo, but the benefits disappeared when compared with standard care.  \n– One small study of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine reported a large increase in the proportion of patients achieving a major reduction in proteinuria, but it did not show a benefit for kidney‑function tests.  \n\nOverall, RAS‑blocking blood‑pressure medicines appear to be the most beneficial non‑immune‑suppressing treatment for IgAN, and their benefits likely outweigh any harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and several studies did not report all needed data. Follow‑up periods were short and participants were not diverse, so we have little confidence about long‑term benefits or harms.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence searched up to December 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the completeness, subheading, factual accuracy, and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that could confuse patients:\\n1. Inconsistent terminology – the draft uses \"non‑immune‑suppressing\" instead of the standard \"non‑immunosuppressive\" term used throughout the source material.\\n2. A typo in a key bullet – \"tonsillectin\" should be \"tonsillectomy\".\\n3. Vague wording – \"lowered blood markers of kidney damage\" does not tell readers which tests are meant.\\n4. Ambiguous safety statement – \"did not see a clear rise in serious side‑effects\" is unclear about whether side‑effects were absent or just not measured.\\nThese issues reduce readability and may mislead the audience. The metrics also show unusually high lexical complexity (complex_words=157, long_words=209, complex_words_dc=313) and a high noun count (196), confirming the need for simpler wording and fewer noun‑heavy constructions. Recommended rewrites are provided below.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit and has good sentence length (18.3 words per sentence, 11th‑grade reading level). However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns in several lexical metrics: nouns (196, beyond P90), SMOG (14.7, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall (8.2, beyond P90), complex words (157, beyond P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (313, beyond P90) and long words (209, indicating the text is more complex than most Cochrane PLSs. These deviations support the need to simplify terminology and reduce noun‑heavy phrasing."
