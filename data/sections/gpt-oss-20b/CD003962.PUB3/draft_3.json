  "draft": "Are treatments that do not suppress the immune system (like blood‑pressure medicines, tonsil removal, and supplements) effective and safe for people with IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy – plain language summary\n\nKey messages\n– Medicines that lower blood pressure, especially those that block the renin‑angiotensin system (a hormone system that helps control blood pressure), usually reduce protein in the urine (proteinuria, a sign that the kidneys are leaking protein) and improve blood tests that show kidney health. The studies were small and short‑term, but we did not see clear increases in serious side‑effects.  \n– Removing the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may increase the chance that protein and tiny amounts of blood disappear from the urine, but the evidence comes only from Japanese patients, so we cannot be sure it works for other groups.  \n– Fish‑oil supplements, blood‑thinning medicines (anticoagulants), traditional herbal products and an antimalarial drug showed only modest or uncertain benefits, and the evidence is low‑quality. Larger, longer studies are needed to confirm whether these treatments can safely preserve kidney function and prevent kidney failure.  \n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?  \nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary kidney disease. It starts in the tiny filtering units called glomeruli, where a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up, causing inflammation and scarring. Over time the kidneys filter less blood. About 20 % to 40 % of people with IgAN need dialysis or a kidney transplant within 25 years. The disease often progresses slowly, so many people do not notice it until kidney damage is advanced.  \n\nWhat treatments that do not suppress the immune system are used for IgAN?  \nWe usually try non‑immune‑suppressing approaches first. They include:  \n– Blood‑pressure medicines, especially drugs that block the renin‑angiotensin system, which lower pressure and protect the kidneys.  \n– Strategies that aim to reduce proteinuria (protein in the urine).  \n– Dietary changes.  \n– Surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy).  \n– Supplements such as fish oil or certain herbal products.  \n\nThese options aim to slow kidney damage while avoiding the side‑effects of long‑term immune‑suppressing drugs.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether these treatments actually help people with IgAN. Specifically, we compared benefits such as lower protein in the urine, better kidney‑function tests, and fewer cases of kidney failure, against any harms. We examined all randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that tested antihypertensives, dietary measures, tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish oil, traditional herbal products and antimalarial drugs in children and adults with a confirmed diagnosis of IgAN.  \n\nHow did we conduct the first review?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register up to December 2023 for relevant trials. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed quality. We combined results with meta‑analysis and judged confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 80 trials that enrolled 4 856 participants. The most frequently studied were blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (37 studies). Other interventions included tonsillectomy, anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplementation, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial therapy.  \n\n– Blocking the renin‑angiotensin system usually lowers the amount of protein in the urine, improves blood tests that show kidney health (such as serum creatinine), and may increase kidney filtration a little.  \n– Tonsillectomy may substantially raise the chance that protein and microscopic blood disappear from the urine, but the studies were done only in Japanese patients, so‑that the findings may not apply elsewhere.  \n– Anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplements and traditional Chinese medicines showed small improvements in kidney function, but these benefits disappeared when the treatments were compared with standard care.  \n– One small study of an antimalarial drug found a large increase in the number of people whose urine protein fell by at least half, but the evidence is very limited.  \n\nOverall, blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system appear to be the most beneficial non‑immune‑suppressing treatment for IgAN, and their benefits likely outweigh any harms.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and several studies did not report all needed data. Follow‑up periods were short and participants were not diverse, so we have little confidence about long‑term benefits or harms.  \n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence searched up to December 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails critical clarity checks: (1) The title is not a clean question – it has mismatched parentheses and no question mark, which can confuse readers. (2) The first key‑message sentence is overly long and packs several ideas (definition of RAS, proteinuria, kidney‑health tests, safety) into one sentence, making it hard to follow. (3) Repeated use of “probably” in the results sentence (“Renin‑angiotensin system inhibition probably reduces protein loss … probably lowers … probably improves …”) is redundant and vague. (4) The statement about anticoagulant, fish‑oil and Chinese medicines (“benefits disappeared when the treatments were compared with standard care”) lacks context, leaving readers unsure whether the treatments were ineffective or the comparison was inappropriate. (5) The antimalarial drug is mentioned without any description, so patients may not know what it is. Suggested rewrites: - Title: “Are non‑immune‑suppressing treatments (like blood‑pressure medicines, tonsil removal, and supplements) effective and safe for people with IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy)?” - Key message 1: “Medicines that lower blood pressure, especially those that block the renin‑angiotensin system (a hormone system that controls blood pressure), usually reduce protein in the urine (proteinuria – a sign that kidneys are leaking protein) and improve kidney‑function blood tests. The studies were small and short‑term, and we did not see a clear increase in serious side‑effects.” - Results sentence: “Blocking the renin‑angiotensin system usually reduces protein loss in the urine, lowers blood markers of kidney damage, and modestly improves kidney filtration.” - Anticoagulant/fish‑oil sentence: “Anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplements and traditional Chinese medicines showed small improvements in kidney function when compared with placebo, but these benefits were not seen when the treatments were compared with standard care.” - Antimalarial sentence: “One small study of an antimalarial drug (e.g., hydroxychloroquine) reported a large increase in the number of people whose urine protein fell by at least half, but the evidence is very limited.” These changes address the major clarity problems while preserving factual accuracy. Metrics support the need for simplification: the draft’s SMOG index (14.3) and complex‑word counts (145) are well above typical PLS ranges, and the noun count (218) is far beyond the median, indicating overly dense, noun‑heavy prose.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights five out‑of‑range metrics: SMOG index (14.3, beyond P90), complex words (145, beyond P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (332, beyond P90), long words (214, beyond P90) and noun count (218, beyond P90). These indicate the draft is more complex than typical plain‑language summaries, supporting the need to reduce sentence length, simplify vocabulary, and use more active verbs."
