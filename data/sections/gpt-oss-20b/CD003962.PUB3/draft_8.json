  "draft": "Are non‑immunosuppressive treatments (like blood‑pressure medicines, tonsil removal, and supplements) effective and safe for people with IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy)?\n\nKey messages\n– Medicines that lower blood pressure by blocking the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS) usually reduce protein in the urine (proteinuria) and improve kidney‑function tests such as serum creatinine and creatinine clearance. Serious side‑effects were not reported more often than in control groups, but the studies were small and short‑term.\n– Removing the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may increase the chance that protein and tiny amounts of blood disappear from the urine, but the evidence comes only from Japanese patients, so we cannot be sure it works for other groups.\n– Fish‑oil supplements, blood‑thinners (anticoagulants), traditional Chinese herbal products and the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine showed only modest or uncertain benefits. The evidence is low‑quality, and larger, longer studies are needed.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?\nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary kidney disease. It starts in the tiny filtering units called glomeruli, where a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up, causing inflammation and scarring. Over time the kidneys filter less blood. About one‑in‑five to two‑in‑five people with IgAN will need dialysis or a kidney transplant within 25 years. The disease often progresses slowly, so many patients are not diagnosed until kidney damage is advanced.\n\nWhat treatments that do not suppress the immune system are used for IgA nephropathy?\nWe usually try non‑immunosuppressive approaches first. They include:\n– Blood‑pressure medicines, especially drugs that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS).\n– Strategies that aim to reduce proteinuria (protein in the urine).\n– Dietary changes.\n– Surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy).\n– Supplements such as fish oil or certain herbal products.\nThese options aim to slow kidney damage while avoiding the side‑effects of long‑term immune‑suppressing drugs.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether these non‑immunosuppressive treatments actually help people with IgAN. Specifically, we compared benefits such as lower proteinuria, better kidney‑function tests, and fewer cases of kidney failure, against any harms. We looked at all randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that tested antihypertensives, dietary measures, tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish oil, traditional herbal products and antimalarial drugs in children and adults with a confirmed diagnosis of IgAN.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register for studies up to December 2023. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed quality. We combined results with meta‑analysis and judged confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 80 trials that enrolled 4 856 participants. The most frequently studied were blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (37 studies). Other interventions included tonsillectomy, anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplementation, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial therapy.\n– RAS‑blocking medicines usually reduced proteinuria, lowered serum creatinine and improved creatinine clearance modestly.\n– Tonsillectomy may substantially increase the chance that protein and microscopic blood disappear from the urine, but the studies were done only in Japanese patients, so the findings may not apply elsewhere.\n– Anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplements and traditional Chinese medicines each showed a small improvement in kidney function compared with placebo, but the benefits disappeared when compared with standard care.\n– One small study of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine reported a large increase in the proportion of patients achieving a major reduction in proteinuria, but it did not improve kidney‑function tests.\nOverall, RAS‑blocking blood‑pressure medicines appear to be the most beneficial non‑immunosuppressive treatment for IgAN, and their benefits likely outweigh any harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany trials were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and several studies did not report all needed data. Follow‑up periods were short and participants were not diverse, so we have little confidence about long‑term benefits or harms.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence searched up to December 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural checklist, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a patient audience:\n1. **Unexplained medical terms** – e.g., \"proteinuria\", \"serum creatinine\" and \"creatinine clearance\" appear without lay definitions. Readers may not understand what these measurements mean.\n   *Rewrite*: \"proteinuria (protein in the urine, a sign that the kidneys are leaking)\"; \"serum creatinine (a blood test that shows how well the kidneys are filtering waste)\"; \"creatinine clearance (a test that measures how efficiently the kidneys are cleaning the blood)\".\n2. **Vague certainty language** – the sentence \"Renin‑angiotensin system inhibition probably reduces protein loss in the urine, probably lowers blood markers of kidney damage, and probably improves kidney filtration slightly\" repeats \"probably\" and leaves readers unsure of the strength of the evidence.\n   *Rewrite*: \"Blocking the renin‑angiotensin system usually reduces protein in the urine, lowers blood tests that indicate kidney damage, and gives a small improvement in kidney filtering ability (moderate‑certainty evidence).\"\n3. **Bullet‑point formatting** – the key‑message list uses an en‑dash (–) instead of the required hyphen (-). This breaches the style guide and can affect readability.\n   *Rewrite*: replace each \"–\" with \"-\" at the start of bullet items.\n4. **Long, dense sentence in the results section** – \"We identified 80 trials that enrolled 4 856 participants. The most frequently studied were blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (37 studies). Other interventions included tonsillectomy, anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplementation, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial therapy.\" This packs three ideas into one paragraph, making it harder to follow.\n   *Rewrite*: \"We identified 80 trials involving 4,856 participants.

Other interventions tested were tonsillectomy, anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplements, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial drugs.\"\n5. **High noun density and passive voice** – the draft contains 197 nouns (P90) and 15 passive constructions (P75), which makes the text noun‑heavy and less engaging. Re‑phrasing sentences in active voice and using more verbs will improve clarity.\n   *Example rewrite*: Change \"The risk of adverse events may be no different with RAS inhibition compared to either placebo or symptomatic treatment\" to \"We found no clear increase in serious side‑effects when using RAS‑blocking medicines compared with placebo or usual care.\"\nThese issues together exceed the threshold for significant clarity problems, so the PLS cannot be approved in its current form.\n\n**Metrics support**: The evaluation shows a high noun count (197, beyond the 90th percentile) and elevated complex‑word counts (complex_words = 156, long_words = 212), confirming the draft is more noun‑ and jargon‑heavy than typical Cochrane PLSs. Passive voice (15) is also higher than the median, reinforcing the need for more active phrasing.",
