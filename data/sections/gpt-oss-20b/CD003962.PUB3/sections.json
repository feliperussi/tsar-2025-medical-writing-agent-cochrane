  "key_messages": [
    "Non‑immune‑suppressing treatments that lower blood pressure, especially medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (a hormone system that helps control blood pressure), appear to reduce protein in the urine (proteinuria) and improve kidney function (e.g., creatinine clearance), and no clear increase in serious side‑effects was reported, but the evidence comes from small, short‑term studies of limited quality.",
    "Surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may increase the chance of urine protein and microscopic blood returning to normal in Japanese patients, while other approaches such as fish‑oil supplements, blood‑thinning medicines (anticoagulants), or traditional herbal medicines show only modest or uncertain benefits and no clear advantage over usual care.",
    "Because most trials were small, short and of uncertain quality, more robust, longer‑lasting research is needed to determine whether these non‑immune treatments can safely preserve kidney function and prevent kidney failure over time."

      "subheading": "What is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?",
      "content": "IgA nephropathy (often called IgAN) is the most common type of kidney disease that starts in the tiny filtering units of the kidneys, called glomeruli. In this condition, a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in the kidneys and can cause inflammation and scarring. Over time, this can lead to a gradual loss of kidney function. About one‑in‑five to two‑in‑five people with IgAN will eventually need dialysis or a kidney transplant within 25 years. Because the disease progresses slowly, it can be hard to notice early, and many patients end up with serious kidney problems."

      "subheading": "What treatments that do not suppress the immune system are used for IgA nephropathy?",
      "content": "Doctors often try non‑immunosuppressive approaches first. These include medicines that control blood pressure (especially drugs that block the renin‑angiotensin system, or RAS, which helps lower pressure and protect the kidneys), strategies to reduce proteinuria (the presence of protein in the urine, a sign of kidney damage), dietary changes, tonsil removal (tonsillectomy), and some herbal or fish‑oil supplements. These treatments aim to slow kidney damage while avoiding the side‑effects of long‑term immune‑system‑suppressing drugs."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to discover whether these non‑immunosuppressive therapies actually help people with IgA nephropathy. Specifically, they set out to compare the benefits (such such as lower protein in the urine, better kidney function, and fewer cases of kidney failure) and any harms of each treatment. They looked at all randomised trials that tested medicines or procedures like antihypertensives, dietary measures, tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish oil, and traditional herbal products in children and adults with a confirmed diagnosis of IgAN."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 80 randomised (or quasi‑randomised) controlled trials that enrolled a total of 4,856 people with biopsy‑proven IgA nephropathy, including both adults and children. All trials tested non‑immunosuppressive interventions. The most frequently studied were antihypertensive agents that block the renin‑angiotensin system (examined in 37 studies). Other interventions evaluated were tonsillectomy, anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplementation, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial therapy, each compared with placebo, no treatment, symptomatic care or standard care. The tonsillectomy studies were conducted exclusively in Japanese patients. The abstract does not provide details on the countries or settings of the remaining trials, nor on participants’ age distribution, gender balance, disease severity, length of follow‑up, or funding sources."

      "subheading": "Main results: Effects of non‑immunosuppressive treatments",
      "content": "Renin‑angiotensin system inhibition probably reduces protein loss in the urine, probably lowers blood markers of kidney damage, and probably improves kidney filtration slightly. Tonsillectomy may cause a large increase in the chance of protein‑loss remission and disappearance of blood in the urine. Anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplementation and traditional Chinese medicines may provide a small improvement in kidney function. Antimalarial therapy may cause a large increase in the proportion of patients achieving a major reduction in protein loss. Overall, antihypertensive medicines appear to be the most beneficial non‑immunosuppressive treatment for IgA nephropathy, and their benefits likely outweigh any harms."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all studies provided all the data we needed, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we are interested in.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to December 2023 of search."
