  "draft": "Are non‑immune‑suppressing treatments (like blood‑pressure medicines, tonsil removal, and supplements) effective and safe for people with IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy)?\n\nKey messages  \n– Blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS – a hormone system that helps control blood pressure) usually lower protein in the urine and improve kidney‑function tests such as creatinine clearance (a measure of how well the kidneys filter waste). The studies were small and short‑term, and we did not see a clear rise in serious side‑effects.  \n– Removing the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may increase the chance that protein and tiny amounts of blood disappear from the urine, but the evidence comes only from Japanese patients, so we cannot be sure it works for other groups.  \n– Fish‑oil supplements, blood‑thinning medicines (anticoagulants), traditional Chinese herbal products and the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine showed only modest or uncertain benefits, and the evidence is low‑quality. Larger, longer studies are needed to confirm whether these treatments can safely preserve kidney function and prevent kidney failure.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?  \nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary kidney disease. It starts in the tiny filtering units called glomeruli, where a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up, causing inflammation and scarring. Over time the kidneys filter less blood. About 20 % to 40 % of people with IgAN need dialysis or a kidney transplant within 25 years. The disease often progresses slowly, so we may not notice it until kidney damage is advanced.\n\nWhat non‑immune‑suppressing treatments are used for IgA nephropathy?  \nWe usually try non‑immune‑suppressing approaches first. They include:  \n– Blood‑pressure medicines, especially drugs that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS).  \n– Strategies that aim to reduce proteinuria (protein in the urine).  \n– Dietary changes.  \n– Surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy).  \n– Supplements such as fish oil or certain herbal products.  \n\nThese options aim to slow kidney damage while avoiding the side‑effects of long‑term immune‑suppressing drugs.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether these treatments actually help people with IgAN. Specifically, we compared benefits such as lower protein in the urine, better kidney‑function tests, and fewer cases of kidney failure, against any harms. We examined all randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that tested antihypertensives, dietary measures, tonsillectomy, anticoagulants, fish oil, traditional herbal products and antimalarial drugs in children and adults with a confirmed diagnosis of IgAN.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register up to December 2023. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed quality. We combined results with meta‑analysis and judged confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 80 trials that enrolled 4 856 participants. The most frequently studied were blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (37 studies). Other interventions included tonsillectomy, anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplementation, traditional Chinese medicines and antimalarial therapy.  \n\n– Blocking the renin‑angiotensin system usually reduces protein loss in the urine, lowers blood markers of kidney damage, and modestly improves kidney filtration.  \n– Tonsillectomy may substantially raise the chance that protein and microscopic blood disappear from the urine, but the studies were done only in Japanese patients, so the findings may not apply elsewhere.  \n– Anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplements and traditional Chinese medicines each showed a small improvement in kidney function when compared with placebo, but those benefits disappeared when the treatments were compared with standard care.  \n– One small study of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine reported a large increase in the number of people whose kidney function improved, but the evidence is very limited.  \n\nOverall, blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system appear to be the most beneficial non‑immune‑suppressing treatment for IgAN, and their benefits likely outweigh any harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and several studies did not report all needed data. Follow‑up periods were short and participants were not diverse, so we have little confidence about long‑term benefits or harms.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence searched up to December 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check: all subheadings must be phrased as questions, but the \"Key messages\" heading is not a question. This alone prevents approval. In addition, several clarity issues could confuse readers: (1) the first key‑message sentence is long and packs several ideas, making it hard to follow; (2) repeated use of “probably” in the results section creates uncertainty; (3) the noun‑heavy sentence about RAS inhibition uses many technical nouns, reducing readability. Suggested rewrites are provided below. Metrics support these observations – the draft has 208 nouns (beyond P90), 153 complex words and 212 long words (both beyond P90), and a SMOG index of 14.5 (beyond typical P90), indicating the text is more noun‑ and word‑dense than typical Cochrane PLSs.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (word count 712, sentences 36, active voice 75%, pronouns 34). However, six metrics deviate markedly: nouns (208, BEYOND_P90), complex_words_dc (325, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (153, BEYOND_P90), long_words (212, BEYOND_P90), smog_index (14.5, P90), and dale_chall_readability (8.19, P90). These indicate the draft is unusually noun‑heavy and uses many long/complex words, which can hinder patient understanding."
