  "draft": "Are non‑immunosuppressive treatments (like blood‑pressure medicines, tonsil removal, and supplements) effective and safe for people with IgA kidney disease (IgA nephropathy)?\n\nKey messages  \n– We found that blood‑pressure medicines that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS) usually lower protein in the urine (proteinuria), improve the blood test that shows kidney damage (serum creatinine), and give a small boost to kidney filtering ability (creatinine clearance). The studies were small and short‑term, so confidence in the result is moderate.  \n– Removing the tonsils (tonsillectomy) may increase the chance that protein and tiny amounts of blood disappear from the urine, but the evidence comes only from Japanese patients, giving low confidence that it works for other groups.  \n– Fish‑oil supplements, blood‑thinning medicines, traditional Chinese herbal products and the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (used off‑label for kidney disease) showed only modest or uncertain benefits, and the evidence is low‑quality.\n\nWhat is IgA nephropathy and why does it matter?  \nIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common and the most common primary kidney disease. It starts when a protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in the tiny filtering units (glomeruli) of the kidneys, causing inflammation and scarring. Over time the kidneys filter less blood. About one‑in‑five to five people with IgAN will need dialysis or a kidney transplant within 25 years. Because the disease progresses slowly, many people are diagnosed only after significant kidney damage has occurred.\n\nWhat treatments that do not suppress the immune system are used for IgA nephropathy?  \nWe usually try non‑immunosuppressive approaches first. They include:  \n– Blood‑pressure medicines, especially those that block the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS), which lower pressure and protect the kidneys.  \n– Strategies that aim to reduce proteinuria (protein in the urine, a sign of kidney damage).  \n– Dietary changes.  \n– Surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy).  \n– Supplements such as fish oil or certain herbal products.  \n\nThese options aim to slow kidney damage while avoiding the side‑effects of long‑term immune‑suppressing drugs.\n\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether these non‑immunosuppressive treatments actually help people with IgAN. Specifically, we compared benefits such as lower proteinuria, better kidney‑function tests, and fewer cases of kidney failure, against any harms.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies for trials up to December 2023. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed quality. We combined results with meta‑analysis and judged confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 80 randomised (or quasi‑randomised) trials that enrolled 4 856 participants with biopsy‑proven IgAN. The most frequently studied were RAS‑blocking blood‑pressure medicines (37 studies). Other interventions tested were tonsillectomy, blood‑thinning medicines, fish‑oil supplements, traditional Chinese medicines and hydroxychloroquine.  \n\n– RAS‑blocking medicines usually reduced proteinuria, lowered serum creatinine and modestly improved creatinine clearance. Serious side‑effects were not reported more often, but the studies were small and short‑term.  \n– Tonsillectomy may substantially increase the chance that protein and microscopic blood disappear from the urine, but all studies were done in Japanese patients, so we cannot be sure the result applies elsewhere.  \n– Blood‑thinning medicines, fish‑oil supplements and traditional Chinese medicines each showed a small improvement in kidney function compared with placebo, but the benefit disappeared when compared with standard care.  \n– One small study of hydroxychloroquine reported a large increase in patients achieving a major reduction in proteinuria, but it did not improve kidney‑function tests.  \n\nOverall, RAS‑blocking blood‑pressure medicines appear to be the most beneficial non‑immunosuppressive treatment for IgAN, and their benefits likely outweigh any harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received, and several studies did not report all needed data. Follow‑up periods were short and participants were not diverse, so we have little confidence about long‑term benefits or harms.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence searched up to December and 2023.",

Problem: not a question, breaking the required subheading style. Rewrite: \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. **Incorrect risk range** – Quote: \"About one‑in‑five to five people with IgAN will need dialysis or a kidney transplant within 25 years.\" Problem: ambiguous and inaccurate; original says 20‑40% (one‑in‑five to two‑in‑five). Rewrite: \"About one‑in‑five to two‑in‑five people with IgAN will need dialysis or a kidney transplant within 25 years.\".\n3. **Currency typo** – Quote: \"This review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence searched up to December and 2023.\" Problem: typo makes the date unclear. Rewrite: \"This review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes evidence searched up to December 2023.\".\n4. **Noun‑heavy sentence** – Quote: \"Anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplements and traditional Chinese medicines each showed a small improvement in kidney function compared with placebo, but the benefit disappeared when compared with standard care.\" Problem: long, noun‑dense, reduces readability. Rewrite: \"Anticoagulant therapy, fish‑oil supplements and traditional Chinese medicines each gave a small improvement in kidney function compared with placebo, but that benefit vanished when they were compared with standard care.\".\n5. **Passive voice** – Example: \"The studies were small and short‑term, so confidence in the result is moderate.\" Problem: passive construction hides who performed the work. Rewrite: \"Because the studies were small and short‑term, we have moderate confidence in the result.\".\n\nThese changes address the factual errors, subheading format, and improve clarity and readability.\n\nMetrics support: the draft shows high noun count (192, P90) and many complex/long words (complex_words 153, long_words 203, both beyond P90), contributing to dense sentences. Passive voice count is 18 (P75), indicating many passive constructions. Reducing nouns, complex words, and passive voice will align the text more closely with typical patient‑level summary patterns.",

These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long/complex words, which can hinder readability for patients."
