  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills) effective for painful periods (primary dysmenorrhoea)?\n\nKey messages\n– Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progestogen) reduce menstrual pain in women with primary dysmenorrhoea compared with placebo or no treatment. They also increase the chance of side‑effects such as irregular bleeding (spotting or bleeding between periods), headaches and nausea. The overall evidence is reasonably reliable but some uncertainties remain.  \n– Taking the pills continuously (without the usual weekly break) may give a little more pain relief than the standard 21‑days‑on/7‑days‑off schedule, although the evidence is limited and long‑term safety data are lacking.  \n– More high‑quality, long‑term studies are needed to clarify the balance of benefits and harms, especially serious side‑effects, and to compare combined oral contraceptive pills directly with other treatments such as NSAIDs (non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs, e.g., ibuprofen).\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea means painful menstrual cramps that occur in women who have no other pelvic disease (such as endometriosis). It is very common and is a leading cause of pain, missed work and missed school for women of reproductive age. The pain can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities, so many women look for ways to relieve it. The usual first‑line treatment is NSAIDs, medicines like ibuprofen that reduce pain and inflammation. Combined oral contraceptive pills are another option because they suppress the menstrual cycle and may lessen cramps.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether combined oral contraceptive pills are effective and safe for treating primary dysmenorrhoea. Specifically, we compared the benefits (pain reduction and reduced need for extra medication) and harms (irregular bleeding, headaches, nausea and any serious side‑effects) of these pills against placebo, no treatment, other pill regimens, or NSAIDs.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane database and other sources for randomised controlled trials that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with placebo, other pill regimens or NSAIDs in women with primary dysmenorrhoea. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 21 trials that enrolled 3,723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The trials compared the pills with three types of comparators:\n– placebo or no treatment (11 trials)  \n– other pill regimens that differed in dose, generation or schedule (9 trials)  \n– NSAIDs (1 trial)\n\nPain relief\nWhen we compared the pills with placebo or no treatment, women reported less pain. Six trials gave a standardised mean difference of –0.58; this number means a moderate reduction in pain on the scales used in the studies. Six other trials showed that women were 65% more likely to notice a meaningful improvement in pain (risk ratio 1.65). In practical terms, if about 28 % of women improve with placebo, the pill raises that proportion to roughly 37‑60 %.\n\nSide‑effects\nWomen using the pills were about twice as likely to experience irregular bleeding (risk ratio 2.63). That translates to roughly 40‑60 women out of 100 experiencing spotting compared with about 20 out of 100 on placebo. The pills also increased the chance of headaches (risk ratio 1.51) and nausea (risk ratio 1.64). We did not find reliable data on weight gain or serious adverse events.\n\nContinuous versus standard regimen\nA small number of studies suggested that taking the pills continuously (no weekly break) may lower pain a little more than the usual 21‑days‑on/7‑days‑off schedule (standardised mean difference –0.73). However, only two trials examined this and they did not provide long‑term safety information.\n\nComparison with NSAIDs\nOnly one small trial compared the pill with an NSAID. It did not show a clear advantage for the pill and did not report side‑effects, so we cannot say whether the pill works better or worse than NSAIDs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings. This means we have some certainty that the results are real, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. The trials varied in the types of women studied, the pill doses used, and how they were run. Many trials were small, some did not hide the treatment from participants, and not all reported every outcome we wanted. No study looked at long‑term effects.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence includes studies identified up to the search date of 28 March 2023.",

Suggested rewrites: • Replace \"standardised mean difference\" with \"average difference in pain scores\" and add a brief note that a negative value means less pain. • Replace \"risk ratio\" with \"how many times more likely\" and explain the meaning (e.g., \"women were about 2.6 times more likely to have spotting\"). • Change passive sentence to active: \"We searched for studies up to 28 March 2023.\" • Rewrite confidence wording: \"We have moderate confidence in these results.\" • Split the bleeding sentence: \"Women using the pills were about twice as likely to have irregular bleeding (risk ratio 2.63). This means roughly 40‑60 out of 100 women on the pill experience spotting, compared with about 20 out of 100 on placebo.\" These changes will align the text with the Cochrane plain-language style guide and improve readability for patients.",

These metrics support the identified clarity and style issues and indicate the need to reduce passive constructions, nominalisations, and overly noun-heavy sentences."
