  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills (birth‑control pills) effective for painful periods (primary dysmenorrhoea)?\n\nKey messages\n– Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth‑control pills that contain both estrogen and progestogen) reduce menstrual pain in women with primary dysmenorrhoea compared with placebo or no treatment, but they increase the chance of side‑effects such as irregular bleeding, headaches and nausea.  \n– Taking the pills continuously (without the usual weekly break) may give a little more pain relief than the standard 21‑days‑on/7‑days‑off schedule, although the evidence is limited and long‑term safety data are missing.  \n– We feel moderately confident in these findings: the evidence is fairly reliable, but some uncertainty remains because the studies were small, varied in design, and often did not hide the treatment from participants.\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea means painful menstrual cramps that occur in women who have no other pelvic disease (such as endometriosis). It is very common and is a leading cause of pain, missed work and missed school for women of reproductive age. The pain can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities, so many women look for ways to relieve it. The usual first‑line treatment is non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) – medicines like ibuprofen that reduce pain and inflammation. Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are another option because they suppress the menstrual cycle and may lessen cramps.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether combined oral contraceptive pills are effective and safe for treating primary dysmenorrhoea. Specifically, we compared the benefits (pain reduction and reduced need for extra medication) and harms (irregular bleeding, headaches, nausea and any serious side‑effects) of OCPs against placebo, no treatment, other OCP regimens, or NSAIDs.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with placebo, other pill regimens or NSAIDs in women with primary dysmenorrhoea. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on the quality and size of the studies. We searched up to 28 March 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 21 trials that together enrolled 3 723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The trials compared OCPs with three types of comparators:\n– placebo or no treatment (11 trials)  \n– other OCP regimens that differed in dose, generation or schedule (9 trials)  \n– NSAIDs (1 trial)\n\nPain relief compared with placebo or no treatment  \nWomen who took OCPs reported less pain. Six trials gave an average reduction in pain scores of –0.58 on the scales used, which reflects a moderate drop in pain. Six other trials showed that women were about 1.6 times more likely to notice a meaningful improvement in pain. In practical terms, if about 28 % of women improve with placebo, the pill raises that proportion to roughly 37‑60 %.\n\nSide‑effects compared with placebo or no treatment  \nWomen taking OCPs were about 2.6 times as likely to have irregular bleeding. That means roughly 40‑60 out of 100 women on the pill experience spotting or bleeding between periods, compared with about 20 out of 100 who do not take the pill. The pills also increased the chance of headaches by about 1.5 times and nausea by about 1.6 times. We did not find reliable data on weight gain or serious adverse events.\n\nContinuous versus standard regimen  \nA small number of studies suggested that taking OCPs continuously (no weekly break) may lower pain a little more than the usual 21‑days‑on/7‑days‑off schedule. The average difference in pain scores was –0.73, but only two trials examined this and they did not provide long‑term safety information.\n\nComparison with NSAIDs  \nOnly one small trial compared OCPs with an NSAID. It did not show a clear advantage for the pill and did not report side‑effects, so we cannot say whether the pill works better or worse than NSAIDs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these results because the studies involved different types of women, used various pill doses, and were often small. Some trials did not hide the treatment from participants, and not all studies reported every outcome we wanted. No study looked at long‑term effects or serious side‑effects.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence includes studies identified up to 28 March 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft is missing a question‑style subheading for the Key messages section (it is labelled simply “Key messages”). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement that all subheadings be phrased as questions. In addition, the text contains several clarity‑reducing patterns identified by the metrics: a high number of nominalisations (26, well above the median), an excessive noun count (205, beyond the typical range), and many complex/long words (136 complex words, 188 long words, and a SMOG index of 14.1). These make the prose harder for patients to read. Suggested improvements: 1) Change the subheading to a question, e.g., “What are the key messages?” 2) Replace nominalised phrases such as “the reduction in pain scores” with active verbs (“pain scores fell”). 3) Swap complex words for simpler alternatives (e.g., replace “approximately” with “about”, “moderately” with “fairly”). 4) Reduce noun‑heavy sentences by turning them into actions (e.g., “The trials compared OCPs with three types of comparators” → “We compared OCPs with three types of comparators”). Implementing these changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets the word‑count limit and has good active‑voice and pronoun use, but deviates on several readability metrics: nominalisation (P90), nouns (BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (P90), complex words and long words (both P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
