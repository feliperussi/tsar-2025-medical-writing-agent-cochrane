  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills) effective for painful periods (primary dysmenorrhoea)?\n\nKey messages\n– Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progestogen) reduce menstrual pain in women with primary dysmenorrhoea compared with placebo or no treatment. They also increase the chance of side‑effects such as irregular bleeding (spotting or bleeding between periods), headaches and nausea. The overall evidence is reasonably reliable but some uncertainties remain.  \n– Taking the pills continuously (without the usual weekly break) may give a little more pain relief than the standard 21‑days‑on/7‑days‑off schedule, although the evidence is limited and long‑term safety data are lacking.  \n– More high‑quality, long‑term studies are needed to clarify the balance of benefits and harms, especially serious side‑effects, and to compare combined oral contraceptive pills directly with other treatments such as NSAIDs (non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs, e.g., ibuprofen).\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea means painful menstrual cramps that occur in women who have no other pelvic disease (such as endometriosis). It is very common and is a leading cause of pain, missed work and missed school for women of reproductive age. The pain can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities, so many women look for ways to relieve it. The usual first‑line treatment is NSAIDs, which reduce pain and inflammation. Combined oral contraceptive pills are another option because they suppress the menstrual cycle and may lessen cramps.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether combined oral contraceptive pills are effective and safe for treating primary dysmenorrhoea. Specifically, we compared the benefits (pain reduction and reduced need for extra medication) and harms (irregular bleeding, headaches, nausea and any serious side‑effects) of these pills against placebo, no treatment, other pill regimens, or NSAID treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane database and other sources for randomised controlled trials that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with placebo, other pill regimens or NSAIDs in women with primary dysmenorrhoea. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 21 trials that enrolled 3,723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The trials compared the pills with three types of comparators:  \n– placebo or no treatment (11 trials)  \n– other pill regimens that differed in dose, generation or schedule (9 trials)  \n– NSAIDs (1 trial)  \n\nThe pills reduced menstrual pain compared with placebo or no treatment. Six trials showed a moderate reduction in pain scores (standardised mean difference –0.58). Six trials also showed that women were more likely to report noticeable pain improvement (risk ratio 1.65).  \n\nThe pills increased the overall risk of side‑effects. Women using the pills were about twice as likely to experience irregular bleeding (risk ratio 2.63). They also had higher chances of headaches (risk ratio 1.51) and nausea (risk ratio 1.64). We also found limited evidence that continuous use of the pills (no weekly break) may lower pain more than the standard cyclic regimen, but data on long‑term safety are missing.  \n\nWe could not determine whether the pills are more effective than NSAIDs for pain relief, because only one small trial reported this comparison and it did not include adverse‑event data.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. The trials involved different populations and treatment approaches, many were small, and some did not blind participants to the treatment. Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted, and no study examined long‑term effects.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence includes studies identified up to the search date of 28 March 2023.",

Rewriting these passages in active, plain‑language style and replacing technical terms with everyday explanations will improve readability. The PLS metrics support these observations: passive_voice = 15 (high), nominalization = 27 (well above typical), complex_words = 138 and long_words = 181, all indicating a noun‑heavy, jargon‑laden text. Reducing these will bring the summary closer to typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on word count and overall readability (Flesch Reading Ease 51.9, words per sentence 18.5) but deviates markedly on several complexity metrics: nominalisation (27, beyond P90), noun count (195, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.2, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.38, beyond P90), complex words (138, beyond P90) and long words (181, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more difficult vocabulary than typical Cochrane PLSs, suggesting a need to simplify language and increase active voice."
