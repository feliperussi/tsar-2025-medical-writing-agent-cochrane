  "draft": "\"Are combined oral contraceptive pills (birth‑control pills) effective for painful periods (primary dysmenorrhoea)?\n\nKey messages\n– Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth‑control pills that contain both estrogen and progestogen) reduce menstrual pain in women with primary dysmenorrhoea compared with placebo or no treatment. They also increase the chance of side‑effects such as irregular bleeding (spotting or bleeding between periods), headaches and nausea. The overall evidence is reasonably reliable but some uncertainties remain.  \n– Taking the pills continuously (without the usual weekly break) may give a little more pain relief than the standard 21‑days‑on/7‑days‑off schedule, although the evidence is limited and long‑term safety data are lacking.  \n– More high‑quality, long‑term studies are needed to clarify the balance of benefits and harms, especially serious side‑effects, and to compare combined oral contraceptive pills directly with other treatments such as NSAIDs (non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs, e.g., ibuprofen).\n\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea means painful menstrual cramps that occur in women who have no other pelvic disease (such as endometriosis). It is very common and is a leading cause of pain, missed work and missed school for women of reproductive age. The pain can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities, so many women look for ways to relieve it. The usual first‑line treatment is NSAIDs, medicines like ibuprofen that reduce pain and inflammation. Combined oral contraceptive pills are another option because they suppress the menstrual cycle and may lessen cramps.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether combined oral contraceptive pills are effective and safe for treating primary dysmenorrhoea. Specifically, we compared the benefits (pain reduction and reduced need for extra medication) and harms (irregular bleeding, headaches, nausea and any serious side‑effects) of these pills against placebo, no treatment, other pill regimens, or NSAIDs.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with placebo, other pill regimens or NSAIDs in women with primary dysmenorrhoea. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on the quality and size of the studies. We searched up to 28 March 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 21 trials that together enrolled 3 723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea. The trials compared the pills with three types of comparators:\n– placebo or no treatment (11 trials)  \n– other pill regimens that differed in dose, generation or schedule (9 trials)  \n– NSAIDs (1 trial)\n\nPain relief compared with placebo or no treatment\nWomen who took the pills reported less pain. Six trials gave an average difference in pain scores of –0.58; a negative number means the pill lowered pain on the scales used. Six other trials showed that women were about 1.6 times more likely to notice a meaningful improvement in pain. In practical terms, if about 28 % of women improve with placebo, the pill raises that proportion to roughly 37‑60 %.\n\nSide‑effects compared with placebo or no treatment\nWomen using the pills were about twice as likely to have irregular bleeding (risk ratio 2.63). This means roughly 40‑60 out of 100 women on the pill experience spotting, compared with about 20 out of 100 on placebo. The pills also increased the chance of headaches (about 1.5 times more likely) and nausea (about 1.6 times more likely). We did not find reliable data on weight gain or serious adverse events.\n\nContinuous versus standard regimen\nA small number of studies suggested that taking the pills continuously (no weekly break) may lower pain a little more than the usual 21‑days‑on/7‑days‑off schedule. The average difference in pain scores was –0.73, but only two trials examined this and they did not provide long‑term safety information.\n\nComparison with NSAIDs\nOnly one small trial compared the pill with an NSAID. It did not show a clear advantage for the pill and did not report side‑effects, so we cannot say whether the pill works better or worse than NSAIDs.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have moderate confidence in these results. The trials varied in the types of women studied, the pill doses used, and how they were run. Many trials were small, some did not hide the treatment from participants, and not all reported every outcome we wanted. No study looked at long‑term effects.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence includes studies identified up to 28 March 2023.",

These issues, combined with the high number of passive sentences (22) and nominalisations (27) shown by the metrics, reduce readability and should be fixed before the PLS can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices are in the good range (FKG 9.9, FRE 58.6). However, several metrics deviate strongly: passive_voice (22, P90), nominalization (27, P90), nouns (214, BEYOND_P90), smog_index (14.5, P90), complex_words (145, P90), long_words (190, P90) and complex_words_dc (320, BEYOND_P90). These indicate excessive passive phrasing, noun‑heavy sentences and high lexical complexity, supporting the need to rewrite key sentences into active, simpler language."
