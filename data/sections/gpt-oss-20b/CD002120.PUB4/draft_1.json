  "draft": "Are combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills) effective for painful periods (primary dysmenorrhoea)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progestogen) are effective at reducing menstrual pain in women with primary dysmenorrhoea (painful periods without pelvic disease) compared with placebo or no treatment, but they also increase the chance of unwanted side effects such as irregular bleeding (unusual spotting or bleeding between periods), headaches (pain in the head), and nausea (feeling sick); the overall evidence is reasonably reliable but some uncertainties remain.\n- Taking the pills continuously (without the usual weekly break) may provide a little more pain relief than the standard regimen (taking pills for three weeks followed by a break), although the evidence is limited and long‑term safety data are lacking.\n- More high‑quality, long‑term studies are needed to clarify the balance of benefits and harms, especially serious side effects, and to compare combined oral contraceptive pills directly with other treatments such as NSAIDs.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is primary dysmenorrhoea and why does it matter?\nPrimary dysmenorrhoea means painful menstrual cramps that occur in women who have no other pelvic disease (such as endometriosis). It is a very common problem and is one of the leading causes of pain and missed work or school days for women of reproductive age. The pain can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities, and many women look for ways to relieve it. The usual first‑line treatment is non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) – medicines like ibuprofen that reduce pain and inflammation. Another option that is often used is the combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP), a birth‑control pill that contains both estrogen and progestogen and can also suppress the menstrual cycle, which may lessen cramps.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to determine whether combined oral contraceptive pills are effective and safe for treating primary dysmenorrhoea. Specifically, they set out to compare the benefits (such as reduction in pain and need for extra medication) and harms (including irregular bleeding, headaches, nausea and any serious side‑effects) of OCPs against placebo, no treatment, other OCP regimens, or NSAIDs.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared combined oral contraceptive pills with placebo, other pills, or NSAIDs in women with primary dysmenorrhoea, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on the quality and size of the studies.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 21 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 3,723 women with primary dysmenorrhoea (painful menstrual cramps after other pelvic problems had been ruled out). The abstract does not give details about participants’ ages, how long each trial lasted, the countries where the 21 studies were carried out, or any funding sources. The trials compared combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) with three types of comparators: placebo or no treatment (11 trials), other OCP regimens that differed in dose, generation or dosing schedule (9 trials), and non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (1 trial). No studies examined long‑term outcomes or non‑pharmacological treatments for primary dysmenorrhoea.\nMain results: Effect of combined oral contraceptives on menstrual pain and side‑effects\nCombined oral contraceptive pills reduce menstrual pain and probably increase the chance of a noticeable improvement in pain. Continuous use of OCPs may lower pain even more than the standard cyclic regimen. OCPs probably raise the overall risk of side‑effects slightly, with a large increase in irregular bleeding (about 40‑60 per 100 women on the pill versus about 20 per 100 not using it), and probably increase the chances of headaches and nausea. It is unclear whether OCPs affect weight gain or serious adverse events, and the evidence is uncertain about how they compare with NSAIDs for pain relief.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, because the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all studies provided data about everything we were interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search.",

The subheadings \"Methods\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are statements, not questions, which violates the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text contains several clarity problems that would confuse a patient: (1) long, complex sentences (e.g., the 30‑word sentence in the Results section) that are hard to follow; (2) excessive passive voice (e.g., \"The abstract does not give details about participants’ ages…\"), which obscures who did what; (3) noun‑heavy phrasing that reduces readability (e.g., \"the overall risk of side‑effects slightly\"). These issues are reflected in the metrics – 19 passive constructions (P90), 30 words per sentence (beyond P90), and high counts of nouns, complex and long words. To make the PLS clear and patient‑friendly, the subheadings should be rewritten as questions, sentences should be split into shorter active statements, and noun‑heavy phrases should be replaced with verb‑focused language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is 721 words (within the 850‑word limit) but deviates from typical PLS patterns on many readability metrics: words per sentence (30.0, BEYOND P90), passive voice (19, P90), and several readability indices (FKGL 15.2, Gunning Fog 19.7, LIX 61) are all higher than the median range for Cochrane PLSs. These metric deviations support the editorial observations about long sentences, passive constructions, and high lexical complexity."
