  "key_messages": [
    "Education programmes that include structured teaching and counseling probably lower average blood sugar levels (glycated haemoglobin, a measure of blood sugar over the past few months) and may improve cholesterol levels and diabetes knowledge in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes; no clear evidence of serious harms was reported.",
    "When education programmes are added to already comprehensive multidisciplinary care (care involving several health professionals), they appear to make little or no difference to kidney function, blood pressure, blood sugar, or cholesterol, suggesting limited extra benefit in that setting.",
    "Because the available studies were few, small, and of limited quality, more large, well‑designed trials are needed to determine the long‑term effects on kidney function, survival, quality of life, and any possible adverse effects."

      "subheading": "What is chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long‑term loss of kidney function, and diabetes is a condition where the body cannot control blood sugar properly. Many people have both conditions at the same time, which makes their health care especially complicated. Managing CKD and diabetes usually requires a strict daily routine – taking several medicines, monitoring blood sugar, watching diet, and sometimes doing dialysis. Because the regimen is so complex, many people find it hard to follow all the instructions, which can lead to worse health outcomes such as higher blood sugar levels, higher cholesterol, and faster loss of kidney function."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether education programmes – organised sessions where health professionals give information, advice and behavioural counselling (for example, through talks, written materials, videos or computer tools) – can help people with CKD and diabetes. Specifically, they looked for evidence that these programmes improve health measures (like blood‑sugar control, cholesterol, knowledge about diabetes, and self‑care skills) and whether they cause any harms. In short, the review set out to evaluate the benefits and risks of educational interventions for this high‑risk group."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified eight randomised (or quasi‑randomised) trials that together enrolled 840 adults (aged 18 years or older) who had chronic kidney disease and diabetes. The participants ranged from people on dialysis to those with moderately increased albuminuria or advanced diabetic nephropathy. All trials tested structured education programmes – delivered verbally, in writing, by audio‑recording or computer‑aided methods – and the educators were nurses, pharmacists, diabetes educators or other health professionals. The education was compared with routine care alone, or with routine care plus multidisciplinary coordinated care. Follow‑up periods varied from five weeks to 18 months, and the HbA1c outcome was measured after a mean of about 13.5 months in four of the studies. The abstract does not give details about the countries where the studies were done or their funding sources."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Education programmes probably lower blood sugar (HbA1c)",
      "content": "The review suggests that structured education programmes probably reduce blood‑sugar levels (HbA1c) in people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes. They may also produce small reductions in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, and lead to modest improvements in diabetes knowledge, confidence in managing diabetes (self‑efficacy), diet and home blood‑glucose monitoring. However, the benefit over longer periods is uncertain, and the evidence does not show clear effects on death, serious low‑blood‑sugar episodes, or kidney failure. When education is combined with multidisciplinary coordinated care, the additional impact on blood sugar, kidney outcomes, blood pressure, cholesterol and other clinical measures appears to be little or none."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies were large enough or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search."
