  "draft": "Is heated, humidified air delivered through small nasal tubes (nasal high‑flow therapy) an effective first breathing support for babies born early compared with other non‑invasive methods such as CPAP?\n\nKey messages\n– Heated, humidified air delivered through small nasal tubes (nasal high‑flow, nHF) gives a similar chance of survival and of developing chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, BPD) as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal intermittent positive‑pressure ventilation (NIPPV).  \n– nHF may increase the need to change breathing support within the first three days, but it does not increase the need for a breathing tube (mechanical ventilation) and may cause less nasal injury and fewer lung air leaks (pneumothorax).  \n– The evidence is of low to moderate certainty and includes few babies born before 28 weeks gestation.\n\nWhy do very early‑born babies sometimes need help breathing?  \nBabies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy are called preterm. Their lungs are often immature, so many develop breathing trouble called respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). If they cannot get enough oxygen, they risk death, long‑term lung damage (BPD), or the need for a breathing tube placed in the windpipe (mechanical ventilation). Traditionally we have used non‑invasive methods such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) – a gentle flow of air that keeps the airways open – or nasal intermittent positive‑pressure ventilation (NIPPV) which adds small pressure bursts. Nasal high‑flow (nHF) therapy delivers warm, humidified air (and oxygen if needed) through two tiny tubes placed in the nose at flows above 1 L/min, usually 2–8 L/min. It may provide comfortable support without a tube in the airway.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about nasal high‑flow therapy?  \nWe compared nHF with other non‑invasive supports (mainly CPAP and NIPPV) when used as the first treatment for preterm infants with early breathing trouble. We wanted to know whether nHF reduces death or long‑term lung problems, whether it changes the chance of early treatment failure (need to change support within 72 hours), and whether it affects the need for mechanical ventilation. We also looked at lung air leaks (pneumothorax), nasal injury (nasal trauma), and other complications.\n\nHow did we find and assess the studies?  \nWe searched the Cochrane database and other sources up to March 2022 for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared nHF with other non‑invasive supports in preterm infants with RDS. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to rate our confidence in each outcome.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 13 trials enrolling 2 540 preterm infants. Most infants were 28 weeks gestation or older; very few were extremely preterm (<28 weeks). Eleven trials compared nHF with CPAP and four compared nHF with NIPPV. No trials compared nHF with low‑flow cannulae or ambient oxygen.\n\nWhat do the results mean?  \n– Survival and chronic lung disease: Using nHF first made little or no difference to the combined risk of death or BPD compared with CPAP (low‑certainty evidence).  \n– Early treatment failure: nHF increased the chance that infants needed a change in support within the first three days compared with CPAP (moderate‑certainty evidence).  \n– Mechanical ventilation: nHF made little or no difference to the need for a breathing tube within the first three days compared with CPAP (moderate‑certainty evidence).  \n– Pneumothorax: nHF probably reduced the risk of lung air leaks compared with CPAP (moderate‑certainty evidence).  \n– Nasal trauma: nHF probably reduced nasal injury compared with both CPAP and NIPPV (moderate‑certainty).  \n– Compared with NIPPV, nHF showed little or no difference in death or BPD (very low certainty) and probably made little or no difference to early treatment failure (moderate certainty).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have limited confidence because many trials were small, some participants and clinicians knew which treatment was given, and the studies included few infants born before 28 weeks. The trials also used different devices and flow rates, adding variability.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to March 2022.",
