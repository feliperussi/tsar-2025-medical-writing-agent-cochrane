  "key_messages": [
    "Heated, humidified air delivered through small nasal tubes (nasal high‑flow therapy) appears to give a similar chance of survival and of developing chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) as other non‑invasive supports such as CPAP or nasal intermittent positive‑pressure ventilation, but it may lead to more early treatment failure (the need to change the breathing support within the first three days); it does not seem to increase the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (a tube placed in the airway to help breathing) and may cause less nasal injury (damage to the nose) and possibly fewer lung air leaks (pneumothorax). The overall quality of the evidence is limited.",
    "Most of the studies included babies born at 28 weeks of gestation or later, so we have little information about how nasal high‑flow therapy works in the most extremely preterm infants (those born before 28 weeks).",
    "Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that enrol very early preterm infants and that follow babies for longer periods to better understand the benefits, harms, and long‑term outcomes of nasal high‑flow therapy as a first breathing support."

      "subheading": "Why do very early‑born babies sometimes need help breathing?",
      "content": "Babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy are called preterm. Their lungs are often not fully developed, so soon after birth many of them develop breathing problems called respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). If the baby cannot get enough oxygen, it can lead to serious complications such as death, long‑term lung damage (bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD), or the need for a breathing tube placed in the windpipe (mechanical ventilation). Traditionally, doctors have used non‑invasive methods such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) – a gentle flow of air that keeps the airways open – or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), which adds small bursts of pressure. More recently, nasal high‑flow (nHF) therapy has become popular. nHF delivers warm, humidified air (and oxygen if needed) through two tiny tubes placed in the baby’s nose at flow rates higher than 1 L/min, usually between 2 and 8 L/min. The idea is that nHF might provide comfortable, effective breathing support without the need for a tube in the airway."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out about nasal high‑flow therapy?",
      "content": "The review authors set out to compare nasal high‑flow therapy with other non‑invasive breathing supports (mainly CPAP and NIPPV) when used as the first line of treatment for preterm infants with early breathing trouble. They wanted to know whether nHF reduces the risk of death or long‑term lung problems, whether it leads to fewer or more cases where the baby’s breathing worsens and needs extra help (treatment failure), and whether it changes the need for mechanical ventilation. They also looked at other outcomes such as the occurrence of air leaks in the lungs (pneumothorax), damage to the baby’s nose (nasal trauma), and any other complications."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 13 randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that together enrolled 2,540 preterm infants (born before 37 weeks' gestation) who had respiratory distress soon after birth. Most of the babies were 28 weeks' gestation or older; very few were extremely preterm (<28 weeks). The trials mainly compared nasal high‑flow (nHF) therapy used as the first form of breathing support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in eleven studies and with nasal intermittent positive‑pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in four studies. No studies compared nHF with ambient oxygen or low‑flow nasal cannulae. Information on the countries where the studies were done, the length of follow‑up, and the sources of funding was not provided in the abstract."

      "content": "When used as the first breathing support, nasal high‑flow probably makes little to no difference to the combined risk of death or chronic lung disease compared with CPAP (low certainty). It probably increases the chance that infants will need a change in treatment within the first three days compared with CPAP (moderate certainty). Nasal high‑flow probably makes little to no difference to the need for mechanical ventilation within the first three days compared with CPAP (moderate certainty). It probably reduces the risk of pneumothorax slightly compared with CPAP (moderate certainty). Nasal high‑flow probably reduces nasal trauma compared with CPAP (moderate certainty) and also compared with NIPPV (moderate certainty). Compared with NIPPV, it is unclear whether nasal high‑flow makes any difference to the combined risk of death or chronic lung disease (very low certainty) and it probably makes little to no difference to treatment failure within the first three days (moderate certainty)."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the evidence does not cover all of the babies we are interested in (especially the very early preterm infants), because the studies were done in different types of babies and used different ways of delivering the therapy, and because the studies were very small and included few events.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search."
