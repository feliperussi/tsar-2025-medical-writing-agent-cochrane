  "draft": "Is taking out the urinary catheter (tube that drains urine) early (within 5 days) better than taking it out later (after 5 days) for people who have had a kidney transplant (kidney transplantation)?\n\nKey messages  \n– We do not know whether removing the catheter before five days changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria).  \n– The review found only two small studies (197 participants) and could not show any difference in symptomatic urinary infections or serious kidney‑related problems; no safety concerns were reported.  \n– Because the studies were tiny, had high or unclear risk of bias, and followed patients for less than one month, our confidence in the evidence is very low.\n\nWhy is the timing of urinary catheter removal after kidney transplantation important?  \nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys no longer work. During the operation a thin tube, called a urinary catheter, is placed in the bladder so urine can drain safely while the new kidney heals. The catheter helps protect the delicate link between the bladder and the tube that carries urine from the kidney (ureter) – the surgical connection (anastomosis). However, the catheter also provides a route for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary tract infection (UTI). The longer the catheter stays in place, the higher the risk of infection. Doctors do not agree on how many days the catheter should remain, and different removal times might affect infection rates or other complications such as the surgical link breaking down.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare two groups of kidney‑transplant patients: those whose catheter was removed early (before 5 days) and those whose catheter stayed in longer (five days or more). We looked at three outcomes:  \n1. Symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs).  \n2. Bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria).  \n3. Major urological problems that needed extra treatment.\n\nHow did we find and analyse the studies?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register up to 13 April 2023. The register includes results from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared early with late catheter removal, regardless of donor type, age or gender. Two reviewers screened the records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results using a random‑effects model and expressed effects as relative risk (RR) – how much more or less likely an outcome is in one group compared with the other – with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) – the range of values within which the true effect is likely to lie. We also reported I² – a statistic that shows how much the study results differ from each other. We rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found two small studies that together enrolled 197 kidney‑transplant recipients. Both trials compare early removal (less than five days) with later removal (five days or more). The only outcome they reported was asymptomatic bacteriuria. We found a pooled relative risk of 0.89 (95 % CI 0.17 to 4.57) and I² = 88 %, indicating high statistical heterogeneity. The evidence was judged very low certainty. No reliable data were available for symptomatic UTIs or major urological complications, and follow‑up was limited to less than one month.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small and had high or unclear risk of bias. Participants and clinicians may have known which timing was used, which can affect results. The studies provided limited outcome data, used different patient groups, and followed patients for only a short period. These factors make the overall estimate uncertain.\n\nHow up to date is this review?  \nOur search covered all relevant records up to 13 April 2023, so the evidence reflects the literature available at that time.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the \"Key messages\" subheading is not phrased as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\"). This violates the Master Style Guide requirement that subheadings be questions where possible. In addition, several clarity issues would likely confuse readers: 1. The sentence \"We combined the results using a random‑effects model and expressed effects as relative risk (RR) – how much more or less likely a outcome is in one group compared with the other – with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) – the range of values within which the true effect is likely to lie.\" is long, technical and uses statistical jargon. Rewrite to a shorter, plain‑language version. 2. \"The only outcome they reported was asymptomatic bacteriuria.\" is noun‑heavy and passive‑sounding. Use an active verb: \"They only reported asymptomatic bacteriuria.\" 3. The term \"statistical heterogeneity\" in \"I² = 88 %, indicating high statistical heterogeneity\" is not explained for a lay audience. Add a brief definition or replace with simpler wording. 4. The bullet point \"The review found only two small studies (197 participants) and could not show any difference in symptomatic urinary infections or serious kidney‑related problems; no safety concerns were reported.\" packs two ideas into one long sentence; split into two sentences for readability. These issues are supported by the PLS evaluation: the draft shows high nominalisation (21 instances, beyond typical PLS range), a high noun count (175, beyond median), and elevated complex‑word metrics (complex_words = 126, long_words = 181, complex_words_dc = 286), all of which contribute to the dense, noun‑heavy style. Reducing nominalisations and simplifying vocabulary will improve readability. Overall, the draft needs revision to meet the required subheading format and to address the identified clarity problems before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (690 words) and scores well on readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 59.4, FKGL 9.2). However, several metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisation (21, beyond P90), nouns (175, beyond P90), SMOG (14.3, beyond P90), complex words (126, beyond P90), long words (181, beyond P90) and especially complex_words_dc (286, beyond BEYOND_P90). These indicate a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style that should be reduced for a patient‑focused summary."
