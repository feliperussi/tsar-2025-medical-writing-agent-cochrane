  "draft": "Is taking out the urinary catheter (tube that drains urine) early (within 5 days) better than taking it out later (after 5 days) for people who have had a kidney transplant (kidney transplantation)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– We do not know whether removing the catheter before five days changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria).  \n– The review found only two small studies (197 participants) and could not show any difference in symptomatic urinary infections or serious kidney‑related problems. No safety concerns were reported.  \n– Because the studies were tiny, had high or unclear risk of bias, and followed patients for less than one month, our confidence in the evidence is very low.\n\nWhy is the timing of urinary catheter removal after kidney transplantation important?  \nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys no longer work. During the operation a thin tube, called a urinary catheter, is placed in the bladder so urine can drain safely while the new kidney heals. The catheter protects the delicate connection (anastomosis) between the bladder and the ureter, reducing tension on the surgical stitch. At the same time the catheter provides a route for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary tract infection (UTI). The longer the catheter stays in place, the higher the risk of infection. Doctors do not agree on how many days the catheter should remain, and different removal times might affect infection rates or other complications such as the surgical link breaking down.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare two groups of kidney‑transplant patients: those whose catheter was removed early (before 5 days) and those whose catheter stayed in longer (five days or more). We looked at three outcomes:  \n1. Symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs).  \n2. Bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria).  \n3. Major urological problems that needed extra treatment.\n\nHow did we find and analyse the studies?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register up to 13 April 2023. The register includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared early (≤5 days) with late (>5 days) catheter removal, regardless of donor type, age or gender. Two reviewers screened the records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results using a random‑effects model and reported the relative risk (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). We also reported I², a statistic that shows how much the study results differ from each other. We rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found two small studies that together enrolled 197 kidney‑transplant recipients. Both trials compared early removal (less than five days) with later removal (five days or more). They only reported asymptomatic bacteriuria. The pooled result gave a relative risk of 0.89 (95 % CI 0.17 to 4.57). The I² value was 88 %, meaning the results varied a lot between the studies. The evidence was judged very low certainty. No reliable data were available for symptomatic UTIs or major urological complications, and follow‑up was limited to less than one month.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small and had high or unclear risk of bias. Participants and clinicians may have known which timing was used, which can affect results. The studies provided limited outcome data, used different patient groups, and followed patients for only a short period. These factors make the overall estimate uncertain.\n\nHow up to date is this review?  \nOur search covered all relevant records up to 13 April 2023, so the evidence reflects the literature available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails to meet plain‑language standards because it includes several technical terms and jargon that a patient reader is unlikely to understand, and some sentences are overly dense. Specific problems: 1) \"We combined the results using a random‑effects model and reported the relative risk (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI).\" – statistical language (random‑effects... etc.) is not explained. Suggested rewrite: \"We added the results from the two studies together and calculated how much the risk of bacteria in the urine might change. We show this as a simple number (the risk) and give a range that tells us how certain we are about it.\" 2) \"the delicate connection (anastomosis) between the bladder and the ureter\" – the word “anastomosis” is not defined and “ureter” may be unfamiliar. Suggested rewrite: \"the delicate connection (the stitch) between the bladder (the organ that stores urine) and the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).\" 3) \"The pooled result gave a relative risk of 0.89 (95 % CI 0.17 to 4.57). The I² value was 88 %, meaning the results varied a lot between the studies\" – combines two statistical concepts in one long sentence. Suggested rewrite: \"When we combined the two studies, the risk of bacteria in the urine was about the same whether the catheter was removed early or later (risk = 0.89). The wide range (0.17 to 4.57) shows we are very uncertain. The studies gave very different results (a value called I² of 88 %).\" These issues are reflected in the metric analysis, which shows unusually high counts of nominalisations (21), nouns (171), SMOG index (14), complex words (124) and long words (177). Reducing these will improve readability and align the summary with typical Cochrane PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit and has good sentence length (average 15 words, P25). Readability scores are strong (Flesch‑Kincaid 8.3, FRE 62). However, several language‑complexity metrics deviate markedly: nominalisation, noun count, SMOG, complex‑word and long‑word counts are all in the P90 range, indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many long, technical words. These metric deviations support the need to simplify wording and reduce jargon."
