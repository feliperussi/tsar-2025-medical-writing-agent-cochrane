  "draft": "Is taking out the urinary catheter (tube that drains urine) early (within 5 days) better than taking it out later (after 5 days) for people who have had a kidney transplant (kidney transplantation)?\n\nKey messages  \n– We are not sure whether removing the catheter before five days changes the chance of bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria).  \n– The review found only two small studies (197 participants) and could not determine any difference in symptomatic urinary infections or serious kidney‑related problems; no safety concerns were reported.  \n– Because the studies were small, had high or unclear risk of bias, and followed patients for less than one month, our confidence in the evidence is very low.\n\nWhy is the timing of urinary catheter removal after kidney transplantation important?  \nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys no longer work. During the operation a thin tube called a urinary catheter is placed in the bladder so urine can drain safely while the new kidney heals. The catheter protects the delicate connection (anastomosis) between the bladder and the ureter, but it also creates a pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary tract infection (UTI). The longer the catheter stays in place, the higher the risk of infection. Doctors do not agree on how many days the catheter should remain after the transplant, and different removal times might affect infection rates or other complications such as the surgical connection breaking down.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare two groups of kidney‑transplant patients: those whose catheter was removed early (before 5 days) and those whose catheter stayed in longer (five days or more). We looked at three outcomes: (1) symptomatic UTIs, (2) bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), and (3) major urological problems that needed extra treatment.\n\nHow did we find and analyse the studies?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register up to 13 April 2023. The register includes results from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared early with late catheter removal, regardless of donor type, age or gender. Two reviewers screened the records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results using a random‑effects model and expressed effects as relative risk (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). We rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found two small studies that together enrolled 197 kidney‑transplant recipients. Both trials compared early removal (less than five days) with later removal (five days or more). The only outcome reported was asymptomatic bacteriuria. The pooled result was RR 0.89 (95 % CI 0.17 to 4.57), with high statistical heterogeneity (I² = 88 %). The evidence was judged very low certainty. No reliable data were available for symptomatic UTIs or major urological complications, and follow‑up was limited to less than one month.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small and had high or unclear risk of bias. Participants and clinicians may have known which timing was used, which can affect results. The studies provided limited outcome data, used different patient groups, and followed patients for only a short period. These factors make the overall estimate uncertain.\n\nHow up to date is this review?  \nOur search covered all relevant records up to 13 April 2023, so the evidence reflects the literature available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required completeness, title/subheading format, factual accuracy, and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a patient reader. \n\n1. **Long, jargon‑heavy sentence** – \"The catheter protects the delicate connection (anastomosis) between the bladder and the ureter, but it also creates a pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary tract infection (UTI).\" This 33‑word sentence combines two ideas and uses the technical term *anastomosis* without explanation. *Rewrite*: \"The catheter helps protect the delicate link between the bladder and the ureter. However, it also provides a route for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary tract infection (UTI).\"\n\n2. **Unexplained technical terms** – Terms such as *anastomosis*, *asymptomatic bacteriuria*, *relative risk (RR)*, *confidence interval (CI)* and *I²* appear without plain‑language definitions, leaving readers unsure of their meaning. *Rewrite examples*: \n   - *anastomosis*: \"the surgical connection between the bladder and the tube that carries urine from the kidney (ureter)\"\n   - *asymptomatic bacteriuria*: \"bacteria in the urine that do not cause any symptoms\"\n   - *relative risk (RR)*: \"how much more or less likely an outcome is in one group compared with another\"\n   - *confidence interval (CI)*: \"the range of values within which the true effect is likely to lie\"\n   - *I²*: \"a statistic that shows how much the study results differ from each other\"\n\n3. **Nominalisation and passive constructions** – The draft frequently uses noun‑heavy phrasing and passive voice, e.g., \"The only outcome reported was asymptomatic bacteriuria\" and \"The pooled result was RR 0.89…\" This makes the text harder to follow. *Rewrite*: \"The studies only reported whether bacteria were present without symptoms\" and \"We found a pooled relative risk of 0.89 (95 % CI 0.17 to 4.57)\"\n\nThese three issues (long sentence, unexplained jargon, and noun‑heavy passive language) are the most important barriers to patient understanding. Addressing them will also improve the metrics that currently deviate from typical PLS patterns (nominalizations = 22 → target < 13; nouns = 160 → target < 116; smog = 13.8 → target < 12.1; complex words = 121 → target < 84).",

However, six metrics fall outside typical PLS ranges: nominalizations, total nouns, SMOG index, Dale‑Chall complex words, overall complex words, and long words—all in the high‑complexity (P90) zone, indicating the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long or technical words. Reducing nominalizations and simplifying vocabulary will bring the draft closer to the median PLS profile."
