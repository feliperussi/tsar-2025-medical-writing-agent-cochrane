  "draft": "\"Is taking out the urinary catheter (tube that drains urine) early (within 5 days) better than taking it out later (after 5 days) for people who have had a kidney transplant (kidney transplantation)?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n- We do not know if removing the catheter before 5 days changes the chance of having bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria).  \n- The review found no evidence of differences in symptomatic urinary infections (UTIs) or serious urological problems, and no harmful effects were reported.  \n- The evidence comes from only two small studies with high or unclear risk of bias and follow‑up of less than one month, so it is weak.\n\nWhy is the timing of urinary catheter removal after kidney transplantation important?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys no longer work. During the operation a thin tube, called a urinary catheter, is placed in the bladder so urine can drain safely while the new kidney heals. The catheter protects the delicate connection (anastomosis) between the bladder and the ureter, reducing tension and allowing the tissue to stitch together properly. However, the catheter also creates a pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary tract infection (UTI) – an infection that makes the bladder and urethra painful. The longer the catheter stays in place, the higher the risk of infection. Doctors do not agree on how many days the catheter should remain after the transplant, and different removal times might affect infection rates or other complications such as the surgical connection breaking down.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare two groups of kidney‑transplant patients: those whose urinary catheter was removed early (before 5 days after surgery) and those whose catheter stayed in longer (5 days or more). We looked at whether early removal changed the rates of (1) symptomatic urinary tract infections, (2) bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), and (3) major urological problems that needed extra treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register, which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings and trial registries, for studies up to April 2023. We included randomised controlled trials that compared early versus late catheter removal after kidney transplantation. Two reviewers screened the records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results using a random‑effects model and rated our confidence in the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two small studies that together enrolled 197 kidney‑transplant recipients. Both trials compared early removal (less than 5 days) with later removal (5 days or more). The participants included all donor types and were not limited by age or gender, although detailed demographics were not reported. Follow‑up was short‑term only, up to one month after surgery. The studies only reported on asymptomatic bacteriuria. We could not determine whether removing the catheter before 5 days changes the likelihood of bacteria in the urine without symptoms, and we had no reliable information on symptomatic UTIs or serious urinary complications.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which timing they received, the studies provided limited data on our outcomes, the interventions varied, and the sample sizes were very small. Risk of bias was high or unclear in both studies.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to April 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.\"",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural checklist (all required sections, question‑style headings, correct numbers, <850 words), but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained technical jargon** – the methods paragraph mentions a “random‑effects model” and “GRADE” without any lay explanation, leaving readers unsure what these mean.\n2. **Ambiguous wording in the key‑message bullet** – “no evidence of differences” can be read as “no difference was found” rather than “the review did not have data to compare”. This may mislead readers about the results.\n3. **Overly long, dense sentence in the limitations** – the sentence that lists several reasons for low confidence is 38 words and packs many ideas together, making it hard to follow.\n4. **Heavy noun‑ and nominalisation usage** – the text is noun‑heavy (160 nouns, P90) and contains many nominalisations (24, P90), which reduces readability for non‑experts.\n5. **Use of the term “anastomosis”** – although briefly defined, the word is still technical and may not be clear to patients.\nThese issues exceed the acceptable level of clarity for a Plain Language Summary and need revision.\n\n**Suggested rewrites:**\n- *Original:* “We combined the results using a random‑effects model and rated our confidence in the evidence with GRADE.”\n  *Rewrite:* “We pooled the study results using a simple statistical method and judged how confident we are in the evidence with an easy‑to‑understand rating system (GRADE).”\n- *Original:* “The review found no evidence of differences in symptomatic urinary infections (UTIs) or serious urological problems, and no harmful effects were reported.”\n  *Rewrite:* “The review did not have enough data to tell whether early or late catheter removal changes the risk of urinary infections or serious kidney‑related problems, and no safety concerns were reported.”\n- *Original:* “We are not confident in the evidence because participants may have known which timing they received, the studies provided limited data on our outcomes, the interventions varied, and studies were very small.”\n  *Rewrite:* “We are uncertain about the evidence because:\n  • Participants might have known which timing they got;\n  • The studies gave little information on the outcomes we wanted;\n  • The way the catheter was removed differed between studies;\n  • Only a few patients were studied.”\n- *Original:* “During the operation a thin tube, called a urinary catheter, is placed in the bladder … the delicate connection (anastomosis) between the bladder and the ureter …”\n  *Rewrite:* “During surgery a thin tube (urinary catheter) is placed in the bladder. It helps protect the tiny link where the bladder meets the tube from the kidney (the ureter), allowing it to heal properly.”\n\n**Metrics support:** The evaluation shows high nominalisation (24, P90) and noun count (160, P90), indicating the text is noun‑heavy. Complex‑word counts (129, P90) and long‑word counts (180, P90) are also above typical PLS ranges, confirming the need to simplify wording and use more verbs. Overall, the draft needs these revisions before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is within the 850‑word limit (615 words) and scores well on readability indices (FKGL 11.4, FRE 49.7). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in several lexical metrics: nominalisation (24, P90), nouns (160, P90), SMOG (14.1, P90), complex words (129, P90), and long words (180, P90) are all above the median, indicating a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style that reduces lay readability. These metric alerts align with the identified clarity issues."
