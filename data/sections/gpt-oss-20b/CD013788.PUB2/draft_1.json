  "draft": "Is taking out the urinary catheter (tube that drains urine) early (within 5 days) better than taking it out later (after 5 days) for people who have had a kidney transplant (kidney transplantation)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- It is not clear whether taking out the urinary catheter (tube that drains urine) before five days after a kidney transplant (surgical replacement of a failing kidney) changes the chance of having bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria); the review did not find evidence about differences in symptomatic urinary infections or serious urological problems, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The conclusion is based on only two small studies with limited information, high or unclear risk of bias, and follow‑up of less than one month, so the overall evidence is weak.\n- More well‑designed, larger randomised trials that include longer follow‑up are needed to determine whether early or late catheter removal affects infection rates or other complications after kidney transplantation.\n\n**Introduction**\nWhy is the timing of urinary catheter removal after kidney transplantation important?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys no longer work. During the operation a thin tube, called a urinary catheter, is placed in the bladder so that urine can drain safely while the new kidney heals. The catheter helps protect the delicate connection (anastomosis) between the bladder and the ureter, reducing tension and allowing the tissue to stitch together properly. However, the catheter also creates a pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary tract infection (UTI) – an infection that makes the bladder and urethra painful and can lead to more serious problems. The longer the catheter stays in place, the higher the risk of infection. Doctors do not agree on how many days the catheter should stay after the transplant, and different removal times might affect the chances of infection or other complications such as the surgical connection breaking down.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to compare two groups of kidney‑transplant patients: those whose urinary catheter was removed early (before five days after surgery) and those whose catheter was removed later (five days or more). They looked at whether early removal changed the rates of (1) symptomatic urinary tract infections, (2) bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), and (3) major urological problems that needed extra treatment.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared early (≤5 days) versus late (>5 days) urinary‑catheter removal after kidney transplantation, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found two small studies that together included 197 kidney‑transplant recipients. Both trials compared early urinary‑catheter removal (less than five days after the transplant) with later removal (five days or more). The participants covered all donor types and were not limited by age, gender or other demographics, although specific details were not provided. Follow‑up was short‑term only, up to one month after surgery, and the review did not report the countries where the studies were conducted or their funding sources. The only outcome reported was asymptomatic bacteriuria. The review could not determine whether removing the catheter before five days changes the likelihood of having bacteria in the urine without symptoms, and there was no reliable information on whether early removal affects the risk of a symptomatic urinary‑tract infection or serious urinary complications.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people/used different ways of delivering intervention, and studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "Critical issue: The draft does not meet the style requirement that all subheadings be phrased as questions. Subheadings such as \"Key messages\", \"Methods\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are statements, not questions, so the document fails the Title & Subheadings section of the checklist.\n\nAdditional improvements needed for clarity and readability:\n1. Problematic bullet (Key messages): \"It is not clear whether taking out the urinary catheter (tube that drains urine) before five days after a kidney transplant (surgical replacement of a failing kidney) changes the chance of having bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria); the review did not find evidence about differences in symptomatic urinary infections or serious urological problems, and no harmful effects were reported.\" – This sentence is overly long and mixes several ideas, making it hard for a patient to follow. Rewrite: \"We do not know if removing the catheter before five days changes the chance of having bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria). The review also found no evidence of differences in symptomatic urinary infections or serious urological problems, and no harmful effects were reported.\"\n2. Passive‑heavy sentence (Results): \"The only outcome reported was asymptomatic bacteriuria.\" – Passive construction hides who reported the outcome. Rewrite: \"The studies only reported on asymptomatic bacteriuria.\"\n3. Nominalisation (Currency): \"The evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search.\" – The noun‑heavy phrasing is difficult. Rewrite: \"We searched the literature up to April 2023.\"\n4. Jargon without plain explanation (Results): \"asymptomatic bacteriuria\" is used without a simple definition in the main text. Although defined in the key messages, many readers may miss it. Rewrite: \"asymptomatic bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine that do not cause any symptoms).\"\n5. Subheading wording: Change non‑question headings to questions, e.g., \"Key messages\" → \"What are the main findings?\", \"Methods\" → \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"Limitations\" → \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"Currency\" → \"How up‑to‑date is the evidence?\".\n\nMetrics support these suggestions: the draft averages 25 words per sentence (P90) and contains 28 nominalisations (BEYOND_P90), indicating overly long sentences and noun‑heavy language. The high count of complex words (140, P90) and long words (197, P90) also points to the need for simpler wording. Reducing sentence length and nominalisations will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity overall but highlights several deviations: words per sentence (25, P90) exceeds the typical range, nominalisations (28, BEYOND_P90) and complex/long words are far above median values, and the Dale‑Chall readability score (8.33, P90) indicates higher difficulty. These metric alerts align with the identified clarity issues and suggest the draft would benefit from shorter sentences, fewer noun‑heavy constructions, and simpler vocabulary."
