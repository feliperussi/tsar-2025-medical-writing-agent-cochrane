  "plain_title": "Is taking out the urinary catheter (tube that drains urine) early (within 5 days) better than taking it out later (after 5 days) for people who have had a kidney transplant (kidney transplantation)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "It is not clear whether taking out the urinary catheter (tube that drains urine) before five days after a kidney transplant (surgical replacement of a failing kidney) changes the chance of having bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria); the review did not find evidence about differences in symptomatic urinary infections or serious urological problems, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "The conclusion is based on only two small studies with limited information, high or unclear risk of bias, and follow‑up of less than one month, so the overall evidence is weak.",
    "More well‑designed, larger randomised trials that follow patients for a longer period are needed to determine whether early or late catheter removal affects infection rates or other complications after kidney transplantation."

      "subheading": "Why is the timing of urinary catheter removal after kidney transplantation important?",
      "content": "Kidney transplantation is the best treatment for people whose kidneys no longer work. During the operation a thin tube, called a urinary catheter, is placed in the bladder so that urine can drain safely while the new kidney heals. The catheter helps protect the delicate connection (anastomosis) between the bladder and the ureter, reducing tension and allowing the tissue to stitch together properly. However, the catheter also creates a pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder, which can cause a urinary tract infection (UTI) – an infection that makes the bladder and urethra painful and can lead to more serious problems. The longer the catheter stays in place, the higher the risk of infection. Doctors do not agree on how many days the catheter should stay after the transplant, and different removal times might affect the chances of infection or other complications such as the surgical connection breaking down."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to compare two groups of kidney‑transplant patients: those whose urinary catheter was removed early (before five days after surgery) and those whose catheter stayed in longer (five days or more). They looked at whether early removal changed the rates of (1) symptomatic urinary tract infections, (2) bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), and (3) major urological problems that needed extra treatment."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found two small studies that together included 197 kidney‑transplant recipients. Both trials compared early urinary‑catheter removal (less than five days after the transplant) with later removal (five days or more). The participants covered all donor types and were not limited by age, gender or other demographics, although specific details were not provided. Follow‑up was short‑term only, up to one month after surgery, and the review did not report the countries where the studies were conducted or their funding sources. The only outcome reported was asymptomatic bacteriuria. The review could not determine whether removing the catheter before five days changes the likelihood of having bacteria in the urine without symptoms, and there was no reliable information on whether early removal affects the risk of a symptomatic urinary‑tract infection or serious urinary complications."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people/used different ways of delivering intervention, and studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search."
