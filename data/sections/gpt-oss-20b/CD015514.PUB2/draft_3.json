  "draft": "Does lying face‑down after eye surgery (pars plana vitrectomy) help prevent the retina from shifting in macula‑involving retinal detachments?\n\nKey messages\n– Lying face‑down (on your stomach) right after pars plana vitrectomy may reduce the chance that the retina shifts out of place (retinal displacement), and it may lower the risk of outer retinal folds (wrinkles in the back layer of the eye) and double vision when both eyes are used together (binocular diplopia). It may also increase the chance of higher pressure inside the eye (elevated intra‑ocular pressure). The evidence is limited and uncertain.\n– The available studies did not show a clear difference in how much vision improves (best‑corrected visual acuity) or in patients’ reported visual distortion or quality of life between face‑down and other post‑surgery positions.\n– Because the evidence comes from only three small trials, we need larger, well‑designed studies to confirm whether face‑down positioning truly helps and to understand any harms.\n\nWhat is a macula‑involving retinal detachment and why is it a problem?  \nA rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) occurs when a tear lets fluid slip behind the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). When the detachment includes the macula – the central part of the retina that provides sharp, detailed vision – we call it a macula‑involving RRD. This is a common eye‑surgery emergency and can quickly cause serious loss of vision if not repaired promptly.\n\nHow is a macula‑involving RRD usually treated and what extra steps are sometimes recommended?  \nSurgeons usually perform a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), a procedure that removes the gel‑like fluid inside the eye and replaces it with a gas bubble (gas tamponade) that pushes the retina back into place. Some eye doctors ask patients to stay in a face‑down position after the operation. The idea is that gravity keeps the gas bubble against the retina and may prevent retinal displacement – a shift that can cause visual distortions (metamorphopsia) and double vision when both eyes are used together (binocular diplopia). Another approach is “support‑the‑break” positioning, where the head is tilted so the gas bubble sits over the retinal tear without lying completely face‑down.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether keeping patients face‑down after PPV with gas tamponade reduces the risk of retinal displacement and related problems, compared with other post‑surgery positions such as face‑up or support‑the‑break. We also examined effects on visual acuity, quality of life, and eye‑related side effects like outer retinal folds and raised eye pressure.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched several databases up to 28 November 2022 for randomized controlled trials that compared face‑down positioning with any other post‑operative position after PPV for primary macula‑involving RRD. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified three trials that together enrolled 368 participants (369 eyes). Most participants were men (68 %–72 %). The trials compared immediate face‑down positioning with support‑the‑break or face‑up positioning and followed patients for up to about six months.\n\n– Retinal displacement: One trial showed fewer cases of retinal displacement with face‑down positioning (risk ratio 0.73). The certainty of this evidence is very low.  \n– Visual acuity: Two trials found no clear difference in best‑corrected visual acuity at three months between face‑down and other positions.  \n– Visual distortion and quality of life: One trial reported little or no effect of face‑down positioning on distortion scores or quality‑of‑life scores at 26 weeks.  \n– Outer retinal folds: One trial suggested face‑down positioning reduced outer retinal folds (risk ratio 0.39) and binocular diplopia (risk ratio 0.20). Another trial found no difference.  \n– Intra‑ocular pressure: One trial indicated face‑down positioning may increase the risk of elevated intra‑ocular pressure (risk ratio 1.74).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because the three trials were very small, involved mainly male participants, and provided limited information about participants’ ages, severity of detachment, and study settings. The trials also used different outcome measures, which makes it hard to combine the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence reflects searches completed up to November 2022. New studies may have been published since then.\n\nWhat do we need next?  \nWe need larger, well‑designed trials that compare face‑down positioning with other post‑surgery positions. Future research should report detailed participant characteristics, use consistent outcome measures, and include patients’ preferences and quality‑of‑life assessments.",
