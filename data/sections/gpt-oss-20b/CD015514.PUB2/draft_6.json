  "draft": "Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to repair a detached retina) better than other positions for preventing retinal displacement in macula‑involving retinal detachments?\n\nKey messages\n– Lying face‑down (on your stomach) right after pars plana vitrectomy may reduce retinal displacement, outer retinal folds and double vision, but it may increase eye‑pressure.  \n– The evidence for these benefits and harms is limited and uncertain.  \n– The studies did not show a clear difference in how sharp vision becomes (best‑corrected visual acuity), visual distortion or quality of life compared with other positions.\n\nWhat is a macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and why is it a problem?  \nA rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) occurs when a tear lets fluid slip behind the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). When the detachment includes the macula – the central part of the retina that gives us sharp, detailed vision – we call it a macula‑involving RRD. This is a common eye‑surgery emergency and can quickly cause serious loss of vision if not repaired promptly.\n\nHow is a macula‑involving retinal detachment usually treated and what extra steps are sometimes recommended?  \nSurgeons usually perform a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In this procedure they remove the gel‑like fluid inside the eye and replace it with a harmless gas bubble (gas tamponade) that pushes the retina back into place. Some eye doctors ask patients to stay face‑down after the operation. The idea is that gravity keeps the gas bubble against the retina and may prevent the retina from shifting after surgery – a problem called retinal displacement that can cause wavy vision (metamorphopsia) and double vision when both eyes are used together (binocular diplopia). Another option is a “support‑the‑break” position, where the head is tilted so the bubble sits over the retinal tear without lying completely face‑down.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether keeping patients face‑down after PPV with gas tamponade reduces the risk of retinal displacement and related problems, compared with other post‑surgery positions such as lying on the back (face‑up) or using the support‑the‑break position. We also looked at effects on visual acuity, visual distortion, quality of life, outer retinal folds, double vision and eye pressure.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched studies up to November 2022 that compared face‑down positioning after pars plana vitrectomy with any other post‑operative position for primary macula‑involving retinal detachments. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified three randomized trials that together enrolled 368 participants (369 eyes). Most participants were men (68 %–72 %). The trials compared immediate face‑down positioning with support‑the‑break or face‑up positioning and followed patients for up to about six months.\n\n– Retinal displacement: One trial found fewer cases with face‑down positioning (risk ratio 0.73). The evidence is of very low certainty.  \n– Visual acuity: Two trials found no clear difference in best‑corrected visual acuity at three months. The evidence is of very low certainty.  \n– Visual distortion and quality of life: One trial reported little or no effect on distortion scores or quality‑of‑life scores at 26 weeks. The evidence is of very low certainty.  \n– Outer retinal folds: One trial suggested face‑down reduced outer retinal folds (risk ratio 0.39). The evidence is of very low certainty.  \n– Double vision: The same trial suggested face‑down reduced binocular diplopia (risk ratio 0.20). The evidence is of very low certainty.  \n– Eye pressure: One trial indicated face‑down may increase the risk of elevated intra‑ocular pressure (risk ratio 1.74). The evidence is of very low certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe three trials were very small and involved mainly male participants. They gave limited information about age, severity of detachment and study settings. Different trials used different outcome measures, making it hard to combine results. Because of these issues, we have low confidence in the findings.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched studies up to November 2022. New research may have been published since then.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the basic completeness, title/subheading, factual accuracy, and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that could confuse a lay reader. Key issues are: (1) technical terms such as “outer retinal folds” are not explained; (2) statistical language like “risk ratio 0.73” is not translated into plain‑language meaning; (3) frequent passive constructions and noun‑heavy phrasing make the text feel abstract (e.g., “The evidence is of very low certainty.”). These issues reduce understandability and are reflected in the metrics (16 passive sentences, 34 nominalisations, and very high counts of complex and long words). The following concrete rewrites are recommended.\n\n1. Problematic sentence: “Outer retinal folds” appears in the results without explanation.\n   Why it’s problematic: Patients are unlikely to know what this means.\n   Suggested rewrite: “outer retinal folds (small wrinkles in the back layer of the eye)”.\n\n2. Problematic sentence: “One trial found fewer cases with face‑down positioning (risk ratio 0.73).”\n   Why it’s problematic: “risk ratio” is a statistical term that most readers do not understand.\n   Suggested rewrite: “One trial found fewer cases of retinal displacement with face‑down positioning – about a 27% reduction compared with other positions (risk ratio 0.73).”\n\n3. Problematic sentence: “The evidence is of very low certainty.”\n   Why it’s problematic: Passive voice and abstract wording make it hard to grasp how confident we are.\n   Suggested rewrite: “We have very low confidence in this evidence.”\n\n4. Problematic sentence: “We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.”\n   Why it’s problematic: “GRADE approach” is jargon and the sentence is passive.\n   Suggested rewrite: “We pooled the results and assessed how confident we are in the evidence using a standard system called GRADE.”\n\n5. Problematic phrase: “The studies did not show a clear difference in how sharp vision becomes (best‑corrected visual acuity)…”.\n   Why it’s problematic: Awkward wording (“how sharp vision becomes”).\n   Suggested rewrite: “The studies did not show a clear difference in how well vision improves (best‑corrected visual acuity).”\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary easier to read and align it with the Cochrane plain‑language style guide.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (e.g., Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 9, Flesch Reading Ease 59). However, it deviates markedly in nominalisation (34, beyond P90), noun count (206, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.1, beyond P90), and complex‑word metrics (long_words 180, complex_words 178, complex_words_dc 322 – all beyond P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long, technical words, which aligns with the observed passive constructions and jargon that need simplifying."
