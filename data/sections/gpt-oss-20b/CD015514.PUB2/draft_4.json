  "draft": "\"Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to repair a detached retina) better than other post‑surgery positions for preventing retinal displacement in macula‑involving retinal detachments (detached retina that includes the central part of vision)?\"\n\nKey messages\n– Lying face‑down (on your stomach) right after pars plana vitrectomy may:\n   * reduce the chance that the retina moves out of place (retinal displacement),\n   * lower the risk of outer retinal folds (wrinkles in the back layer of the eye) and double vision (seeing two images),\n   * increase the chance of higher eye pressure. The evidence for these effects is limited and uncertain.\n– The studies did not show a clear difference in how well vision improves (best‑corrected visual acuity) or in patients’ reported visual distortion or quality of life between face‑down and other positions.\n– Because the evidence comes from only three small trials, we need larger, well‑designed studies to confirm any benefits or harms.\n\nWhat is a macula‑involving retinal detachment and why is it a problem?  \nA rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) occurs when a tear lets fluid slip behind the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). When the detachment includes the macula – the central part of the retina that gives us sharp, detailed vision – we call it a macula‑involving RRD. This is a common eye‑surgery emergency and can quickly cause serious loss of vision if not repaired promptly.\n\nHow is a macula‑involving RRD usually treated and what extra steps are sometimes recommended?  \nSurgeons usually perform a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In this procedure they remove the gel‑like fluid inside the eye and replace it with a gas bubble (a small bubble of harmless gas placed in the eye after surgery) that pushes the retina back into place. Some eye doctors ask patients to stay face‑down after the operation. The idea is that gravity keeps the gas bubble pressed against the retina. This may stop the retina from moving – a problem called retinal displacement that can cause visual distortion (seeing wavy lines) and double vision (seeing two images). Another approach is “support‑the‑break” positioning, where the head is tilted so the gas bubble sits over the retinal tear without the patient lying completely face‑down.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether keeping patients face‑down after PPV with gas tamponade reduces the risk of retinal displacement and related problems, compared with other post‑surgery positions such as face‑up or support‑the‑break. We also looked at effects on visual acuity, visual distortion, quality of life, outer retinal folds, double vision, and eye pressure.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched several databases up to 28 November 2022 for randomized controlled trials that compared face‑down positioning with any other post‑operative position after PPV for primary macula‑involving RRD. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified three trials that together enrolled 368 participants (369 eyes). Most participants were men (68 %–72 %). The studies compared immediate face‑down positioning with support‑the‑break or face‑up positioning and followed patients for up to about six months.\n\n– **Retinal displacement:** One trial showed fewer cases with face‑down positioning (risk ratio 0.73). Certainty of the evidence is very low.  \n– **Visual acuity:** Two trials found no clear difference in best‑corrected visual acuity at three months.  \n– **Visual distortion and quality of life:** One trial reported little or no effect on distortion scores or quality‑of‑life scores at 26 weeks.  \n– **Outer retinal folds and double vision:** One trial suggested face‑down reduced outer retinal folds (risk ratio 0.39) and double vision (risk ratio 0.20). Another trial found no difference.  \n– **Eye pressure:** One trial indicated face‑down may increase the risk of elevated intra‑ocular pressure (risk ratio 1.74).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe three trials were very small and involved mainly male participants. They provided limited information about age, severity of detachment, and study settings. Different trials used different outcome measures, making it hard to combine results. Because of these issues, we have low confidence in the findings.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence reflects searches completed up to November 2022. New studies may have been published since then.\n\nWhat do we need next?  \nWe need larger, well‑designed trials that compare face‑down positioning with other post‑surgery positions. Future research should report detailed participant characteristics, use consistent outcome measures, and include patients’ preferences and quality‑of‑life assessments.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several passages that would likely confuse a lay reader. 1) The term “support‑the‑break positioning” is used without a clear, plain‑language explanation, leaving readers unsure what the alternative posture involves. 2) A long, compound sentence about gravity and retinal displacement (\"The idea is that gravity will keep the gas bubble against the retina and may prevent the retina from shifting after the operation – a problem known as retinal displacement, which can cause visual distortions (metamorphopsia) and double vision when both eyes are used together (binocular diplopia).\") is difficult to follow and exceeds the recommended length for plain‑language text. 3) The draft relies heavily on noun‑heavy constructions and nominalisations (e.g., \"The evidence reflects searches completed up to November 2022\"), which the metrics flag as far beyond typical PLS patterns (nominalisation 30 → target <13; nouns 228 → target <116). 4) Passive voice appears in several places, reducing immediacy (e.g., \"The evidence reflects searches completed…\"). 5) Some bullet‑point phrasing is wordy (\"increase the chance of higher eye pressure\"). These issues together create a text that is less accessible than required for a patient‑focused Plain Language Summary.\n\nTop improvements:\n1) Problematic phrase: \"support‑the‑break positioning\". Why problematic: No plain‑language definition; readers cannot visualise the posture. Rewrite: \"a ‘support‑the‑break’ position, where you tilt your head so the gas bubble sits over the retinal tear without lying completely face‑down\".\n2) Problematic sentence: \"The idea is that gravity will keep the gas bubble against the retina and may prevent the retina from shifting after the operation – a problem known as retinal displacement, which can cause visual distortions (metamorphopsia) and double vision when both eyes are used together (binocular diplopia).\" Why problematic: Over 30 words, multiple clauses, and introduces technical term “metamorphopsia”. Rewrite: \"We think gravity helps the gas bubble press against the retina. This may stop the retina from moving after surgery – a problem called retinal displacement that can cause wavy vision and double vision.\"\n3) Problematic passive sentence: \"The evidence reflects searches completed up to November 2022.\" Why problematic: Passive voice hides who did the searching. Rewrite: \"We searched the literature up to November 2022.\"\n4) Problematic noun‑heavy phrase: \"The evidence reflects searches completed up to November 2022.\" (also contributes to high noun count). Why problematic: Uses many nouns, making the sentence dense. Rewrite: \"We looked for studies published up to November 2022.\"\n5) Problematic bullet wording: \"increase the chance of higher eye pressure.\" Why problematic: Awkward phrasing; could be clearer. Rewrite: \"may increase the risk of higher eye pressure (raised intra‑ocular pressure).\"\n\nThese rewrites address the major clarity gaps, reduce sentence length, replace passive constructions with active voice, and lower noun‑heavy phrasing, bringing the text in line with the style guide and typical PLS metrics.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and contains all required sections, but metric analysis shows several deviations from typical PLS patterns: nominalisations (30, beyond P90), nouns (228, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.1, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.2, beyond P90), complex words (182, beyond P90) and long words (190, beyond P90).
