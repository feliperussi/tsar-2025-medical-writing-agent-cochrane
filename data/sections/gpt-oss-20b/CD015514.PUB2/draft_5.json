  "draft": "Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to repair a detached retina) better than other post‑surgery positions for preventing retinal displacement in macula‑involving retinal detachments (detached retina that includes the central part of vision)?\n\nKey messages\n– Lying face‑down (on your stomach) right after pars plana vitrectomy may lower the chance that the retina moves out of place (retinal displacement) and may reduce outer retinal folds (wrinkles in the back layer of the eye) and double vision when both eyes are used together (binocular diplopia). It may also increase the risk of higher pressure inside the eye (elevated intra‑ocular pressure). The evidence for these effects is limited and uncertain.\n– The available studies did not show a clear difference in how well vision improves (best‑corrected visual acuity, a measure of sharpness of vision with glasses) or in patients’ reported visual distortion or quality of life between face‑down and other positions after surgery.\n– Because the evidence comes from only three small trials, we need larger, well‑designed studies to confirm any benefits or harms.\n\nWhat is a macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and why is it a problem?  \nA rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) occurs when a tear lets fluid slip behind the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). When the detachment includes the macula – the central part of the retina that gives us sharp, detailed vision – we call it a macula‑involving RRD. This is a common eye‑surgery emergency and can quickly cause serious loss of vision if not repaired promptly.\n\nHow is a macula‑involving RRD usually treated and what extra steps are sometimes recommended?  \nSurgeons usually perform a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In this procedure they remove the gel‑like fluid inside the eye and replace it with a gas bubble (a harmless gas placed in the eye after surgery) that pushes the retina back into place. Some eye doctors ask patients to stay face‑down after the operation. The idea is that gravity helps the gas bubble press against the retina, which may stop the retina from moving after surgery – a problem called retinal displacement that can cause wavy vision (metamorphopsia) and double vision (binocular diplopia). Another option is a “support‑the‑break” position, where the patient tilts the head so the gas bubble sits over the retinal tear without lying completely face‑down.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether keeping patients face‑down after PPV with gas tamponade reduces the risk of retinal displacement and related problems, compared with other post‑surgery positions such as lying on the back (face‑up) or using the support‑the‑break position. We also looked at effects on visual acuity, visual distortion, quality of life, outer retinal folds, double vision, and eye pressure.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to November 2022 for randomized controlled trials that compared face‑down positioning with any other post‑operative position after PPV for primary macula‑involving RRD. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified three trials that together enrolled 368 participants (369 eyes). Most participants were men (68 %–72 %). The trials compared immediate face‑down positioning with support‑the‑break or face‑up positioning and followed patients for up to about six months.\n\n– Retinal displacement: One trial showed fewer cases with face‑down positioning (risk ratio 0.73). Certainty of the evidence is very low.  \n– Visual acuity: Two trials found no clear difference in best‑corrected visual acuity at three months.  \n– Visual distortion and quality of life: One trial reported little or no effect on distortion scores or quality‑of‑life scores at 26 weeks.  \n– Outer retinal folds and double vision: One trial suggested face‑down reduced outer retinal folds (risk ratio 0.39) and double vision (risk ratio 0.20). Another trial found no difference.  \n– Eye pressure: One trial indicated face‑down may increase the risk of elevated intra‑ocular pressure (risk ratio 1.74).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe three trials were very small and involved mainly male participants. They gave limited information about age, severity of detachment, and study settings. Different trials used different outcome measures, making it hard to combine results. Because of these issues, we have low confidence in the findings.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence reflects searches completed up to November 2022. New studies may have been published since then.\n\nWhat do we need next?  \nWe need larger, well‑designed trials that compare face‑down positioning with other post‑surgery positions. Future research should report detailed participant characteristics, use consistent outcome measures, and include patients’ preferences and quality‑of‑life assessments.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required checks (all sections present, title and sub‑headings are phrased as questions, numbers match the source, word count = 789). However, three major clarity problems would likely confuse a patient reader:\n1. Over‑long opening question – “Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to repair a detached retina) better than other post‑surgery positions for preventing retinal displacement in macula‑involving retinal detachments (detached retina that includes the central part of vision)?” This sentence packs several concepts and nested parentheses, making it hard to follow. Rewrite: “Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to repair a detached retina) better than other positions for preventing retinal displacement in macula‑involving retinal detachments?”\n2. Key‑messages bullet is a single, dense sentence – “Lying face‑down (on your stomach) right after pars plana vitrectomy may lower the chance that the retina moves out of place … It may also increase the risk of higher pressure inside the eye … The evidence for these effects is limited and uncertain.” The sentence mixes three separate ideas. Rewrite: split into two bullets:\n   - “Lying face‑down (on your stomach) right after pars plana vitrectomy may reduce retinal displacement, outer retinal folds and double vision, but it may increase eye‑pressure.\n   - The evidence for these benefits and harms is limited and uncertain.”\n3. Result bullets contain long, noun‑heavy sentences – e.g., “– Retinal displacement: One trial showed fewer cases with face‑down positioning (risk ratio 0.73). Certainty of the evidence is very low.” This pattern repeats, reducing readability. Rewrite each bullet into two short sentences: “– Retinal displacement: One trial found fewer cases with face‑down positioning (risk ratio 0.73). The evidence is of very low certainty.”\nAdditional minor edits to reduce nominalisations (e.g., change “The evidence reflects searches completed up to November 2022.” to “We searched studies up to November 2022.”) will also improve flow. These changes address the most confusing parts while keeping the content accurate and within the style guide.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability metrics (e.g., Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 57.7, words per sentence 19.2) are in the good‑range (P25‑P75).

The suggested rewrites reduce nominalisations and break long sentences, bringing the text closer to typical PLS patterns."
