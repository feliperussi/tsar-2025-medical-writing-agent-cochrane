  "draft": "Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to repair a detached retina) better than other post‑surgery positions for preventing retinal displacement in macula‑involving retinal detachments (detached retina that includes the central part of vision)?\n\nKey messages\n– Lying face‑down (on your stomach) right after pars plana vitrectomy may lower the chance that the retina moves out of place (retinal displacement) and may reduce some eye problems such as outer retinal folds (small wrinkles in the back layer of the eye) and double vision when both eyes are used together (binocular diplopia), but it may increase the chance of higher pressure inside the eye (elevated intra‑ocular pressure).  \n– The studies we found did not show a clear difference in how well vision improves (best‑corrected visual acuity) or in patients’ reports of visual distortion or quality of life when we compare face‑down with other positions.  \n– Because the evidence comes from only three small trials, we have very low confidence in these results and larger, well‑designed studies are needed.\n\nWhat is a macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and why is it a problem?  \nA rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) occurs when a tear lets fluid slip behind the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). When the detachment includes the macula – the central part of the retina that gives us sharp, detailed vision – we call it a macula‑involving RRD. This is a common eye‑surgery emergency and can quickly cause serious loss of vision if it is not repaired promptly.\n\nHow is a macula‑involving retinal detachment usually treated and what extra steps are sometimes recommended?  \nSurgeons usually perform a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In this procedure they remove the gel‑like fluid inside the eye and replace it with a harmless gas bubble (gas tamponade) that pushes the retina back into place. Some eye doctors ask patients to stay face‑down after the operation. The idea is that gravity keeps the gas bubble against the retina and may prevent the retina from shifting after surgery – a problem called retinal displacement that can cause wavy vision (metamorphopsia) and double vision when both eyes are used together (binocular diplopia). Another option is a “support‑the‑break” position, where the head is tilted so the bubble sits over the retinal tear without lying completely face‑down.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether keeping patients face‑down after PPV with gas tamponade reduces the risk of retinal displacement and related problems, compared with other post‑surgery positions such as lying on the back (face‑up) or using the support‑the‑break position. We also looked at effects on visual acuity, visual distortion, quality of life, outer retinal folds, double vision and eye pressure.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?  \nWe searched multiple databases for randomised trials that compared face‑down positioning after PPV with any other post‑operative position for primary macula‑involving retinal detachments. We pooled the results and assessed how confident we are in the evidence using a standard system called GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified three randomised trials that together enrolled 368 participants (369 eyes). Most participants were men (68 %–72 %). The trials compared immediate face‑down positioning with support‑the‑break or face‑up positioning and followed patients for up to about six months.\n\n– Retinal displacement: One trial found fewer cases of retinal displacement with face‑down positioning – about a 27 % reduction compared with other positions (risk ratio 0.73). We have very low confidence in this result.  \n– Visual acuity: Two trials found no clear difference in best‑corrected visual acuity at three months. We have very low confidence in this result.  \n– Visual distortion and quality of life: One trial reported little or no effect on distortion scores or quality‑of‑life scores at 26 weeks. We have very low confidence in this result.  \n– Outer retinal folds: One trial suggested face‑down reduced outer retinal folds (small wrinkles in the back layer of the eye) – about a 61 % reduction (risk ratio 0.39). We have very low confidence in this result.  \n– Double vision: The same trial suggested face‑down reduced binocular diplopia – about an 80 % reduction (risk ratio 0.20). We have very low confidence in this result.  \n– Eye pressure: One trial indicated face‑down may increase the risk of elevated intra‑ocular pressure – about a 74 % increase (risk ratio 1.74). We have very low confidence in this result.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe three trials were very small and involved mainly male participants. They provided limited information about age, severity of the detachment and where the studies were conducted. Different trials used different outcome measures, making it hard to combine results. Because of these issues, we are not confident that the findings apply to all patients.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched studies up to November 2022. New research may have been published since then.",
