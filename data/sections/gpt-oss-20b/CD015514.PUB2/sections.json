  "key_messages": [
    "Lying face‑down (lying on your stomach) right after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to repair a detached retina) may lower the chance that the retina moves out of place (retinal displacement) and may reduce some eye problems such as outer retinal folds (wrinkles in the back layer of the eye) and double vision when both eyes are used (binocular diplopia), but it may increase the chance of higher pressure inside the eye (elevated intra‑ocular pressure). The evidence for these effects is limited and uncertain.",
    "The available studies did not show a clear difference in how well vision improves (best‑corrected visual acuity, a measure of sharpness of vision with glasses) or in patients’ reported visual distortion or quality of life between face‑down and other positions after surgery.",
    "Because the current evidence comes from a small number of trials with uncertain results, larger, well‑designed studies are needed to determine whether face‑down positioning truly improves outcomes and to better understand any potential harms."

      "subheading": "What is a macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "A rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is when the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) pulls away because of a tear. When the detachment includes the macula – the central part of the retina that gives us sharp, detailed vision – it is called a macula‑involving RRD. This is one of the most common eye‑surgery emergencies and can quickly lead to serious loss of vision if not repaired promptly."

    {
      "subheading": "How is a macula‑involving RRD usually treated and what extra steps are sometimes recommended?",
      "content": "The standard surgery is a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), where the surgeon removes the gel‑like fluid inside the eye and replaces it with a gas bubble (called gas tamponade) that pushes the retina back into place. Some eye doctors suggest that after this surgery the patient should stay in a face‑down position for a period of time. The idea is that gravity will keep the gas bubble against the retina and may prevent the retina from shifting after the operation – a problem known as retinal displacement, which can cause visual distortions (metamorphopsia) and double vision when both eyes are used together (binocular diplopia)."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to determine whether keeping patients face‑down after PPV with gas tamponade actually reduces the risk of retinal displacement and related problems, compared with other post‑surgery positions such as lying on the back (face‑up) or a \"support‑the‑break\" position. They also looked at whether this positioning affects visual acuity, quality of life, and eye‑related side effects like outer retinal folds or raised eye pressure."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found three randomized trials that together enrolled 368 people (369 eyes) with primary macula‑involving retinal detachments treated by pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade. Most participants were men (68%–72%). The studies compared keeping the head face‑down right after surgery with other posturing strategies, such as a support‑the‑break position or face‑up positioning, and followed patients for up to about six months. Only one trial reported funding and only one gave any information about participants’ race or ethnicity; details about age, severity of the condition, and where the trials were conducted were not provided. \n\nIt is unclear whether face‑down positioning after surgery makes a difference to retinal displacement, visual acuity, visual distortion, quality of life, outer retinal folds, binocular diplopia, or intra‑ocular pressure."
