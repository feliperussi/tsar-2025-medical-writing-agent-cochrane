  "draft": "Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to repair a detached retina) better than other post‑surgery positions for preventing retinal displacement in macula‑involving retinal detachments (detached retina that includes the central part of vision)?\n\nKey messages\n- Lying face‑down (on your stomach) right after pars plana vitrectomy may lower the chance that the retina shifts out of place, and it may reduce outer retinal folds (wrinkles in the back layer of the eye) and double vision when both eyes are used together (binocular diplopia). It may also raise the risk of higher pressure inside the eye (elevated intra‑ocular pressure). The evidence is limited and uncertain.\n- The studies we found did not show a clear difference in how much vision improves (best‑... )\n- Because the evidence comes from only three small trials, we need larger, well‑designed studies to confirm whether face‑down positioning truly helps and to understand any harms.\n\nWhat is a macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and why is it a problem?\nA rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) occurs when a tear lets fluid slip behind the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). When the detachment includes the macula – the central part of the retina that provides sharp, detailed vision – we call it a macula‑involving RRD. This condition is a common eye‑surgery emergency and can quickly cause serious loss of vision if not repaired promptly.\n\nHow is a macula‑involving RRD usually treated and what extra steps are sometimes recommended?\nSurgeons typically perform a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In PPV they remove the gel‑like fluid inside the eye and replace it with a gas bubble (gas tamponade) that pushes the retina back into place. Some eye doctors ask patients to stay in a face‑down position after the operation. The idea is that gravity keeps the gas bubble against the retina and may prevent retinal displacement – a shift that can cause visual distortions (metamorphopsia) and double vision when both eyes are used together (binocular diplopia). Another approach is “support‑the‑break” positioning, where the patient keeps the head slightly tilted to keep the gas bubble over the retinal tear without lying completely face‑down.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether keeping patients face‑down after PPV with gas tamponade reduces the risk of retinal displacement and related problems, compared with other post‑surgery positions such as face‑up or support‑the‑break positioning. We also examined effects on visual acuity, quality of life, and eye‑related side effects like outer retinal folds and raised eye pressure.\n\nHow did we look for evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases up to 28 November 2022 for randomized controlled trials that compared face‑down positioning with any other post‑operative position after PPV for primary macula‑involving RRD. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find‑out?\nWe identified three randomized trials that together enrolled 368 participants (369 eyes). Most participants were men (68 %–72 %). The trials compared immediate face‑down positioning with support‑the‑break or face‑up positioning and followed patients for up to about six months.\n\n- Retinal displacement: One trial showed a lower proportion of retinal displacement with face‑down positioning (risk ratio 0.73). The evidence is of very low certainty.\n- Visual acuity: Two trials found no clear difference in best‑corrected visual acuity at three months between face‑down and other positions.\n- Visual distortion and quality of life: One trial reported little or no effect of face‑down positioning on distortion scores or quality‑of‑life scores at 26 weeks.\n- Outer retinal folds: One trial suggested face‑down positioning reduced outer retinal folds (risk ratio 0.39) and binocular diplopia (risk ratio 0.20). Another trial found no difference.\n- Intra‑ocular pressure: One trial indicated face‑down positioning may increase the risk of elevated intra‑ocular pressure (risk ratio 1.74).\n\nOverall, the evidence is very uncertain because the trials were small and reported limited details about participants and settings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are ...\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence reflects searches completed up to November 2022. New studies may have been published since then.\n\nWhat do we need next?\nWe need larger, well‑designed trials that compare face‑down positioning with other post‑surgery positions. Future research should report detailed participant characteristics, use consistent outcome measures, and include patients’ preferences and quality‑of‑life assessments.",

      "feedback": "The draft is missing a complete \"Limitations of the evidence\" section – it ends abruptly with \"We are ...\" and provides no description of the study limitations. This fails the critical completeness check. Additionally, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers: (1) the title/question is overly long and packed with technical terms, (2) key technical terms (e.g., pars plana vitrectomy, retinal displacement, metamorphopsia, binocular diplopia) appear without immediate plain-language definitions, (3) many sentences are passive or noun‑heavy, contributing to high nominalisation (28) and noun counts (221) and a high SMOG index (15.4), making the text harder to read. These issues need to be fixed before the PLS can be approved.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Incomplete Limitations section** – Quote: \"We are ...\". Problem: leaves readers without understanding why the evidence is uncertain. Rewrite: \"We are not confident in the evidence because the three trials were small, involved mainly male participants, and provided limited information about participants’ ages, severity of detachment, and settings.\"\n2. **Overly long title/question** – Quote: \"Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to repair a detached retina) better than other post‑surgery positions for preventing retinal displacement in macula‑involving retinal detachments (detached retina that includes the central part of vision)?\" Problem: >30 words, many brackets, hard to parse. Rewrite: \"Does lying face‑​down after eye surgery (pars plana vitrectomy) help prevent the retina from shifting in macula‑involving retinal detachments?\"\n3. **Unexplained jargon** – Quote: \"pars plana vitrectomy (PPV)\" and later \"retinal displacement (metamorphopsia)\". Problem: readers may not know these terms before they are defined. Rewrite by adding brief definitions at first mention: \"pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), a surgery that removes the gel inside the eye and replaces it with a gas bubble, and retinal displacement, a shift of the retina that can cause visual distortion (metamorphopsia) and double vision (binocular diplopia).\"\n4. **Passive voice and noun‑heavy sentences** – Quote: \"The evidence reflects searches completed up to November 2022.\" Problem: passive construction adds distance. Rewrite: \"We searched databases up to 28 November 2022.\"\n5. **Paragraph and bullet formatting** – The draft runs long blocks of text without blank lines between paragraphs and sometimes uses numbered lists instead of dashes. Problem: reduces readability and does not follow style guide. Rewrite by inserting a blank line after each heading and using dashes for bullet points.\n\nMetrics support: The evaluation shows high nominalisation (28, beyond P90) and noun count (221, beyond P90), indicating the text is noun‑heavy. The SMOG index (15.4) and complex word counts are also beyond typical PLS ranges, confirming the need to simplify language and shorten sentences.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and scores well on many readability metrics (e.g., Flesch Reading Ease 57.6, words per sentence 19.6). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in nominalisation, noun density, SMOG index, and complex‑word counts, all beyond the P90 range, indicating the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than usual. These metric deviations align with the identified clarity and style issues."
