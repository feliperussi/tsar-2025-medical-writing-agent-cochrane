  "draft": "Is lying face‑down after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to repair a detached retina) better than other post‑surgery positions for preventing retinal displacement in macula‑involving retinal detachments (detached retina that includes the central part of vision)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Lying face‑down (lying on your stomach) right after pars plana vitrectomy (eye surgery to repair a detached retina) may lower the chance that the retina moves out of place (retinal displacement) and may reduce some eye problems such as outer retinal folds (wrinkles in the back layer of the eye) and double vision when both eyes are used (binocular diplopia), but it may increase the chance of higher pressure inside the eye (elevated intra‑ocular pressure). The evidence for these effects is limited and uncertain.\n- The available studies did not show a clear difference in how well vision improves (best‑corrected visual acuity, a measure of sharpness of vision with glasses) or in patients’ reported visual distortion or quality of life between face‑down and other positions after surgery.\n- Because the current evidence comes from a small number of trials with uncertain results, larger, well‑designed studies are needed to determine whether face‑down positioning truly improves outcomes and to better understand any potential harms.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is a macula‑involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and why is it a problem?\nA rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is when the thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) pulls away because of a tear. When the detachment includes the macula – the central part of the retina that gives us sharp, detailed vision – it is called a macula‑involving RRD. This is one of the most common eye‑surgery emergencies and can quickly lead to serious loss of vision if not repaired promptly.\n\nHow is a macula‑involving RRD usually treated and what extra steps are sometimes recommended?\nThe standard surgery is a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), where the surgeon removes the gel‑like fluid inside the eye and replaces it with a gas bubble (called gas tamponade) that pushes the retina back into place. Some eye doctors suggest that after this surgery the patient should stay in a face‑down position for a period of time. The idea is that gravity will keep the gas bubble against the retina and may prevent the retina from shifting after the operation – a problem known as retinal displacement, which can cause visual distortions (metamorphopsia) and double vision when both eyes are used together (binocular diplopia).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to determine whether keeping patients face‑down after PPV with gas tamponade actually reduces the risk of retinal displacement and related problems, compared with other post‑surgery positions such as lying on the back (face‑up) or a \"support‑the‑break\" position. They also looked at whether this positioning affects visual acuity, quality of life, and eye‑related side effects like outer retinal folds or raised eye pressure.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared face‑down positioning after pars plana vitrectomy with other post‑operative positions for primary macula‑involving retinal detachments, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found three randomized trials that together enrolled 368 people (369 eyes) with primary macula‑involving retinal detachments treated by pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade. Most participants were men (68%–72%). The studies compared keeping the head face‑down right after surgery with other posturing strategies, such as a support‑the‑break position or face‑up positioning, and followed patients for up to about six months. Only one trial reported funding and only one gave any information about participants’ race or ethnicity; details about age, severity of the condition, and where the trials were conducted were not provided. It is unclear whether face‑down positioning after surgery makes a difference to retinal displacement, visual acuity, visual distortion, quality of life, outer retinal folds, binocular diplopia, or intra‑ocular pressure.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we are interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical style requirement: all section subheadings must be phrased as questions, but the current headings ('Introduction/Aims', 'Methods', 'Results', 'Limitations', 'Currency') are statements. This breaches the Master Style Guide and prevents approval. Additionally, the text contains several readability and style issues that could confuse readers:\n1. **Passive‑voice heavy** – many sentences use passive constructions (e.g., \"It is unclear whether face‑down positioning after surgery makes a difference…\"). Rewrite in active voice.\n2. **Long, complex sentences** – sentences often exceed 25 words, making them hard to follow. Split them into shorter, clearer statements.\n3. **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – excessive nominalizations increase cognitive load. Replace nouns with verbs where possible.\n4. **Technical jargon without immediate definition** – terms like \"support‑the‑break positioning\" should be briefly explained for a lay audience.\n5. **Bullet formatting** – ensure all lists use clear bullet points for readability.\n\nSuggested concrete improvements:\n- Rephrase subheadings as questions (e.g., \"What did we find?\" instead of \"Results\").\n- Convert passive sentences to active voice (e.g., \"We do not know whether face‑down positioning after surgery changes outcomes.\").\n- Break long sentences into two or more shorter ones.\n- Reduce nominalizations and replace noun‑heavy constructions with verb‑based phrasing.\n- Define any specialized terms in plain language.\n\n**Metrics support**: The draft shows 19 passive‑voice constructions (P90), 26 nominalizations (P90), 209 nouns (beyond P90), and high readability indices (Gunning Fog 20.2, SMOG 15.3). These indicate the text is more complex than typical PLS and needs simplification to meet the style guide.\n\nOverall, the subheading format violation and the identified clarity issues must be addressed before the PLS can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is 702 words (within the 850‑word limit). Readability scores are moderate (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 46, FKGL 12.8) but several metrics exceed typical thresholds: passive voice (19, P90), nominalizations (26, P90), noun count (209, beyond P90), Gunning Fog (20.2, P90), SMOG (15.3, beyond P90), and high counts of complex and long words. These indicate the draft is more complex and noun‑heavy than usual Cochrane PLS, supporting the need for simplification and active‑voice revisions."
