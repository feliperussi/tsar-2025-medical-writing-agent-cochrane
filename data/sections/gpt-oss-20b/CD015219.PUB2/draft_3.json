  "draft": "Does the antiviral drug favipiravir (an oral medication) improve recovery or reduce serious illness in people with COVID‑19?\n\nKey messages\n– We do not know whether favipiravir (an oral antiviral medicine) improves recovery or reduces serious illness such as death or the need for a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation). The studies give uncertain evidence, and the drug may cause more mild side‑effects (unwanted effects), while serious side‑effects appear similar to other treatments.  \n– Most of the research involved adults with mild‑to‑moderate disease who were already in hospital, and researchers usually gave favipiravir at a high dose for several days.  \n– Because the current evidence is limited and uncertain, we need more well‑designed randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive either favipiravir or another treatment). Future trials should enrol larger numbers of participants, include people with different disease severity, and report both benefits and harms over longer periods.\n\nWhy is COVID‑19 a global health challenge and what treatments are being explored?  \nCOVID‑19 is caused by the coronavirus SARS‑CoV‑2. Since it first appeared, it has spread worldwide, leading to many hospitalisations, deaths and huge pressure on health services. Most people develop mild or moderate symptoms, but some become seriously ill and need extra oxygen or a ventilator (a machine that helps patients breathe). Doctors have tried several medicines to help patients recover, such as steroids, the antiviral remdesivir, and supportive care (oxygen, fluids, rest). Favipiravir is a pill originally developed for flu that might stop the coronavirus from multiplying, but it was unclear whether it really helps people with COVID‑19 and whether it is safe.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about favipiravir?  \nWe wanted to find out whether giving favipiravir to people with acute COVID‑19 changes important outcomes compared with no treatment, usual supportive care, or other experimental antivirals. Specifically, we looked at whether favipiravir reduces death, the need for a ventilator, hospital admission, the time it takes to recover, and whether it causes any side‑effects. To answer these questions we gathered evidence from randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive either favipiravir or a comparison treatment).\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane COVID‑19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the WHO COVID‑19 Global literature database and three other sources up to 18 July 2023. We selected randomised controlled trials that compared favipiravir with no treatment, standard care or another antiviral. We combined the results and used the GRADE approach to rate our confidence in each outcome.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 25 trials that randomised 5 750 adults, most under 60 years old, and 89 % of whom were hospitalised with mild‑to‑moderate COVID‑19. Researchers carried out the trials in many countries, including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. In 22 trials favipiravir was compared with placebo or standard care; two trials used lopinavir/ritonavir and one used umifenovir as the comparator. Most trials started favipiravir with a loading dose of 1 600 mg or 1 800 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by 600–800 mg twice daily for 5–14 days. The abstracts did not provide information on follow‑up beyond the treatment period, on funding sources, or on gender distribution.\n\nWhat do the results say about mortality and other outcomes?  \nThe evidence does not tell us whether favipiravir reduces death in people with COVID‑19. It also does not tell us whether favipiravir reduces the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (a breathing machine). Favipiravir probably does not change whether people are admitted to hospital, need extra oxygen, or recover faster. The drug may increase the overall incidence of adverse events (unwanted side‑effects), but it probably does not change the risk of serious adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants in many studies may have known which treatment they received, and because the studies were very small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence we summarised is current up to July 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural checklist, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader and the linguistic metrics show unusually high passive voice, nominalisations, noun density and word complexity. Key issues:\n1. Jargon without plain-language equivalents – e.g., “randomised”, “placebo”, “adverse events”. These terms are not explained, so readers may not understand what the studies involved or what side‑effects mean.\n   Suggested rewrite: “randomised (where participants are assigned by chance)”, “placebo (a harmless pill used for comparison)”, “adverse events (unwanted side‑effects)”.\n2. Overly long, information-dense sentence in the aims section – “We wanted to find out whether giving favipiravir to people with acute COVID‑19 changes important outcomes compared with no treatment, usual supportive care, or other experimental antivirals.” This sentence is >30 words and packs several ideas.\n   Suggested rewrite: “We wanted to find out whether giving favipiravir to people with acute COVID‑19 changes important outcomes. We compared favipiravir with no treatment, usual supportive care, or other experimental antivirals.”\n3. Passive-voice constructions that hide who did the action – e.g., “The abstracts did not provide information on follow‑up beyond the treatment period, on funding sources, or on gender distribution.”\n   Suggested rewrite: “We could not find information on follow‑up beyond the treatment period, on funding sources, or on gender distribution in the abstracts.”\n4. Noun-heavy phrasing that reduces readability – e.g., “The evidence does not tell us whether favipiravir reduces death in people with COVID‑19.” The phrase “does not tell us whether” is vague.\n   Suggested rewrite: “We do not have evidence that favipiravir reduces death in people with COVID‑19.”\n5. High lexical complexity (SMOG index 15.2, many long and complex words). Simplify terms such as “incidence” → “frequency”, “adverse events” → “side‑effects”, “mechanical ventilation” → “breathing machine”.\nThese changes will lower the passive-voice count, reduce nominalisations, cut noun density and bring readability indices into the typical PLS range. The PLS evaluation shows passive_voice = 19 (P90), nominalization = 21 (P90), nouns = 169 (P90), SMOG = 15.2 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words = 155 (BEYOND_P90) and long_words = 226 (BEYOND_P90), confirming the need for the suggested edits.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word-count limits but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: passive voice (19, P90), nominalisations (21, P90), noun count (169, P90), SMOG index (15.2, BEYOND_P90), complex words (155, BEYOND_P90) and long words (226, BEYOND_P90). These indicate excessive complexity and passive constructions, which should be reduced to improve readability."
