  "key_messages": [
    "We do not know whether favipiravir (an oral antiviral medicine) improves recovery or reduces serious illness such as death or the need for breathing support (mechanical ventilation) in people with COVID‑19; the available studies provide uncertain evidence, and the drug may cause more mild side effects (unwanted effects), while serious side effects appear similar to other treatments.",
    "Most of the research involved adults with mild to moderate disease who were already in hospital, and favipiravir was usually given at a high dose for several days.",
    "Because the current evidence is limited and uncertain, further well‑designed randomised trials are needed that enrol larger numbers of participants, include people with different disease severity, and report both benefits and harms over longer periods."

      "content": "COVID‑19 is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS‑CoV‑2. Since it first appeared, it has spread worldwide, causing many hospitalisations, deaths and huge pressure on health services. Most people develop mild to moderate symptoms, but some become seriously ill and need oxygen or a ventilator. Doctors have tried several medicines to help patients recover, such as steroids, the antiviral remdesivir, and supportive care (oxygen, fluids, rest). One antiviral that has attracted interest is favipiravir – a pill originally developed for flu that might stop the coronavirus from multiplying. However, it was unclear whether favipiravir really helps people with COVID‑19 and whether it is safe."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers aim to discover about favipiravir?",
      "content": "The authors of the review wanted to find out whether giving favipiravir to people with acute COVID‑19 changes important outcomes compared with no treatment, usual supportive care, or other experimental antivirals. Specifically, they examined whether favipiravir reduces death, the need for a ventilator, hospital admission, the time it takes to recover, and whether it causes any side‑effects. To answer these questions they gathered evidence from randomised controlled trials – studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive either favipiravir or a comparison treatment, which helps ensure the results are reliable."

      "content": "The review included 25 randomised controlled trials with a total of 5,750 adult participants, most of whom were younger than 60 years and 89 % were hospitalised with mild‑to‑moderate COVID‑19. The trials were carried out in many countries, including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. In 22 of the 25 studies favipiravir was compared with placebo or standard of care; two trials used lopinavir/ritonavir as the comparator and one used umifenovir. Favipiravir regimens most often started with a loading dose of 1,600 mg or 1,800 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by 600–800 mg twice daily, with treatment courses lasting from five to fourteen days. The abstract does not give information on follow‑up beyond the treatment period, does not report funding sources, and does not specify gender distribution."

      "subheading": "Main results: Mortality and other outcomes",
      "content": "It is unclear whether favipiravir reduces death in people with COVID‑19. It is also unclear if favipiravir reduces the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Favipiravir may make little to no difference to whether people need to be admitted to hospital, to the need for oxygen therapy, or to the speed of clinical improvement. Favipiravir may increase the overall incidence of side effects, but probably makes little to no difference to serious side effects."
