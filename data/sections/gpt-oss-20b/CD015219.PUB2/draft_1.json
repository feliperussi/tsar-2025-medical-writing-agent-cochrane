  "draft": "Does the antiviral drug favipiravir (an oral medication) improve recovery or reduce serious illness in people with COVID‑19?\n\n- We do not know whether favipiravir (an oral antiviral medicine) improves recovery or reduces serious illness such as death or the need for breathing support (mechanical ventilation) in people with COVID‑19; the available studies provide uncertain evidence, and the drug may cause more mild side effects (unwanted effects), while serious side effects appear similar to other treatments.\n- Most of the research involved adults with mild to moderate disease who were already in hospital, and favipiravir was usually given at a high dose for several days.\n- Because the current evidence is limited and uncertain, further well‑designed randomised trials are needed that enrol larger numbers of participants, include people with different disease severity, and report both benefits and harms over longer periods.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is COVID‑19 a global health challenge and what treatments are being explored?\nCOVID‑19 is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS‑CoV‑2. Since it first appeared, it has spread worldwide, causing many hospitalisations, deaths and huge pressure on health services. Most people develop mild to moderate symptoms, but some become seriously ill and need oxygen or a ventilator. Doctors have tried several medicines to help patients recover, such as steroids, the antiviral remdesivir, and supportive care (oxygen, fluids, rest). One antiviral that has attracted interest is favipiravir – a pill originally developed for flu that might stop the coronavirus from multiplying. However, it was unclear whether favipiravir really helps people with COVID‑19 and whether it is safe.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about favipiravir?\nThe authors of the review wanted to find out whether giving favipiravir to people with acute COVID‑19 changes important outcomes compared with no treatment, usual supportive care, or other experimental antivirals. Specifically, they examined whether favipiravir reduces death, the need for a ventilator, hospital admission, the time it takes to recover, and whether it causes any side‑effects. To answer these questions they gathered evidence from randomised controlled trials – studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive either favipiravir or a comparison treatment, which helps ensure the results are reliable.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared favipiravir with no treatment, supportive care or other antivirals, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 25 randomised controlled trials with a total of 5,750 adult participants, most of whom were younger than 60 years and 89 % were hospitalised with mild‑to‑moderate COVID‑19. The trials were carried out in many countries, including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. In 22 of the 25 studies favipiravir was compared with placebo or standard of care; two trials used lopinavir/ritonavir as the comparator and one used umifenovir. Favipiravir regimens most often started with a loading dose of 1,600 mg or 1,800 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by 600–800 mg twice daily, with treatment courses lasting from five to fourteen days. The abstract does not give information on follow‑up beyond the treatment period, does not report funding sources, and does not specify gender distribution.\n\nMain results: Mortality and other outcomes\nIt is unclear whether favipiravir reduces death in people with COVID‑19. It is also unclear if favipiravir reduces the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Favipiravir may make little to no difference to whether people need to be admitted to hospital, to the need for oxygen therapy, or to the speed of clinical improvement. Favipiravir may increase the overall incidence of side effects, but probably makes little to no difference to serious side effects.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical checks: (1) several subheadings are not phrased as questions (Methods, Main results: Mortality and other outcomes, Limitations, Currency). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement for question‑style subheadings. (2) The text contains many passive constructions (18 instances, P75) and a high level of nominalisation (23 instances, P90), making sentences harder to follow. (3) Several sentences are overly long and contain technical jargon without plain‑language explanations, which can confuse patients.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Subheading format – Quote: \"Methods\". Problem: not a question. Rewrite: \"How did we find and assess the evidence?\" Apply similarly to other headings: change \"Main results: Mortality and other outcomes\" to \"What did the studies show about mortality and other outcomes?\", \"Limitations\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", and \"Currency\" to \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n2. Passive voice – Quote: \"The abstract does not give information on follow‑up beyond the treatment period, does not report funding sources, and does not specify gender distribution.\" Problem: passive, vague. Rewrite: \"We could not find information on follow‑up beyond the treatment period, funding sources, or gender distribution in the abstract.\"\n3. Nominalisation / noun‑heavy phrasing – Quote: \"Favipiravir may make little to no difference to whether people need to be admitted to hospital, to the need for oxygen therapy, or to the speed of clinical improvement.\" Problem: noun‑heavy, complex. Rewrite: \"Favipiravir probably does not change whether people are admitted to hospital, need oxygen, or recover faster.\"\n4. Jargon without definition – Quote: \"mechanical ventilation\". Problem: may be unfamiliar to lay readers. Rewrite: \"a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation)\". Also define \"randomised controlled trials\" as \"studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive either favipiravir or another treatment\".\n5. Long sentence – Quote: \"Because the current evidence is limited and uncertain, further well‑designed randomised trials are needed that enrol larger numbers of participants, include people with different disease severity, and report both benefits and harms over longer periods.\" (30+ words). Problem: dense. Rewrite: \"Because the evidence is limited, we need more well‑designed trials. These should include more participants, cover different disease severities, and track both benefits and harms over longer periods.\"\n\nMetrics support these edits: passive_voice score is high (18, P75), nominalisation is unusually high (23, P90), and readability indices (SMOG 15, complex_words 146, long_words 227) indicate the text is more complex than typical PLS. Reducing passive voice, nominalisations, and complex words will lower these scores toward the median ranges and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (677 words) but shows moderate conformity overall. Readability scores are around the median (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 42, FKGL 12.4) but several linguistic features deviate: nominalisation (23, P90), nouns (175, P90), SMOG index (15, BEYOND_P90), complex words (146, BEYOND_P90), and long words (227, BEYOND_P90) are all higher than typical PLS patterns, indicating excess complexity. Passive voice is also high (18, P75). Addressing these deviations will bring the text closer to typical PLS style."
