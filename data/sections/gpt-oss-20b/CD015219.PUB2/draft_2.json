  "draft": "Does the antiviral drug favipiravir (an oral medication) improve recovery or reduce serious illness in people with COVID‑19?\n\nKey messages\n– We do not know whether favipiravir (an oral antiviral medicine) improves recovery or reduces serious illness such as death or the need for breathing support (mechanical ventilation) in people with COVID‑19; the available studies give uncertain evidence, and the drug may cause more mild side effects, while serious side effects appear similar to other treatments.  \n– Most of the research involved adults with mild‑to‑moderate disease who were already in hospital, and favipiravir was usually given at a high dose for several days.  \n– Because the current evidence is limited and uncertain, we need more well‑designed randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive either favipiravir or another treatment). These trials should enrol larger numbers of participants, include people with different disease severity, and report both benefits and harms over longer periods.\n\nWhy is COVID‑19 a global health challenge and what treatments are being explored?\nCOVID‑19 is caused by the coronavirus SARS‑CoV‑2. Since it first appeared, it has spread worldwide, leading to many hospitalisations, deaths and huge pressure on health services. Most people develop mild or moderate symptoms, but some become seriously ill and need extra oxygen or a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation). Doctors have tried several medicines to help patients recover, such as steroids, the antiviral remdesivir, and supportive care (oxygen, fluids, rest). Favipiravir is a pill originally developed for flu that might stop the coronavirus from multiplying, but it was unclear whether it really helps people with COVID‑19 and whether it is safe.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about favipiravir?\nWe wanted to find out whether giving favipiravir to people with acute COVID‑19 changes important outcomes compared with no treatment, usual supportive care, or other experimental antivirals. Specifically, we looked at whether favipiravir reduces death, the need for a breathing machine, hospital admission, the time it takes to recover, and whether it causes any side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find and assess the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane COVID‑19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the WHO COVID‑19 Global literature database and three other sources up to 18 July 2023. We selected randomised controlled trials that compared favipiravir with no treatment, standard care or another antiviral. We combined the results and used the GRADE approach to rate our confidence in each outcome.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 25 trials that randomised 5 750 adults, most under 60 years old, and 89 % of whom were hospitalised with mild‑to‑moderate COVID‑19. The trials were conducted in many countries, including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. In 22 trials favipiravir was compared with placebo or standard care; two trials used lopinavir/ritonavir and one used umifenovir as the comparator. Most trials started favipiravir with a loading dose of 1 600 mg or 1 800 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by 600–800 mg twice daily for 5–14 days. The abstracts did not provide information on follow‑up beyond the treatment period, on funding sources, or on gender distribution.\n\nWhat did the studies show about mortality and other outcomes?\nThe evidence does not tell us whether favipiravir reduces death in people with COVID‑19. It also does not tell us whether favipiravir reduces the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (a breathing machine). Favipiravir probably does not change whether people are admitted to hospital, need extra oxygen, or recover faster. The drug may increase the overall incidence of adverse events (mild side‑effects), but it probably does not change the risk of serious adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants in many studies may have known which treatment they received, and because the studies were very small.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised is current up to July 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains three significant problems that would confuse a patient reader. 1) The first key‑message sentence is overly long and packs several ideas together, making it hard to follow. 2) The text uses passive constructions such as “The trials were conducted in many countries…”, which obscure who did what and the PLS metrics show 19 passive instances (far above the typical range). 3) Several technical terms – “adverse events”, “mechanical ventilation”, “randomised controlled trials” – are used without brief explanations, leaving readers unsure of their meaning. These issues need to be fixed before the summary can be approved. Suggested rewrites: • Split the key‑message sentence into two shorter sentences, e.g., “We do not know whether favipiravir improves recovery or reduces serious illness such as death or the need for a breathing machine. The studies give uncertain evidence, and the drug may cause more mild side‑effects, while serious side‑effects appear similar to other treatments.” • Change passive sentences to active voice, e.g., replace “The trials were conducted in many countries” with “Researchers carried out the trials in many countries”. • Add brief definitions: “adverse events (unwanted side‑effects)”, “mechanical ventilation (a breathing machine that helps patients breathe)”, “randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive either the drug or a comparison treatment)”. The PLS evaluation also flags an unusually high number of long words (212, beyond the typical range) and complex words, supporting the need to simplify wording.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and contains all required sections, but metric analysis shows several deviations: passive_voice = 19 (P90, higher than typical), nouns = 162 (P90), smog_index = 14.7 (P90), complex_words_dc = 266 (P90), complex_words = 144 (P90), long_words = 212 (BEYOND_P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy sentences, and many long/complex words, which align with the identified clarity issues."
