  "draft": "Are oral medicines (systemic drugs taken by mouth) effective and safe for treating Ménière’s disease?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– We do not have reliable evidence that oral medicines improve vertigo (spinning sensation) or are safe for people with Ménière’s disease.  \n– The drugs studied – betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medicines and corticosteroids – were each tested in only a few small trials, and none showed a clear benefit or clear risk.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed that measure vertigo, hearing, tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and side effects in the same way.\n\nWhat is Ménière’s disease and why does it matter?\nMénière’s disease is a disorder of the inner ear that causes repeated episodes of vertigo – a sudden feeling that the world is spinning – together with hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and sometimes a feeling of fullness in the ear. An attack can last minutes to hours and can make driving, working or socialising frightening. Because the cause is unknown, doctors often try different oral medicines to reduce how often attacks happen and how severe they are. Commonly used medicines include betahistine, diuretics (which help the body get rid of excess fluid), antiviral medicines (which target viruses) and corticosteroids (anti‑inflammatory drugs). We do not know how well these medicines work or whether they cause harmful side effects.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether systemic medicines – medicines that affect the whole body – help or harm people with Ménière’s disease. We compared these medicines with a placebo (a pill that looks the same but contains no active drug) or with no treatment. We looked at whether the medicines reduced vertigo attacks, improved hearing or quality of life, and whether they caused serious adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, the ICTRP and other sources for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials published up to 14 September 2022. We included studies that enrolled adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease and that followed participants for at least three months. Two reviewers extracted the data and we rated our confidence in each result using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 10 trials that together enrolled 848 participants. The trials tested betahistine (7 trials, 548 participants), diuretics (2 trials, 300 participants), antiviral medicines (1 trial, 24 participants) and systemic corticosteroids (1 trial, 16 participants). No trial evaluated antihistamines.  \n\nAll trials were small and used different ways of measuring outcomes, so we could not combine the results. The evidence for every drug class was of low or very low certainty. We could not determine whether any oral medicine reduces the frequency or severity of vertigo attacks, improves hearing or quality of life, or causes serious side effects. In short, we remain very uncertain about the benefits and harms of these medicines.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies involved different types of participants and used varied treatment regimens. Each trial was small, and there were too few trials to give a reliable answer. These factors make the overall evidence weak.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence reflects searches completed up to September 2022. New studies published after that date are not included.",
