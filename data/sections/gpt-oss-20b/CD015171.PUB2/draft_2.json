  "draft": "Are oral medicines (systemic drugs taken by mouth) effective and safe for treating Ménière’s disease‑related vertigo?\n\nKey messages\n– We do not have reliable evidence that oral medicines improve vertigo (spinning sensation) or are safe for people with Ménière’s disease.  \n– The drugs studied – betahistine, betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medicines and corticosteroids – were each tested in only a few small trials, and none showed a clear benefit or clear harm.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to measure vertigo, hearing, tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and side effects consistently.\n\nWhat is Ménière’s disease and why does it matter?\nMénière’s disease is a disorder of the inner ear. It causes repeated episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus and sometimes a feeling of fullness in the ear. An attack can last minutes to hours and can make driving, working or socialising frightening. Because the cause is unknown, doctors often try different oral medicines to reduce how often attacks happen and how severe they are. Commonly used medicines include betahistine, diuretics (which help the body get rid of excess fluid), antiviral medicines (which target viruses) and corticosteroids (anti‑inflammatory drugs). We do not know how well these medicines work or whether they cause harmful side effects.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether systemic drugs – medicines that work throughout the whole body – help or harm people with Ménière’s disease. We compared these drugs with a placebo (a pill that looks the same but contains no active medicine) or with no treatment. We looked at whether the drugs reduced vertigo attacks, improved hearing or quality of life, and whether they caused serious adverse events.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, the ICTRP and other sources for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials published up to 14 September 2022. We included studies that enrolled adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease and that followed participants for at least three months. Two reviewers extracted data and we rated our confidence in each result using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 10 trials that together enrolled 848 participants. The trials tested betahistine (7 trials, 548 participants), diuretics (2 trials, 300 participants), antiviral medicines (1 trial, 24 participants) and systemic corticosteroids (1 trial, 16 participants). No trial evaluated antihistamines.  \n\nThe trials were small and used different ways of measuring outcomes. Because of these differences, we could not combine the results. The evidence for all drug classes was of low or very low certainty. We could not determine whether any oral medicine reduces the frequency or severity of vertigo attacks, improves hearing or quality of life, or causes serious side effects. In short, we remain very uncertain about the benefits and harms of these medicines.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies involved different types of participants and used varied treatment regimens. Each trial was small, and there were too few trials to give a reliable answer. These factors make the overall evidence weak.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence reflects searches completed up to September 2022. New studies published after that date are not included.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails two critical checks: (1) the subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, which the style guide requires for all subheadings; (2) the list of drugs repeats \"betahistine\" twice, which is a factual inaccuracy and could confuse readers. In addition, the text contains a high number of unfamiliar long words (complex_words_dc = 239, long_words = 177) that exceed typical PLS patterns, making the summary harder to read.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Key messages\". Problem: not a question, breaking the required subheading style. Rewrite: \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. **Duplicate drug name** – Quote: \"The drugs studied – betahistine, betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medicines and corticosteroids –...\". Problem: repeats betahistine and misstates the list of interventions. Rewrite: \"The drugs studied – betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medicines and corticosteroids –...\".\n3. **Reduce long/complex words** – Example: \"systemic pharmacological interventions\". Problem: long, technical phrase that raises the long‑word count. Rewrite: \"systemic medicines\".\n4. **Simplify wording** – Example: \"systemic drugs – medicines that work throughout the whole body\". Problem: wordy and contains a long word \"throughout\". Rewrite: \"systemic drugs – medicines that affect the whole body\".\n5. **Clarify benefit/harm phrasing** – Quote: \"none showed a clear benefit or clear harm\". Problem: redundant \"clear\" and could be smoother. Rewrite: \"none showed a clear benefit or clear risk\".\n\nThese changes address the critical formatting error, correct the factual typo, and lower the counts of complex and long words (metrics show complex_words_dc and long_words are well above the median), thereby improving readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well on most metrics (e.g., readability scores, active voice, pronouns) but deviates on two key measures: complex_words_dc (239, P90) and long_words (177, P90), indicating an excess of unfamiliar and lengthy words. Adjusting these will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns."
