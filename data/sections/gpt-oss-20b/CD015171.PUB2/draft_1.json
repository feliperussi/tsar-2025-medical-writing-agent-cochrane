  "draft": "Are oral medicines (systemic drugs taken by mouth) effective and safe for treating Ménière’s disease?\n\nKey messages\n- There is not enough reliable evidence to show that oral medicines (drugs taken by mouth that affect the whole body) improve vertigo (spinning sensation) or are safe for people with Ménière’s disease; the few studies that exist provide uncertain results and serious side effects (serious unwanted effects) were rarely reported.\n- The drugs that have been studied – betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medicines and corticosteroids – each had only a small number of trials, and none showed a clear benefit or clear harm.\n- More well‑designed, larger trials are needed that use consistent ways of measuring vertigo, hearing, tinnitus and side effects, so that we can determine whether any oral medicine truly helps and is safe.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhat is Ménière’s disease and why does it matter?\nMénière’s disease is a disorder of the inner ear that causes repeated episodes of vertigo – a sudden feeling that the world is spinning – together with hearing loss, ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and sometimes a feeling of fullness in the ear. These attacks can last from minutes to hours and can be frightening, making everyday activities such as driving, working or socialising difficult. Because the exact cause of Ménière’s disease is unknown, doctors often try different medicines to try to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Commonly used drugs include betahistine, diuretics (which help the body get rid of excess fluid), antiviral medicines and corticosteroids (a type of anti‑inflammatory drug). However, it is not clear how well these medicines work or whether they cause harmful side effects.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to discover whether taking medicines that act throughout the whole body (systemic pharmacological interventions) is helpful or harmful for people with Ménière’s disease. Specifically, they compared these drugs with a placebo (a pill that looks the same but contains no active medicine) or with no treatment at all. They looked at whether the drugs reduced vertigo attacks, improved hearing or quality of life, and whether they caused serious side effects.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared systemic drugs for Ménière’s disease with placebo or no treatment, summarized their findings, and rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE.\n\nResults\nWe examined 10 randomised (or quasi‑randomised) controlled trials that together enrolled 848 adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease. All studies lasted at least three months and reported outcomes at three time‑points (up to six months, up to twelve months, and beyond twelve months). The trials compared systemic drugs with placebo or no treatment. The drug classes studied were betahistine (7 trials, 548 participants), diuretics (2 trials, 300 participants), antivirals (1 trial, 24 participants) and systemic corticosteroids (1 trial, 16 participants). No antihistamines were evaluated.\n\nThe review could not determine whether any of these systemic medicines have a clear benefit or harm on vertigo attack frequency, severity, or related symptoms in Ménière’s disease. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain, so we do not know if any of these drugs help or cause harm.\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and because the studies were very small and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failed: subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement. In addition, the draft contains several readability and style problems that would hinder patient understanding: (1) many long sentences (average 25.9 words per sentence, above the typical PLS median of 22) – e.g., the opening sentence of the Results section is 38 words; (2) high lexical complexity (241 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words, 116 three‑syllable words, 194 words with ≥7 characters) far above typical ranges, making the text harder to read; (3) excessive passive voice (18 instances, P75) obscures who did what; (4) jargon such as “systemic pharmacological interventions” is not defined for lay readers; (5) bullet points use hyphens correctly but the key‑message list could be shortened for conciseness. Suggested top improvements: rewrite each subheading as a question (e.g., \"What did we find?\" instead of \"Results\"), split long sentences into shorter ones (<20 words), replace complex terms with plain language (e.g., \"drugs that work throughout the whole body\" for \"systemic pharmacological interventions\"), convert passive constructions to active voice (e.g., \"We examined 10 trials\" rather than \"10 trials were examined\"), and reduce the number of difficult words by using common synonyms. These changes will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns (words per sentence <22, LIX <54, complex_words <84, long_words <122) and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (596 words) but deviates on several readability metrics: words_per_sentence 25.9 (P90), LIX 58.5 (P90), RIX 8.4 (P90), complex_words_dc 241 (P90), complex_words 116 (P90), long_words 194 (P90). Passive voice is high (18, P75) and active voice is only marginally higher (56, P75). These deviations indicate the text is longer, more lexical‑dense, and more passive than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need for the suggested edits."
