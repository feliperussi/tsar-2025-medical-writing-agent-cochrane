  "plain_title": "Are oral medicines (systemic drugs taken by mouth) effective and safe for treating Ménière’s disease?",
  "key_messages": [
    "There is not enough reliable evidence to show that oral medicines (drugs taken by mouth that affect the whole body) improve vertigo (spinning sensation) or are safe for people with Ménière’s disease; the few studies that exist provide uncertain results and serious side effects (serious unwanted effects) were rarely reported.",
    "The drugs that have been studied – betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medicines and corticosteroids – each had only a small number of trials, and none showed a clear benefit or clear harm.",
    "More well‑designed, larger trials are needed that use consistent ways of measuring vertigo, hearing, tinnitus and side effects, so that we can determine whether any oral medicine truly helps and is safe."

      "subheading": "What is Ménière’s disease and why does it matter?",
      "content": "Ménière’s disease is a disorder of the inner ear that causes repeated episodes of vertigo – a sudden feeling that the world is spinning – together with hearing loss, ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and sometimes a feeling of fullness in the ear. These attacks can last from minutes to hours and can be frightening, making everyday activities such as driving, working or socialising difficult. Because the exact cause of Ménière’s disease is unknown, doctors often try different medicines to try to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Commonly used drugs include betahistine, diuretics (which help the body get rid of excess fluid), antiviral medicines and corticosteroids (a type of anti‑inflammatory drug). However, it is not clear how well these medicines work or whether they cause harmful side effects."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to discover whether taking medicines that act throughout the whole body (systemic pharmacological interventions) is helpful or harmful for people with Ménière’s disease. Specifically, they compared these drugs with a placebo (a pill that looks the same but contains no active medicine) or with no treatment at all. They looked at whether the drugs reduced vertigo attacks, improved hearing or quality of life, and whether they caused serious side effects."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We examined 10 randomised (or quasi‑randomised) controlled trials that together enrolled 848 adults with definite or probable Ménière’s disease. All studies lasted at least three months and reported outcomes at three time‑points (up to six months, up to twelve months, and beyond twelve months). The trials compared systemic drugs with placebo or no treatment. The drug classes studied were betahistine (7 trials, 548 participants), diuretics (2 trials, 300 participants), antivirals (1 trial, 24 participants) and systemic corticosteroids (1 trial, 16 participants). No antihistamines were evaluated.\\n\\nThe review could not determine whether any of these systemic medicines have a clear benefit or harm on vertigo attack frequency, severity, or related symptoms in Ménière’s disease. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain, so we do not know if any of these drugs help or cause harm."

  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and because the studies were very small and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search."
