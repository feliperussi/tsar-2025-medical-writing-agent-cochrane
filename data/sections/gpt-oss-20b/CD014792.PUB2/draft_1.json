  "draft": "What kind of nutrition (tube feeding, IV nutrition, or regular eating) works best after a Whipple operation (pancreaticoduodenectomy) for adults?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Feeding through a tube placed into the small intestine (jejunostomy) probably shortens the time spent in hospital compared with giving nutrition entirely through a vein (total parenteral nutrition), and there is no clear evidence that either method changes the risk of common post‑surgery problems such as pancreatic fistula (leak of pancreatic fluid), delayed gastric emptying (slow stomach emptying), bleeding after surgery, or death.\n- Feeding through a tube that goes through the nose into the small intestine (nasojejunal tube) appears to have a similar effect on hospital stay and complications as total parenteral nutrition, but the overall evidence from the studies is limited, so the findings are uncertain.\n- Because the existing studies are few, varied, and of limited quality, more well‑designed research is needed to determine which nutrition method best supports recovery after a Whipple operation, including longer‑term outcomes and potential side effects.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\n**What health problem does a Whipple operation create and why does nutrition matter?**\nA pancreaticoduodenectomy, also called a Whipple procedure, is a major operation that removes the head of the pancreas and nearby parts of the digestive tract. It is most often done for pancreatic cancer, but can also be needed for non‑cancerous tumours or chronic inflammation. Removing these organs changes how food is digested and absorbed, and the surgery itself is very demanding on the body. As a result, many patients become malnourished after the operation – they may lose weight, have low protein levels, and feel weak. Poor nutrition can slow recovery, increase the risk of complications such as infections or leaks from the surgical site, and lengthen the hospital stay. After surgery, doctors can provide nutrition in three ways: \n- **Oral feeding** – letting the patient eat and drink normally, starting with liquids and moving to solid food. \n- **Enteral feeding** – delivering food directly into the small intestine through a tube (e.g., a naso‑jejunal tube that goes through the nose, or a jejunostomy tube that is surgically placed). \n- **Parenteral nutrition (PN)** – giving nutrients straight into a vein, either through a central line (total PN) or a peripheral line (supplemental PN). Each method has potential benefits and drawbacks, and it is unclear which approach helps patients recover best.\n**What did the researchers want to find out?**\nThe review authors set out to compare the different ways of giving nutrition after a Whipple operation. Specifically, they wanted to know how each strategy (enteral feeding, parenteral nutrition, or oral intake) affects the number and severity of post‑surgical complications and how quickly patients can recover and leave the hospital. In other words, they aimed to discover which postoperative nutritional support method leads to fewer problems and a faster return to normal life for adults undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched databases for studies that compared postoperative nutritional support after pancreaticoduodenectomy, combined their findings, and assessed confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n**What did we find?**\nWe identified 17 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,897 adult patients who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy. The trials compared postoperative nutritional support given by different routes – enteral feeding (via jejunostomy, naso‑jejunal tube or gastro‑jejunostomy), parenteral nutrition (total or supplemental, given centrally or peripherally) and oral intake. Specific head‑to‑head comparisons reported were jejunostomy versus total parenteral nutrition, naso‑jejunal feeding versus total parenteral nutrition, and jejunostomy versus oral feeding; one study also included a modified surgical technique as part of the intervention. The abstract does not give details on follow‑up length, trial locations, participants’ age or gender distribution, or funding sources.\n**Main results: Hospital stay and complications**\nEnteral feeding through a jejunostomy probably shortens the time patients stay in hospital slightly compared with parenteral nutrition. Feeding through a naso‑jejunal tube probably makes little to no difference to the length of hospital stay compared with parenteral nutrition. Feeding through a jejunostomy compared with oral intake probably makes little to no difference to the length of hospital stay. For postoperative complications such as pancreatic fistula, delayed stomach emptying, bleeding, and death after surgery, the evidence is very uncertain, but the available data suggest little to no difference between the feeding methods.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because several required subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). The Master Style Guide explicitly requires subheadings to be question‑style where possible. In addition, the text is heavy on passive constructions (24 instances, well beyond the typical PLS range) and nominalisations (39 instances) and contains an unusually high noun count (226) and complex‑word density, which together lower readability (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 33, FK‑grade 14). These issues make the summary harder for patients to follow. Suggested priority improvements: 1) Re‑write all section headings as questions (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\", \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"). 2) Convert passive sentences to active voice (e.g., change \"Feeding through a tube placed into the small intestine was used\" to \"We fed patients through a tube placed into the small intestine\"). 3) Reduce nominalisations by using verbs (e.g., replace \"assessment of confidence\" with \"we assessed confidence\"). 4) Simplify noun‑heavy sentences and replace long/complex words with everyday alternatives (e.g., \"postoperative nutritional support\" → \"nutrition after surgery\"). 5) Shorten any sentences that exceed 30 words to improve flow. These changes will bring the draft into alignment with the style guide and bring the linguistic metrics closer to typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit (761 words) but deviates from typical PLS patterns on 11 metrics. Notably, passive_voice (24, BEYOND_P90), nominalization (39, BEYOND_P90), nouns (226, BEYOND_P90), and several readability indices (coleman_liau_index 14.1, lix 59.4, rix 8.3, smog_index 16.4, dale_chall_readability 8.5) are all beyond the 90th percentile, indicating excessive complexity and noun‑heavy, passive style. Active_voice and pronoun use are acceptable, but the overall pattern‑deviation suggests the text needs substantial simplification and restructuring."
