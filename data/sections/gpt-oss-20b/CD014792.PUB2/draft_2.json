  "draft": "What kind of nutrition (tube feeding, IV nutrition, or regular eating) works best after a Whipple operation (pancreaticoduodenectomy) for adults?\n\nWhat are the key messages? – Feeding through a tube placed directly into the small intestine (jejunostomy) probably shortens hospital stay compared with giving all nutrition through a vein (total parenteral nutrition, TPN). – The evidence does not show a clear difference between these two methods for common post‑surgery problems such as pancreatic fistula (leak of pancreatic fluid), delayed gastric emptying (slow stomach emptying), bleeding, or death. – Feeding through a tube that goes through the nose into the small intestine (naso‑jejunal tube) appears to have a similar effect on hospital stay and complications as TPN, but the studies are few and the findings are uncertain. – Because the existing studies are small, varied, and of limited quality, we need more well‑designed research to determine which nutrition method best supports recovery after a Whipple operation.\n\nWhat health problem does a Whipple operation create and why does nutrition matter? A Whipple operation removes the head of the pancreas and nearby parts of the digestive (sic) tract. It is usually done for pancreatic cancer but may also be needed for benign tumours or chronic inflammation. Removing these organs changes how food is digested and absorbed. After such a major surgery many patients lose weight, have low protein levels, and feel weak. Poor nutrition can slow recovery, increase the risk of infection or leaks, and lengthen the hospital stay. Doctors can provide nutrition after surgery in three ways: – Oral feeding – letting the patient eat and drink normally, starting with liquids and progressing to solid food. – Enteral feeding – delivering food directly into the small intestine through a tube (either a naso‑jejunal tube that passes through the nose or a jejunostomy tube that is surgically placed). – Parenteral nutrition (PN) – giving nutrients straight into a vein, either through a central line (total PN) or a peripheral line (supplemental PN).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out? We wanted to compare these three nutrition strategies to see which one reduces post‑surgical complications and helps patients leave the hospital sooner.\n\nHow did we find the evidence? We searched major medical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL) and trial registers from their start dates to October 2022. We looked for randomised controlled trials that compared any two of the nutrition methods after a Whipple operation. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data, and used the GRADE system to judge confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? We identified 17 trials that enrolled a total of 1,897 adults who had undergone a Whipple operation. The trials compared enteral feeding (jejunostomy, naso‑jejunal tube or gastro‑jejunostomy), parenteral nutrition (total or supplemental), and oral feeding. – Jejunostomy versus total PN: Four trials (316 participants) showed that jejunostomy probably reduces hospital stay by about 1.6 days (moderate‑certainty evidence). The same studies suggested little or no difference in pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, bleeding, or death (low‑ to very‑low certainty). – Naso‑jejunal tube versus total PN: Two trials (242 participants) indicated little or no difference in hospital stay, delayed gastric emptying, or bleeding (low‑certainty evidence). The data hinted that TPN might slightly increase the risk of pancreatic fistula, but the evidence is uncertain. – Jejunostomy versus oral feeding: Two trials (301 participants) showed little or no difference in hospital stay and in the same complications (very‑low certainty evidence). No trial showed a clear difference in mortality between any groups.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? The studies involved different patient groups, used varied feeding protocols, and were generally small. Because of these differences and the low number of participants, we have little confidence in the overall findings.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review? The evidence we summarised reflects searches completed up to October 2022.",

Minor clarity and style tweaks will improve readability for patients:\n1. **Remove the stray “(sic)”** – it adds confusion without purpose. e.g., change \"digestive (sic) tract\" to \"digestive tract\".\n2. **Split a dense sentence in the results** – the sentence \"The same studies suggested little or no difference in pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, bleeding, or death (low‑ to very‑low certainty)\" can be rewritten as two shorter sentences: \"The same studies suggested little or no difference in pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, bleeding, or death. This evidence is of low to very‑low certainty.\"\n3. **Clarify the tentative finding about TPN and pancreatic fistula** – the current wording may seem contradictory. A clearer version: \"The data hinted that TPN might increase the risk of pancreatic fistula, but the evidence is very uncertain.\"\n4. **Reduce noun‑heavy phrasing (high nominalisation)** – replace phrases like \"the evidence we summarised reflects searches completed up to October 2022\" with \"we summarised evidence from searches up to October 2022\".\n5. **Ensure bullet lists are preceded by a blank line** for better visual separation (e.g., add a line break before the list that starts with \"- Oral feeding\").\nThese adjustments address the few remaining readability issues while preserving the accurate, complete content.\n\n**PLS evaluation summary**: The draft scores well on most metrics (words per sentence 18.8, FK grade 11.6, active voice 67, pronouns 26) placing it in the lower quartiles where PLS texts typically sit. However, nominalisations (36), nouns (189), SMOG (14.8), Dale‑Chall (8.4), complex words (144) and long words (221) are above the typical PLS range, indicating a tendency toward noun‑heavy, complex wording. The suggested edits target these deviations to bring the text closer to the median PLS profile.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "Overall moderate conformity: most metrics (sentence length, readability grades, active voice) are within typical PLS ranges (P25‑P50). Notable deviations are high nominalisation, noun count, SMOG, Dale‑Chall, complex and long word counts (beyond P90), suggesting the text is more noun‑heavy and uses longer, less familiar words than usual. Reducing nominalisations and simplifying vocabulary will improve alignment with typical PLS patterns."
