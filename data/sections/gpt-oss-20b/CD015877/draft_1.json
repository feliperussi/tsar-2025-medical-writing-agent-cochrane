  "draft": "Are personalized nutrition plans (precision nutrition) more effective than standard diet advice for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Current evidence does not show a clear advantage of precision nutrition (diet plans tailored to each child's genetics, metabolism, habits, and other personal factors) over standard diet advice for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight; no harmful side effects were reported, but the certainty of the evidence is very low because only a few small studies have been done.\n- The few studies that exist used computerised decision‑support tools (software that combines personal data to give individualized diet recommendations) and examined outcomes such as body‑mass‑index (BMI, a measure of weight relative to height) and weight, but results were inconsistent and limited to short‑term follow‑up.\n- More large, well‑designed randomised trials are needed that report both physical and mental health outcomes, use clear methods, and follow participants for longer periods to determine whether personalised nutrition truly helps weight loss and to identify any possible harms.\n- No adverse events (unwanted side effects) were reported in the available studies.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is obesity in children and teenagers a health problem?\nBeing overweight or obese means having too much body fat for one’s height and age. In children and adolescents (up to 19 years old) this can lead to serious health issues such as type‑2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, joint problems, and lower self‑esteem. It also increases the risk of staying overweight into adulthood. Common ways to manage childhood obesity include general diet advice, physical‑activity programmes, and sometimes medication or surgery, but these are usually the same for all children – a “one‑size‑fits‑all” approach.\n\nWhat is meant by “precision nutrition” and how might it differ from usual diet advice?\nPrecision nutrition tries to tailor diet recommendations to each individual’s unique characteristics. This can include a person’s genetics, current eating habits, sleep patterns, gut bacteria (the “microbiome”), health status, socioeconomic background, and activity level. By using tools such as computer‑based decision‑support systems that combine this information, the goal is to give more personalised advice than the standard, generic diet plans. The idea is that a diet that matches a child’s specific needs might work better than a generic plan.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe researchers set out to examine whether precision‑nutrition‑based interventions can help children and adolescents with overweight or obesity lose weight or improve their body‑mass index (BMI) compared with usual, non‑personalised diet advice or no special intervention. They also wanted to see if these personalised approaches affect overall well‑being, physical activity, quality of life, and any possible side effects.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that tested precision‑nutrition interventions for overweight or obesity in children and adolescents versus usual care, combined the findings, and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two randomised (or quasi‑randomised) trials that together involved 105 people with overweight or obesity. The studies were carried out in Ukraine and Greece. One trial enrolled 35 children aged 0–9 years and the other enrolled 30 adolescents aged 10–19 years; data from 65 participants were used for the main outcomes. Both trials compared a precision‑nutrition approach – a computer‑based decision‑support tool that creates personalised diet recommendations using individual information – with a standard, one‑size‑fits‑all diet advice. Funding details were limited: one study reported nonprofit funding and the other gave no funding information.\n\nIn the group of children (0–9 years), the personalised nutrition programme may have lowered: it may have lowered body‑mass index (BMI) and weight, but the evidence is very uncertain. In the group of adolescents (10–19 years), the same type of programme may have increased BMI and weight, again with very uncertain evidence.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because studies were very small, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical style requirement: all subheadings must be phrased as questions. Current subheadings such as \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are statements, not questions, so the review does not meet the Master Style Guide. In addition, several clarity issues could confuse readers:\n1. Long, compound sentence in the first key message – it packs multiple ideas and jargon, making it hard to follow.\n   Suggested rewrite: \"Current evidence does not show a clear advantage of precision nutrition over standard diet advice for helping children and teenagers lose weight. No harmful side effects were reported, but the evidence is very low‑certainty because only a few small studies exist.\"\n2. Awkward phrasing in the results for children: \"may have lowered: it may have lowered\" repeats the same idea and creates confusion.\n   Suggested rewrite: \"In children aged 0–9 years, the personalised nutrition programme may have reduced BMI and weight, but the evidence is very uncertain.\"\n3. Redundant wording and vague terms in the methods description (e.g., \"randomised (or quasi‑randomised) trials\" and \"people\").\n   Suggested rewrite: \"We identified two randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that together included 105 participants with overweight or obesity.\"\nThese changes improve readability and align the text with the Cochrane plain‑language style. The PLS evaluation shows high counts of passive voice (24 instances, beyond typical range), excessive nominalisations (24) and a very high noun count (216), all of which contribute to the dense, noun‑heavy style. Reducing passive constructions, nominalisations and noun density will further enhance clarity. To meet the style guide, rewrite each subheading as a question, for example:\n- \"What are the key messages?\"\n- \"Why is obesity in children and teenagers a health problem?\"\n- \"How did we conduct the review?\"\n- \"What did we find?\"\n- \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n- \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is within the 850‑word limit (685 words) and scores well on readability indices (Flesch Reading Ease 51, Grade 11). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in several areas: passive voice (24, BEYOND_P90), nominalisation (24, BEYOND_P90), noun count (216, BEYOND_P90), complex words (160, BEYOND_P90), and long words (207, BEYOND_P90). These metrics indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than usual PLS, supporting the need for simplification and active‑voice revisions."
