  "plain_title": "Are personalized nutrition plans (precision nutrition) more effective than standard diet advice for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Current evidence does not show a clear advantage of precision nutrition (diet plans tailored to each child's genetics, metabolism, habits, and other personal factors) over standard diet advice for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight; no harmful side effects were reported, but the certainty of the evidence is very low because only a few small studies have been done.",
    "The few studies that exist used computerised decision‑support tools (software that combines personal data to give individualized diet recommendations) and examined outcomes such as body‑mass‑index (BMI, a measure of weight relative to height) and weight, but results were inconsistent and limited to short‑term follow‑up.",
    "More large, well‑designed randomised trials are needed that report both physical and mental health outcomes, use clear methods, and follow participants for longer periods to determine whether personalised nutrition truly helps weight loss and to identify any possible harms.",
    "No adverse events (unwanted side effects) were reported in the available studies."

      "subheading": "Why is obesity in children and teenagers a health problem?",
      "content": "Being overweight or obese means having too much body fat for one’s height and age. In children and adolescents (up to 19 years old) this can lead to serious health issues such as type‑2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, joint problems, and lower self‑esteem. It also increases the risk of staying overweight into adulthood. Common ways to manage childhood obesity include general diet advice, physical‑activity programmes, and sometimes medication or surgery, but these are usually the same for all children – a “one‑size‑fits‑all” approach."

      "subheading": "What is meant by “precision nutrition” and how might it differ from usual diet advice?",
      "content": "Precision nutrition tries to tailor diet recommendations to each individual’s unique characteristics. This can include a person’s genetics, current eating habits, sleep patterns, gut bacteria (the “microbiome”), health status, socioeconomic background, and activity level. By using tools such as computer‑based decision‑support systems that combine this information, the goal is to give more personalised advice than the standard, generic diet plans. The idea is that a diet that matches a child’s specific needs might work better than a generic plan."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The researchers set out to examine whether precision‑nutrition‑based interventions can help children and adolescents with overweight or obesity lose weight or improve their body‑mass index (BMI) compared with usual, non‑personalised diet advice or no special intervention. They also wanted to see if these personalised approaches affect overall well‑being, physical activity, quality of life, and any possible side effects."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified two randomised (or quasi‑randomised) trials that together involved 105 people with overweight or obesity. The studies were carried out in Ukraine and Greece. One trial enrolled 35 children aged 0–9 years and the other enrolled 30 adolescents aged 10–19 years; data from 65 participants were used for the main outcomes. Both trials compared a precision‑nutrition approach – a computer‑based decision‑support tool that creates personalised diet recommendations using individual information – with a standard, one‑size‑fits‑all diet advice. Funding details were limited: one study reported nonprofit funding and the other gave no funding information.\n\nIn the group of children (0–9 years), the personalised nutrition programme may have lowered: it may have lowered body‑mass index (BMI) and weight, but the evidence is very uncertain. In the group of adolescents (10–19 years), the same type of programme may have increased BMI and weight, again with very uncertain evidence."
