  "draft": "\"Are personalised nutrition plans (precision nutrition) more effective than standard diet advice for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight?\"\n\nKey messages\n– Current evidence does not show a clear advantage of personalised nutrition over standard diet advice for weight loss in children and teenagers; no harmful side effects were found, but the certainty is very low because only a few small studies exist.  \n– The studies used computer programmes that collect each child’s information (such as diet, genetics, activity and gut bacteria) and then suggest a diet just for them. They measured body‑mass index (BMI, a measure of weight relative to height) and weight, but the results were inconsistent and only short‑term.  \n– Larger, well‑designed randomised trials that also look at mental‑health outcomes and follow participants for longer are needed to know whether personalised nutrition truly helps.\n\nWhy is obesity in children and teenagers a health problem?  \nBeing overweight or obese means having excess body fat for one’s height and age. In people up to 19 years old this can lead to type‑2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, joint problems and lower self‑esteem. It also raises the chance of staying overweight in adulthood. Most current approaches—general diet advice, physical‑activity programmes, medication or surgery—are the same for every child, a “one‑size‑fits‑all” strategy.\n\nWhat is meant by “precision nutrition” and how might it differ from usual diet advice?  \nPrecision nutrition tries to tailor diet recommendations to each child’s unique characteristics. This can include genetics, current eating habits, sleep patterns, gut bacteria (the microbiome), health status, socioeconomic background and activity level. Computer programmes (decision‑support tools) combine this information and then give a diet plan that is specific to the individual, rather than giving the same advice to everyone.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether precision‑nutrition interventions help children and adolescents with overweight or obesity lose weight or improve BMI compared with usual, non‑personalised diet advice or no special intervention. We also looked at effects on overall well‑being, physical activity, quality of life and any side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?  \nWe searched many databases up to July 2024. We looked for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared precision‑nutrition interventions with usual care in children (0‑9 years) or adolescents (10‑19 years) who were overweight or obese. Two reviewers screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence (GRADE). We pooled the results using a simple statistical method that assumes the studies are similar.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified two trials (105 participants) from Ukraine and Greece. One trial enrolled 35 children aged 0‑9 years and the other 30 adolescents aged 10‑19 years; data from 65 participants were used for the main outcomes.  \n\nIn children aged 0‑9 years, the personalised nutrition programme may have lowered BMI by about 1.4 kg/m² and weight by about 2.6 kg, but the evidence is very uncertain.  \n\nIn adolescents aged 10‑19 years, the same programme may have raised BMI by about 3.0 kg/m² and weight by about 11.4 kg, again with very uncertain evidence.  \n\nWe did not find any adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe studies were very small and only two trials are available, so we cannot be confident in the results. Follow‑up was short and the outcomes reported were limited.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence is current to July 2024.",

Suggested rewrite: \"In children aged 0–9 years, the personalised nutrition programme may have lowered body‑mass index (BMI) and weight, but the evidence is very uncertain.\"\n2. **Over‑long key‑message bullet** – \"Key messages – Current evidence does not show a clear advantage of personalised nutrition over standard diet advice for weight loss in children and teenagers; no harmful side effects were found, but the certainty is very low because only a few small studies exist.\" The sentence packs three ideas and is hard to follow.

No side effects were found, but the certainty is very low because only a few small studies exist.\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy, passive phrasing** – \"We pooled the results using a simple statistical method that assumes the studies are similar.\" The sentence is noun‑heavy and uses a passive‑style verb. Suggested rewrite: \"We combined the results using a simple statistical method that treats the studies as similar.\"\nThese three issues are significant enough to impede patient‑level understanding. **Metric support:** The PLS evaluation shows unusually high noun count (180, P90), complex words (119, P90) and Dale‑Chall complex words (262, P90), confirming the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words, which aligns with the clarity problems identified.",

These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than usual, supporting the need to simplify and use more active language."
