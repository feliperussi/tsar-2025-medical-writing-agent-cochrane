  "draft": "Are personalised nutrition plans (precision nutrition) more effective than standard diet advice for children and teenagers with obesity?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Current evidence does not show a clear advantage of precision nutrition over standard diet advice for helping children and teenagers lose weight. No harmful side effects were reported, but the certainty of the evidence is very low because only a few small studies exist.  \n– The existing studies used computer‑based decision‑support tools (software that combines personal data to give individual diet recommendations) and measured body‑mass index (BMI, a measure of weight relative to height) and weight. Results were inconsistent and limited to short‑term follow‑up.  \n– Larger, well‑designed randomised trials that report both physical and mental health outcomes and follow participants for longer periods are needed to determine whether personalised nutrition truly helps weight loss and to identify any possible harms.\n\nWhy is obesity in children and teenagers a health problem?\nBeing overweight or obese means having excess body fat for one’s height and age. In children and adolescents (up to 19 years) this can lead to type‑2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, joint problems, and lower self‑esteem. It also raises the chance of remaining overweight in adulthood. Typical management approaches—general diet advice, physical‑activity programmes, medication or surgery—are usually the same for all children, a “one‑size‑fits‑all” strategy.\n\nWhat is precision nutrition and how does it differ from usual diet advice?\nPrecision nutrition tailors diet recommendations to each child’s unique characteristics. This may include genetics, current eating habits, sleep patterns, gut bacteria (the microbiome), health status, socioeconomic background, and activity level. Decision‑support tools combine this information to produce personalised advice, whereas usual diet advice provides the same recommendations to everyone.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether precision‑nutrition interventions help children and adolescents with overweight or obesity lose weight or improve BMI compared with usual, non‑personalised diet advice or no special intervention. We also looked at effects on overall well‑being, physical activity, quality of life, and any side effects.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched multiple databases up to July 2024 for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared precision‑nutrition interventions with standard care in children (0‑9 years) or adolescents (10‑19 years) who were overweight or obese. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence (GRADE). We combined results using fixed‑effect meta‑analysis.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified two trials (105 participants) from Ukraine and Greece. One trial involved 35 children aged 0‑9 years and the other 30 adolescents aged 10‑19 years; data from 65 participants contributed to the main outcomes.  \nIn children (0‑9 years), the personalised nutrition programme may have reduced BMI (mean difference −1.4 kg/m²) and weight (mean difference −2.6 kg), but the evidence is very uncertain.  \nIn adolescents (10‑19 years), the same programme may have increased BMI (mean difference +3.0 kg/m²) and weight (mean difference +11.4 kg), again with very uncertain evidence. No adverse events were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe studies were very small and only two trials are available, so we cannot be confident in the results. Short‑term follow‑up and limited outcome reporting also reduce certainty.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, question‑style headings, factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader. Key issues include unexplained statistical jargon, passive constructions, overly long sentences, heavy nominalisation and residual technical terms. These reduce readability despite acceptable metric scores. Suggested improvements: \n1. **Statistical term** – Original: \"In children (0‑9 years), the personalised nutrition programme may have reduced BMI (mean difference −1.4 kg/m²) and weight (mean difference −2.6 kg), but the evidence is very uncertain.\"  Problem: \"mean difference\" is a technical phrase not explained for patients.  Rewrite: \"In children (0‑9 years), the personalised nutrition programme may have lowered BMI by about 1.4 kg/m² and weight by about 2.6 kg, but we are not sure because the evidence is very weak.\"\n2. **Passive voice** – Original: \"No adverse events were reported.\"  Problem: passive wording hides who looked for side effects.  Rewrite: \"We did not find any adverse events.\"\n3. **Long sentence in Methods** – Original: \"We searched multiple databases up to July 2024 for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared precision‑nutrition interventions with standard care in children (0‑9 years) or adolescents (10‑19 years) who were overweight or obese.\"  Problem: >30 words, hard to follow.  Rewrite: \"We searched many databases up to July 2024. We looked for randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that compared precision‑nutrition interventions with usual care in children (0‑9 years) or adolescents (10‑19 years) who were overweight or obese.\"\n4. **Nominalisation** – Original: \"We combined results using fixed‑effect meta‑analysis.\"  Problem: noun‑heavy phrasing.  Rewrite: \"We pooled the results using a simple statistical method that assumes the studies are similar.\"\n5. **Technical jargon** – Original: \"decision‑support tools (software that combines personal data to give individual diet recommendations)\" appears only once and may still be unclear.  Problem: readers may not grasp what the tool does.  Rewrite: \"computer programmes that collect each child’s information (like diet, genetics and activity) and then suggest a diet just for them.\"\nThese revisions address the most confusing elements while keeping the content accurate and within the style guide. The PLS evaluation shows high nominalisation (24, P90) and many complex words (140, P90) supporting the need to simplify language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on overall readability (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 57.3, P75) and sentence length (18.4 words, P25). However, several metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisations (24, P90), total nouns (184, P90), SMOG index (13.9, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.4, P90), complex words (140, P90) and long words (175, P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex terms, which aligns with the identified clarity issues."
