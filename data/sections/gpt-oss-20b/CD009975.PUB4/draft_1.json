  "draft": "Is video laryngoscopy (using a camera to view the airway) more effective than direct laryngoscopy (looking directly with a tube) for inserting breathing tubes in newborn babies?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Video laryngoscopy (using a camera to view the airway) may increase the chance that the first attempt at intubation (inserting a breathing tube) is successful and may reduce the number of attempts needed, but it does not clearly shorten the time required for a successful insertion; it also appears to lower the risk of airway trauma (injury to the airway), while evidence about effects on desaturation (low oxygen levels) or bradycardia (slow heart rate) is uncertain, and the overall evidence is limited because the studies were small and had methodological concerns.\n- There is very little information on other possible harms, such as changes in oxygen saturation or heart rate, and no data on longer‑term outcomes after neonatal intubation with video laryngoscopy.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that confirm these potential benefits, assess safety outcomes more comprehensively, and explore whether any advantages persist over time.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is securing the airway in newborn babies a critical problem?\nWhen a baby is born, especially if it is very small or ill, doctors may need to help it breathe by placing a tiny tube into the windpipe – a procedure called endotracheal intubation. This tube keeps the airway open so the baby can get oxygen. Doing this quickly and correctly is vital because any delay can lead to low oxygen levels, a slow heart rate, or other serious complications. The traditional way to see where to place the tube is using a direct laryngoscope, a metal blade that the clinician looks through directly. A newer tool, a videolaryngoscope, has a tiny camera that shows a video of the airway on a screen, which might give a clearer view of the vocal cords (the opening to the windpipe) and make the tube placement easier and safer.\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review authors set out to compare the two methods – videolaryngoscopy and direct laryngoscopy – to see which one works better and is safer for newborns (aged 0‑28 days). Specifically, they wanted to know whether using a video‑assisted device reduces the time it takes to place the tube, lowers the number of attempts needed, and increases the chance of getting the tube right on the first try. They also looked at whether the video method leads to fewer problems such as low oxygen levels, slow heart rate, or injury to the airway.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies comparing videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy for neonatal intubation, combined their findings on success, attempts and time, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight randomized (or quasi‑randomized) trials that together reported on 759 intubation attempts in newborn babies aged 0‑28 days of either sex. All trials were carried out in hospital settings in several countries, although the exact locations were not specified. Each study compared a video‑laryngoscope (such as C‑MAC, Airtraq, or Glidescope) with the usual direct laryngoscope for placing an endotracheal tube. The abstracts did not give details about how long participants were followed after the procedure or about the sources of funding for the individual trials. No studies examined other airway devices or older children.\nMain results: Effect of videolaryngoscopy\nVideolaryngoscopy may make little or no difference to the time needed to achieve a successful intubation, and the evidence is uncertain. It may reduce the number of attempts required, with about 14 more newborns per 100 likely to be successfully intubated on the first try, but this benefit is also uncertain and probably small. Importantly, videolaryngoscopy probably reduces the risk of airway injury during intubation, with roughly 4 fewer infants per 100 experiencing such trauma. The impact on the chance of desaturation or bradycardia episodes during intubation is unclear, and the evidence is very uncertain. Likewise, videolaryngoscopy may make little or no difference to the lowest oxygen‑saturation levels recorded during the procedure.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022 of search.",

In addition, several clarity issues would confuse readers: (1) the first bullet in Key messages is a single, very long sentence that packs multiple ideas and technical terms, making it hard to follow; (2) technical jargon such as \"intubation\", \"desaturation\", and \"bradycardia\" is introduced without simple definitions for a lay audience; (3) the Results paragraph contains dense, nominalised language (e.g., \"the impact on the chance of desaturation…\") and long sentences that exceed 30 words. These issues, combined with the metric analysis showing high nominalisation (28, beyond P90), excessive nouns (205, beyond P90) and high complex‑word counts, indicate the text needs restructuring, simplification, and re‑phrasing of subheadings into questions. Suggested improvements: rewrite subheadings as questions, split long sentences into shorter ones, replace or define technical terms, and convert nominalised phrases into active verbs.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit (740 words) and has moderate overall conformity. Readability scores are near median (Flesch‑Reading Ease 43.8, FKGL 12.6). However, several metrics deviate strongly: nominalisation (28, BEYOND_P90), noun count (205, BEYOND_P90), complex words (135, P90), long words (197, P90) and complex Dale‑Chall words (308, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex terms, which aligns with the observed clarity and the need for simplification."
