  "plain_title": "Is video laryngoscopy (using a camera to view the airway) more effective than direct laryngoscopy (looking directly with a tube) for inserting breathing tubes in newborn babies?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Video laryngoscopy (using a camera to view the airway) may increase the chance that the first attempt at intubation (inserting a breathing tube) is successful and may reduce the number of attempts needed, but it does not clearly shorten the time required for a successful insertion; it also appears to lower the risk of airway trauma (injury to the airway), while evidence about effects on desaturation (low oxygen levels) or bradycardia (slow heart rate) is uncertain, and the overall evidence is limited because the studies were small and had methodological concerns.",
    "There is very little information on other possible harms, such as changes in oxygen saturation or heart rate, and no data on longer‑term outcomes after neonatal intubation with video laryngoscopy.",
    "Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that confirm these potential benefits, assess safety outcomes more comprehensively, and explore whether any advantages persist over time."

      "subheading": "Why is securing the airway in newborn babies a critical problem?",
      "content": "When a baby is born, especially if it is very small or ill, doctors may need to help it breathe by placing a tiny tube into the windpipe – a procedure called endotracheal intubation. This tube keeps the airway open so the baby can get oxygen. Doing this quickly and correctly is vital because any delay can lead to low oxygen levels, a slow heart rate, or other serious complications. The traditional way to see where to place the tube is using a direct laryngoscope, a metal blade that the clinician looks through directly. A newer tool, a videolaryngoscope, has a tiny camera that shows a video of the airway on a screen, which might give a clearer view of the vocal cords (the opening to the windpipe) and make the tube placement easier and safer."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors set out to compare the two methods – videolaryngoscopy and direct laryngoscopy – to see which one works better and is safer for newborns (aged 0‑28 days). Specifically, they wanted to know whether using a video‑assisted device reduces the time it takes to place the tube, lowers the number of attempts needed, and increases the chance of getting the tube right on the first try. They also looked at whether the video method leads to fewer problems such as low oxygen levels, slow heart rate, or injury to the airway."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified eight randomized (or quasi‑randomized) trials that together reported on 759 intubation attempts in newborn babies aged 0‑28 days of either sex. All trials were carried out in hospital settings in several countries, although the exact locations were not specified. Each study compared a video‑laryngoscope (such as C‑MAC, Airtraq, or Glidescope) with the usual direct laryngoscope for placing an endotracheal tube. The abstracts did not give details about how long participants were followed after the procedure or about the sources of funding for the individual trials. No studies examined other airway devices or older children."

      "subheading": "Main results: Effect of videolaryngoscopy",
      "content": "Videolaryngoscopy may make little or no difference to the time needed to achieve a successful intubation, and the evidence is uncertain. It may reduce the number of attempts required, with about 14 more newborns per 100 likely to be successfully intubated on the first try, but this benefit is also uncertain and probably small. Importantly, videolaryngoscopy probably reduces the risk of airway injury during intubation, with roughly 4 fewer infants per 100 experiencing such trauma. The impact on the chance of desaturation or bradycardia episodes during intubation is unclear, and the evidence is very uncertain. Likewise, videolaryngoscopy may make little or no difference to the lowest oxygen‑saturation levels recorded during the procedure."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
