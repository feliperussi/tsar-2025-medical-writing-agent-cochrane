  "draft": "Is intermittent phototherapy (light treatment given in intervals) as effective as continuous phototherapy (light treatment without breaks) for newborn jaundice?\n\nKey messages\n– Intermittent phototherapy lowers bilirubin (the yellow pigment that builds up in newborns) about as well as continuous phototherapy, and we found no clear evidence that it changes the risk of serious brain damage (kernicterus) or infant death; the studies did not report safety outcomes well.\n– Turning the lights off reduces the total hours babies spend under phototherapy. This can give mothers more time to feed and bond with their baby. However, the evidence suggests the method may be less effective for very pre‑term infants, and important safety data are still missing.\n– The current evidence comes from small, varied trials. Larger, well‑designed studies in both term and pre‑term infants are needed to confirm long‑term safety and to balance benefits and harms.\n\nWhy is newborn jaundice a problem and how is it usually treated?\nMany babies develop a yellow colour of the skin and eyes in the first weeks of life because bilirubin builds up in their blood. This condition is called neonatal jaundice. Most cases are harmless, but very high bilirubin levels can damage the brain, causing kernicterus (a type of brain injury). The usual first‑line treatment is phototherapy – placing the baby under special lights that change bilirubin into a form the body can eliminate. Traditionally the lights stay on continuously, but some clinicians have suggested turning the lights on and off at set intervals (intermittent phototherapy) to allow more feeding time and better mother‑baby bonding.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared intermittent phototherapy with the usual continuous phototherapy to see which approach is safer and more effective. We looked at how quickly bilirubin levels fell, whether either method reduced the risk of brain damage from bilirubin (including kernicterus or bilirubin‑induced brain dysfunction), and whether there were differences in treatment failure (when phototherapy does not lower bilirubin enough and the baby needs a different treatment) or infant death.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched all relevant databases up to January 2022 for randomised trials that compared intermittent with continuous phototherapy in infants up to 30 days old. We combined the results using meta‑analysis and rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 12 randomised trials that together included about 1 600 newborns, both full‑term and pre‑term, with high bilirubin levels. The evidence shows that intermittent phototherapy probably makes little or no difference to how fast bilirubin falls compared with continuous phototherapy. We could not tell whether intermittent phototherapy changes the chance that treatment fails. It probably makes little or no difference to infant mortality, and we remain uncertain about its effect on the risk of bilirubin‑induced brain damage.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the findings because the studies enrolled different types of babies, used varied light‑delivery methods, were small, and reported few events. Important safety outcomes were not well captured.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nWe searched all relevant databases up to January 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

In addition, the draft contains two significant clarity problems: (1) the first bullet in the Key messages section is a long, compound sentence that mixes several ideas and may overwhelm readers; (2) technical terms such as \"meta‑analysis\" and \"bilirubin‑induced brain dysfunction (BIND)\" are introduced without plain‑language explanations, which can leave a lay audience confused. Minor style issues also remain: the draft shows a high level of nominalisation (23 instances, well above the typical P90 range) and an excessive count of Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (238, also above the typical P90 range), which can make the text feel more academic than necessary. Reducing nominalisations and replacing uncommon words with everyday alternatives would improve readability and bring the metrics closer to typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (55.6% of features in the best quartile). Most readability and structural metrics are within typical ranges (e.g., ARI 11.94, LIX 49.5, words per sentence 20.2). However, two metrics deviate markedly: nominalisation (23, beyond the P90 median) and complex_words_dc (238, also beyond the P90 median), indicating the draft uses more noun‑heavy constructions and less familiar vocabulary than typical plain‑language summaries."
