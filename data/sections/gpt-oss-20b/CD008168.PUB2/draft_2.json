  "draft": "Is intermittent phototherapy (light treatment given in intervals) as effective as continuous phototherapy (light treatment without breaks) for newborn jaundice?\n\nKey messages\n– Intermittent phototherapy (light on and off) works about as well as continuous phototherapy for lowering bilirubin, the yellow pigment that builds up in newborns. We found no clear evidence that it changes the risk of serious brain damage (kernicterus) or infant death, and safety outcomes were poorly reported.\n– Turning the lights off for periods reduces the total hours babies spend under phototherapy. This may help mothers feed and bond with their infants, but the evidence suggests the approach may be less effective in very pre‑term babies and important safety data are still missing.\n– The current evidence comes from small, varied studies. Larger, well‑designed trials in both term \"term\" and pre‑term infants are needed to confirm long‑term safety and to balance benefits and harms.\n\nWhy is newborn jaundice a problem and how is it usually treated?\nMany babies develop a yellow colour of the skin and eyes in the first weeks of life because bilirubin builds up in their blood. This condition is called neonatal jaundice. Most cases are harmless, but very high bilirubin levels can damage the brain, leading to kernicterus (a type of brain injury). The usual first‑line treatment is phototherapy – placing the baby under special lights that change bilirubin into a form the body can eliminate. Traditionally the lights stay on continuously, but some clinicians have suggested turning the lights on and off at set intervals (intermittent phototherapy) to allow more feeding time and better mother‑baby bonding.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe compared intermittent phototherapy with the usual continuous phototherapy to see which method is safer and more effective. We looked at how quickly bilirubin levels fell, whether either method reduced the risk of brain damage (including kernicterus or bilirubin‑induced brain dysfunction), and whether there were differences in treatment failure or infant death.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to January 2022 for randomised trials that compared intermittent with continuous phototherapy in infants up to 30 days old. We combined the results using meta‑analysis and assessed our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 12 randomised trials involving about 1 600 newborns, both full‑term and pre‑term, with high bilirubin levels. The evidence shows that intermittent phototherapy probably makes little or no difference to how fast bilirubin falls compared with continuous phototherapy. We could not determine whether intermittent phototherapy changes the chance of treatment failure. It also probably makes little or no difference to infant mortality, and we remain uncertain about its effect on the risk of bilirubin‑induced brain damage.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in the findings because the studies enrolled different types of babies, used varied light‑delivery methods, were small, and reported few events. Important safety outcomes were not well captured.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nWe searched all relevant databases up to January 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural and factual requirements, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Undefined term – “treatment failure”** – The sentence \"We could not determine whether intermittent phototherapy changes the chance that the treatment fails.\" uses a technical outcome without explanation, leaving readers unsure what it means. Suggested rewrite: \"We could not tell whether intermittent phototherapy leads to more or fewer cases where the phototherapy does not lower bilirubin enough and the baby needs a different treatment (treatment failure).\"\n2. **Overly long bullet point** – Bullet 2 reads: \"Turning the lights off for periods reduces the total hours babies spend under phototherapy. This may help mothers feed and bond with their infants, but the evidence suggests the approach may be less effective in very pre‑term babies and important safety data are still missing.\" This combines three ideas in one long sentence, making it hard to follow. Suggested rewrite: \"Turning the lights off reduces the total hours babies are under phototherapy. This can give mothers more time to feed and bond with their baby. However, the evidence suggests the method may be less effective for very pre‑term infants, and important safety data are still missing.\"\n3. **Awkward phrasing of currency statement** – The line \"The evidence is up to date to January 2022 of search.\" is unclear. Suggested rewrite: \"We searched all relevant databases up to January 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.\"\n4. **Vague wording – “may also make little or no difference”** – In the results paragraph the phrase \"It may also make little or no difference to infant mortality\" is ambiguous. Suggested rewrite: \"It probably makes little or no difference to infant mortality.\"\n5. **High nominalisation and difficult words** – The metrics show a high nominalisation count (22, beyond typical) and many complex Dale‑Chall words (233). Re‑writing noun‑heavy phrases as verbs (e.g., change \"the evidence suggests\" to \"we found\") and replacing difficult words with simpler alternatives will improve readability.\n\nThese issues affect the core understanding of the review for patients and need to be addressed before the PLS can be approved.",

Word of the draft is 531, within the 850 limit, and readability scores are within expected ranges.
