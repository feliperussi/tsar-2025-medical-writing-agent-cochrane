  "draft": "Which nerve block (regional pain relief) technique gives the best pain relief after breast cancer surgery?\n\nWhat are the main messages of this review?\n- The four nerve‑block techniques we studied – paravertebral block (injection near the spine), erector spinae plane block (injection beside a back muscle), pectoral nerve block (injection near chest muscles), and serratus anterior plane block (injection near a side‑chest muscle) – all provide similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery; no single method proved clearly better.  \n- Serious complications such as block failure, local‑anaesthetic toxicity, nerve injury, or collapsed lung (pneumothorax) were not reported in the trials, suggesting that these blocks appear safe in the short term.  \n- Larger, high‑quality studies that follow patients for longer periods and record opioid use and rare side‑effects are needed to confirm whether any technique offers a meaningful advantage.\n\nWhy is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery a concern?\nWomen undergoing breast cancer surgery often experience strong pain after the operation. This pain can slow recovery, lower quality of life, and increase the need for opioid medicines, which have their own side‑effects. To reduce pain, clinicians use regional analgesia – techniques that place a local anaesthetic near specific nerves to block pain signals. The four common techniques we examined are:\n- Paravertebral block (PVB): injection next to the spinal nerves.  \n- Erector spinae plane block (ESPB): injection into the muscle plane beside the spine.  \n- Pectoral nerve block (PEC): injection targeting the chest‑wall nerves.  \n- Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB): injection near the serratus muscle on the side of the chest.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe set out to compare how well each regional‑analgesia technique relieves postoperative pain and how safe the techniques are. Our primary outcomes were pain scores after surgery and any reported complications.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared two or more of the four techniques in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. We combined the results using a statistical method called a network meta‑analysis, which lets us compare several treatments at once. We judged the certainty of the evidence with a tool called CINeMA (Confidence In Network Meta‑Analysis).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 39 trials that enrolled a total of 2,348 women, most of whom had a modified radical mastectomy. The trials were conducted in Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the United States and Thailand, and all surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia in hospital settings.\n\nWe compared the four techniques and found that ESPB, PEC and SAPB gave little or no difference in pain compared with the paravertebral block, whether the pain was measured at rest or during movement at 2, 24 or 48 hours after surgery. There was a small hint that the pectoral nerve block might reduce pain during movement two hours after surgery, but the evidence was uncertain. No serious complications such as block failure, toxicity, nerve damage or pneumothorax were reported for any technique, although the certainty about safety was low because few events occurred.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were small and involved slightly different patient groups or injection methods. This variability reduces the precision of our estimates and makes it harder to detect rare adverse events.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published until that date.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft passes the mandatory checks (all required sections are present, subheadings are phrased as questions, facts match the source, and word count is under 850). However, three key clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained technical term** – \"network meta‑analysis\" is mentioned without a plain‑language definition. Readers may not understand how the comparison was made.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We combined the results using a statistical method called a network meta‑analysis – a way to compare several treatments at once even when the studies didn’t test them directly.\"\n2. **Jargon about evidence certainty** – phrases such as \"high‑certainty evidence\", \"low‑certainty evidence\" and \"moderate‑certainty evidence\" are used without explanation, leaving readers unsure what the grades mean.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We rated how confident we are in the results. When we say the evidence is ‘high‑certainty’, we are very sure the finding is reliable; ‘low‑certainty’ means the result is less certain because the studies were small or varied.\"\n3. **Long, dense bullet point** – The first key‑message bullet combines several ideas in one long sentence, making it hard to follow.\n   *Original:* \"The four nerve‑block techniques we studied – paravertebral block (injection near the spine), erector spinae plane block (injection beside a back muscle), pectoral nerve block (injection near chest muscles), and serratus anterior plane block (injection near a side‑chest muscle) – all provide similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery; no single method proved clearly better.\"\n   *Rewrite:* \"All four nerve‑block techniques – paravertebral block (near the spine), erector spinae plane block (beside a back muscle), pectoral nerve block (near chest muscles) and serratus anterior plane block (near a side‑chest muscle) – gave similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery. No single method was clearly better than the others.\"\nThese changes address the most likely sources of confusion. Supporting metrics show a high nominalisation count (21, beyond the typical P90 range) and a high noun count (189, also beyond P90), indicating the text is noun‑heavy. Reducing nominalisations (e.g., changing \"Our primary analysis for postoperative pain included 16 studies\" to \"We analysed 16 studies for postoperative pain\") will improve readability. Overall, while the draft meets structural requirements, the identified clarity issues must be resolved before the summary can be considered ready for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (50% of features in the best quartile). However, five metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisations (21, P90), noun count (189, P90), SMOG index (14, P90), complex words (133, P90) and complex Dale‑Chall words (235, P90). These suggest the draft is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than usual, supporting the recommendation to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
