  "draft": "Which nerve block (regional pain relief) technique gives the best pain relief after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- The four nerve‑block techniques we looked at – paravertebral block (injection near the spine), erector spinae plane block (injection beside a back muscle), pectoral nerve block (injection near chest muscles) and serratus anterior plane block (injection near a side‑chest muscle) – all provide similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery; no one method is clearly better.\n- Serious problems such as block failure, local‑anaesthetic toxicity, nerve injury or a collapsed lung (pneumothorax) were not reported in the studies, suggesting these blocks appear safe in the short term.\n- Larger, high‑quality studies that follow patients for longer, record opioid use and capture rare side‑effects are needed to confirm whether any technique offers a meaningful advantage.\n\nWhy is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery a concern?  \nWomen often feel strong pain after breast cancer surgery. The pain can slow recovery, lower quality of life and increase the need for opioid medicines, which have their own side‑effects. To reduce pain, clinicians use regional analgesia – a technique that places a local anaesthetic near specific nerves to block pain signals.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare how well each regional‑analgesia technique relieves pain after surgery and how safe the techniques are. Our main outcomes were pain scores and any reported complications.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared two or more of the four nerve‑block techniques in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. We combined the results from all eligible trials in a single analysis that allows indirect comparisons between techniques. We also judged how confident we are in each result using a standard evidence‑rating approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 39 trials that enrolled a total of 2,348 women, most of whom had a modified radical mastectomy. The trials were carried out in Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the United States and Thailand, and all surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia in hospitals.\n\nCompared with a paravertebral block, the other three blocks (erector spinae plane, pectoral nerve and serratus anterior plane) made little or no difference to pain at rest or during movement at 2, 24 and 48 hours after surgery. There was a hint that a pectoral nerve block might reduce pain during movement two hours after surgery, but the evidence was uncertain. No serious complications such as block failure, toxicity, nerve damage or pneumothorax were reported for any technique, although the certainty about safety is low because few events occurred.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany studies were small and involved slightly different patient groups or injection methods. This variability reduces the precision of our estimates and makes it harder to detect rare adverse events.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published until that date.",

Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers: (1) a 37‑word sentence comparing the blocks is too long and dense; (2) the term 'modified radical mastectomy' is not explained for a lay audience; (3) passive phrasing in the complications sentence obscures who observed the lack of events; (4) the paragraph contains noun‑heavy constructions, reflected by the metric deviation (nouns = 164, complex_words = 118, both above typical PLS ranges). These issues need to be corrected before the summary can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall (high overall conformity) but deviates on two metrics: noun count (164, P90) and complex word count (118, P90), indicating a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style. Readability scores are good (Flesch‑Reading Ease 51, FKGL 11), but the identified style deviations support the need for simplification."
