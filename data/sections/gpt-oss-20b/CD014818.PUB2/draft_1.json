  "draft": "Which nerve block (regional pain relief) technique gives the best pain relief after breast cancer surgery?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Overall, the four nerve‑block techniques studied – paravertebral block (injection near the spine), erector spinae plane block (injection near a back muscle), pectoral nerve block (injection near chest muscles), and serratus anterior plane block (injection near a side‑chest muscle) – provide similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery, with no single method clearly superior; the evidence comes from generally well‑conducted trials but some comparisons have limited data.\n- Serious complications such as block failure, local anaesthetic toxicity, nerve injury, or pneumothorax (collapsed lung) were not reported in the included studies, indicating that these nerve‑block approaches appear safe in the short term.\n- Future research should include larger, high‑quality studies that examine longer‑term pain outcomes, opioid use, and any rare adverse effects to better determine whether any technique offers a meaningful advantage.\n\n**Introduction**\nWhy is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery a concern?\nWomen undergoing breast cancer surgery often experience significant postoperative pain, which can delay recovery, diminish quality of life, and increase reliance on opioid medications that have notable side‑effects. To mitigate this, clinicians use regional analgesia—techniques that deliver local anaesthetic near specific nerves to block pain signals. Common regional techniques studied for breast surgery include:\n\n- Paravertebral block (PVB): injection adjacent to the spinal nerves.\n- Erector spinae plane block (ESPB): injection into the muscle plane beside the spine.\n- Pectoral nerve block (PEC): injection targeting the chest wall nerves.\n- Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB): injection near the serratus muscle on the lateral chest.\n\nThese methods can reduce pain intensity and opioid consumption, but they also carry potential harms such as nerve injury, bleeding, or local anaesthetic toxicity. Understanding which technique offers the best balance of benefit and risk is essential for improving postoperative outcomes in breast cancer patients.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe review sought to compare the analgesic effectiveness and safety of different regional analgesia techniques used after breast cancer surgery. Specifically, it aimed to determine how well each technique relieves postoperative pain and what adverse events or complications are associated with them, by analysing data from randomised controlled trials.\n\n**Methods**\nMethods Summary\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials that compared regional analgesia techniques after breast cancer surgery, combined their results using network meta‑analysis, and rated our confidence in the evidence with the CINeMA approach.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 39 randomised controlled trials that together included 2,348 women undergoing breast cancer surgery, most often a modified radical mastectomy. The studies were carried out in several countries (including Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the United States and Thailand) and all surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia in hospital settings. The trials compared four regional‑analgesia techniques – paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block, pectoral nerve block and serratus anterior plane block – each given as a single, long‑acting injection under ultrasound guidance.\n\nThe review found that, compared with a paravertebral block, the other three blocks generally made little or no difference to pain at rest or during movement at 2, 24 and 48 hours after surgery. There was a hint that a pectoral nerve block might reduce pain during movement two hours after surgery, but overall the evidence was uncertain. No serious complications such as block failure, toxicity or nerve injury were reported for any of the techniques, although the certainty about safety was very low.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check that all section subheadings must be phrased as questions. Several headings are statements (e.g., \"Introduction\", \"Methods Summary\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\") which violates the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text contains a high amount of passive voice (21 instances, beyond the typical PLS range) and excessive nominalisation (25 instances) leading to noun‑heavy sentences that are hard for patients to follow. Some sentences are long and contain unexplained jargon (e.g., \"network meta‑analysis\", \"CINeMA\", \"minimal clinically important difference\"). These issues reduce readability (Flesch‑Kincaid grade 14.7, Gunning Fog 21.2) and would likely confuse a lay audience. Suggested priority improvements: 1) Rewrite all subheadings as questions (e.g., \"Why is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery a concern?\"). 2) Convert passive constructions to active voice (e.g., change \"The review found that, compared with a paravertebral block, the other three blocks generally made little or no difference…\" to \"We found that the other three blocks made little or no difference compared with a paravertebral block.\"). 3) Replace nominalised nouns with verbs (e.g., \"The review found\" → \"We found\"). 4) Simplify or define technical terms (e.g., add a brief explanation of \"network meta‑analysis\"). 5) Break long sentences into shorter ones (aim for ≤20 words). Implementing these changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability metrics.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets the word‑count limit (632 words) but deviates from typical PLS patterns on 12 metrics. Notably, passive voice (21, beyond P90), nominalisation (25, beyond P90), noun count (220, beyond P90), and readability indices (Flesch‑Kincaid grade 14.7, Gunning Fog 21.2, SMOG 16) are all higher than the median ranges for Cochrane PLSs, indicating the text is more complex and noun‑heavy than usual. These metric deviations support the editorial recommendations above."
