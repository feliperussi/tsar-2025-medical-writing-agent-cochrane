  "draft": "Which nerve block (regional pain relief) technique gives the best pain relief after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- All four nerve‑block techniques – paravertebral block (near the spine), erector spinae plane block (beside a back muscle), pectoral nerve block (near chest muscles) and serratus anterior plane block (near a side‑chest muscle) – gave similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery. No single method was clearly better.\n- Serious complications such as block failure, local‑anaesthetic toxicity, nerve injury or a collapsed lung (pneumothorax) were not reported in the trials, suggesting that these blocks appear safe in the short term.\n- Larger, high‑quality studies that follow patients for longer periods and record opioid use and rare side‑effects are needed to confirm whether any technique offers a meaningful advantage.\n\nWhy is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery a concern?  \nWomen who have breast cancer surgery often experience strong pain afterwards. The pain can slow recovery, lower quality of life and increase the need for opioid medicines, which have their own side‑effects. To reduce pain, clinicians use regional analgesia – a technique that places a local anaesthetic near specific nerves to block pain signals. The four common approaches we examined are:\n- Paravertebral block (PVB): injection next to the spinal nerves.  \n- Erector spinae plane block (ESPB): injection into the muscle plane beside the spine.  \n- Pectoral nerve block (PEC): injection targeting the chest‑wall nerves.  \n- Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB): injection near the serratus muscle on the side of the chest.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare how well each regional‑analgesia technique relieves postoperative pain and how safe the techniques are. Our primary outcomes were pain scores after surgery and any reported complications.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared two or more of the four techniques in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. We combined the results using a statistical method called a network meta‑analysis – a way to compare several treatments at once even when the studies did not test them directly. We rated our confidence in the results with the CINeMA tool. When we say the evidence is “high‑certainty”, we are very sure the finding is reliable; “low‑certainty” means the result is less certain because the studies were small or varied.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 39 trials that enrolled a total of 2,348 women, most of whom had a modified radical mastectomy. The trials were conducted in Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the United States and Thailand, and all surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia in hospitals.\n\nCompared with a paravertebral block, the other three blocks (ESPB, PEC and SAPB) made little or no difference to pain at rest or during movement at 2, 24 or 48 hours after surgery. There was a hint that a pectoral nerve block might reduce pain during movement two hours after surgery, but the evidence was uncertain. No serious complications such as block failure, toxicity, nerve damage or pneumothorax were reported for any technique, although the certainty about safety was low because few events occurred.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany studies were small and involved slightly different patient groups or injection methods. This variability reduces the precision of our estimates and makes it harder to detect rare adverse events.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published until that date.",

These issues are reflected in the metric analysis, which shows a high noun count (185, P90) and many complex words (complex_words_dc = 235, P90; complex_words = 127, P90). The draft needs clearer, feedback, and less jargon‑laden language to meet Cochrane plain‑language standards.",

These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex words, which aligns with the identified clarity issues."
