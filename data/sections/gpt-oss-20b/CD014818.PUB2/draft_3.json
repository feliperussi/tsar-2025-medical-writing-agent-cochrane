  "draft": "Which nerve block (regional pain relief) technique gives the best pain relief after breast cancer surgery?\n\nKey messages\n- The four nerve‑block techniques we studied – paravertebral block (injection near the spinal nerves), erector spinae plane block (injection beside a back muscle), pectoral nerve block (injection near chest muscles), and serratus anterior plane block (injection near a side‑chest muscle) – all provide similar pain relief after breast cancer surgery; no single method proved clearly better.\n- Serious complications such as block failure, local‑anaesthetic toxicity, nerve injury, or collapsed lung (pneumothorax) were not reported in the trials, suggesting that these blocks appear safe in the short term.\n- Larger, high‑quality studies that follow patients for longer periods and record opioid use and rare side‑effects are needed to confirm whether any technique offers a meaningful advantage.\n\nWhy is postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery a concern?  \nWomen undergoing breast cancer surgery often experience strong pain after the operation. This pain can slow recovery, lower quality of life, and increase the need for opioid medicines, which have their own side‑effects. To reduce pain, clinicians use regional analgesia – techniques that place a local anaesthetic near specific nerves to block pain signals. The four common techniques we examined are:\n\n- Paravertebral block (PVB): injection next to the spinal nerves.  \n- Erector spinae plane block (ESPB): injection into the muscle plane beside the spine.  \n- Pectoral nerve block (PEC): injection targeting the nerves of the chest wall.  \n- Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB): injection near the serratus muscle on the side of the chest.  \n\nEach method aims to lower pain intensity and reduce opioid consumption, but it can also cause harms such as nerve injury, bleeding, or local‑anaesthetic toxicity. Knowing which technique offers the best balance of benefit and risk can help improve recovery for breast‑cancer patients.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe set out to compare how well each regional‑analgesia technique relieves postoperative pain and how safe the techniques are. Our primary outcomes were pain scores after surgery and any reported complications.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared two or more of the four techniques in women undergoing breast cancer surgery. We combined the results using a network meta‑analysis, a statistical method that lets us compare several treatments at once. We judged the certainty of the evidence with CINeMA (Confidence In Network Meta‑Analysis), a tool that rates how trustworthy the findings are. All included studies used a single, long‑acting injection under ultrasound guidance.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 39 trials that enrolled a total of 2,348 women, most of whom had a modified radical mastectomy. Researchers carried out the trials in several countries (Egypt, India, Turkey, China, Japan, the United States, and Thailand). All surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia in hospital settings.\n\nWe compared the four techniques. The three blocks (ESPB, PEC, SAPB) gave little or no difference in pain compared with the paravertebral block. This was true for pain at rest and during movement at 2, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. There was a small hint that the pectoral nerve block might reduce pain during movement two hours after surgery, but the evidence was uncertain. No serious complications such as block failure, toxicity, nerve damage, or pneumothorax were reported for any technique, although the certainty about safety was low because few events occurred.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the results because many studies were small and involved slightly different patient groups or injection methods. This variability reduces the precision of our estimates and makes it harder to detect rare adverse events.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to June 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published until that date.",

This alone prevents approval. In addition, several clarity and style issues should be addressed to improve readability:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – terms like \"network meta‑analysis\" and \"CINeMA\" appear without plain‑language explanations, which can confuse patients.\n   *Rewrite*: \"We combined the results using a statistical method called a network meta‑analysis, which lets us compare several treatments at once. We checked how trustworthy the findings were with a tool called CINeMA (Confidence In Network Meta‑Analysis).\"\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"We compared the four techniques. The three blocks (ESPB, PEC, SAPB) gave little or no difference in pain compared with the paravertebral block. This was true for pain at rest and during movement at 2, 24, and 48 hours after surgery.\" can be streamlined.\n   *Rewrite*: \"We compared the four techniques and found that ESPB, PEC, and SAPB gave little or no difference in pain compared with the paravertebral block, whether the pain was measured at rest or during movement at 2, 24, or 48 hours after surgery.\"\n3. **Passive voice / nominalisation** – \"The certainty of the evidence was judged with CINeMA\" uses a noun‑heavy construction.\n   *Rewrite*: \"We judged the certainty of the evidence with CINeMA.\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy paragraph** – the results paragraph contains many nouns, contributing to a high noun count (216, beyond typical range). Re‑write sentences to use more verbs and fewer abstract nouns.\n   *Example rewrite*: Change \"The review found that, compared with a paravertebral block, the other three blocks generally made little or no difference to pain at rest or during movement at 2, 24 and 48 hours after surgery\" to \"We found that, compared with a paravertebral block, the other three blocks generally did not change pain at rest or during movement at 2, 24, or 48 hours after surgery.\"\n5. **Subheading format** – change \"Key messages\" to a question, e.g., \"What are the main messages of this review?\".\nThese changes will also address metric deviations (high nominalisation, noun count, SMOG, complex words) and bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns. Overall, the draft needs the subheading reformatted as a question and the above clarity/style edits before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (moderate overall pattern conformity). Readability scores are strong (Flesch Reading Ease 52, grade 10.3). However, several metrics deviate: nominalizations (25, beyond typical), noun count (216, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.5, beyond P90), complex words (150) and long words (181) are all higher than typical PLS ranges, indicating noun‑heavy, complex language. Addressing these will improve readability."
