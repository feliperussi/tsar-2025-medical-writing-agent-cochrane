  "draft": "\"?Glue‑like sealants (sealants) help stop bleeding faster at blood‑vessel connections than usual methods during vascular (blood‑vessel) surgery?\\n\\nKey messages\\n– Sealants may stop bleeding about four minutes sooner and may lower the chance that bleeding control fails, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies have many limitations.\\n– Sealants did not show clear differences in total blood loss, overall operating time, postoperative bleeding, or the need to return to the operating room.\\n– No harmful effects were reported, and higher‑quality research is needed to confirm benefits, identify any harms, and assess cost‑effectiveness.\\n\\nWhy is bleeding at the site where blood vessels are joined a problem in vascular surgery?\\nDuring vascular surgery surgeons create a link called an anastomosis. The tiny needle holes in the anastomosis can leak, causing bleeding. Excess bleeding can lengthen the operation, increase the need for blood transfusions, and raise the risk of complications after surgery.\\n\\nWhat are sealants and how might they help stop this bleeding?\\nSealants are medical glues that surgeons apply directly to the bleeding tissue. They act as an extra tool (an adjunct) when standard methods such as manual pressure, gauze, or reversal of blood‑thinning medication do not stop the bleed quickly enough. Sealants are made from proteins (for example fibrin) or from synthetic materials and form a rapid, waterproof barrier over the needle holes.\\n\\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\\nWe wanted to know whether using sealants during vascular surgery improves patient outcomes. Specifically we examined whether sealants reduce the time needed to achieve hemostasis (the stopping of bleeding), lower the risk that bleeding control fails, and affect other outcomes such as total blood loss, operating time, postoperative bleeding, return to the operating room, and any harms.\\n\\nWhat did we do?\\nWe searched major medical databases for randomized controlled trials that compared fibrin‑based or synthetic sealants with standard techniques for achieving anastomotic hemostasis. We pooled the results and assessed the certainty of the evidence using established criteria.\\n\\nWhat did we find?\\nWe identified 24 trials involving 2,376 participants who underwent vascular anastomoses. All trials compared sealants with standard‑care methods such as oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, or manual compression. The studies did not report follow‑up length, funding sources, participant details, or trial locations, and none recorded deaths from bleeding or quality‑of‑life outcomes.\\n\\nAcross 498 participants in seven studies, sealants reduced the time to stop bleeding by about four minutes (mean difference ≈ 230 seconds). The certainty of this evidence is low. Sealants may also reduce the chance that the bleeding control fails (risk ratio ≈ 0.46), but this evidence is very uncertain. We found no clear differences between sealants and standard care for intra‑operative blood loss, total operating time, postoperative bleeding, or unplanned return to the operating room. No harmful effects were reported.\\n\\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\\nAll trials were at high risk of bias because participants and clinicians often knew which treatment was used. The studies were small, varied in participants and methods, and provided incomplete data. These weaknesses mean the results may over‑estimate benefits.\\n\\nHow current is the evidence?\\nThe evidence is up to date with searches completed in March 2023.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failures: • The subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, violating the style guide requirement that all subheadings be questions. • The title is wrapped in stray question‑mark characters (\"?Glue‑like…?\") which is non‑standard formatting. • Several sentences exceed 30 words, contributing to the high words‑per‑sentence metric (32, beyond the typical PLS range) and making the text harder to follow. • The draft uses a high proportion of nouns (163, P90) and complex/long words, leading to a reading grade of 15.8 (P90) and low readability scores. Suggested fixes: 1) Change \"Key messages\" to a question such as \"What are the main findings?\" and adjust the bullet list accordingly. 2) Clean up the title to read: \"Do glue‑like sealants help stop bleeding faster at blood‑vessel connections than usual methods during vascular surgery?\" 3) Break long sentences into shorter ones (e.g., split the sentence about study characteristics into two). 4) Replace some noun‑heavy phrases with active verbs and simpler words (e.g., \"The studies did not report…\" → \"Researchers did not report…\"). These changes will bring the draft into compliance with the master style guide and improve readability and metric scores.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets the word‑count limit but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: words per sentence (32, BEYOND_P90), nouns (163, P90), reading grade (15.8, P90), complex words and long words (both P90), and readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 38.5, P25). Active voice is strong (71, P75) but the high noun and sentence length scores indicate the text is too dense for the target audience."
