  "plain_title": "Do glue-like sealants (sealants) help stop bleeding faster at blood vessel connections than usual methods during vascular (blood vessel) surgery?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Sealants (glue‑like materials applied to the surgical connection) may help achieve hemostasis (stop bleeding) faster and may reduce the chance that the bleeding control fails, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies had many limitations. No harmful effects were reported.",
    "When compared with standard care (usual methods such as manual pressure or other materials), sealants did not show clear differences in the amount of blood lost during the operation, the overall length of the surgery, bleeding after the operation, or the need to return to the operating room for bleeding.",
    "Because the existing studies have important weaknesses, further high‑quality research is needed to confirm any benefits, to identify possible harms, and to examine cost‑effectiveness."

  "background": [
    {
      "subheading": "Why is bleeding at the site where blood vessels are joined a problem in vascular surgery?",
      "content": "During operations on arteries, veins or artificial grafts, surgeons create a connection called an **anastomosis** – essentially a stitch‑like link that lets blood flow from one piece to another. The tiny needle holes made during this process can leak, leading to **bleeding** (loss of blood) at the surgical site. Excess bleeding can make the operation longer, increase the need for blood transfusions, and raise the risk of complications after surgery."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What are sealants and how might they help stop this bleeding?",
      "content": "**Sealants** are special medical glues that surgeons can apply directly to the bleeding tissue. They are meant to act as an extra tool (an **adjunct**) when traditional methods – such as pressing the tissue together, using gauze, or reversing blood‑thinning medication – do not stop the bleed quickly enough. Different sealants are made from proteins (like fibrin) or synthetic materials, and they are designed to form a quick, waterproof barrier over the needle holes."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to determine whether using sealants during vascular surgery actually helps patients. Specifically, they looked at whether sealants reduce the time needed to achieve **hemostasis** (the stopping of bleeding), lower the chance that the bleeding control fails, and affect other outcomes such as total blood loss during the operation, overall operating time, postoperative bleeding, the need to the operating room, and any possible harms."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we do?",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared sealants with standard techniques for achieving anastomotic hemostasis in vascular surgery, pooled the findings, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using established criteria."
    }
  ],
  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review identified 24 randomized controlled trials enrolling a total of 2,376 participants who underwent vascular anastomoses. All trials compared sealants (fibrin‑based or synthetic) with standard‑care methods such as oxidized cellulose, gelatin sponge, or manual compression. The abstract provides no details on follow‑up duration, funding sources, participant demographics, or geographic locations, and no trial reported death from bleeding or quality‑of‑life outcomes."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Time to achieve hemostasis",
      "content": "Sealants may reduce the time required to achieve hemostasis. Across roughly 100 patients, bleeding stopped about four minutes sooner when a sealant was used, although the certainty of this evidence is low."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, the studies were very small, and the studies that provide results are likely to exaggerate the benefits because they represent only a small set of the studies on the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search."
