  "draft": "Do decision aids (simple tools that explain health options and help you weigh pros and cons) help adults make better‑informed choices compared with usual information?\n\n- Decision aids (simple tools that explain health options and help you weigh pros and cons) probably help adults make choices that match their personal values better than usual information, increase knowledge about the options, improve understanding of the chances of benefits and harms, and reduce feelings of being uninformed or uncertain about what matters most; there was no evidence of increased regret (feeling sorry about the choice later) or other serious harms.\n- People using decision aids were more likely to take an active role in discussions with their clinicians, and using the aids before a visit did not noticeably lengthen the appointment, while using them during the visit added only a short amount of time.\n- Further research is needed to see how decision aids influence whether people follow through with their chosen options, long‑term health outcomes, and costs, and to improve the quality and reporting of future studies.\n\n**Why do many people need help when choosing health treatments or screening tests?**\nEvery day, adults face choices about whether to start a medication, have a surgery, or undergo a screening test for conditions such as heart disease, cancer, mental health problems, or joint replacement. These decisions can be hard because the options often have different benefits, risks, and costs, and patients may not fully understand the information or know which factors matter most to them. When people do not feel well‑informed, they may make choices that do not match their personal values or may feel uncertain and anxious about the decision. To support patients, tools called patient decision aids have been created. These aids clearly lay out the decision, give evidence‑based facts about each option (including possible benefits and harms), and help people think about what matters most to them. \"Usual care\" – the standard information or advice patients usually receive – often does not include all of these elements.\n\n**What did the review aim to find out?**\nThe authors wanted to determine whether using patient decision aids improves the decision‑making process for adults facing treatment or screening choices. Specifically, they compared decision aids with usual care to see if they lead to: (1) choices that better reflect patients’ informed values (called values‑congruent choices), (2) higher knowledge about the options, (3) more accurate perceptions of risks, (4) less feeling of being uninformed or conflicted (known as decisional conflict), and (5) any differences in outcomes such as decision regret, consultation length, or later health effects. The review gathered evidence from randomized trials published up to March 2022 to answer these questions.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched multiple databases for randomized controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants) comparing patient decision aids with usual care for adults making treatment or screening choices, pooled their results, and assessed our confidence in the evidence using GRADE.\n\n**What did we find?**\nThe review included 209 randomised controlled trials with a total of 107,698 adult participants who were facing treatment or screening decisions. All trials compare a patient decision aid – an intervention that makes the decision explicit, provides evidence‑based information about options and benefits/harms, and helps clarify personal values – with usual care (general information, risk‑assessment tools, consumer‑focused guideline summaries, a placebo information intervention, or no additional intervention). The abstract does not give details on how long the individual studies lasted, where they were conducted, the participants’ ages, genders, or health status, or who funded the trials.\n\n**Main results: Patient decision aids improve informed choice**\nPatient decision aids probably cause a large increase in the chance that people make choices that match their informed values. They also cause a large increase in accurate risk perception, increase knowledge, reduce feelings of being uninformed, reduce indecision about personal values, and lower the proportion of people who are passive in decision making. Decision aids make little to no difference to decision regret.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.",

(2) The draft does not clearly label a separate \"Key messages\" section; the opening bullet points are presented without a heading, so the required sections are incomplete. While the factual numbers are accurate and the word count is within limits, the missing and mis‑formatted sections prevent approval. Additionally, the draft contains many passive constructions (19 instances, P90) and excessive nominalizations (31, beyond P90), contributing to readability issues. To meet the guidelines, the document needs re‑structuring with question‑style subheadings, an explicit Key messages heading, and reduction of passive voice and nominalizations.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows overall moderate conformity. Readability scores are near median (Flesch Reading Ease 46, FKGL 12.9), but several metrics deviate: passive_voice (19, P90), nominalization (31, BEYOND_P90), nouns (229, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (134, P90), and long_words (225, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the draft is more noun‑heavy and uses more passive and complex language than typical Cochrane PLS texts, supporting the need for clearer, more active, and concise phrasing."
