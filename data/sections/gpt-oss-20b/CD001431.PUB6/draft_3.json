  "draft": "Do decision aids (tools that explain health options and help you choose) help adults make better treatment or screening choices?\n\nKey messages\n- Decision aids probably help more adults choose options that match their values, increase knowledge, improve risk understanding and reduce uncertainty, with no extra harms.\n- Using decision aids adds little or no time to appointments; if used during the visit they add only about one to two minutes.\n- Future research should examine long‑term effects on health outcomes, costs and include diverse populations.\n\nWhy do many adults need help when choosing health treatments or screening tests?\nEvery day adults must decide whether to start a new medicine, have a cancer screening test, begin mental‑health therapy, or undergo surgery such as joint replacement. Each option has benefits, possible harms and uncertainties. Most people receive only brief information or a short talk with their doctor, which may not clearly explain the trade‑offs or help them think about what matters most to them. When patients do not fully understand the options or cannot match their personal values (what they consider important) with a choice, they may feel uncertain, make a decision that does not reflect their preferences, or later regret it. Patient decision aids are tools that lay out the decision, give evidence‑based facts about benefits and harms, and include exercises to help people clarify their own values.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about these decision‑making tools?\nWe wanted to know whether patient decision aids improve the decision‑making process for adults facing treatment or screening choices. Specifically we asked if the tools help people: (1) gain more knowledge about their options, (2) understand their personal risk more accurately, (3) feel better informed and clear about what matters to them, (4) take a more active role in discussions with their clinician, and (5) make choices that match their informed values. We also looked at whether the aids affect decision regret, appointment length and any potential harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases and grey literature for randomized controlled trials that compared patient decision aids with usual care (general information, risk assessments, guideline summaries, unrelated placebo information or no intervention). Two reviewers independently screened citations, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled results using standard statistical methods and rated the certainty of the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 209 trials involving 107,698 adults who faced a wide range of health decisions, such as cardiovascular treatments, cancer screening and treatment, mental‑health therapy and joint‑replacement surgery. The trials compared decision aids that present the choice, give evidence‑based information and help clarify values with usual care. The studies covered 71 different decisions.\n\nWhat impact do decision aids have?\nDecision aids probably increase the proportion of people who make choices that match their informed values. They also produce large increases in knowledge about health options and in the accuracy of risk understanding. Decision aids reduce feelings of being uninformed, lower uncertainty about personal values and decrease the number of people who let clinicians make the decision for them. They make little or no difference to decision‑regarding regret. When used before a consultation they make little or no difference to appointment length; when used during a consultation they add about one to two minutes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Some participants knew which treatment they received, and not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, which may affect the certainty of the findings.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, question‑style headings, factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but it contains several clarity problems that could confuse readers. 1) A long, noun‑heavy sentence makes the key result hard to follow. 2) The phrase “informed values” is jargon that isn’t explained for a lay audience. 3) The sentence about appointment length is wordy and passive‑sounding, reducing immediacy. These issues, together with the high counts of nominalisations (25) and nouns (190) shown in the PLS evaluation, mean the summary is not yet clear enough for patients.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Problematic sentence: \"We included 209 trials involving 107,698 adults who faced a wide range of health treatment or screening decisions, such as cardiovascular treatments, cancer screening and treatment, mental‑health therapy and joint‑replacement surgery.\"\n   Why it’s an issue: The sentence is long (>30 words) and packed with nouns, making it hard to process.\n   Suggested rewrite: \"We included 209 trials with 107,698 adults. They were making decisions about many health issues, including heart treatments, cancer screening or treatment, mental‑health therapy, and joint‑replacement surgery.\"\n\n2. Problematic phrase: \"make choices that match the informed values\"\n   Why it’s an issue: \"Informed values\" is technical jargon that patients may not understand.\n   Suggested rewrite: \"make choices that reflect what matters most to them after receiving clear information.\"\n\n3. Problematic sentence: \"When used before a consultation they make little or no difference to appointment length; when used during a consultation they add about one to two minutes.\"\n   Why it’s an issue: The construction is passive‑like and combines two ideas in one sentence, reducing clarity.\n   Suggested rewrite: \"If the decision aid is reviewed before the appointment, it does not change how long the visit lasts. If it is used during the visit, it adds only about one to two minutes.\"\n\nThese rewrites reduce sentence length, replace jargon with plain language, and shift to active voice, aligning the text with the style guide and improving readability.\n\nMetrics support: The evaluation shows a high nominalisation count (25, beyond the typical median) and a high noun count (190). Reducing nominalisations and nouns, as suggested, will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most PLS norms (e.g., low passive voice, good readability scores) but deviates on nominalisations, noun density, SMOG index, and complex‑word counts (all in the P90 range). These metrics indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical PLS, supporting the need to simplify sentences and replace jargon."
