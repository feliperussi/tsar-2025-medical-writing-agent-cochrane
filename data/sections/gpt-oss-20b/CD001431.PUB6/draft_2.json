  "draft": "Do decision aids (tools that explain health options and help you choose) help adults make better treatment or screening choices?\n\nKey messages\n- Decision aids (tools that explain health options and help you choose) probably help more adults make choices that match their personal values, increase their knowledge about options, improve understanding of risks, reduce feelings of uncertainty, and encourage a more active role in decision‑making; there was no evidence of increased regret or other harms, and the overall evidence is fairly reliable.\n- Using decision aids does not seem to lengthen the total time spent with clinicians when they are reviewed before the appointment, and only adds a short amount of time if used during the visit, indicating they are practical to incorporate into routine care.\n- Future research should examine longer‑term effects such as whether people follow through with the choices they make, the impact on health outcomes and costs, and should include diverse populations while improving study reporting to strengthen the evidence base.\n\nWhy do many adults need help when choosing health treatments or screening tests?\nEvery day, adults are asked to decide whether to start a new medicine, have a screening test for cancer, begin therapy for mental health, or undergo surgery such as a joint replacement. These choices can be confusing because each option has its own benefits, possible harms, and uncertainties. Most people receive only general information or a brief talk with their doctor, which may not clearly explain the trade‑offs or help them think about what matters most to them. When patients do not fully understand the options or cannot match their personal values (what they consider important) with the choice, they may feel uncertain, make a decision that does not reflect their preferences, or later regret the decision. Tools called \"patient decision aids\" are designed to fill this gap: they lay out the decision clearly, give evidence‑based facts about benefits and risks, and include exercises to help people clarify their own values.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about these decision‑making tools?\nThe review authors set out to determine whether patient decision aids actually improve the decision‑making process for adults facing treatment or screening choices. Specifically, they wanted to know if these tools help people: (1) gain more knowledge about their options, (2) understand their personal risk more accurately, (3) feel better informed and clear about what matters to them, (4) take a more active role in discussions with their clinician, and (5) make choices that match their informed values. They also examined whether using decision aids affected other outcomes such as decision regret, the length of medical appointments, and any potential harms.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies evaluating patient decision aids for treatment or screening decisions, combined their results, and assessed confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 209 randomized controlled trials involving 107,698 adult participants who faced a wide range of health treatment or screening decisions. The trials compared patient decision aids—tools that present the decision, give evidence‑based information about options and their benefits and harms, and help clarify personal or family values—with usual care (which could be general information, risk assessments, guideline summaries, unrelated placebo information, or no intervention). The studies covered 71 different decisions across areas such as cardiovascular treatments, cancer screening and treatment, mental‑health treatment, and joint‑replacement surgery. The abstract does not report follow‑up length, funding sources, participant demographics (age, gender, disease severity), or the countries where the trials were conducted.\n\nMain results: Impact of patient decision aids\nPatient decision aids probably produce a large increase in the proportion of people who make choices that match their informed values. They also cause a large increase in knowledge about health options and in the accuracy of risk understanding. Decision aids reduce feelings of being uninformed, lower uncertainty about personal values, and decrease the number of people who let clinicians make the decision for them. They make little or no difference to decision‑making regret. Using decision aids before a consultation makes little or no difference to appointment length, while using them during a consultation adds about one to two minutes.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check: several section subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Methods\", \"Main results: Impact of patient decision aids\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement that subheadings be question‑style. Additionally, the text contains a few clarity problems that would hinder patient understanding:\n1. Long, dense sentences (e.g., the opening key‑message sentence) exceed 30 words and make the main findings hard to follow.\n2. Excessive noun‑heavy phrasing and nominalisations (e.g., \"Patient decision aids probably produce a large increase in the proportion of people who make choices that match their informed values.\") reduce readability.\n3. Passive constructions and missing pronouns obscure who performed actions (e.g., \"The review included 209 randomized controlled trials…\" rather than \"We included…\").\nSuggested rewrites are provided below. Metrics support these observations: words_per_sentence = 27.25 (P90), nominalization = 30 (BEYOND_P90), nouns = 233 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words = 148 (BEYOND_P90), indicating the draft is more complex and noun‑heavy than typical PLS texts.\n\nTop improvements:\n- Re‑phrase subheadings as questions (e.g., change \"Methods\" to \"How did we find the evidence?\" and \"Limitations\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\").\n- Shorten the first key‑message sentence to under 20 words and use active voice.\n- Replace nominalised phrases with active verbs and reduce noun clusters.\n- Convert passive statements to active voice and add first‑person plural pronouns where appropriate.\n- Break up long paragraphs and ensure bullet points start with a dash.\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits but deviates on several readability metrics: words_per_sentence (27.25, P90) is higher than typical; nominalization (30, BEYOND_P90), nouns (233, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (148, BEYOND_P90), and long_words (232, BEYOND_P90) are all far above median values, indicating overly complex, noun‑heavy prose. Active_voice and pronoun use are good (P75), but the high passive_voice count (11, P50) and long sentences contribute to reduced clarity."
