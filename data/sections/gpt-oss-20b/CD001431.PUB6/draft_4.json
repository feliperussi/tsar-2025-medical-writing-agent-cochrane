  "draft": "Do decision aids (tools that explain health options and help you choose) help adults make better treatment or screening choices?\n\nKey messages\n– Decision aids probably help more adults choose options that reflect what matters most to them after receiving clear information, increase knowledge, improve understanding of risks, reduce uncertainty and encourage an active role in decision‑making; no extra harms were found.  \n– Reviewing a decision aid before the appointment does not lengthen the visit, and using it during the visit adds only about one to two minutes.  \n– Future research should look at long‑term effects on health outcomes, costs and adherence, and should include more diverse populations.\n\nWhy do many adults need help when choosing health treatments or screening tests?  \nEvery day adults must decide whether to start a new medicine, have a cancer screening test, begin mental‑health therapy, or undergo surgery such as joint replacement. Each option has benefits, possible harms and uncertainties. Most people receive only brief information or a short talk with their doctor, which may not clearly explain the trade‑offs or help them think about what matters most to them. When patients do not fully understand the options or cannot match their personal values (what they consider important) with a choice, they may feel uncertain, make a or b decisions that do not reflect their preferences, or later regret the decision. Patient decision aids are tools that lay out the decision, give evidence‑based facts about benefits and harms, and include exercises to help people clarify their own values.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about these decision‑making tools?  \nWe wanted to know whether patient decision aids improve the decision‑making process for adults facing treatment or screening choices. Specifically we asked whether the tools help people: (1) gain more knowledge about their options, (2) understand their personal risk more accurately, (3) feel better informed and clear about what matters to them, (4) take a more active role in discussions with their clinician, and (5) make choices that reflect what matters most to them after receiving clear information. We also examined whether the aids affect decision regret, appointment length and any potential harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases and grey literature for randomized controlled trials that compared patient decision aids with usual care (general information, risk assessments, guideline summaries, unrelated placebo information or no intervention). Two reviewers independently screened citations, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled results using standard statistical methods and rated the certainty of the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 209 trials with 107,698 adults. They were making decisions about many health issues, including heart treatments, cancer screening or treatment, mental‑health therapy, and joint‑replacement surgery. The trials compared decision aids that present the choice, give evidence‑based information and help clarify values with usual care. The studies covered 71 different decisions.\n\nWhat impact do decision aids have?  \nDecision aids probably increase the proportion of people who make choices that reflect what matters most to them after receiving clear information. They also produce large increases in knowledge about health options and in the accuracy of risk understanding. Decision aids reduce feelings of being uninformed, lower uncertainty about personal values and decrease the number of people who let clinicians make the decision for them. They make little or no difference to decision‑regret. If the decision aid is reviewed before the appointment, it does not change how long the visit lasts. If it is used during the visit, it adds only about one to two minutes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. In many studies participants knew which intervention they received, and not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, which may affect certainty.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review  updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to March 2022.",
