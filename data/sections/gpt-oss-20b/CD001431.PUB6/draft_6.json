  "draft": "Do decision aids (tools that explain health options and help you choose) help adults make better treatment or screening choices?\n\nKey messages\n– Decision aids probably help more adults choose options that match what matters most to them, increase knowledge, improve understanding of risks, reduce uncertainty, and encourage an active role in decision‑making; no extra harms were found and the evidence is fairly reliable.  \n– Reviewing a decision aid before an appointment does not lengthen the visit, and using it during the visit adds only about one to two minutes.  \n– Future research should look at long‑term effects on health outcomes, costs, and adherence, and should include more diverse populations.\n\nWhy do many adults need help when choosing health treatments or screening tests?  \nEvery day adults must decide whether to start a new medicine, have a cancer screening test, begin mental‑health therapy, or undergo surgery such as joint replacement. Each option has benefits, possible harms, and uncertainties. Most people only get a brief talk with their doctor. This often does not explain the trade‑offs or help them think about what matters most to them. When patients do not fully understand the options or cannot match their personal values (what they consider important) with a choice, they may feel uncertain, make a decision that does not reflect their preferences, or later regret it. Patient decision aids are tools that lay out the decision, give evidence‑based facts about benefits and harms, and include exercises to help people understand their own values.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about these decision‑making tools?  \nWe wanted to know whether patient decision aids improve the decision‑making process for adults facing treatment or screening choices. Specifically we asked if the tools help people: (1) gain more knowledge about their options, (2) understand their personal risk more accurately (risk perceptions = how likely they think they are to develop a health problem), (3) feel better informed and clear about what matters to them, (4) take a more active role in discussions with their clinician, and (5) make choices that match their informed values. We also examined whether the aids affect decision regret (how much they wish they had chosen differently later), appointment length, and any potential harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases and grey literature for randomized controlled trials that compared patient decision aids with usual care (general information, risk assessments, guideline summaries, unrelated placebo information, or no intervention). Two reviewers independently screened citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We pooled results using standard statistical methods and rated the certainty of the evidence, and rated the certainty of the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 209 trials involving 107,698 adults. The decision aids covered 71 different choices, including heart treatments, cancer screening or treatment, mental‑health therapy, and joint‑replacement surgery. Compared with usual care, decision aids probably help more people choose options that fit what matters most to them. They also produce large increases in knowledge about health options and in the accuracy of risk understanding. Decision aids reduce feelings of being uninformed, lower uncertainty about personal values, and decrease the number of people who let clinicians make the decision for them. They make little or no difference to decision regret. Reviewing a decision aid before a consultation does not change how long the visit lasts. Using a decision aid during the consultation adds about one to two minutes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate confidence in these findings, meaning we are fairly sure they are reliable but some uncertainty remains. Many studies did not blind participants, and not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, which may affect certainty.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to March 2022.",

In addition, several clarity problems could confuse readers:\n1. **Overly long, compound sentence in Key messages** – \"Decision aids probably help more adults choose options that match what matters most to them, increase knowledge, improve understanding of risks, reduce uncertainty, and encourage an active role in decision‑making; no extra harms were found and the evidence is fairly reliable.\" This packs many ideas into one sentence, making it hard to follow.\n   *Rewrite:* \"Decision aids probably help more adults choose options that match what matters most to them. They increase knowledge, improve understanding of risks, reduce uncertainty, and encourage an active role in decision‑making. No extra harms were found, and the evidence is fairly reliable.\"\n2. **Jargon‑heavy sentence in the introduction** – \"When patients do not fully understand the options or cannot match their personal values (what they consider important) with a choice, they may feel uncertain, make a decision that does not reflect their preferences, or later regret it.\" The phrase \"match their personal values\" and the nested clause are dense.\n   *Rewrite:* \"When patients do not fully understand the options or cannot see how the choices fit with what matters to them, they may feel uncertain, make a decision that does not reflect their preferences, or later regret it.\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy phrasing throughout (e.g., \"the decision‑making process\", \"the evidence is fairly reliable\")** contributes to high noun and nominalisation counts (188 nouns, 22 nominalisations, well above median). Replace nouns with active verbs where possible.\n   *Example rewrite:* \"We found that decision aids improve the way people make decisions and that the evidence is reliable.\"\n4. **Complex and long words** (125 complex words, 187 long words, 280 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words) raise the SMOG (14) and readability scores. Simplify terms such as \"congruent\" → \"match\", \"adverse outcomes\" → \"harms\", \"utilize\" → \"use\".\n5. **Missing question‑style heading for Key messages** – change the heading to a question, e.g., \"What are the main messages?\" to comply with the style guide.\n\nThese issues are reflected in the metric analysis: nominalisations (22, beyond P90), nouns (188, beyond P90), SMOG index (14, beyond P90), complex words (125, beyond P90), long words (187, beyond P90), and Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (280, beyond P90) all exceed typical PLS ranges, indicating the draft is overly noun‑ and word‑heavy. Reducing these will improve readability and align the text with Cochrane PLS standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate overall conformity but highlights several deviations: nominalisations (22, beyond P90), nouns (188, beyond P90), SMOG index (14, beyond P90), complex words (125, beyond P90), long words (187, beyond P90), and Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (280, beyond P90). These suggest the draft is more noun‑ and word‑heavy than typical PLS texts, contributing to higher reading grade levels and lower ease scores."
