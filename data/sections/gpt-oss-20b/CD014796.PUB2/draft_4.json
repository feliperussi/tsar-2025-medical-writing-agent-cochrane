  "draft": "What do patients, providers and policymakers think influences the planning, delivery and use of general health checks?\n\nKey messages  \n– Patients say health checks can motivate healthier habits and give reassurance, but fear bad results, worry about treatment costs and sometimes prefer to wait for symptoms, which can lower attendance.  \n– Providers say skilled, culturally competent staff and clear invitation and information systems help attendance, yet they face barriers such as competing curative duties, staff shortages, limited resources and reimbursement problems.  \n– Policymakers say a supportive political climate and backing from multiple stakeholders are needed to establish health‑check services, and no direct harmful effects of the checks themselves were reported.\n\nWhy are general health checks offered and what is the problem?  \nGeneral health checks are routine appointments for people who feel well. During the visit they can have a series of screening tests—such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar and cancer screens—to spot health problems early. The hope is that early detection and advice will help people change risky habits and reduce illness and death in the whole population. However, a 2019 Cochrane review found that these checks have little or no effect on the most important outcomes, such as overall mortality, cancer rates or heart disease. In other words, even though the checks are popular, the evidence suggests they may not deliver the big health benefits they promise.\n\nWhat do we need to learn about commissioning, delivery and uptake?  \nWe want to hear from three groups: (1) the people who decide whether to fund or organise the checks (called “commissioning”), (2) the health‑care professionals who actually run the checks (the “delivery” side), and (3) the members of the public who choose to attend or not attend (the “uptake” side). By analysing qualitative studies—research that records opinions, feelings and lived experiences—we aim to find what helps or hinders each step. This human‑focused insight will complement the earlier finding that the checks have limited clinical impact and may point to ways to make the service more useful or better targeted.\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies on stakeholder views of commissioning, delivery and uptake of general health checks. We combined the findings into themes using a method called framework synthesis (grouping similar ideas together). We also rated how much we can trust each finding with the GRADE‑CERQual approach, a tool that shows the confidence level of qualitative evidence. Our searches covered studies published up to August 2022.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 146 qualitative studies and analysed a purposively selected sample of 36 studies. Most studies came from high‑income European countries; about one‑third were from middle‑income regions in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia and Latin America. The research was carried out in a variety of settings: 16 studies were in primary or community health‑care centres, four in workplaces and four in community settings. The studies explored three stakeholder groups: clients or potential clients (25 studies), health‑care providers (15 studies) and health‑care managers or commissioners (9 studies). All studies examined health checks that screened for at least two diseases or risk factors.\n\nWhat are the main results about motivation, reassurance and barriers?  \n– Clients said health checks can increase their motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles and can give them reassurance about their health status.  \n– Clients who fear negative results or who rely on symptom‑based care are less likely to attend.  \n– Skilled and culturally competent providers can increase client participation.  \n– Time pressures, staff shortages and limited resources can reduce the delivery of health checks.  \n– Clear information, invitation systems and education can raise awareness and improve uptake.  \nOverall, health checks may shape how people view prevention and influence their decision to attend.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence in many findings because the original studies were small, used different methods and often involved participants who knew which intervention they received. These factors limit how strongly we can rely on the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence reflects searches up to August 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?  \nEven though quantitative studies show little impact on mortality, patients, providers and policymakers still consider health checks popular and useful, especially when they offer a comprehensive set of tests and clear explanations of results. To change or reduce these services we will need alternatives that address the motivations and concerns identified here, and we need more research on how cultural, social and policy contexts shape uptake and commissioning decisions.",

This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement for subheadings. Additionally, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Long, dense sentence** – \"We want to hear from three groups: (1) the people who decide whether to fund or organise the checks (called “commissioning”), (2) the health‑care professionals who actually run the checks (the “delivery” side), and (3) the members of the public who choose to attend or not attend (the “uptake” side).\" This sentence exceeds 30 words and packs three concepts together, making it hard to follow. *Rewrite*: \"We want to hear from three groups: (1) people who decide whether to fund or organise the checks (called “commissioning”); (2) health‑care professionals who run the checks (“delivery”); and (3) members of the public who choose to attend or not attend (“uptake”).\"\n2. **Unexplained jargon** – the term “framework synthesis” appears in the Methods section without any definition, leaving lay readers unsure what it means. *Rewrite*: \"We combined the findings using a method called framework synthesis, which groups similar ideas together to create clear themes.\"\n3. **Nominalisation and noun‑heavy phrasing** – the draft contains many noun‑based constructions (e.g., “the evidence reflects searches up to August 2022”, “the evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search”). This makes sentences feel abstract. *Rewrite*: \"We searched studies up to August 2022, so the evidence is current as of that date.\"\n4. **Key messages heading not a question** – change to a question format, e.g., \"What are the main messages from patients, providers and policymakers?\"\n5. **Passive‑voice‑like wording** – \"The evidence reflects searches up to August 2022\" can be made more active. *Rewrite*: \"We searched studies up to August 2022.\"\n\nThese changes address the most confusing elements and bring the text in line with the style guide.\n\n**Metrics support**: The PLS evaluation shows unusually high nominalisation (30, beyond P90) and noun count (237, beyond P90), indicating the draft is noun‑heavy. Complex‑word counts (156) and long‑word counts (246) are also far above typical ranges, confirming the need to simplify wording and reduce technical jargon. Active‑voice count is good (98, P75), but the identified passive‑like constructions still affect readability.\n\nOverall, because the subheading format requirement is not met and several clarity issues remain, the draft cannot be approved in its current form.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and has good active‑voice (98, P75) and readability scores (FRE 49, P75). However, it deviates strongly on nominalisation (30, BEYOND_P90), noun count (237, BEYOND_P90), SMOG (15.3, BEYOND_P90), complex words (156, BEYOND_P90) and long words (246, BEYOND_P90). These metrics indicate the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many complex, long words, which aligns with the editorial suggestions to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
