  "draft": "What do patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers think influences the planning, delivery, and use of general health checks (comprehensive health screenings)?\n\nKey messages\n– Patients say health checks motivate them to adopt healthier habits and give reassurance, but fear bad results, treatment costs, and rely on symptom‑based care, which can lower attendance.  \n– Providers stress the need for skilled, culturally competent staff and clear invitation and information systems; they face barriers such as competing curative duties, staff shortages, limited resources, and reimbursement issues.  \n– Policymakers note that a supportive political climate and backing from multiple stakeholders are important for establishing health‑check services, and no direct harmful effects of the checks themselves were reported.\n\nWhy are general health checks offered and what is the problem?  \nGeneral health checks are routine appointments where people who feel well receive a series of screening tests (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and cancer screens) to spot health problems early. The hope is that early detection and advice will help people change risky habits and reduce illness and death in the whole population. However, a large 2019 Cochrane review found that these checks have little or no effect on the most important outcomes, such as overall mortality, cancer rates, or heart disease. In other words, although the checks are popular, the evidence suggests they may not deliver the big health benefits they promise.\n\nWhat do we need to learn about commissioning, delivery, and uptake?  \nWe want to understand the views and experiences of three groups: (1) those who decide whether to fund or organise the checks (commissioning), (2) the health‑care professionals who actually run the checks (delivery), and (3) members of the public who choose to attend or not attend (uptake). By analysing qualitative studies—research that records people’s opinions, feelings, and lived experiences—we aim to find what helps or hinders each step. This insight will complement the earlier finding that the checks have limited clinical impact and may point to ways to make the service more useful or better targeted.\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and citation lists for qualitative studies that explored stakeholder views of commissioning, delivery, and uptake of general health checks. We combined the findings using a framework synthesis and assessed our confidence in each finding with the GRADE‑CERQual approach (a method for judging how much we can trust qualitative evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 146 qualitative studies and analysed a purposively selected sample of 36 studies. Most studies were from high‑income European countries; about one‑third were from middle‑income regions in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The studies were conducted in primary or community health‑care centres (16), workplaces (4), and broader community settings (4). They explored three stakeholder groups: clients or potential clients (25 studies), health‑care providers (15 studies), and health‑care managers or commissioners (9 studies). All studies examined health checks that screened for at least two diseases or risk factors.\n\nMain results: motivation, reassurance, and barriers  \n– Clients said health checks probably increase their motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles and give them reassurance about their health status.  \n– Clients who fear negative results or who rely on symptom‑based care are probably less likely to attend.  \n– Skilled and culturally competent providers probably increase client participation.  \n– Time pressures, staff shortages, and limited resources probably reduce the delivery of health checks.  \n– Clear information, invitation systems, and education probably raise awareness and uptake.  \n– Overall, health checks may shape how people view prevention and influence their decision to attend.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence in many findings because the original studies were small, used different methods, and participants often knew which intervention they received. These factors limit how strongly we can rely on the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence reflects searches up to August 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?  \nEven though quantitative studies show little impact on mortality, patients, providers, and policymakers still consider health checks popular and useful, especially when they offer a comprehensive set of tests and clear explanations of results. To change or reduce these services, we will need alternatives that address the motivations and concerns identified here, and we need more research on how cultural, social, and policy contexts shape uptake and commissioning decisions.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions. The subheading \"Main results: motivation, reassurance, and barriers\" is a statement, not a question, and should be re‑worded. In addition, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Jargon not explained** – terms like \"commissioning\", \"framework synthesis\" and \"GRADE‑CERQual\" appear without definition, leaving non‑expert readers unsure of their meaning. *Rewrite*: \"Commissioning (deciding whether to fund or organise the checks)\", \"We used a framework synthesis (a method that groups findings into themes)\", \"We assessed confidence in each finding with the GRADE‑CERQual approach (a tool that tells us how much we can trust the evidence)\".\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and citation lists for qualitative studies that explored stakeholder views of commissioning, delivery and uptake of general health checks.\" This 27‑word sentence packs three ideas. *Rewrite*: \"We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies. These studies looked at how different people view the planning, delivery and use of general health checks.\"\n3. **Nominalised, noun‑heavy phrasing** – many sentences start with nouns (e.g., \"The evidence reflects searches up to August 2022.\") which contributes to the high nominalisation count (29, beyond the typical PLS range) and makes the text feel abstract. *Rewrite*: \"We searched for evidence up to August 2022.\"\n4. **Missing question‑style subheading** – the section after \"What did we find?\" should be a question to match the style guide. *Rewrite*: Change \"Main results: motivation, reassurance, and barriers\" to \"What are the main results about motivation, reassurance, and barriers?\"\n5. **Complex words and long words** – the draft contains many polysyllabic and long words (e.g., \"framework synthesis\", \"methodological limitations\", \"comprehensively\"), reflected in the metrics (complex_words = 160, long_words = 246, both far beyond typical PLS ranges). Replacing them with simpler alternatives improves readability. *Example rewrite*: \"We used a simple method to group the findings\" instead of \"We used a framework synthesis approach\".\nThese changes address the most impactful clarity problems and also bring the draft closer to typical PLS metric ranges (reducing nominalisations, nouns, complex and long words).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and shows good active voice (92, P75) and pronoun use (47, P75). However, it deviates strongly on several lexical metrics: nominalisation (29, BEYOND_P90), noun count (231, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15.45, BEYOND_P90), complex words (160, BEYOND_P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (331, BEYOND_P90) and long words (246, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words, which aligns with the identified clarity and style issues."
