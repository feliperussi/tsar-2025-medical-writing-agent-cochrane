  "draft": "\"What do patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers think influences the planning, delivery, and use of general health checks (comprehensive health screenings)?\"\n\nKey messages\n– Patients say health checks motivate them to adopt healthier habits and give reassurance, but fear bad results, worry about treatment costs, and sometimes wait for symptoms, which can lower attendance.  \n– Providers say skilled, culturally competent staff and clear invitation and information systems boost attendance, yet they face barriers such as competing curative duties, staff shortages, limited resources, and reimbursement problems.  \n– Policymakers say a supportive political climate and backing from multiple stakeholders are needed to establish health‑check services, and no direct harmful effects of the checks themselves were reported.\n\nWhy are general health checks offered and what is the problem?  \nGeneral health checks are routine appointments for people who feel well. During the visit we perform screening tests such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar and cancer screens (tests that look for early signs of disease). The aim is to spot problems early, give advice, and encourage lifestyle changes that could reduce illness and death in the whole population. However, a 2019 Cochrane review found that these checks have little or no effect on the most important outcomes, such as overall mortality, cancer rates or heart‑disease rates. In other words, despite their popularity, the evidence suggests they do not deliver the big health benefits they promise.\n\nWhat do we need to learn about how health checks are planned (commissioning), delivered, and taken up by people?  \nWe want to hear from three groups:  \n– those who decide whether to fund or organise the checks (commissioning),  \n– the health‑care professionals who run the checks (delivery), and  \n– members of the public who choose to attend or not attend (uptake).  \nBy analysing qualitative studies – research that records opinions, feelings and lived experiences – we aim to identify what helps or hinders each step. This human‑focused insight can complement the earlier finding that the checks have limited clinical impact.\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies that explored stakeholder views of commissioning, delivery and uptake of general health checks. We brought the findings together by sorting them into common themes (a simple framework). Then we checked how confident we could be in each result using a standard quality‑assessment tool (called GRADE‑CERQual). Our searches covered studies published up to August 2022.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found 146 qualitative studies and carefully chose 36 of them that gave a rich variety of perspectives for detailed analysis. Most studies came from high‑income European countries; about one‑third were from middle‑income regions in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The studies were carried out in 16 primary or community health‑care centres, 4 workplaces, and 4 community settings. They explored three stakeholder groups: clients or potential clients (25 studies), health‑care providers (15 studies) and health‑care managers or commissioners (9 studies). All studies examined health checks that screened for at least two diseases or risk factors.\n\nWhat are the main results about motivation, reassurance and barriers?  \n– Clients said health checks increase motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles and give reassurance about their health status.  \n– Clients who fear negative results or who rely on symptom‑based care are less likely to attend.  \n– Skilled and culturally competent providers increase client participation.  \n– Time pressures, staff shortages and limited resources reduce the delivery of health checks.  \n– Clear information, invitation systems and education raise awareness and improve uptake.  \nOverall, health checks shape how people view prevention and influence their decision to attend.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence in many findings because the original studies were small, used different methods, and often included participants who knew which intervention they received. These factors limit how strongly we can rely on the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched studies up to August 2022, so the evidence is current as of that date.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?  \nQuantitative studies show little impact on mortality, yet patients, providers and policymakers still find health checks popular and useful, especially when they offer a comprehensive set of tests and clear explanations of results. If we want to change or reduce these services, we will need alternatives that answer the motivations and concerns we found. We also need more research on how culture, society and policy affect whether people use health checks and how they are planned.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, subheading format, factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader. \n1. **Overly long bullet sentences** – e.g., “Patients say health checks motivate them to adopt healthier habits and give reassurance, but fear bad results, worry about treatment costs, and sometimes wait for symptoms, which can lower attendance.” This packs multiple ideas into one sentence, making it hard to follow. *Rewrite*: “Patients say health checks motivate them to adopt healthier habits and give reassurance. However, they may fear bad results, worry about treatment costs, or wait for symptoms, which can lower attendance.”\n2. **Unexplained technical term** – the acronym “GRADE‑CERQual” appears in the Methods section without any definition. Readers may not understand what it means. *Rewrite*: “We rated our confidence in each finding using the GRADE‑CERQual approach, a method that assesses how much we can trust the evidence.”\n3. **Noun‑heavy, nominalised phrasing** – e.g., “We have low confidence in many findings because the original studies were small, used different methods, and often included participants who knew which intervention they received.” The sentence is dense and uses abstract nouns (“confidence”, “methods”, “intervention”). *Rewrite*: “We are not very confident in many findings because the original studies were small, used different methods, and participants often knew which check they were getting.”\n4. **Lack of plain‑language explanation for “commissioning”** – the term appears in the heading “What do we need to learn about commissioning, delivery, and uptake?” without a simple definition. *Rewrite*: “What do we need to learn about planning (commissioning), delivering, and using health checks?”\nThese issues are reflected in the metric analysis: the draft shows high nominalisation (28 vs typical <13), many nouns (231 vs typical <116), a high SMOG index (15 vs typical <12), and many complex/long words, all indicating a noun‑heavy, complex style that reduces readability. Reducing nominalisations, breaking long sentences, and explaining technical terms will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights six out‑of‑range metrics: nominalisation (28, BEYOND_P90), nouns (231, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15, BEYOND_P90), complex words (149, BEYOND_P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (328, BEYOND_P90) and long words (243, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many complex words, which aligns with the identified clarity issues."
