  "draft": "What do patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers think influences the planning, sections, and use of general health checks (comprehensive health screenings)?\n\n- Patients, healthcare providers and policymakers say that several factors shape how general health checks (comprehensive health screenings) are planned, delivered and used: patients value the checks for motivation to change lifestyle and for reassurance, but fear bad results, cost of treatment and rely on symptom‑based care which can reduce attendance; providers stress the need for skilled, culturally competent staff and clear invitation and information systems, yet face barriers such as competing curative duties, staff shortages, limited resources and reimbursement issues; policymakers highlight that a supportive political climate and backing from multiple stakeholders are important for establishing these services, and no direct harmful effects of the checks themselves were reported.\n- Even though quantitative studies have shown little impact on mortality, stakeholders across many countries still consider general health checks popular and useful, especially when they offer a comprehensive set of tests and clear explanations of results, indicating that perceived personal and societal benefits drive continued use.\n- More research is needed to clarify why health systems choose to commission these checks, how to design acceptable alternatives before any reduction in service, and how cultural, social and policy contexts influence uptake, because current qualitative evidence is limited in scope and confidence, particularly regarding policy‑level reasons.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy do general health checks get offered and what is the problem?\nGeneral health checks are routine appointments where people who feel well can have a series of screening tests—such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and cancer screens—to spot health problems early. The hope is that early detection and advice will help people change risky habits and reduce illness and death in the whole population. However, a large 2019 review (the Cochrane review) found that these checks have little or no effect on the most important outcomes, such as overall mortality, cancer rates, or heart disease. In other words, even though the checks are popular, the evidence suggests they may not be delivering the big health benefits they promise.\nWhat do we need to learn about commissioning, delivery, and uptake?\nThe reviewers want to understand the views and experiences of three groups of people: (1) those who decide whether to fund or organise the checks (called \"commissioning\"), (2) the health‑care professionals who actually run the checks (the \"delivery\" side), and (3) the members of the public who choose to attend or not attend (the \"uptake\" side). By gathering and analysing qualitative studies—research that records people's opinions, feelings, and lived experiences—they aim to find a way to make the service more useful or better targeted.\n\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies on stakeholder views of commissioning, delivery and uptake of general health checks; we combined their findings using a framework synthesis; and we rated our confidence in each finding with the GRADE‑CERQual approach.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review looked at 146 qualitative studies about people’s views on general health checks. A detailed analysis was done on a selected group of 36 studies. Most of these studies came from high‑income European countries, while about one‑third were from middle‑income regions in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The research was carried out in a variety of settings: 16 studies were in primary or community health‑care centres, four were in workplaces, and four were in broader community environments. The studies explored three groups of stakeholders: clients or potential clients of health checks (25 studies), health‑care providers (15 studies), and health‑care managers or commissioners (9 studies). All studies examined general health checks that screened for at least two diseases or risk factors and did not include comparison groups or control interventions.\nMain results: Motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles\nThe review found that general health checks probably increase clients' motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles. They also probably give people reassurance about their health status. Fear of receiving negative results probably reduces attendance. Having skilled and culturally competent providers probably increases client participation. Time pressures, staff shortages, and limited resources probably reduce the delivery of health checks. Providing clear information, invitation systems, and education probably increases awareness and uptake of health checks. General health checks may influence how people perceive prevention and affect uptake of health checks.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the health checks, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the required subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\" are statements, not questions). This breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text contains several clarity and readability problems that would confuse readers: (1) long, noun‑heavy sentences such as \"What do patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers think influences the planning, sections, and use of general health checks (comprehensive health screenings)?\" – the phrase \"planning, sections, and use\" is unclear and the sentence exceeds 30 words. (2) Excessive nominalisation and noun density (e.g., \"the availability and accessibility of general health checks and awareness systems\"), reflected by the metric showing 31 nominalisations and 264 nouns (far beyond typical PLS ranges). (3) High sentence length (average 26 words, P90) makes the text hard to follow. Suggested rewrites: change subheadings to questions (e.g., \"Why are general health checks offered and what is the problem?\"), break long sentences into shorter active‑voice statements, replace noun‑heavy phrases with verbs (e.g., \"We found that patients value checks because they motivate lifestyle change and provide reassurance\"), and reduce technical jargon where possible. These changes will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns and improve patient‑readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is within the 850‑word limit (806 words) but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: words per sentence (26, P90), nominalizations (31, BEYOND_P90), noun count (264, BEYOND_P90), and readability indices (ARI 16.46, SMOG 16.19, both BEYOND_P90). These indicate overly long, noun‑heavy, and complex sentences, supporting the need for shorter, more active, and less nominalised language."
