  "draft": "What do patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers think influences the planning, delivery, and use of general health checks (comprehensive health screenings)?\n\nKey messages  \n– Patients say health checks motivate healthier habits and give reassurance, but fear bad results, worry about treatment costs, and sometimes wait for symptoms, which can lower attendance.  \n– Providers say skilled, culturally competent staff and clear invitation and information systems boost attendance, yet they face barriers such as competing curative duties, staff shortages, limited resources, and reimbursement problems.  \n– Policymakers say a supportive political climate and backing from multiple stakeholders are needed to establish health‑check services, and no direct harmful effects of the checks themselves were reported.\n\nWhat are general health checks?  \nGeneral health checks are routine appointments for people who feel well. During the visit we perform screening tests such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar and cancer screens (tests that look for early signs of disease). The aim is to spot problems early, give advice, and encourage lifestyle changes that could reduce illness and death in the whole population.\n\nWhy are general health checks offered and what is the problem?  \nWe offer health checks because early detection and advice might help people adopt healthier habits and lower population‑wide disease rates. However, a 2019 Cochrane review found that these checks have little or no effect on the most important outcomes, such as overall mortality, cancer rates or heart‑disease rates. In other words, despite their popularity, the evidence suggests they do not deliver the big health benefits they promise.\n\nWhat do we need to learn about commissioning, delivery, and uptake?  \nWe want to hear from three groups:  \n– those who decide whether to fund or organise the checks (commissioning),  \n– the health‑care professionals who run the checks (delivery), and  \n– members of the public who choose to attend or not attend (uptake).  \nBy analysing qualitative studies – research that records opinions, feelings and lived experiences – we aim to identify what helps or hinders each step. This human‑focused insight can complement the earlier finding that the checks have limited clinical impact.\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies about stakeholder views of commissioning, delivery and uptake of general health checks. Then we used framework synthesis – a method that groups similar ideas – to create clear themes. Finally we rated our confidence in each finding with the GRADE‑CERQual approach (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research). Our searches covered studies published up to August 2022.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 146 qualitative studies and analysed a purposively selected sample of 36 studies. Most studies came from high‑income European countries; about one‑third were from middle‑income regions in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The research took place in primary or community health‑care centres (16 studies), workplaces (4 studies) and broader community settings (4 studies). The studies explored three stakeholder groups: clients or potential clients (25 studies), health‑care providers (15 studies) and health‑care managers or commissioners (9 studies). All studies examined health checks that screened for at least two diseases or risk factors.\n\nWhat are the main results about motivation, reassurance and barriers?  \n– Clients said health checks increase motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles and give reassurance about their health status.  \n– Clients who fear negative results or who rely on symptom‑based care are less likely to attend.  \n– Skilled and culturally competent providers increase client participation.  \n– Time pressures, staff shortages and limited resources reduce the delivery of health checks.  \n– Clear information, invitation systems and education raise awareness and improve uptake.  \nOverall, health checks shape how people view prevention and influence their decision to attend.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany findings have low confidence because the original studies were small, used different methods and often involved participants who knew which intervention they received. These factors limit how strongly we can rely on the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched studies up to August 2022, so the evidence is current as of that date.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?  \nAlthough quantitative studies show little impact on mortality, patients, providers and policymakers still find health checks popular and useful, especially when they offer a comprehensive set of tests and clear explanations of results. To change or reduce these services we will need alternatives that address the motivations and concerns identified here, and we need more research on how cultural, social and policy contexts shape uptake and commissioning decisions.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical check: the subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, which the Master Style Guide requires for all subheadings. This alone prevents approval. In addition, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Key messages\" should be re‑phrased as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\").\n2. **Unexplained technical terms** – terms like “framework synthesis” and “GRADE‑CERQual” appear without plain‑language explanations, leaving non‑expert readers uncertain. Suggest adding brief definitions (e.g., “We used a ‘framework synthesis’, a method that groups similar ideas, and we rated our confidence in the GRADE‑CERQual approach, which tells us how sure we are about the results”).\n3. **Long, dense sentence** – \"We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies about stakeholder views of commissioning, delivery and uptake of general health checks.\" (23 words) could be split for easier reading: \"We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies. These studies explored how stakeholders view the commissioning, delivery and uptake of general health checks.\".\n4. **Passive‑voice‑heavy paragraph** – The limitations paragraph uses a passive construction: \"Many findings have low confidence because the original studies were small, used different methods and often involved participants who knew which intervention they received.\" Re‑write in active voice: \"We have low confidence in many findings because the original studies were small, used different methods, and often included participants who knew which intervention they received.\".\n5. **Bullet‑point consistency** – The “Key messages” section uses a dash list, which is correct, but the list could be introduced with a brief introductory sentence to improve flow (e.g., \"The main messages are:\").\nThese revisions address the most important clarity and style problems and bring the draft into full compliance with the style guide. Metrics support these suggestions: the draft shows a high nominalisation count (32) and many nouns (249), indicating noun‑heavy sentences; the passive‑voice count (8) is at the lower quartile but still present; and the readability indices (FKGL 10.9, SMOG 15.3) are higher than typical PLS ranges, reflecting the need to simplify language and reduce complex words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits and has good active‑voice usage (97 active constructions, P75). However, several metrics deviate strongly: nominalisations (32, BEYOND_P90), noun count (249, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15.3, BEYOND_P90), and complex‑word counts are all far above typical PLS ranges, indicating overly noun‑heavy and complex language. These metric alerts align with the editorial recommendation to reduce nominalisations, simplify wording, and re‑phrase headings as questions."
