  "draft": "\"What do patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers think influences the planning, delivery, and use of general health checks (comprehensive health screenings)?\"\n\nKey messages  \n– Patients say health checks can motivate healthier habits and give reassurance, but fear bad results, worry about treatment costs, and sometimes wait for symptoms, which can lower attendance.  \n– Providers say skilled, culturally competent staff and clear invitation and information systems help attendance, yet they face barriers such as competing curative duties, staff shortages, limited resources, and reimbursement problems.  \n– Policymakers say a supportive political climate and backing from multiple stakeholders are needed to establish health‑check services, and no direct harmful effects of the checks themselves were reported.\n\nWhy are general health checks offered and what is the problem?  \nGeneral health checks are routine appointments for people who feel well. During the visit they can have screening tests – such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and cancer screens – to spot health problems early. The hope is that early detection and advice will help people change risky habits and reduce illness and death in the whole population. However, a 2019 Cochrane review found that these checks have little or no effect on the most important outcomes, such as overall mortality, cancer rates, or heart disease. In other words, even though the checks are popular, the evidence suggests they may not deliver the big health benefits they promise.\n\nWhat do we need to learn about commissioning, delivery, and uptake?  \nWe want to hear from three groups: (1) people who decide whether to fund or organise the checks (called “commissioning”); (2) health‑care professionals who run the checks (“delivery”); and (3) members of the public who choose to attend or not attend (“uptake”). By analysing qualitative studies – research that records opinions, feelings, and lived experiences – we aim to find what helps or hinders each step. This human‑focused insight will complement the earlier finding that the checks have limited clinical impact and may point to ways to make the service more useful or better targeted.\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and citation lists for qualitative studies on stakeholder views of commissioning, delivery, and uptake of general health checks. We combined the findings using a method called framework synthesis, which groups similar ideas together to create clear themes. We then rated our confidence in each finding with the GRADE‑CERQual approach (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research). Our searches covered studies published up to August 2022.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 146 qualitative studies and analysed a purposively selected sample of 36 studies. Most studies came from high‑income European countries; about one‑third were from middle‑income regions in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The research was carried out in a variety of settings: 16 studies were in primary or community health‑care centres, four in workplaces, and four in broader community environments. The studies explored three stakeholder groups: clients or potential clients (25 studies), health‑care providers (15 studies), and health‑care managers or commissioners (9 studies). All studies examined health checks that screened for at least two diseases or risk factors.\n\nWhat are the main results about motivation, reassurance and barriers?  \n– Clients said health checks can increase their motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles and can give them reassurance about their health status.  \n– Clients who fear negative results or who rely on symptom‑based care are less likely to attend.  \n– Skilled and culturally competent providers can increase client participation.  \n– Time pressures, staff shortages, and limited resources can reduce the delivery of health checks.  \n– Clear information, invitation systems, and education can raise awareness and improve uptake.  \nOverall, health checks may shape how people view prevention and influence their decision to attend.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany findings have low confidence because the original studies were small, used different methods, and often involved participants who knew which intervention they received. These factors limit how strongly we can rely on the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched studies up to August 2022, so the evidence is current as of that date.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?  \nEven though quantitative studies show little impact on mortality, patients, providers, and policymakers still consider health checks popular and useful, especially when they offer a comprehensive set of tests and clear explanations of results. To change or reduce these services we will need alternatives that address the motivations and concerns identified here, and we need more research on how cultural, social, and policy contexts shape uptake and commissioning decisions.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions. Several section headings (e.g., \"Key messages\") are not questions, violating the master style guide requirement. Additionally, the text contains many clarity and style issues: long, jargon‑heavy sentences, excessive noun‑heavy phrasing, and passive constructions. Metrics confirm these problems – nominalizations (31, beyond P90), nouns (239, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.4, beyond P90), and many complex/long words, making the text harder to read despite an acceptable Flesch reading ease score. The following specific improvements are recommended.\n\n1. Problematic subheading: \"Key messages\"\n   - Why problematic: Not phrased as a question, breaching the style guide.\n   - Suggested rewrite: \"What are the key messages?\"\n\n2. Long, jargon‑filled sentence: \"General health checks are routine appointments for people who feel well. During the visit they can have screening tests – such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and cancer screens – to spot health problems early.\"\n   - Why problematic: Vague phrasing and dense list.\n   - Suggested rewrite: \"What are general health checks? They are routine appointments for people who feel well, during which tests such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar and cancer screens are done to spot problems early.\"\n\n3. Passive voice and noun‑heavy phrasing: \"We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and citation lists for qualitative studies on stakeholder views of commissioning, delivery and uptake of general health checks. We combined the findings using a method called framework synthesis, which groups similar ideas together to create clear themes.\"\n   - Why problematic: Long sentence with abstract nouns.\n   - Suggested rewrite: \"We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies about stakeholder views. Then we used framework synthesis – a method that groups similar ideas – to create clear themes.\"\n\n4. Overly complex sentence: \"Even though quantitative studies show little impact on mortality, patients, providers, and policymakers still consider health checks popular and useful, especially when they offer a comprehensive set of tests and clear explanations of results.\"\n   - Why problematic: 30‑word sentence with several clauses.\n   - Suggested rewrite: \"What does this mean for practice? Although quantitative studies show little impact on mortality, patients, providers and policymakers still find health checks popular and useful. They value the comprehensive tests and clear explanations of results.\"\n\n5. Excessive nominalisation: \"the availability and accessibility of general health checks and awareness systems\"\n   - Why problematic: Uses abstract nouns instead of verbs.\n   - Suggested rewrite: \"When health checks are easy to find and when people are aware of them, attendance improves.\"\n\nThese rewrites address the subheading format issue, shorten long sentences, replace passive and noun‑heavy constructions with active verbs, and reduce jargon, aligning the draft with the master style guide and improving readability. The metrics support these changes: nominalisations will drop below the P90 threshold, noun count will be reduced, and complex/long words will be minimized, moving the draft into the typical PLS percentile ranges. Because the subheading requirement is not met and several clarity issues remain, the draft cannot be approved in its current form.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (777 words) and has good active‑voice (96, P75) and pronoun use (48, P75). However, it deviates strongly on nominalisation (31, BEYOND_P90), noun count (239, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15.4, BEYOND_P90), complex words (155, BEYOND_P90) and long words (252, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex words, reducing readability despite a decent Flesch reading ease (48.5, P75). Reducing nominalisations, nouns, and complex/long words will bring the draft into the typical PLS range."
