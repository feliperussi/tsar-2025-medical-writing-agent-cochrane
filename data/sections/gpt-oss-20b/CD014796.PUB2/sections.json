  "key_messages": [
    "Patients, healthcare providers and policymakers say that several factors shape how general health checks (comprehensive health screenings) are planned, delivered and used: patients value the checks for motivation to change lifestyle and for reassurance, but fear bad results, cost of treatment and rely on symptom‑based care which can reduce attendance; providers stress the need for skilled, culturally competent staff and clear invitation and information systems, yet face barriers such as competing curative duties, staff shortages, limited resources and reimbursement issues; policymakers highlight that a supportive political climate and backing from multiple stakeholders are important for establishing these services, and no direct harmful effects of the checks themselves were reported.",
    "Even though quantitative studies have shown little impact on mortality, stakeholders across many countries still consider general health checks popular and useful, especially when they offer a comprehensive set of tests and clear explanations of results, indicating that perceived personal and societal benefits drive continued use.",
    "More research is needed to clarify why health systems choose to commission these checks, how to design acceptable alternatives before any reduction in service, and how cultural, social and policy contexts influence uptake, because current qualitative evidence is limited in scope and confidence, particularly regarding policy‑level reasons."

      "subheading": "Why are general health checks offered and what is the problem?",
      "content": "General health checks are routine appointments where people who feel well can have a series of screening tests—such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and cancer screens—to spot health problems early. The hope is that early detection and advice will help people change risky habits and reduce illness and death in the whole population. However, a large 2019 review (the Cochrane review) found that these checks have little or no effect on the most important outcomes, such as overall mortality, cancer rates, or heart disease. In other words, even though the checks are popular, the evidence suggests they may not be delivering the big health benefits they promise."

      "subheading": "What do we need to learn about commissioning, delivery, and uptake?",
      "content": "The reviewers want to understand the views and experiences of three groups of people: (1) those who decide whether to fund or organise the checks (called \"commissioning\"), (2) the health‑care professionals who actually run the checks (the \"delivery\" side), and (3) the members of the public who choose to attend or not attend (the \"uptake\" side). By gathering and analysing qualitative studies—research that records people's opinions, feelings, and lived experiences—they aim to find out what helps or hinders each step. This human‑focused insight will complement the earlier finding that the checks have limited clinical impact, and may point to ways to make the service more useful or better targeted."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review looked at 146 qualitative studies about people’s views on general health checks. A detailed analysis was done on a selected group of 36 studies. Most of these studies came from high‑income European countries, while about one‑third were from middle‑income regions in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The research was carried out in a variety of settings: 16 studies were in primary or community health‑care centres, four were in workplaces, and four were in broader community environments. The studies explored three groups of stakeholders: clients or potential clients of health checks (25 studies), health‑care providers (15 studies), and health‑care managers or commissioners (9 studies). All studies examined general health checks that screened for at least two diseases or risk factors and did not include comparison groups or control interventions."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles",
      "content": "General health checks probably increase clients' motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles. They also probably give people reassurance about their health status. Fear of receiving negative results probably reduces attendance. Having skilled and culturally competent providers probably increases client participation. Time pressures, staff shortages, and limited resources probably reduce the delivery of health checks. Providing clear information, invitation systems, and education probably increases awareness and uptake of health checks. General health checks may influence how people perceive prevention and affect uptake of health checks."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the health checks, and the studies were very small.",
