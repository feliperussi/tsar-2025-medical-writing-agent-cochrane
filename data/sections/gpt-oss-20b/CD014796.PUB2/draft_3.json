  "draft": "What do patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers think influences the planning, delivery, and use of general health checks (comprehensive health screenings)?\n\nKey messages\n– Patients say health checks motivate them to adopt healthier habits and give reassurance, but fear bad results, worry about treatment costs, and sometimes rely on symptom‑based care, which can lower attendance.  \n– Providers stress the need for skilled, culturally competent staff and clear invitation and information systems; they face barriers such as competing curative duties, staff shortages, limited resources, and reimbursement issues.  \n– Policymakers note that a supportive political climate and backing from multiple stakeholders are important for establishing health‑check services, and no direct harmful effects of the checks themselves were reported.\n\nWhy are general health checks offered and what is the problem?  \nGeneral health checks are routine appointments where people who feel well can have a series of screening tests—such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and cancer screens—to spot health problems early. The hope is that early detection and advice will help people change risky habits and reduce illness and death in the whole population. However, a large 2019 Cochrane review found that these checks have little or no effect on the most important outcomes, such as overall mortality, cancer rates, or heart disease. In other words, even though the checks are popular, the evidence suggests they may not deliver the big health benefits they promise.\n\nWhat do we need to learn about commissioning, delivery, and uptake?  \nWe want to understand three groups: (1) those who decide whether to fund or organise the checks (commissioning), (2) the healthcare professionals who actually run the checks (delivery), and (3) members of the public who choose to attend or not attend (uptake). By analysing qualitative studies—research that records people’s opinions, feelings, and lived experiences—we aim to find what helps or hinders each step. This human‑focused insight will complement the earlier finding that the checks have limited clinical impact and may point to ways to make the service more useful or better targeted.\n\nHow did we gather the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and citation lists for qualitative studies. These studies looked at how different people view the planning, delivery and use and use of general health checks. We combined the findings using a simple method that groups results into themes (framework synthesis). We assessed confidence in each finding with the GRADE‑CERQual approach (a tool that tells us how much we can trust the evidence). We searched for evidence up to August 2022.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 146 qualitative studies and analysed a purposively selected sample of 36 studies. Most studies were from high‑income European countries; about one‑third were from middle‑income regions in Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The research took place in primary or community health‑care centres (16 studies), workplaces (4) and broader community settings (4). The studies explored three stakeholder groups: clients or potential clients (25 studies), healthcare providers (15 studies), and healthcare managers or commissioners (9 studies). All studies examined health checks that screened for at least two diseases or risk factors.\n\nWhat are the main results about motivation, reassurance, and barriers?  \n– Clients said health checks probably increase their motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles and probably give them reassurance about their health status.  \n– Clients who fear negative results or who rely on symptom‑based care are probably less likely to attend.  \n– Skilled and culturally competent providers probably increase client participation.  \n– Time pressures, staff shortages and limited resources probably reduce the delivery of health checks.  \n– Clear information, invitation systems and education probably raise awareness and uptake.  \nOverall, health checks may shape how people view prevention and influence their decision to attend.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence in many findings because the original studies were small, used different methods, and participants often knew which intervention they received. These factors limit how strongly we can rely on the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence reflects searches up to August 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean for practice?  \nEven though quantitative studies show little impact on mortality, patients, providers and policymakers still consider health checks popular and useful, especially when they offer a comprehensive set of tests and clear explanations of results. To change or reduce these services we will need alternatives that address the motivations and concerns identified here, and we need more research on how cultural, social and policy contexts shape uptake and commissioning decisions.",

Long sentences are hard to follow and exceed the 30‑word guideline.\n   *Rewrite:* \"General health checks are routine appointments for people who feel well. During the visit they can have a series of screening tests—such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and cancer screens—to spot health problems early.\"\n2. **Unexplained jargon** – terms like *commissioning*, *framework synthesis* and *GRADE‑CERQual* appear without definition, leaving readers unsure of their meaning.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We combined the findings into themes using a method called *framework synthesis* (grouping similar ideas together). We also rated how much we can trust each finding with the *GRADE‑CERQual* approach, a tool that shows the confidence level of qualitative evidence.\"\n3. **Repeated use of “probably”** makes statements sound vague (e.g., \"General health checks probably increase clients' motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles and probably give them reassurance about their health status.\"). Readers may wonder how certain the evidence is.\n   *Rewrite:* \"The evidence suggests that general health checks can increase clients' motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles and can give them reassurance about their health status.\"\n4. **Title is wordy and includes parentheses** – \"What do patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers think influences the planning, delivery, and use of general health checks (comprehensive health screenings)?\" The parentheses add complexity.\n   *Rewrite:* \"What do patients, providers and policymakers think influences the planning, delivery and use of general health checks?\"\n5. **Noun‑heavy sentences** (e.g., \"The research took place in a variety of settings: 16 studies were in primary or community health‑care centres, four were in workplaces, and four were in broader community environments.\") contribute to a dense style.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We found that 16 studies were carried out in primary or community health‑care centres, four in workplaces and four in community settings.\"\nThese issues reduce readability for patients. The PLS evaluation also flags high nominalisation (30 instances) and an excess of nouns (239), confirming the noun‑heavy style. Reducing these will improve clarity and align the summary with typical Cochrane PLS patterns.",
