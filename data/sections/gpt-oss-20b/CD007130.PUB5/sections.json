  "key_messages": [
    "Home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education for heart patients that can be delivered at home, often using telehealth – health services provided by phone or video) works about as well as centre‑based cardiac rehabilitation for people after a heart attack (myocardial infarction), heart procedures (revascularisation) or heart failure, showing similar effects on survival, ability to exercise (exercise capacity) and overall health‑related quality of life; no additional harms were reported.",
    "The two approaches also show similar rates of completing the programme and have comparable costs, although most studies only followed participants for up to a year.",
    "Because most evidence comes from short‑term studies, we need longer‑term research to confirm whether the benefits of home‑based programmes persist over time and to assess safety and effectiveness for other heart conditions."

      "subheading": "Why is cardiac rehabilitation needed after heart problems?",
      "content": "Heart disease such as heart attacks, heart failure, or procedures to open blocked arteries is a leading cause of death. After these events people often feel weaker, have trouble exercising, and are at higher risk of more heart problems. Cardiac rehabilitation is a planned programme that helps patients recover, improve their ability to exercise (called \"exercise capacity\"), and lower the chance of future heart events. Traditionally these programmes are run in hospitals or community centres where patients attend supervised sessions. More recently, programmes that can be done at home – sometimes using video calls or apps (called \"digital\" or \"telehealth\" rehabilitation) – have been introduced to make it easier for people to take part, especially when face‑to‑face visits are difficult."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review compared home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (including any digital or telehealth support) with the usual centre‑based, supervised programmes. The authors wanted to see whether the two approaches differed in terms of: \n- total mortality (the number of people who die), \n- morbidity (the number of people who experience further heart‑related health problems), \n- exercise capacity (how well a person can perform physical activity), \n- health‑related quality of life (how a person feels about their overall health and daily life), and \n- modifiable cardiac risk factors (behavioural or medical factors such as blood pressure or cholesterol that can be changed to lower heart risk)."

      "content": "We searched for studies that compared home‑based (including digital/telehealth) with supervised centre‑based cardiac rehabilitation in adults with heart disease, combined their results on mortality, morbidity, exercise capacity, quality of life and risk factors, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 24 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 3,046 people who had an acute heart attack, had undergone revascularisation, or were living with heart failure. The trials compared supervised centre‑based cardiac rehabilitation programmes (delivered in hospitals, sports or community centres) with home‑based cardiac rehabilitation, which could include digital or telehealth components, both overseen by health‑care professionals. Most studies were short, reporting outcomes up to 12 months; only three provided data beyond that, up to 24 months for quality of life and exercise capacity. The abstract does not give details on funding sources, participants’ age or gender, or the countries where the studies were carried out, and it reports no gaps in the evidence for these interventions, outcomes, or patient groups."

      "content": "Home‑based cardiac rehabilitation may make little to no difference to the risk of death compared with centre‑based programmes."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and the studies were very small.",
