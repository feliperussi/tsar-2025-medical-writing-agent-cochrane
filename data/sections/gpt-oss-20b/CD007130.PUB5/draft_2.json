  "draft": "Is home‑based heart‑rehab (including online video or phone support) as effective as centre‑based heart‑rehab for people after a heart attack, heart surgery or heart failure?\n\nKey messages\n– Home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education that can be delivered at home, often using phone or video calls) works about as well as centre‑based rehabilitation for people after a heart attack (myocardial infarction), and for those who have had procedures to open blocked arteries (revascularisation) or who have heart failure (the heart cannot pump enough blood). It gives similar benefits for survival, ability to exercise (exercise capacity) and overall health‑related quality of life, and no extra harms were reported.  \n– Completion rates and costs are similar for home‑based and centre‑based programmes, although most studies followed participants for only up to 12 months.  \n– Because the evidence is short‑term, we need longer‑term research to confirm whether the benefits of home‑based programmes last and to test safety for other heart conditions.\n\nWhy is cardiac rehabilitation needed after heart problems?  \nHeart disease such as heart attacks, heart failure, or procedures to open blocked arteries is a leading cause of death. After these events people often feel weaker, have trouble exercising, and face a higher risk of further heart problems. Cardiac rehabilitation is a planned programme that helps patients recover, improves their ability to exercise (exercise capacity), and lowers the chance of future heart events. Traditionally the programme is delivered in hospitals or community centres where patients attend supervised sessions. Home‑based programmes, sometimes using video calls or apps (digital or telehealth rehabilitation), have been introduced to make participation easier, especially when face‑to‑face visits are difficult.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nWe compared home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (including any digital or telehealth support) with the usual centre‑based, supervised programmes. We wanted to know whether the two approaches differed in:  \n– total mortality (the number of people who die);  \n– morbidity (the number of people who experience further heart‑related health problems);  \n– exercise capacity (how well a person can perform physical activity);  \n– health‑related quality of life (how a person feels about their overall health and daily life); and  \n– modifiable cardiac risk factors (behavioural or medical factors such as blood pressure or cholesterol that can be changed to lower heart risk).\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major trial databases for randomised controlled trials that compared home‑based with centre‑based cardiac rehabilitation in adults with heart disease. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 24 trials that together enrolled 3 046 participants who had a heart attack, had undergone revascularisation, or were living with heart failure. The two types of programmes gave similar results for survival, exercise capacity, and health‑related quality of life up to 12 months. The risk of death was little‑to‑no different between home‑based and centre‑based rehabilitation. Completion rates and costs were also comparable. Most studies were short‑term; only three reported outcomes beyond 12 months (up to 24 months for quality of life and exercise capacity).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have low confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which programme they received, some trials did not report all outcomes, and many studies were small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to September 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several passages that would likely confuse or frustrate a patient reader:\n1. Overly long, jargon‑heavy sentence in the Key messages – the opening bullet packs multiple concepts, parentheses and technical terms into one run‑on sentence, making it hard to follow.\n2. Passive‑voice constructions that hide who did what – e.g., “The risk of death was little‑to‑no different…”, “The two types of programmes gave similar results…”. This obscures the reviewers’ actions and reduces immediacy.\n3. Unexplained technical terms – phrases such as “modifiable cardiac risk factors” appear without a plain‑language definition, leaving readers unsure what is meant.\nThese issues exceed the threshold of three significant clarity problems, so the PLS cannot be approved in its current form.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n- Quote: \"Home‑based cardiac rehabilitation (a supervised program of exercise and education that can be delivered at home, often using phone or video calls) works about as well as centre‑based rehabilitation for people after a heart attack (myocardial infarction), and for those who have had procedures to open blocked arteries (revascularisation) or who have heart failure (the heart cannot pump enough blood). It gives similar benefits for survival, ability to exercise (exercise capacity) and overall health‑related quality of life, and no extra harms were reported.\"\n  Problem: Sentence is >30 words, contains multiple parentheses and technical terms, making it dense.\n  Rewrite: \"Home‑based cardiac rehabilitation – a supervised program of exercise and education delivered at home, often via phone or video – works just as well as centre‑based rehab for people after a heart attack, after procedures to open blocked arteries, or with heart failure.

Complex‑word counts (154) and long‑word counts (184) are far above median values, contributing to the high SMOG (14.3) and Dale‑Chall (8.3) scores. Reducing passive constructions and simplifying vocabulary will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores within the word limit but shows moderate overall conformity. Key deviations include a high passive‑voice count (33, BEYOND_P90), excessive nominalisations (24, BEYOND_P90), and elevated complexity metrics (SMOG 14.3, Dale‑Chall 8.3, many complex/long words). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and harder to read than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need for the suggested revisions."
