  "draft": "Do personal stress‑reduction programs (individual‑level interventions) reduce work‑related stress in healthcare workers?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Personal stress‑reduction programmes (individual‑level interventions aimed at each healthcare worker) can lower reported stress symptoms in the short‑term (up to three months after the programme ends) and in the medium‑term (up to about a year), but the evidence is uncertain and no data are available on long‑term effects; no harmful effects were reported.\n- Both approaches that help workers focus on their stress (for example, mindfulness) and those that help them focus away from stress (for example, relaxation or exercise) appear to reduce stress, and programmes that combine several techniques (combination interventions) may give a larger short‑term benefit, although the evidence does not clearly show which type works best.\n- Because most studies were small, lacked proper blinding (keeping participants unaware of which group they are in), and did not follow participants for long periods, higher‑quality, larger trials with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm the benefits, explore any possible harms, and determine the effects of interventions that target work‑related risk factors.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nWhy is occupational stress a problem for healthcare workers?\nPeople who work in hospitals, clinics and other health‑care settings often face a mismatch between what their job asks of them, the skills they have, and the support they receive from colleagues and managers. This imbalance can cause work‑related stress, which may develop into burnout (feeling exhausted, detached and ineffective), physical symptoms such as headaches or stomach problems, and can even reduce the quality of care patients receive. While many organisations try to improve working conditions, most stress‑reduction efforts focus on helping the individual – for example, teaching techniques to notice and manage stress, practising relaxation or exercise, or changing personal work habits.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether programmes that target individual health‑care workers can actually lower their stress levels. Specifically, they compared these personal stress‑reduction interventions with doing nothing, waiting for treatment, receiving a placebo, or using a different type of stress‑reduction programme. Their goal was to see which approaches work best, how long any benefit lasts, and whether combining several techniques might be more effective.\n\nMETHODS\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched databases for studies of individual‑level stress‑reduction interventions for healthcare workers compared with no intervention or other approaches, combined the results to assess effects on stress symptoms, and evaluated confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria.\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 117 randomised trials that together involved 11,119 health‑care workers. All the studies tested individual‑level stress‑reduction techniques and compared them with doing nothing, waiting‑list, placebo or other non‑stress‑reduction controls. The interventions fell into four groups: (1) helping people focus on their experience of stress, (2) helping people shift their attention away from stress (for example, relaxation or exercise), (3) trying to change work‑related risk factors at the individual level, and (4) combining two or more of these approaches. The studies reported results up to three months after the programme (short‑term), between three and twelve months (medium‑term) and beyond twelve months (long‑term), although many did not provide long‑term data.\n\nThe evidence suggests that:\n• Focusing on the experience of stress may give a small short‑term reduction in stress symptoms (about 5 points lower on a 0‑to‑54 scale), but the certainty of this effect is low.\n• The same approach may also produce a small benefit in the medium term, again with uncertain evidence.\n• Shifting attention away from stress (e.g., relaxation, exercise) appears to lead to a moderate short‑term reduction in stress symptoms (around 7 points lower), though we are not sure how reliable this finding is.\n• In the medium term, this “away‑from‑stress” approach may give a small reduction, but the evidence remains uncertain.\n• Combining different individual‑level techniques may achieve a moderate short‑term reduction in stress symptoms (about 8 points lower), but the certainty of this effect is also low.\n\nOverall, the studies show that individual‑level stress‑reduction programmes can lower stress symptoms for health‑care workers, especially in the short term, but the quality of the evidence is limited and long‑term effects are largely unknown.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nCURRENCY\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the style requirement that **all subheadings be phrased as questions** – the sections “LIMITATIONS” and “CURRENCY” are headings, not questions. This breaches the Master Style Guide and must be corrected. In addition, several clarity issues could confuse readers: \n1. **Long, complex sentence** – \"People who work in hospitals, clinics and other health‑care settings often face a mismatch between what their job asks of them, the skills they have, and the support they receive from colleagues and managers.\" This 33‑word sentence is hard to follow. *Rewrite*: \"People who work in hospitals, clinics or other health‑care settings often face a mismatch between job demands, their skills, and the support they receive from colleagues and managers.\"\n2. **Unexplained technical term** – \"low‑uncertainty evidence\" appears in the key messages and results without explanation. Readers may not know what this means. *Rewrite*: \"low‑uncertainty evidence (meaning the confidence in the result is limited)\".\n3. **Jargon without definition** – \"randomised trials\" and \"standardised mean difference (SMD)\" are used without lay explanations. *Rewrite*: \"randomised trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups)\" and \"standardised mean difference (a way of comparing results, where a negative number means lower stress)\".\n4. **Passive‑voice phrasing** – \"The evidence suggests that:\" is acceptable, but elsewhere passive constructions appear (e.g., \"All the studies tested… and compared…\" could be more active). *Rewrite*: \"Researchers tested… and compared…\".\n5. **Bullet‑point formatting** – The list under \"The evidence suggests that:\" uses a bullet (•) rather than a dash (‑) as required by the style guide. Replace each bullet with a dash.\nThese changes, together with converting the remaining headings to questions (e.g., change \"LIMITATIONS\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and \"CURRENCY\" to \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"), will bring the PLS into full compliance.\n\nMetrics support these observations: the draft shows a high nominalisation count (38, beyond typical PLS), an excess of nouns (217), and many complex/long words (153 complex, 233 long). The average sentence length is 26.4 words (above the typical 19‑28 range), confirming the need to shorten sentences. Reducing nominalisations and complex words will also improve readability scores such as the SMOG (14.2, beyond typical) and Dale‑Chall (8.86, beyond typical).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is within the 850‑word limit but deviates from typical patterns on several metrics: words per sentence (26.4, P90), nominalizations (38, BEYOND_P90), noun count (217, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (14.2, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.86, BEYOND_P90), and counts of complex/long words (all beyond typical ranges). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than usual PLS, supporting the need for shorter sentences, fewer nominalisations, and simpler vocabulary."
