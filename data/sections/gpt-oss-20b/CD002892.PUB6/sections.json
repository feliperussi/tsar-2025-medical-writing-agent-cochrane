  "key_messages": [
    "Personal stress‑reduction programmes (individual‑level interventions aimed at each healthcare worker) can lower reported stress symptoms in the short‑term (up to three months after the programme ends) and in the medium‑term (up to about a year), but the evidence is uncertain and no data are available on long‑term effects; no harmful effects were reported.",
    "Both approaches that help workers focus on their stress (for example, mindfulness) and those that help them focus away from stress (for example, relaxation or exercise) appear to reduce stress, and programmes that combine several techniques (combination interventions) may give a larger short‑term benefit, although the evidence does not clearly show which type works best.",
    "Because most studies were small, lacked proper blinding (keeping participants unaware of which group they are in), and did not follow participants for long periods, higher‑quality, larger trials with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm the benefits, explore any possible harms, and determine the effects of interventions that target work‑related risk factors."

      "subheading": "Why is occupational stress a problem for healthcare workers?",
      "content": "People who work in hospitals, clinics and other health‑care settings often face a mismatch between what their job asks of them, the skills they have, and the support they receive from colleagues and managers. This imbalance can cause work‑related stress, which may develop into burnout (feeling exhausted, detached and ineffective), physical symptoms such as headaches or stomach problems, and can even reduce the quality of care patients receive. While many organisations try to improve working conditions, most stress‑reduction efforts focus on helping the individual – for example, teaching techniques to notice and manage stress, practising relaxation or exercise, or changing personal work habits."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether programmes that target individual health‑care workers can actually lower their stress levels. Specifically, they compared these personal stress‑reduction interventions with doing nothing, waiting for treatment, receiving a placebo, or using a different type of stress‑reduction programme. Their goal was to see which approaches work best, how long any benefit lasts, and whether combining several techniques might be more effective."

      "subheading": "What did we do?",
      "content": "We searched databases for studies of individual‑level stress‑reduction interventions for healthcare workers compared with no intervention or other approaches, combined the results to assess effects on stress symptoms, and evaluated confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at 117 randomised trials that together involved 11,119 health‑care workers. All the studies tested individual‑level stress‑reduction techniques and compared them with doing nothing, waiting‑list, placebo or other non‑stress‑reduction controls. The interventions fell into four groups: (1) helping people focus on their experience of stress, (2) helping people shift their attention away from stress (for example, relaxation or exercise), (3) trying to change work‑related risk factors at the individual level, and (4) combining two or more of these approaches. The studies reported results up to three months after the programme (short‑term), between three and twelve months (medium‑term) and beyond twelve months (long‑term), although many did not provide long‑term data.\n\nThe evidence suggests that:\n• Focusing on the experience of stress may give a small short‑term reduction in stress symptoms (about 5 points lower on a 0‑to‑54 scale), but the certainty of this effect is low.\n• The same approach may also produce a small benefit in the medium term, again with uncertain evidence.\n• Shifting attention away from stress (e.g., relaxation, exercise) appears to lead to a moderate short‑term reduction in stress symptoms (around 7 points lower), though we are not sure how reliable this finding is.\n• In the medium term, this “away‑from‑stress” approach may give a small reduction, but the evidence remains uncertain.\n• Combining different individual‑level techniques may achieve a moderate short‑term reduction in stress symptoms (about 8 points lower), but the certainty of this effect is also low.\n\nOverall, the studies show that individual‑level stress‑reduction programmes can lower stress symptoms for health‑care workers, especially in the short term, but the quality of the evidence is limited and long‑term effects are largely unknown."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search."
