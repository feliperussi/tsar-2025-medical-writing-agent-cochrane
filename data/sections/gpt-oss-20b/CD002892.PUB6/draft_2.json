  "draft": "Do personal stress‑reduction programs (individual‑level interventions) reduce work‑related stress in healthcare workers?\n\nKey messages\n- Personal stress‑reduction programmes (individual‑level interventions aimed at each healthcare worker) can lower reported stress symptoms in the short‑term (up to 3 months after the programme ends) and in the medium‑term (up to about a year). The evidence is low‑uncertainty evidence (meaning confidence in the result is limited) and no data are available on long‑term effects; no harmful effects were reported.\n- Both approaches that help workers focus on their stress (for example, mindfulness) and those that help them focus away from stress (for example, relaxation or exercise) appear to reduce stress. Programmes that combine several techniques may give a larger short‑term benefit, although the evidence does not clearly show which type works best.\n- Because most studies were small, lacked proper blinding (keeping participants unaware of which group they are in), and did not follow participants for long periods, higher‑quality, larger trials with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm the benefits, explore any possible harms, and determine the effects of interventions that target work‑related risk factors.\n\nWhy is occupational stress a problem for healthcare workers?\nPeople who work in hospitals, clinics or other health‑care settings often face a mismatch between job demands, their skills, and the support they receive from colleagues and managers. This imbalance can cause work‑related stress, which may develop into burnout (feeling exhausted, detached and ineffective), physical symptoms such as headaches or stomach problems, and can even reduce the quality of care patients receive. While many organisations try to improve working conditions, most stress‑reduction efforts focus on helping the individual – for example, teaching techniques to notice and manage stress, practising relaxation or exercise, or changing personal work habits.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether programmes that target individual health‑care workers can actually lower their stress levels. Specifically, we compared personal stress‑reduction interventions with doing nothing, waiting for treatment, receiving a placebo, or using a different type of stress‑reduction programme. Our goal was to see which approaches work best, how long any benefit lasts, and whether combining several techniques might be more effective.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched several databases for studies that evaluated individual‑level stress‑reduction interventions for healthcare workers. We included randomised trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to groups) that compared an intervention with no intervention, a wait‑list, a placebo, or another stress‑reduction approach. We combined the results to assess effects on stress symptoms and judged confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 117 randomised trials that together involved 11 119 health‑care workers. All the studies tested individual‑level stress‑reduction techniques and compared them with a control condition. The interventions fell into four groups:\n- Helping people focus on their experience of stress (for example, mindfulness).\n- Helping people shift their attention away from stress (for example, relaxation or exercise).\n- Trying to change work‑related risk factors at the individual level.\n- Combining two or more of the above approaches.\n\nResearchers reported outcomes at short‑term (up to 3 months), medium‑term (more than 3 months to 12 months) and long‑term (beyond 12 months), although many studies did not provide long‑term data.\n\nThe evidence suggests that:\n- Focusing on the experience of stress may give a small short‑term reduction in stress symptoms (about 5 points lower on a 0‑to‑54 scale). The certainty of this effect is low.\n- The same approach may also give a small benefit in the medium term, but the evidence remains uncertain.\n- Shifting attention away from stress (for example, relaxation, exercise) appears to lead to a moderate short‑term reduction in stress symptoms (around 7 points lower). We are not sure how reliable this finding is.\n- In the medium term, the “away‑from‑stress” approach may give a small reduction, but the evidence is still uncertain.\n- Combining different individual‑level techniques may achieve a moderate short‑term reduction in stress symptoms (about 8 points lower). The certainty of this effect is also low.\n\nOverall, the studies show that individual‑level stress‑reduction programmes can lower stress symptoms for health‑care workers, especially in the short term, but the quality of the evidence is limited and long‑term effects are largely unknown.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received and the studies were very small. These factors increase the risk of bias and reduce the reliability of the findings.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes evidence searched up to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the style requirement that all subheadings be phrased as questions – the \"Key messages\" heading is not a question. Additionally, several sentences are overly long and contain unexplained jargon, which hampers readability for a lay audience. The draft also uses a high level of nominalisation and noun‑heavy phrasing, reflected in the metrics (41 nominalisations and 232 nouns, both well beyond the typical PLS range). These issues together create confusion and reduce clarity.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Problematic: \"Key messages\" (not a question). Rewrite as a question, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. **Long, jargon‑filled bullet** – Problematic: \"Personal stress‑reduction programmes (individual‑level interventions aimed at each healthcare worker) can lower reported stress symptoms in the short‑term (up to three months after the programme ends) and in the medium‑term (up to about a year‑long), but the evidence is low‑uncertainty evidence (meaning confidence in the result is limited) and no data are available on long‑term effects; no harmful effects were reported.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words, mixes technical terms, and repeats \"evidence\". Suggested rewrite: \"Personal stress‑reduction programmes can lower reported stress symptoms in the short term (up to 3 months) and medium term (up to about a year). The evidence is of low certainty, so we are less sure about the exact size of the benefit, and no long‑term data or harms were reported.\"\n3. **Unexplained jargon** – Problematic: phrase \"low‑uncertainty evidence\". Replace with plain language: \"the evidence is of low certainty (we have limited confidence in the result)\".\n4. **Nominalisation / noun‑heavy phrasing** – Problematic: \"The evidence suggests that:\" followed by noun‑heavy bullet points. Convert to active voice: e.g., \"We found that focusing on the experience of stress gave a small short‑term reduction in stress symptoms (about 5 points on a 0‑to‑54 scale).\" Apply this change throughout the results section.\n5. **Passive constructions** – Problematic: \"The interventions fell into four groups:\" can be made active: \"We grouped the interventions into four types:\".\n\nThese revisions will bring the draft into compliance with the Master Style Guide, improve readability (supported by the metrics showing excessive nominalisations, nouns, and a high SMOG index), and ensure the PLS is clear for patients.",
