  "draft": "Do psychological therapies (counselling, education or relaxation) improve quality of life, mood and disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with usual care?\n\nKey messages\n– Psychological therapies (counselling, education or relaxation) probably give small improvements in quality of life and in mood (depression and anxiety) for adults, and they probably improve quality of life for children; the evidence is of moderate quality.  \n– Similar modest benefits are seen when the programmes focus mainly on patient education or on relaxation techniques, but the overall picture is mixed because the studies used many different approaches.  \n– Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials that follow participants for longer periods, especially to determine any impact on disease activity and to confirm benefits in children.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why does it matter?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of long‑lasting conditions, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, that cause the lining of the gut to become inflamed. This inflammation leads to painful symptoms like diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, bleeding and weight loss. Because the gut is constantly active, people with IBD often need medicines, regular check‑ups and sometimes surgery. Flares can occur unpredictably, making daily life and work difficult and lowering overall well‑being (quality of life).\n\nWhy might mental‑health support be important for people with IBD?\nLiving with IBD affects both the body and the mind. People with IBD are more likely to experience anxiety, depression and other emotional problems, and these mental‑health issues can, in turn, worsen gut inflammation – a two‑way (bi‑directional) relationship. Researchers think that helping people manage stress, learn coping skills or receive counselling (collectively called psychological interventions or psychotherapy) could improve day‑to‑day feelings, reduce anxiety and depression, and maybe even calm the disease itself. Common approaches include talking‑therapy, education about the illness and relaxation exercises.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether psychological interventions make a real difference for people with IBD. Specifically, we looked at three outcomes: (1) quality of life – how satisfied people feel with their health and daily activities; (2) emotional state – levels of depression and anxiety; and (3) disease activity – how active the gut inflammation is. We compared these mental‑health programmes with usual care, a sham (fake) treatment or other active treatments.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, PsycINFO, and several regional databases) from their start dates to May 2023. We also checked trial registries and major gastro‑enterology conference proceedings from 2019 to 2023. We included randomised controlled trials that tested any non‑pharmacological psychological intervention (psychotherapy, education or relaxation) in children or adults with IBD, had at least two months of follow‑up and compared the intervention with no therapy, sham therapy or another active treatment. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias, and we used GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 68 randomised controlled trials of psychological interventions for people with IBD. Forty‑eight trials provided enough data for meta‑analysis, covering 6 405 participants (6 111 adults and 294 children or adolescents). All studies followed participants for at least two months.\n\nWe tested three types of interventions – multimodular psychotherapy (using several different therapy components), patient‑education programmes and relaxation techniques – either alone or together. We compared them with usual care, sham treatments or other active therapies.\n\nIn adults, psychological therapies, education programmes and relaxation techniques probably lead to a small improvement in quality of life. They also probably reduce depression and anxiety slightly. In children and adolescents, multimodular psychotherapy probably improves quality of life, while the effects of other approaches remain very uncertain. We did not find clear evidence that any psychological intervention changes disease activity. No harmful effects were reported.\n\nWe do not have details about funding sources, participants’ gender, disease severity or the countries where the trials were conducted.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Many studies could not blind participants or investigators, which may have introduced bias. Not all trials reported every outcome we were interested in, and the studies varied in the types of participants, how the interventions were delivered and their size – most were small. These factors reduce the precision of our estimates.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to the May 2023 search.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural and factual requirements, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained technical terms** – the draft mentions “GRADE”, “risk of bias”, and “meta‑analysis” without any simple definition. These concepts are essential for understanding the confidence in the findings, yet a patient may not know what they mean.\n   - *Quote*: \"We used GRADE to rate our confidence in the evidence.\"\n   - *Problem*: GRADE is a specialist grading system; readers are left guessing its meaning.\n   - *Rewrite*: \"We used a simple grading system (called GRADE) to show how sure we are about the results – ‘moderate‑certainty’ means we have a fair amount of confidence.\"\n2. **Jargon / ambiguous phrasing** – the term “sham (fake) treatment” and the phrase “multimodular psychotherapy” are not fully explained, which can be puzzling.\n   - *Quote*: \"sham (fake) treatment\"\n   - *Problem*: The parenthetical explanation is brief and may still be unclear.\n   - *Rewrite*: \"a ‘sham’ treatment – a pretend therapy that looks like real counselling but has no active component.\"\n   - *Quote*: \"multimodular psychotherapy (using several different therapy components)\"\n   - *Problem*: The definition is terse; readers may not grasp what the multiple components are.\n   - *Rewrite*: \"multimodular psychotherapy – therapy that combines several approaches, such as talking‑therapy, education and relaxation exercises.\"\n3. **Passive voice that hides who did what** – the sentence “No harmful effects were reported.” makes it unclear who looked for harms.\n   - *Quote*: \"No harmful effects were reported.\"\n   - *Problem*: Passive construction reduces immediacy and can be harder to follow.\n   - *Rewrite*: \"We did not see any harmful effects in the studies.\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy, abstract wording** – several sentences rely on long noun strings, making the text feel dense (e.g., “The evidence is current to the May 2023 search.”). The PLS metrics show a very high noun count (236, beyond typical range) and high nominalisation (34), confirming the issue.\n   - *Quote*: \"The evidence is current to the May 2023 search.\"\n   - *Problem*: The phrasing is indirect and uses abstract nouns.\n   - *Rewrite*: \"Our evidence is up to date as of May 2023.\"\n5. **Unnecessary detail for lay audience** – the sentence about missing information on funding, gender, disease severity, and country adds technical detail that does not help a patient understand the main findings.\n   - *Quote*: \"We do not have details about funding sources, participants’ gender, disease severity or the countries where the trials were conducted.\"\n   - *Problem*: This information is irrelevant for a plain‑language summary and adds to noun‑heavy load.\n   - *Rewrite*: Omit this sentence entirely, or replace with a brief note: \"The studies did not always report who took part or where they were done.\"\n**Metric support**: The evaluation shows the draft is well within word‑count limits, but it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in several areas: nominalisation (34, beyond P90), noun count (236, beyond P90), SMOG index (16.7, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.3, beyond P90), and high counts of complex and long words. These numbers confirm the editorial observations about noun‑heavy, complex wording and suggest the need to simplify the language.\nOverall, while the draft is factually accurate and structurally complete, the identified clarity issues are significant enough to warrant revision before the summary can be considered ready for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets the word‑count limit (749 words) and has a good sentence length (17.8 words per sentence, P25). Readability scores are moderate (FRE 39.4, P25). However, several linguistic features are far outside typical PLS ranges: nominalisation (34, BEYOND_P90), noun count (236, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (16.7, BEYOND_P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.3, P90), complex words (199, BEYOND_P90) and long words (252, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many complex words, which aligns with the observed clarity and style issues."
