  "draft": "Do psychological therapies (counselling, education or relaxation) improve quality of life, mood and disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with usual care?\n\nKey messages\n– Psychological therapies probably give small improvements in quality of life and in mood (depression and anxiety) for adults, and probably improve quality of life for children; the evidence is of moderate certainty.  \n– Similar modest benefits were seen for programmes that mainly taught patients about IBD or taught relaxation techniques, but the results vary because the studies used many different approaches.  \n– No harmful effects were reported. Larger, well‑designed trials that follow participants for longer are needed, especially to see whether these therapies affect disease activity and to confirm benefits in children.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why does it matter?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of long‑lasting ...\n\nWhy might mental‑health support be important for people with IBD?\nPeople with IBD are more likely to experience anxiety, depression and other emotional problems. These mental‑health issues can, in turn, make the gut inflammation worse – a two‑way (bi‑directional) relationship. We think that helping people manage stress, learn coping skills or receive counselling (collectively called psychological interventions or psychotherapy) could improve how they feel day‑to‑day, reduce anxiety and depression, and maybe even calm the disease itself. Common approaches include talking‑therapy, education about the illness and relaxation exercises.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether psychological interventions make a real difference for people with IBD. We looked at three outcomes: (1) quality of life – how satisfied people feel with their health and daily activities; (2) emotional state – levels of depression and anxiety; and (3) disease activity – how active the gut inflammation is. We compared these programmes with usual care, a sham (fake) treatment or other active therapies.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registries from their start dates to May 2023. We included randomised controlled trials that tested any psychological intervention (counselling, education, relaxation or multimodular psychotherapy) in children or adults with IBD, with at least two months of follow‑up. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system (high, moderate, low, very low).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 68 eligible trials. Forty‑eight of these trials provided enough data for analysis, covering 6 405 participants (6 111 adults and 294 children or adolescents). All studies followed participants for at least two months.\n\nQuality of life  \nIn adults, psychological therapies, education programmes and relaxation techniques probably lead to a small improvement in quality of life. In children and adolescents, multimodular psychotherapy probably improves quality of life, while evidence for other approaches is very uncertain.\n\nMood (depression and anxiety)  \nIn adults, the same three types of programmes probably reduce depressive symptoms and anxiety a little. In children, the evidence is limited and uncertain.\n\nDisease activity  \nWe did not find clear evidence that any psychological intervention changes disease activity in adults or children. The studies were too different ...\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in our findings, but several issues reduce certainty. Many studies could not blind participants or investigators, some outcome measures may be biased, the trials were small and varied in how they delivered the interventions, and not all studies reported every outcome we wanted.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023, the date of our most recent search.",

      "feedback": "Critical issue: factual inaccuracy – the draft says “Forty‑six of these trials provided enough data for analysis,” but the source reports 48 trials. This violates the factual accuracy check. Additional clarity problems: (1) jargon – the term “multimodular psychotherapy” is not explained for lay readers; (2) a very long sentence about how psychological support might help (over 30 words) makes the meaning hard to follow; (3) passive construction “The studies were too different …” obscures who judged the studies; (4) high nominalisation and complex‑word density (27 nominalisations, 190 nouns, 196 long words, SMOG 15.3) reduce readability. Suggested rewrites are provided below. These issues, together with the factual error, mean the PLS cannot be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and has good active‑voice (57) and pronoun use (29). However, it deviates markedly in several lexical metrics: nominalisations (27, beyond P90), nouns (190, beyond P90), long words (196, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.3, beyond P90), complex words (155, beyond P90) and Dale‑Chall complex words (280, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words than typical Cochrane PLS, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
