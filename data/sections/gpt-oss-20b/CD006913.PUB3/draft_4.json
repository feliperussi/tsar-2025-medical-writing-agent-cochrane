  "draft": "Do psychological therapies (counselling, education or relaxation) improve quality of life, mood and disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with usual care?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– Psychological therapies – counselling, education and relaxation – probably give small improvements in quality of life and in mood (depression and anxiety) for adults, and probably improve quality of life for children; the evidence is of moderate certainty.  \n– Similar modest benefits appear when programmes focus mainly on patient education or on relaxation techniques, but results vary because the studies used many different approaches.  \n– We did not see any harmful effects. Larger, well‑designed trials that follow participants for longer are needed, especially to find out whether these therapies affect disease activity and to confirm benefits in children.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why does it matter?  \nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of long‑lasting conditions, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, that cause inflammation of the gut lining. This inflammation leads to painful symptoms like diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, bleeding and weight loss. Because the gut is constantly active, people with IBD often need medicines, regular check‑ups and sometimes surgery. Flares can happen unpredictably, making it difficult to manage daily life and work, and lowering overall well‑being (quality of life).\n\nWhy might mental‑health support be important for people with IBD?  \nLiving with IBD affects both the body and the mind. People with IBD are more likely to experience anxiety, depression and other emotional problems, and these mental‑health issues can, in turn, worsen gut inflammation – a two‑way (bi‑directional) relationship. Researchers think that helping people manage stress, learn coping skills or receive counselling (collectively called psychological interventions or psychotherapy) could improve day‑to‑day feelings, reduce anxiety and depression, and maybe even calm the disease itself. Common approaches include talking‑therapy, education about the illness and relaxation exercises.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether psychological interventions really make a difference for people with IBD. Specifically, we looked at three outcomes: (1) quality of life – how satisfied people feel with their health and daily activities; (2) emotional state – levels of depression and anxiety; and (3) disease activity – how active the gut inflammation is. We compared these programmes with usual care, a ‘sham’ treatment – a pretend therapy that looks like real counselling but has no active component – or other active treatments.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, PsycINFO and several regional databases from their start dates to May 2023. We also looked at trial registries and major gastro‑enterology conference proceedings from 2019 to 2023. We included randomised controlled trials that tested any non‑pharmacological psychological intervention (psychotherapy, education or relaxation) in children or adults with IBD, required at least two months of follow‑up and compared the intervention with no therapy, sham therapy or another active treatment. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias, then we combined results in meta‑analyses and graded our confidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 68 randomised controlled trials; 48 provided enough data for meta‑analysis, covering 6 405 participants (6 111 adults and 294 children or adolescents). All studies followed participants for at least two months. The interventions fell into three groups:  \n\n– Multimodular psychotherapy – a type of therapy that combines talking‑therapy, education and relaxation exercises.  \n– Patient‑education programmes – sessions that teach people about IBD, its management and coping strategies.  \n– Relaxation techniques – practices such as breathing exercises or guided imagery that aim to reduce stress.  \n\nIn adults, all three approaches probably lead to a small improvement in quality of life and a slight reduction in depression and anxiety. In children and adolescents, multimodular psychotherapy probably improves quality of life, while the effects of education or relaxation remain very uncertain. We did not find clear evidence that any psychological intervention changes disease activity. No harmful effects were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in these findings. Many studies could not blind participants or investigators, which may have introduced bias. Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted, and the studies varied in participants, how the interventions were delivered and size – most were small. These factors reduce the precision of our estimates.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe searched up to May 2023, so the evidence is current as of that date.",

These issues are reflected in the metrics: nominalisation count (37, beyond P90), noun count (233, beyond P90), SMOG index (16.5, beyond P90) and high numbers of complex words, indicating the text is more dense than typical PLS. Addressing the four points above will bring the summary into line with Cochrane plain‑language standards.",

These indicate the draft is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical Cochrane PLS, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
