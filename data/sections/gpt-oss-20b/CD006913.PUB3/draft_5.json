  "draft": "\"Do psychological therapies (counselling, education or relaxation) improve quality of life, mood and disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with usual care?\"\n\nKey messages  \n– Psychological therapies – counselling, education and relaxation – probably give small improvements in quality of life and in mood (depression and anxiety) for adults, and probably improve quality of life for children; the evidence is of moderate certainty.  \n– Similar modest benefits appear when programmes focus mainly on patient education or on relaxation techniques, but results vary because the studies used many different approaches.  \n– No harmful effects were reported. Larger, well‑designed trials that follow participants for longer are needed, especially to find out whether these therapies affect disease activity and to confirm benefits in children.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why does it matter?  \nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of long‑lasting conditions, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, that cause inflammation of the gut lining. This inflammation leads to painful symptoms like diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, bleeding and weight loss. Because the gut is constantly active, people with IBD often need medicines, regular check‑ups and sometimes surgery. Flares can happen unpredictably, making daily life and work difficult and lowering overall well‑being (quality of life).\n\nWhy might mental‑health support be important for people with IBD?  \nLiving with IBD affects both the body and the mind. People with IBD are more likely to experience anxiety, depression and other emotional problems, and these mental‑health issues can, in turn, worsen gut inflammation – a two‑way (bi‑directional) relationship. Researchers think that helping people manage stress, learn coping skills or receive counselling (collectively called psychological interventions or psychotherapy) could improve day‑to‑day feelings, reduce anxiety and depression, and maybe even calm the disease itself. Common approaches include talking‑therapy, education about the illness and relaxation exercises.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether psychological interventions really make a difference for people with IBD. Specifically, we looked at three outcomes: (1) quality of life – how satisfied people feel with their health and daily activities; (2) emotional state – levels of depression and anxiety; and (3) disease activity – how active the gut inflammation is. We compared these programmes with usual care, a sham (pretend) treatment or other active treatments.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, PsycINFO and several regional databases from their start dates to May 2023. We also checked trial registries and major gastro‑enterology conference proceedings from 2019 to 2023. We included randomised controlled trials that tested any non‑pharmacological psychological intervention (psychotherapy, education or relaxation) in children or adults with IBD, required at least two months of follow‑up and compared the intervention with no therapy, sham therapy or another active treatment. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias, then we combined results in meta‑analyses and graded our confidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 68 randomised controlled trials; 48 provided enough data for meta‑analysis, covering 6 405 participants (6 111 adults and 294 children or adolescents). All studies followed participants for at least two months. The interventions fell into three groups:  \n\n– Multimodular psychotherapy – a therapy that combines talking, education and relaxation exercises.  \n– Patient‑education programmes – sessions that teach people about IBD, its management and coping strategies.  \n– Relaxation techniques – practices such as breathing exercises or guided imagery that aim to reduce stress.  \n\nIn adults, each of these approaches probably leads to a small improvement in quality of life and a slight reduction in depression and anxiety. In children and adolescents, multimodular psychotherapy probably improves quality of life, while the effects of education or relaxation remain very uncertain. We did not find clear evidence that any psychological intervention changes disease activity. No harmful effects were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are fairly confident in these findings, but many studies could not blind participants or investigators, which may have introduced bias. Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted, and the studies varied in participants, how the interventions were delivered and size – most were small. These factors reduce the precision of our estimates.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe searched up to May 2023, so the evidence is current as of that date.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft passes the required completeness, title/subheading format, factual accuracy, and word‑count checks, but it contains three significant clarity problems that could confuse readers. 1) A long, jargon‑heavy sentence about researchers’ expectations makes the key idea hard to follow. 2) The term “multimodular psychotherapy” is introduced without any plain‑language definition, leaving patients unsure what it means. 3) Several noun‑heavy constructions (e.g., “The interventions fell into three groups”) reduce readability and contribute to the high nominalisation and noun counts reported by the metrics. These issues should be rewritten to use shorter sentences, everyday language, and more active verbs. Suggested rewrites: - Original: “Researchers think that helping people manage stress, learn coping skills or receive counselling (collectively called psychological interventions or psychotherapy) could improve day‑to‑day feelings, reduce anxiety and depression, and maybe even calm the disease itself.” Rewrite: “We think that teaching people how to manage stress, learn coping skills, or receive counselling – called psychological interventions – can improve how they feel each day, lower anxiety and depression, and maybe even calm the disease.” - Original: “Multimodular psychotherapy – a therapy that combines talking, education and relaxation exercises.” Rewrite: “Multimodular psychotherapy, which means a programme that mixes talking therapy, education about IBD, and relaxation exercises.” - Original: “The interventions fell into three groups:” Rewrite: “We grouped the interventions into three types:” These changes will lower the nominalisation (currently 37, far above the typical <13) and noun count (228 vs typical <116) highlighted in the PLS evaluation, and will make the summary easier for patients to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and has good sentence length (words_per_sentence 18.1, P25). Readability scores are acceptable (FRE 40.3, P25). However, several metrics deviate markedly: nominalisation (37, BEYOND_P90), noun count (228, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (16.4, BEYOND_P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.4, P90), complex words (186, BEYOND_P90) and long words (242, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex words, suggesting a need to simplify language and use more active verbs."
