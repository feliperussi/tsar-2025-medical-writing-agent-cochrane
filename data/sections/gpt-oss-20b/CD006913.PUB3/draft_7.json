  "draft": "\"Do psychological therapies (counselling, education or relaxation) improve quality of life, mood and disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with usual care?\"\n\nKey messages  \n– We found that psychological therapies probably give small improvements in quality of life and in mood (depression and anxiety) for adults, and probably improve quality of life for children; the evidence is of moderate certainty.  \n– We saw similar modest benefits when programmes focused mainly on patient education or on relaxation techniques, but the results vary because the studies used many different approaches.  \n– We did not find any harmful effects. Larger, well‑designed trials that follow participants for longer are needed, especially to determine whether these therapies affect disease activity and to confirm benefits in children.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why does it matter?  \nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of long‑lasting conditions, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, that cause inflammation of the gut lining. This inflammation leads to painful symptoms like diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, bleeding and weight loss. Because the gut is constantly active, people with IBD often need medicines, regular check‑ups and sometimes surgery. Flares can occur unpredictably, making daily life and work difficult and lowering overall well‑being (quality of life).\n\nWhy might mental‑health support be important for people with IBD?  \nPeople with IBD are more likely to experience anxiety, depression and other emotional problems. These mental‑health issues can worsen gut inflammation – a two‑way (bi‑directional) relationship. Researchers think that helping people manage stress, learn coping skills or receive counselling (collectively called psychological interventions or psychotherapy) could improve day‑to‑day feelings, reduce anxiety and depression, and maybe even calm the disease itself. Common approaches include talking‑therapy, education about the illness and relaxation exercises.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether psychological interventions make a real difference for people with IBD. Specifically, we looked at three outcomes: (1) quality of life – how satisfied people feel with their health and daily activities; (2) emotional state – levels of depression and anxiety; and (3) disease activity – how active the gut inflammation is. We compared these mental‑health programmes with usual care, a sham (fake) treatment or other active treatments.\n\nMethods  \nWe searched multiple databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, PsycINFO and others) and trial registries from inception to May 2023. We included randomised controlled trials that tested any psychological intervention (counselling, education, relaxation or multimodular psychotherapy) in children or adults with IBD, with at least two months of follow‑up. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes and relative risks for event data, using random‑effects models. We graded the certainty of the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 68 eligible trials; 48 provided enough data for meta‑analysis, covering 6 405 participants (6 111 adults and 294 children or adolescents). All studies followed participants for at least two months. The interventions were multimodular psychotherapy, patient‑education programmes or relaxation techniques, alone or combined, and they were compared with usual care, sham treatments or other active therapies.\n\nMain results: quality of life  \nIn adults, psychological therapies, education programmes and relaxation techniques probably lead to a small improvement in quality of life (standardised mean difference ≈ 0.2–0.25; moderate‑Uncertainty). In children and adolescents, multimodular psychotherapy probably improves quality of life (SMD ≈ 0.5; moderate‑Uncertainty), while evidence for other approaches is very uncertain.\n\nMain results: mood (depression and anxiety)  \nIn adults, the same three types of interventions probably reduce depressive symptoms (SMD ≈ ‑0.2 to ‑0.27) and anxiety (SMD ≈ ‑0.16 to ‑0.29) with moderate certainty. In children, the evidence is limited and uncertain.\n\nMain results: disease activity  \nWe did not find clear evidence that any psychological intervention changes disease activity in adults or children. Results were too heterogeneous to pool, and the certainty was low.\n\nLimitations of the evidence  \nWe are moderately confident in the findings, but several issues reduce certainty: many studies could not blind participants or investigators, some outcomes were measured with tools that may be biased, the trials were small and varied in how they delivered the interventions, and not all studies reported every outcome we wanted.\n\nCurrency  \nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023, the date of our most recent search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the style requirement that all subheadings be phrased as questions. Sections such as \"Methods\", \"Main results: quality of life\", \"Main results: mood (depression and anxiety)\", \"Main results: disease activity\", \"Limitations of the evidence\" and \"Currency\" are headings, not questions, and must be rewritten (e.g., \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What were the results for quality of life?\", etc.).\n\nAdditional clarity issues that could confuse readers:\n1. Unexplained technical term – \"standardised mean difference (SMD)\" appears several times without definition. Suggest adding a brief explanation, e.g., \"a small effect size that compares groups on a common scale\".\n2. Nominalised, noun‑heavy sentence – \"We identified 68 eligible trials; 48 provided enough data for meta‑analysis, covering a total of 6,405 participants (6,111 adults and 294 children or adolescents).\" This can be split for readability.\n3. Jargon without lay explanation – terms like \"random‑effects models\" and \"GRADE\" are not explained. Provide simple definitions.\n4. Inconsistent wording of certainty – the draft uses \"moderate‑Uncertainty\" which is opposite of the intended meaning. Replace with \"moderate certainty\".\n\nThese issues, together with the subheading problem, prevent the PLS from meeting the required style and clarity standards.\n\nMetrics support the editorial judgment: the draft shows high nominalisation (31, beyond typical range) and a very high noun count (232, beyond typical range), indicating noun‑heavy writing. The SMOG index (16.7) and Dale‑Chall readability (8.5) are also above typical PLS levels, confirming the need to simplify language and reduce complex words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is 742 words (within the 850‑word limit) and has good active voice (65, P75) and pronoun use (29, P75). However, it deviates markedly in nominalisation, noun count, SMOG index, Dale‑Chall readability, and counts of complex/long words, all beyond the 90th percentile, indicating overly complex, noun‑heavy language that should be simplified."
