  "draft": "Do psychological therapies (counselling, education or relaxation) improve quality of life, mood and disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with usual care?\n\nKey messages  \n– We found that psychological therapies probably give small improvements in quality of life and in mood (depression and anxiety) for adults, and probably improve quality of life for children; the evidence is of moderate certainty.  \n– Similar modest benefits were seen for programmes that mainly taught patients about IBD or taught relaxation techniques, but the results vary because the studies used many different approaches.  \n– No harmful effects were reported. Larger, well‑designed trials that follow participants for longer are needed, especially to see whether these therapies affect disease activity and to confirm benefits in children.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why does it matter?  \nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of long‑lasting conditions, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, that cause inflammation of the gut lining. This inflammation leads to painful symptoms like diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, bleeding and weight loss. Because the gut is constantly active, people with IBD often need medicines, regular check‑ups and sometimes surgery. Flares can happen unpredictably, making daily life and work difficult and lowering overall well‑being (quality of life).\n\nWhy might mental‑health support be important for people with IBD?  \nPeople with IBD are more likely to experience anxiety, depression and other emotional problems. These mental‑health issues can worsen gut inflammation – a two‑way (bi‑directional) relationship. Researchers think that helping people manage stress, learn coping skills or receive counselling (collectively called psychological interventions or psychotherapy) could improve day‑to‑day feelings, reduce anxiety and depression, and maybe even calm the disease itself. Common approaches include talking‑therapy, education about the illness and relaxation exercises.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether psychological interventions make a real difference for people with IBD. Specifically, we looked at three outcomes: (1) quality of life – how satisfied people feel with their health and daily activities; (2) emotional state – levels of depression and anxiety; and (3) disease activity – how active the gut inflammation is. We compared these programmes with usual care, a sham (fake) treatment or other active treatments.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, PsycINFO and other databases, plus trial registries, from their start dates to May 2023. We included randomised controlled trials that tested any psychological intervention (counselling, education, relaxation or multimodular psychotherapy) in children or adults with IBD, with at least two months of follow‑up. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results using random‑effects models (a statistical method that assumes the true effect may vary between studies). We expressed differences as standardised mean differences (SMD), which are small effect sizes that compare groups on a common scale. We rated our confidence in the evidence with GRADE (a system that grades certainty as high, moderate, low or very low).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 68 eligible trials. Forty‑eight of them provided enough data for meta‑analysis, covering a total of 6 405 participants (6 111 adults and 294 children or adolescents). All studies followed participants for at least two months. The interventions tested were multimodular psychotherapy, patient‑education programmes and relaxation techniques, alone or combined, and they were compared with usual care, sham treatments or other active therapies.\n\nWhat were the results for quality of life?  \nIn adults, psychological therapies, education programmes and relaxation techniques probably lead to a small improvement in quality of life (SMD ≈ 0.2–0.25; moderate certainty). In children and adolescents, multimodular psychotherapy probably improves quality of life (SMD ≈ 0.5; moderate certainty), while evidence for other approaches is very uncertain.\n\nWhat were the results for mood (depression and anxiety)?  \nIn adults, the same three types of interventions probably reduce depressive symptoms (SMD ≈ ‑0.2 to ‑0.27) and anxiety (SMD ≈ ‑0.16 to ‑0.29) with moderate certainty. In children, the evidence is limited and uncertain.\n\nWhat were the results for disease activity?  \nWe did not find clear evidence that any psychological intervention changes disease activity in adults or children. Results were too heterogeneous to pool, and the certainty was low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the findings, but several issues reduce certainty: many studies could not blind participants or investigators, some outcome measures may be biased, the trials were small and varied in how they delivered the interventions, and not all studies reported every outcome we wanted.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023, the date of our most recent search.",

In addition, several clarity issues would confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained technical jargon** – terms such as \"standardised mean difference (SMD)\" and \"GRADE\" appear without plain‑language explanation.\n2. **Heavy noun‑and nominalisation density** – sentences like \"The interventions tested were multimodular psychotherapy, patient‑education programmes and relaxation techniques, alone or combined, and they were compared with usual care, sham treatments or other active therapies\" are noun‑heavy and hard to follow.\n3. **Missing plain‑language equivalents for statistical language** – the description of \"random‑effects models\" and the use of confidence‑interval notation (e.g., SMD ≈ 0.2–0.25) are unnecessary for a patient audience.\n4. **Overall readability metrics are far from typical PLS values** (nominalisations 31 → beyond P90; nouns 242 → beyond P90; smog index 16.8 → beyond P90; complex words 198 → beyond P90). These indicate the text is too complex and noun‑heavy.\n\n**Suggested concrete improvements**:\n- **Subheading**: Change \"Key messages\" to a question, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\".\n- **Jargon**: Replace \"standardised mean difference (SMD)\" with \"a small difference in how groups performed, measured on a common scale\" and add a brief note on GRADE, e.g., \"We rated how confident we are in the evidence using a system called GRADE (high, moderate, low, very low).\"\n- **Nominalisation**: Rewrite the heavy sentence as \"We tested three types of programmes – psychotherapy that combines several techniques, education about IBD, and relaxation exercises – and compared each with usual care, a fake treatment, or another active therapy.\"\n- **Statistical language**: Remove the technical description of random‑effects models and confidence intervals; instead say \"We combined the results of the studies and looked at the overall pattern of benefit.\"\n\nAddressing these points will bring the draft into full compliance with the Master Style Guide and improve readability for patients.",
