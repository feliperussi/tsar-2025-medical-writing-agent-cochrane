  "draft": "Do psychological therapies (counselling, education or relaxation) improve quality of life, mood and disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with usual care?\n\n- Psychological therapies (counselling, education or relaxation) probably provide small improvements in quality of life (how people feel about their daily life), and in mood (depression and anxiety) for adults and improve quality of life for children, with no clear effect on disease activity (how active the IBD is) and no harmful effects reported; the evidence is of moderate quality.\n- Similar modest benefits were also seen for interventions that focused mainly on patient education or relaxation techniques, but the overall picture is mixed because the studies used many different approaches and showed varying results.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed studies that follow participants for longer periods, especially to determine any impact on disease activity and to confirm benefits in children.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why does it matter?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of long‑lasting conditions, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, that cause the lining of the gut to become inflamed. This inflammation leads to painful symptoms like diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, bleeding, and weight loss. Because the gut is constantly active, people with IBD often have to take medicines, undergo regular check‑ups, and sometimes need surgery. The disease can flare up unpredictably, making daily life and work difficult, and it can lower a person’s overall sense of well‑being, known as quality of life.\n\nWhy might mental health support be important for people with IBD?\nLiving with IBD not only affects the body but also the mind. People with IBD are more likely to experience anxiety, depression, and other emotional problems, and these mental health issues can, in turn, make the gut inflammation worse – a two‑way (bi‑directional) relationship. Researchers think that helping people manage stress, learn coping skills, or receive counselling (collectively called psychological interventions or psychotherapy) could improve how they feel day‑to‑day, reduce anxiety and depression, and maybe even calm the disease itself. Common psychological approaches include talking‑therapy, education about the illness, and relaxation exercises.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether psychological interventions actually make a difference for people with IBD. Specifically, they looked at three outcomes: (1) quality of life – how satisfied people feel with their overall health and daily activities; (2) emotional state – levels of depression and anxiety; and (3) disease activity – how active the gut inflammation is. They examined studies that compared these mental‑health programmes with usual care, a fake (sham) treatment, or other active treatments, to see if the programmes provide real benefits.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies evaluating psychological interventions for inflammatory bowel disease, combined their results to assess effects on quality of life, emotional state, and disease activity, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 68 randomised controlled trials that tested psychological interventions for people with inflammatory bowel disease. Forty‑eight of these trials provided enough data for analysis, covering a total of 6,405 participants (6,111 adults and 294 children or adolescents). All studies followed participants for at least two months. The interventions tested were multimodular psychotherapy, patient‑education programmes and relaxation techniques, either alone or in combination, and they were compared with usual care, sham treatments or other active therapies. The abstract does not give details about funding sources, participants’ gender, disease severity or the countries where the trials were conducted.\n\nMain results: Quality of life\nIn adults, psychological therapies, education programmes and relaxation techniques probably lead to a small improvement in quality of life. In children and adolescents, multimodular psychotherapy probably improves quality of life, while the effect of other psychological approaches is very uncertain.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023 of search.",

The abstract does not report funding sources, participants’ gender, disease severity, or the countries where the trials were conducted.\"\n4. **Technical jargon without definition** – the term \"multimodular\" appears without explanation. *Rewrite:* \"multimodular (using several different therapy components)\".\n5. **Bullet‑point formatting** – the key messages use hyphens, which is correct, but the list could be separated by blank lines for better white‑space.\n\nThese issues, combined with the metric analysis showing unusually high nominalisation (28, beyond P90), noun count (228, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.9, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall score (8.33, beyond P90), and many complex/long words, indicate the draft is harder to read than typical Cochrane PLS texts.
