  "draft": "Do psychological therapies (counselling, education or relaxation) improve quality of life, mood and disease activity in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared with usual care?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– We found that psychological therapies probably give small improvements in quality of life and in mood (depression and anxiety) for adults, and probably improve quality of life for children; the evidence is of moderate certainty.  \n– Similar modest benefits were seen for programmes that mainly taught patients about IBD or taught relaxation techniques, but the results vary because the studies used many different approaches.  \n– No harmful effects were reported. Larger, well‑designed trials that follow participants for longer are needed, especially to see whether these therapies affect disease activity and to confirm benefits in children.\n\nWhat is inflammatory bowel disease and why does it matter?\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of long‑lasting conditions, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, that cause inflammation of the gut lining. This inflammation leads to painful symptoms like diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, bleeding and weight loss. Because the gut is constantly active, people with IBD often need medicines, regular check‑ups and sometimes surgery. Flares can happen unpredictably, making daily life and work difficult and lowering overall well‑being (quality of life).\n\nWhy might mental‑health support be important for people with IBD?\nPeople with IBD are more likely to experience anxiety, depression and other emotional problems. These mental‑health issues can worsen gut inflammation – a two‑way (bi‑directional) relationship. Researchers think that helping people manage stress, learn coping skills or receive counselling (collectively called psychological interventions or psychotherapy) could improve day‑to‑day feelings, reduce anxiety and depression, and maybe even calm the disease itself. Common approaches include talking‑therapy, education about the illness and relaxation exercises.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether psychological interventions make a real difference for people with IBD. Specifically, we looked at three outcomes: (1) quality of life – how satisfied people feel with their health and daily activities; (2) emotional state – levels of depression and anxiety; and (3) disease activity – how active the gut inflammation is. We compared these programmes with usual care, a sham (fake) treatment or other active treatments.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registries from their start dates to May 2023. We included randomised controlled trials that tested any psychological intervention (counselling, education, relaxation or multimodular psychotherapy) in children or adults with IBD, with at least two months of follow‑up. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results of the studies and looked at the overall pattern of benefit. We rated how confident we are in the evidence using a system called GRADE (high, moderate, low, very low).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 68 eligible trials. Forty‑eight of them provided enough data for analysis, covering 6 405 participants (6 111 adults and 294 children or adolescents). All studies followed participants for at least two months. We tested three types of programmes – psychotherapy that combines several techniques, education about IBD, and relaxation exercises – and compared each with usual care, a fake treatment, or another active therapy.\n\nWhat were the results for quality of life?\nIn adults, the three types of programmes probably lead to a small improvement in quality of life. In children and adolescents, psychotherapy that combines several techniques probably improves quality of life, while evidence for the other approaches is very uncertain.\n\nWhat were the results for mood (depression and anxiety)?\nIn adults, the same three types of programmes probably reduce depressive symptoms and anxiety a little. In children, the evidence is limited and uncertain.\n\nWhat were the results for disease activity?\nWe did not find clear evidence that any psychological intervention changes disease activity in adults or children. The studies were too different to combine, and the certainty of the evidence was low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings, but several issues reduce certainty: many studies could not blind participants or investigators, some outcome measures may be biased, the trials were small and varied in how they delivered the interventions, and not all studies reported every outcome we wanted.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2023, the date of our most recent search.",

This factual inaccuracy must be corrected. Additionally, several clarity problems could confuse readers:\n1. Long, complex sentence: \"Researchers think that helping people manage stress, learn coping skills or receive counselling (collectively called psychological interventions or psychotherapy) could improve day‑to‑day feelings, reduce anxiety and depression, and maybe even calm the disease itself.\" – split into two shorter sentences.\n2. Jargon without definition: the term \"bi‑directional\" appears without a plain‑language explanation.\n3. Wordy phrasing: \"The evidence is up to date to May 2023, the date of our most recent search.\" – can be simplified.\n4. Noun‑heavy, nominalised constructions (e.g., \"the overall pattern of benefit\") make the text harder to read. These issues, together with the metric report showing very high nominalisation, noun count, SMOG, and complex‑word scores, indicate the draft needs revision before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability metrics (words per sentence, active voice, pronouns) are within typical PLS ranges. However, it deviates strongly on nominalisation (30 vs typical ≤13), noun count (227 vs ≤116), SMOG index (16.4 vs ≤12.1), complex words (187 vs ≤84) and long words (240 vs ≤122). These high scores reflect the noun‑heavy, complex language noted above and support the need to simplify wording and reduce nominalisations."
