  "draft": "\"Does giving sweet sugar solution (sucrose) reduce pain from heel‑prick tests in newborn babies?\"\n\nKey messages\n– Giving a small dose of sweet sugar solution (sucrose) probably lowers pain scores during heel‑prick tests. The reduction is seen in standard newborn pain scales measured shortly after the prick, and no harmful side effects were reported. The evidence comes from many trials and is of moderate certainty.  \n– When sucrose is compared with other soothing methods such as non‑nutritive sucking (a pacifier without milk), breastfeeding, glucose, or skin‑to‑skin contact, the benefit is unclear and the evidence is uncertain.  \n– Future research should test longer‑term outcomes, include different groups of newborns, and directly compare sucrose with other pain‑relief approaches to identify the most effective method.\n\nWhy does heel‑lance pain matter for newborn babies?  \nWhen a baby is born, clinicians often need a tiny drop of blood to check the baby’s health. They obtain the sample by quickly pricking the heel – a procedure called a heel‑lance. Even though the needle is small, the prick can cause noticeable pain and distress in both full‑term and pre‑term infants. Repeated painful experiences early in life may affect a baby’s comfort, sleep, and later pain responses. Because babies cannot tell us how they feel, clinicians use pain‑rating tools such as the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP – a scale that looks at facial expression, crying, and heart rate) and the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS – a similar tool) to measure pain.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nWe set out to determine whether giving a tiny dose of sucrose (table sugar) before a heel‑lance reduces the baby’s pain. We compared sucrose with no treatment, water, or placebo, and also with other soothing methods such as non‑nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, glucose, expressed breast milk, skin‑to‑skin contact, laser acupuncture, and facilitated tucking. We examined immediate pain scores and any longer‑term outcomes, using data from randomised controlled trials that together enrolled more than 6 000 infants.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major medical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science) and three trial registries up to February 2022. We selected randomised controlled trials that compared sucrose with any of the listed alternatives in newborns undergoing heel‑lance. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed the quality of each study using the GRADE approach, which rates confidence in the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 55 trials involving 6 273 newborn babies. Twenty‑nine trials enrolled only full‑term infants, 22 enrolled only pre‑term infants, and four included both groups. All babies underwent a heel‑lance; some trials also examined other minor painful procedures.\n\n– **Sucrose versus no treatment or water**: The evidence (moderate certainty) shows that sucrose probably reduces PIPP scores by about 1.7 points at 30 seconds and by about 2.1 points at 60 seconds after the prick.  \n– **Sucrose versus non‑nutritive sucking alone**: Sucrose probably reduces pain compared with non‑nutritive sucking, based on moderate‑certainty evidence.  \n– **Sucrose versus glucose, expressed breast milk, or skin‑to‑skin care with water**: The evidence suggests little or no difference in pain scores (low to very low certainty).  \n– **Sucrose versus breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, or facilitated tucking**: The evidence is very uncertain; we cannot tell whether sucrose helps more, less, or the same as these methods.  \n– **Sucrose combined with non‑nutritive sucking**: The evidence is very uncertain about any added benefit over non‑nutritive sucking alone.\n\nNo serious adverse events were reported in any trial.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the overall findings, but the trials varied in the types of babies studied, the exact dose and timing of sucrose, and the way pain was measured. This heterogeneity reduces our certainty for some comparisons.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nOur search covered studies published up to February 2022. Any trials published after that date are not included.\n\nWhat should happen next?  \nFuture studies should use well‑designed randomised trials that follow babies for longer periods, include both term and pre‑term infants, and directly compare sucrose with other soothing techniques. This will help clinicians choose the most effective and safest method to ease heel‑lance pain in newborns.",

Additional improvements: 1) Reduce passive voice (26 instances, beyond P90) to improve clarity; 2) Lower noun density (194 nouns, beyond P90) by using more verbs; 3) Simplify long, complex words (142 complex words, 206 long words, 334 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words – all beyond P90) to meet typical PLS readability. Suggested rewrites are provided below.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count and structural requirements, but metric analysis shows deviations: passive_voice (26, BEYOND_P90), nouns (194, P90), smog_index (13.9, P90), dale_chall_readability (8.2, P90), complex_words_dc (334, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (142, BEYOND_P90), long_words (206, BEYOND_P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy sentences, and high lexical complexity, which should be reduced to align with typical PLS patterns."
