  "draft": "Does giving sweet sugar solution (sucrose) reduce pain from heel‑prick tests in newborn babies?\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n- Giving sweet sugar solution (sucrose) probably reduces pain in newborn babies during heel‑prick tests, as shown by lower infant pain scores (PIPP scores, a standard measure of newborn pain) shortly after the procedure; no unwanted side effects (adverse events) were reported, and the evidence comes from many studies and is fairly reliable.\n- When sucrose is compared with other soothing methods such as non‑nutritive sucking (sucking on a dummy without milk), breastfeeding, glucose, or skin‑to‑skin care, the benefit is unclear and the evidence for these comparisons is uncertain.\n- Future research should include well‑designed studies that examine longer‑term outcomes, different groups of newborns, and direct comparisons between sucrose and other pain‑relief approaches to clarify which methods work best.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nWhy is pain from heel‑lance procedures a concern for newborn babies?\nWhen a baby is born, doctors often need a tiny drop of blood to check for health problems. They get this sample by quickly pricking the baby's heel – a test called a \"heel‑lance\". Even though the prick is very small, it can cause noticeable pain and distress for both full‑term and pre‑term newborns. Repeated painful experiences early in life may affect a baby's comfort, sleep, and even how they respond to pain later on. Because babies cannot tell us how they feel, clinicians use special pain‑rating tools such as the PIPP (Premature Infant Pain Profile) and NIPS (Neonatal Infant Pain Scale) to measure facial expressions, crying, and physiological signs. To make the procedure less painful, many non‑drug methods are used, including giving a small amount of sweet liquid (like sucrose), letting the baby suck on a pacifier (non‑nutritive sucking, NNS), breastfeeding, skin‑to‑skin contact, music, or gentle holding techniques.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out about using sucrose for pain relief?\nThe review set out to determine whether giving babies a tiny dose of sucrose (table sugar) before a heel‑lance helps reduce their pain. Specifically, the authors wanted to compare sucrose with other options such as water or no treatment, with other soothing methods like NNS, breastfeeding, glucose, or skin‑to‑skin care, and to see if adding sucrose to these methods makes a difference. They examined both the immediate pain scores recorded right after the prick and any longer‑term outcomes, using evidence from randomised controlled trials involving over 6,000 infants.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched for studies that examined sucrose versus other treatments for heel‑lance pain in newborns, pooled the findings, and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nRESULTS\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 55 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 6,273 newborn babies. The studies looked at infants of different ages – 29 trials included only full‑term babies, 22 included only pre‑term babies and four included both groups. All babies were undergoing a heel‑lance procedure, and some trials also examined other minor painful procedures. The interventions tested were a range of pain‑relief methods given before or during the heel‑lance, such as sucrose, water, placebo, non‑nutritive sucking, sucrose combined with non‑nutritive sucking, glucose, breastfeeding, expressed breast milk, laser acupuncture, facilitated tucking, and skin‑to‑skin care with water. The abstract did not give details about how long the studies lasted, where they were conducted, or how they were funded.\n\nMain results: Sucrose reduces pain after heel lance\nThe review found that giving sucrose \"probably\" lowers pain scores after a heel‑lance when compared with giving no treatment or water. Sucrose also probably reduces pain compared with non‑nutritive sucking alone. For many other comparisons the evidence was less clear: sucrose may make little or no difference to pain when compared with glucose, expressed breast milk, or skin‑to‑skin care with water, and it is unclear whether sucrose has any effect compared with breastfeeding, laser acupuncture, or facilitated tucking.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.\n\nCURRENCY\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical style checks: several section headings are not phrased as questions (e.g., “METHODS”, “LIMITATIONS”, “CURRENCY”), which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text contains multiple clarity problems that would confuse readers:\n1. **Passive‑voice overload** – e.g., “The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.” Passive constructions obscure who did what and the evaluation shows 24 passive instances (well above the typical PLS range, BEYOND_P90). Rewrite as active: “We searched the literature up to February 2022.”\n2. **Very long sentences** – e.g., “We identified 55 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 6,273 newborn babies.” (25+ words; the overall average is 25.4 words per sentence, beyond the P90 benchmark). Split into shorter sentences: “We identified 55 randomised controlled trials. Together, they enrolled 6,273 newborn babies.”\n3. **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – e.g., “The abstract did not give details about how long the studies lasted, where they were conducted, or how they were funded.” This sentence packs many nouns, contributing to the high noun count (193, BEYOND_P90). Use more verbs: “The abstract omitted details on study duration, location, and funding.”\n4. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as “PIPP scores”, “NIPS”, “moderate‑certainty evidence” appear without simple definitions. Add brief explanations: “PIPP scores (a standard pain scale that looks at facial expression, crying, and heart rate)”.\n5. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – change headings to questions, e.g., “How did we find the evidence?” (instead of “METHODS”), “What are the limitations of the evidence?” (instead of “LIMITATIONS”), and “How up‑to‑date is this review?” (instead of “CURRENCY”).\nAddressing these five points will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients.\n\nMetrics support: the draft’s readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 49.9, ARI 13.7), but the high counts of passive voice, long sentences, nouns, complex and long words (all beyond the 90th percentile) explain the identified clarity issues.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "Overall the draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (FRE, ARI, SMOG) fall within typical PLS ranges. However, six metrics deviate markedly: words_per_sentence (25.4, >P90), passive_voice (24, >P90), nouns (193, >P90), complex_words_dc (293, >P90), complex_words (120, >P90) and long_words (199, >P90). These indicate overly long, noun‑heavy, and passive constructions that reduce clarity."
