  "draft": "\"Does closing the small gaps (mesenteric defects) in the tissue that holds the intestines lower the chance of internal hernia after gastric bypass (Roux‑en‑Y) surgery?\n\nKey messages\n– We found that stitching the small gaps (mesenteric defects) made during Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass probably cuts the risk of an internal hernia (a serious bowel problem where part of the intestine slips into a space) by about two‑thirds.  \n– The studies did not show a clear increase in overall complications within 30 days, death within 30 days, or problems during the operation when the gaps were stitched.  \n– The evidence is very uncertain about whether stitching the gaps makes the hospital stay longer, because only three small trials are available.\n\nWhy is internal hernia a concern after gastric bypass surgery?\nPeople with severe obesity sometimes have weight‑loss surgery called Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass (RYGB). In this operation a small stomach pouch is made and the small intestine is rerouted. The rerouting creates small gaps, called mesenteric defects (the openings in the tissue that holds the intestines). If a loop of intestine slips through one of these gaps, it can become trapped – an internal hernia. An internal hernia can block the bowel, cause severe pain, cut off blood supply, and even lead to death. Some surgeons stitch (close) the gaps to prevent this, but stitching might also kink in the connection (anastomosis) between intestinal segments, which could cause a new blockage.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to find out?\nWe compared two approaches used during RYGB: (1) closing the mesenteric defects with stitches and (2) leaving the defects open. We wanted to know whether closing the gaps reduces the chance of an internal hernia with bowel obstruction over the long term (up to 10 years) and whether it changes other outcomes such as overall complications within 30 days, death within 30 days, problems during the operation, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases – CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, OpenGrey, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP – for randomised controlled trials. These trials compared closing versus not closing mesenteric defects in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) who had laparoscopic or robotic RYGB. We also screened reference lists, contacted study authors for missing data, and assessed each trial’s risk of bias. We combined the results with a random‑effects meta‑analysis and rated our confidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three‑year randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 3,010 participants. All three trials compared closing the mesenteric defects during surgery with leaving them open. One trial used stitches that do not dissolve and are placed separately; the other two used stitches that do not dissolve and are placed continuously. The reports did not give details about how long participants were followed, their ages, sex, or the countries where the studies were done. The review itself had no dedicated funding.\n\nWhat are the main results of closing the mesenteric defects?\n– Closing the defects probably reduces the risk of internal hernia with bowel obstruction (risk ratio ≈ 0.3).  \n– Closing the defects probably makes little or no difference to the overall chance of complications within 30 days (risk ratio ≈ 1.1).  \n– We are very uncertain whether closing the gaps changes 30‑day postoperative mortality, intra‑operative complications, or the length of hospital stay. The evidence suggests a possible slight increase in stay, but confidence is low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in these findings because only three small trials are available and the participants and surgical techniques differed across studies. This limits our ability to be certain about the true benefits and harms of closing the gaps.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched for relevant studies up to August 2024, so the evidence reflects research available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical checks: (1) a factual error – it calls the studies \"three‑year randomised controlled trials\" instead of the correct \"three randomised controlled trials\" (3,010 participants). (2) Subheading format – the heading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, which breaches the style guide requirement that all subheadings be questions. (3) Several clarity and style issues would confuse readers, such as unexplained jargon, overly long sentences, and noun‑heavy phrasing. Suggested improvements: \n1. Quote: \"We identified three‑year randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 3,010 participants.\" \n   Issue: Incorrect description of the studies. \n   Rewrite: \"We identified three randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 3,010 participants.\"\n2. Quote: \"Key messages\" \n   Issue: Not a question. \n   Rewrite: \"What are the key messages?\"\n3. Quote: \"The reports did not give details about how long participants were followed, their ages, sex distribution, the countries where the studies were done, or the funding sources for the individual trials.\" \n   Issue: Very long sentence; hard to follow. \n   Rewrite: \"The reports did not provide details on follow‑up length, participants' ages or sex, the countries where the trials were conducted, or the funding sources for each study.\"\n4. Quote: \"mesenteric defects (the openings in the tissue that holds the intestines)\" \n   Issue: Technical term introduced without a simple definition for lay readers. \n   Rewrite: \"mesenteric defects – small openings in the tissue that holds the intestines together.\"\n5. Quote: \"Closing the defects probably reduces the risk of internal hernia with bowel obstruction (risk ratio ≈ 0.3).\" \n   Issue: Uses passive phrasing and technical risk‑ratio notation. \n   Rewrite: \"Closing the gaps probably cuts the risk of an internal hernia with bowel blockage by about 70% (risk ratio about 0.3).\"\nThese changes address factual accuracy, subheading style, and the most confusing sentences. Metrics support the need for simplification: the draft shows high noun count (172, P90), many complex words (121, P90) and a high Dale‑Chall score (8.28, P90), indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical PLS. Reducing nouns, simplifying vocabulary, and breaking long sentences will improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits and has good readability scores (Flesch Reading Ease 56, P75). However, it deviates on several lexical metrics: nouns (172, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.28, P90), complex words (121, P90), long words (192, P90) and especially complex words (Dale‑Chall) at 306 (BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words, supporting the recommendation to simplify language and reduce noun‑heavy constructions."
