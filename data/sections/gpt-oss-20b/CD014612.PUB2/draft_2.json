  "draft": "\"Does closing the small gaps (mesenteric defects) in the tissue that holds the intestines lower the chance of internal hernia after gastric bypass (Roux‑en‑Y) surgery?\"\n\nKey messages\n- Stitching the small gaps (mesenteric defects) made during Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass probably reduces the risk of an internal hernia, where a loop of intestine slips into a space.\n- The available trials do not show a clear increase in short‑term overall complications, death within 30 days, or problems during the operation when the gaps are closed.\n- Evidence is very uncertain about whether closing the gaps lengthens the hospital stay, and the overall confidence in the findings is low because only a few small studies are available.\n\nWhy is internal hernia a concern after gastric bypass surgery?\nPeople with severe obesity sometimes undergo Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass (RYGB), a weight‑loss operation that creates a small stomach pouch and reroutes the small intestine. This rerouting creates small gaps, called mesenteric defects, in the tissue that holds the intestines (the mesentery). If a loop of intestine slips through one of these gaps, it can become trapped – an internal hernia. An internal hernia can block the bowel, cause severe pain, cut off blood supply, and even lead to death. Some surgeons stitch (close) the gaps to prevent this, but stitching might also cause a kink in the connection (anastomosis) between intestinal segments, which could create a new blockage. We do not yet know whether the benefit of preventing hernias outweighs the possible harm of new blockages.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to find out?\nWe compared two approaches used during RYGB: (1) closing the mesenteric defects with stitches and (2) leaving the defects open. We wanted to know whether closing the gaps reduces the chance of an internal hernia with bowel obstruction over the long term (up to 10 years) and whether it changes other outcomes such as overall complications within 30 days, death within 30 days, problems during the operation, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, OpenGrey, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP) for randomised controlled trials that compared closure versus non‑closure of mesenteric defects in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) undergoing laparoscopic or robotic RYGB. We screened reference lists, contacted study authors for missing data, and assessed each trial’s risk of bias. We combined the results using a random‑effects meta‑analysis and rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 3,010 participants. All trials compared closing the mesenteric defects during surgery with leaving them open. One trial used a non‑absorbable interrupted suture; the other two used non‑absorbable running sutures. The reports did not provide details on follow‑up length, participants’ ages, sex distribution, or country of conduct, and the review itself had no dedicated funding.\n\nWhat are the main results of closing the mesenteric defects?\n- Closing the defects probably leads to a large reduction in the risk of internal hernia with bowel obstruction (risk ratio ≈ 0.3).  \n- Closing the defects probably makes little or no difference to the overall chance of complications within 30 days (risk ratio ≈ 1.1).  \n- The effect on 30‑day postoperative mortality, intra‑operative complications, and length of hospital stay remains unclear; the evidence is very uncertain and suggests a possible slight increase in hospital stay.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in these findings because only three small trials are available, and the participants and surgical techniques differed across studies. This limits our ability to be certain about the true benefits and harms of closing the gaps.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched for relevant studies up to August 2024, so the evidence reflects research available at that time.",

Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Missing Limitations section** – the draft jumps from main results to currentness without discussing the low confidence and variability of the studies. Add a clear limitations paragraph.\n2. **Overly long sentence in Methods** – \"We searched databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, OpenGrey, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP) for randomised controlled trials that compared closure versus non‑closure of mesenteric defects in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) undergoing laparoscopic or robotic RYGB.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words and packs many details, making it hard to follow. Split into two shorter sentences.\n3. **Passive constructions that obscure agency** – e.g., \"The evidence is very uncertain about whether closing the gaps lengthens the hospital stay.\" Re‑phrase to active voice to clarify who is uncertain.\n4. **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – the draft contains many noun‑dense sentences (e.g., \"The reports did not provide details on follow‑up length, participants’ ages, sex distribution, or country of conduct\"). Replace some nouns with verbs to improve readability.\n5. **Complex and long words** – metrics show high counts of complex words (134, P90), long words (200, P90) and Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (297, BEYOND_P90). Simplify terminology where possible (e.g., replace “non‑absorbable interrupted suture” with “stitches that don’t dissolve”).\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Add Limitations: \"**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\\nWe have low confidence in these findings because only three small trials were available, and the participants and surgical techniques differed across studies. This limits our ability to be certain about the true benefits and harms of closing the gaps.\"\n- Split Methods sentence: \"We searched several databases – CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, OpenGrey, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP – for randomised controlled trials. These trials compared closing versus not closing mesenteric defects in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) who had laparoscopic or robotic RYGB.\"\n- Active voice for uncertainty: \"We are very uncertain whether closing the gaps lengthens the hospital stay.\"\n- Reduce noun density: change \"The reports did not provide details on follow‑up length, participants’ ages, sex distribution, or country of conduct\" to \"The reports did not give details about how long participants were followed, their ages, sex, or the countries where the studies were done.\"\n- Simplify complex terms: replace \"non‑absorbable interrupted suture\" with \"stitches that do not dissolve and are placed separately\".\n\nMetrics support these suggestions: the draft has a high noun count (182, P90) and many complex/long words (complex_words = 134, long_words = 200, both P90), as well as a very high Dale‑Chall score (8.22, BEYOND_P90). Reducing these will bring the text closer to typical PLS patterns and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit but deviates on several linguistic fronts: nouns (182, P90), SMOG index (13.7, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.22, BEYOND_P90), complex words (134, P90), long words (200, P90), and complex Dale‑Chall words (297, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words, reducing readability. Other metrics (Flesch reading ease 52.9, active voice 68) are acceptable.
