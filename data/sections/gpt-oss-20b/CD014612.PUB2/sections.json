  "key_messages": [
    "Closing the small gaps (mesenteric defects – the openings in the tissue that holds the intestines) that are created during Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass (a type of weight‑loss surgery) may lower the chance of developing an internal hernia (a serious bowel problem where part of the intestine slips into a space) compared with leaving the gaps open. The available studies do not show a clear increase in short‑term overall complications (unwanted problems after surgery), mortality (death), or intra‑operative problems (issues that occur during the operation), but the evidence is limited and uncertain.",
    "The evidence also suggests that closing the gaps might lead to a slightly longer stay in hospital after surgery, although this finding is very uncertain.",
    "Because the current evidence comes from only a few trials with limited size and follow‑up, more well‑ designed, larger studies are needed to confirm the benefits, clarify any potential harms, and determine the impact on recovery time after surgery."

      "subheading": "Why is internal hernia a concern after gastric bypass surgery?",
      "content": "People with severe obesity sometimes have weight‑loss surgery called Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass (RYGB). In this operation a small stomach pouch is made and the small intestine is rerouted, which helps people lose weight. The rerouting creates small gaps, called mesenteric defects, in the tissue that holds the intestines (the mesentery). If a loop of intestine slips through one of these gaps, it can become trapped – this is an internal hernia. An internal hernia can block the bowel (small‑bowel obstruction), which is a medical emergency that can cause severe pain, loss of blood supply to the gut, and even death. Because of this risk, some surgeons stitch (close) the gaps during the operation, but stitching might also cause problems, such as kinking the connection (anastomosis) between intestinal segments, which could also lead to blockage. The balance of benefits (preventing hernias) versus harms (possible new blockages) is not well known."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to compare two surgical approaches used during RYGB: (1) closing the mesenteric defects with stitches and (2) leaving the defects open. The authors wanted to know whether closing the gaps reduces the chance of an internal hernia with bowel obstruction over the long term (up to 10 years) and whether it changes the rates of other outcomes such as overall complications after surgery, death within 30 days, problems during the operation, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain. In short, the goal was to determine if closing the defects is more helpful than harmful for people undergoing gastric bypass."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified three randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 3,010 people with obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) who had laparoscopic or robotic Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass surgery. All three trials compared closing the mesenteric defects during surgery with leaving them open. One trial used a non‑absorbable interrupted suture and the other two used non‑absorbable running sutures. The abstract does not give details about how long participants were followed, their ages, sex distribution, the countries where the studies were done, or the funding sources for the individual trials. The review itself had no dedicated funding and no other studies on different closure methods, other bariatric procedures, or other patient groups were found."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Closing the mesenteric defects",
      "content": "Closing the mesenteric defects probably leads to a large reduction in the risk of internal hernia with bowel obstruction after gastric bypass surgery. It probably makes little or no difference to the overall chance of complications within 30 days after the operation. It is unclear whether closing the defects affects 30‑day postoperative mortality, intra‑operative complications, or the length of hospital stay."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
