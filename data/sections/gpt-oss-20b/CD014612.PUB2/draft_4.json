  "draft": "\"Does closing the small gaps (mesenteric defects) in the tissue that holds the intestines lower the chance of internal hernia after gastric bypass (Roux‑en‑Y) surgery?\"\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Closing the small gaps (mesenteric defects – the tiny openings in the tissue that holds the intestines together) probably cuts the risk of an internal hernia with bowel blockage by about 70 %.\n– The available studies do not show a clear increase in overall complications within 30 days, death within 30 days, or problems during the operation when the gaps are closed.\n– The evidence is very uncertain about whether closing the gaps makes the hospital stay longer, because only three small trials are available.\n\nWhy is internal hernia a concern after gastric bypass surgery?\nPeople with severe obesity sometimes have weight‑loss surgery called Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass (RYGB). In this operation a small stomach pouch is made and the small intestine is rerouted. The rerouting creates small gaps, called mesenteric defects, in the tissue that holds the intestines (the mesentery). If a loop of intestine slips through one of these gaps, it becomes trapped – an internal hernia. An internal hernia can block the bowel, cause severe pain, cut off blood supply, and even lead to death. Some surgeons stitch (close) the gaps to prevent this, but stitching might also kink the connection (anastomosis) between intestinal segments, which could cause a new blockage.\n\nWhat are the key messages?\nWhat did the researchers aim to find out?\nWe compared two approaches used during RYGB: (1) closing the mesenteric defects with stitches and (2) leaving the defects open. We wanted to know whether closing the gaps reduces the chance of an internal hernia with bowel obstruction over the long term (up to 10 years) and whether it changes other outcomes such as overall complications within 30 days, death within 30 days, problems during the operation, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, OpenGrey, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP for randomised controlled trials up to August 2024. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors for missing data. Two reviewers independently assessed each trial’s risk of bias and extracted data. We combined the results with a random‑effects meta‑analysis and rated our confidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 3,010 participants with obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) who had laparoscopic or robotic RYGB. All three trials compared closing the mesenteric defects with leaving them open. One trial used non‑absorbable interrupted stitches; the other two used non‑absorbable running stitches. The reports did not provide details on follow‑up length, participants’ ages or sex, the countries where the trials were conducted, or the funding sources for each study.\n\nWhat are the main results of closing the mesenteric defects?\n– Closing the gaps probably reduces the risk of internal hernia with bowel blockage (risk ratio about 0.3, meaning roughly a 70 % reduction).\n– Closing the gaps probably makes little or no difference to the overall chance of complications within 30 days (risk ratio about 1.1).\n– We are very uncertain whether closing the gaps changes 30‑day mortality, intra‑operative complications, or length of hospital stay. The limited evidence hints at a slight increase in stay, but confidence is low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have low confidence in these findings because only three small trials are available and the participants and surgical techniques differed across studies. This limits our ability to be certain about the true benefits and harms of closing the gaps.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched for relevant studies up to August 2024, so the evidence reflects research available at that time.",

(2) Technical terms such as “risk ratio”, “mean difference”, and “GRADE approach” are used without plain‑language explanations, which can alienate patients. (3) Several sentences are overly long and noun‑heavy, making them hard to follow (e.g., the methods description and the summary of trial participants). These issues impede patient understanding and need revision. Suggested improvements: • Replace the duplicate heading with a distinct question (e.g., “What did we find?”) and remove the second occurrence. • Explain jargon in simple terms (e.g., “risk ratio about 0.3 means the chance of an internal hernia was roughly one‑third as likely, a 70 % reduction”). • Split long sentences into shorter ones and use bullet points for the methods to improve readability.",
