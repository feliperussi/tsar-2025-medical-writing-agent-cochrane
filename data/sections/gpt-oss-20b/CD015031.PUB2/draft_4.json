  "draft": "\"Does a flipped‑over eye membrane (inverted ILM flap) close large macular holes better than removing the membrane (ILM peeling) during eye surgery?\"\n\nKey messages\n- The inverted ILM flap technique probably increases the chance that a large macular hole closes. It may also improve sharpness of vision a few months after surgery, and no serious eye complications were reported.\n- The technique probably adds about ten extra hole closures for every 100 surgeries and about five extra complete (type 1) closures for every 100 surgeries.\n- The evidence comes from four small trials with methodological limitations, so we need larger, well‑designed multicentre studies to confirm the benefits and monitor any harms.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why does it matter?  \nA macular hole is a small, full‑thickness break in the centre of the retina – the light‑sensing layer at the back of the eye. When this hole forms, people lose central vision, making reading, recognizing faces, or driving difficult. A “large” macular hole is wider than 400 µm (about the width of a thin human hair). Because the macula provides the sharpest vision, even a tiny defect can have a big impact on daily life.\n\nHow are large macular holes usually treated and what are the challenges?  \nThe most common surgery is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In PPV the surgeon removes the gel‑like fluid (vitreous) that fills the eye and then peels away a thin retinal layer called the internal limiting membrane (ILM). Peeling the ILM helps the hole edges come together. This works well for small holes but often fails for large holes, leaving patients with persistent vision loss. Some surgeons use an “inverted ILM flap” technique: instead of removing the ILM completely, they create a small flap and fold it back over the hole, providing a scaffold that may help the tissue heal.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare standard PPV with ILM peeling to PPV with the inverted ILM flap technique for large macular holes. Specifically, we examined whether the flap method improves visual outcomes (measured as best‑corrected visual acuity, BCVA, on a logMAR chart) and increases the rate of hole closure, while also checking safety.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases up to December 2022 for randomised controlled trials that directly compared the two surgical approaches in people with large macular holes. We combined the results of eligible trials and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified four randomised controlled trials involving 275 participants (285 eyes). Most participants were women (63%) and were aged between 60 and 66 years. The trials were conducted in India, Poland and Mexico and followed participants for up to 12 months. All trials compared standard PPV with ILM peeling to PPV with the inverted ILM flap. No serious eye complications were reported.\n\nThe inverted ILM flap technique probably improves vision three months after surgery compared with conventional peeling. It also probably increases the overall chance that the macular hole will close—about ten extra closures per 100 surgeries—and probably raises the chance of achieving a complete (type 1) closure by about five extra per 100 surgeries.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have limited confidence because the trials were small, often unmasked (participants and surgeons knew which treatment was used), and sometimes lacked complete outcome data. The studies also differed in whether cataract surgery was performed alongside PPV, which could affect results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched for relevant trials up to December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "Critical checks failed: the draft contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the absolute benefit for type 1 macular‑hole closure (the source reports a risk ratio of 1.31, not an increase of five per 100 surgeries). Additionally, the term “logMAR chart” is not explained for a lay audience, and the opening title uses the phrase “flipped‑over eye membrane”, which is jargon that may confuse readers. These issues, combined with a high SMOG index (13.9) and many complex/long words, reduce readability.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Incorrect absolute risk statement** – Quote: \"about five extra (type 1) closures per 100 surgeries.\" – Problem: The source provides a relative risk (RR = 1.31) not an absolute increase of five per 100; the statement misrepresents the evidence. – Rewrite: \"The inverted ILM flap technique probably increases the chance of a complete (type 1) closure in about 30 per 100 surgeries (RR = 1.31).\"\n2. **Unexplained jargon – logMAR** – Quote: \"best‑corrected visual acuity, BCVA, on a logMAR chart\" – Problem: Readers may not know what a logMAR chart is. – Rewrite: \"best‑corrected visual acuity (sharpness of vision measured with glasses) using a standard logMAR chart, a scale doctors use worldwide.\"\n3. **Jargon in title** – Quote: \"flipped‑over eye membrane (inverted ILM flap)\" – Problem: “flipped‑over eye membrane” is technical and unclear. – Rewrite: \"Does using a thin folded‑over retinal layer (inverted ILM flap) close large macular holes better than removing it (ILM peeling) during eye surgery?\"\n4. **Complex/long words** – The draft contains 130 complex words and 170 long words, raising the SMOG index to 13.9 (above typical PLS range). Simplify terms such as “pars plana vitrectomy” to “eye surgery (PPV)\", “idiopathic” to “of unknown cause\", and replace “utilize” with “use”.\n5. **Passive voice** – Although active voice is strong, there are still 16 passive constructions (e.g., \"No serious eye complications were reported\"). Rewrite to active: \"The studies reported no serious eye complications.\"\n\nMetrics support: The SMOG index (13.9) and counts of complex (130) and long words (170) are well above the median, confirming the need to simplify language. Passive voice count (16) is higher than the typical range, justifying the suggested active rewrites.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most structural guidelines, but deviates on readability metrics: SMOG index (13.9, P90), complex words (130, P90), and long words (170, P90) are higher than typical PLS values, indicating the text is more complex than usual. Passive voice is also elevated (16, P75). These metric deviations align with the editorial recommendations to simplify wording and increase active constructions."
