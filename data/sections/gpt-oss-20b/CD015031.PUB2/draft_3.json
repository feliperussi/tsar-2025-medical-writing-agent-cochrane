  "draft": "Is a flipped‑over thin eye membrane (inverted internal limiting membrane flap) more effective than removing that membrane (conventional internal limiting membrane peeling) during eye surgery (pars plana vitrectomy) for closing large central retinal holes (large macular holes)?\n\nKey messages\n- The inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique probably gives a higher chance that a large macular hole closes and may improve vision a few months after surgery; the studies reported no serious eye complications.\n- It probably raises overall hole‑closure rates by about ten more closures per hundred surgeries and increases type 1 (complete, stable) closure by roughly thirty more per hundred surgeries.\n- The evidence comes from four small trials with methodological limitations, so we need larger, well‑designed multicentre studies to confirm benefits and monitor harms.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why does it matter?\nA macular hole is a small, full‑thickness break in the centre of the retina – the part of the eye that captures sharp, detailed images. When this hole forms, people lose central vision, making reading, recognizing faces, or driving difficult. A “large” macular hole is wider than 400 µm (about the width of a thin human hair) at its narrowest point. Because the macula provides the sharpest vision, even a tiny defect can have a big impact on daily life.\n\nHow are large macular holes usually treated and what are the challenges?\nThe most common surgery is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In PPV the surgeon removes the gel‑like fluid (vitreous) that fills the eye and then peels away a thin retinal layer called the internal limiting membrane (ILM). Peeling the ILM helps the hole edges come together. This works well for small holes but often fails for large holes, leaving patients with persistent vision loss. Some surgeons use an “inverted ILM flap” technique: instead of removing the ILM completely, they create a small flap and fold it back over the hole, providing a scaffold that may help the tissue heal.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare standard PPV with ILM peeling to PPV with the inverted ILM flap technique for large macular holes. Specifically, we examined whether the flap method improves visual outcomes (measured as best‑corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, on a logMAR chart – a chart that measures how clearly you can see letters at a distance) and increases the rate of hole closure, while also checking safety.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases up to December 2022 for randomised controlled trials that directly compared the two surgical approaches in people with large macular holes. We combined the results of eligible trials and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified four randomised controlled trials involving 275 participants (285 eyes). Most participants were women (63%) and were aged between 60 and 66 years. The trials were conducted in India, Poland and Mexico and followed participants for up to 12 months. All trials compare standard PPV with ILM peeling to PPV with the inverted ILM flap. The studies reported no serious eye complications.\n\nThe inverted ILM flap technique probably improves vision three months after surgery compared with conventional peeling. It also probably raises the overall chance that the macular hole will close—about ten more closures per hundred surgeries. It probably increases the chance of a type 1 (complete, stable) closure by roughly thirty more per hundred surgeries.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence because the trials were small, often unmasked (participants and surgeons knew which treatment was used), and sometimes lacked complete outcome data. The studies also differed in whether cataract surgery was performed alongside PPV, which could affect results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched for relevant trials up to December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

It may also improve vision a few months after surgery, and no serious eye complications were reported.\"\n3. **Risk phrasing that may be misinterpreted** – \"It probably raises overall hole‑closure rates by about ten more closures per hundred surgeries and increases type 1 (complete, stable) closure by roughly thirty more per hundred surgeries.\" Readers may not understand whether these are absolute or relative differences. *Rewrite*: \"It probably leads to about ten extra hole closures for every 100 surgeries and about thirty extra type 1 (complete, stable) closures for every 100 surgeries.\"\nThese issues, together with the metric analysis showing unusually high noun count (160, P90), complex words (143, P90), long words (198, P90) and especially complex‑word‑density (297, beyond P90), indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words, which further reduces readability for a lay audience.
