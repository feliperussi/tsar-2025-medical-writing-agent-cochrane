  "draft": "Is a flipped‑over thin eye membrane (inverted internal limiting membrane flap) more effective than removing that membrane (conventional internal limiting membrane peeling) during eye surgery (pars plana vitrectomy) for closing large central retinal holes (large macular holes)?\n\nKey messages\n- We found that the inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique probably gives a higher chance of hole closure and may improve best‑corrected visual acuity (sharpness of vision measured with glasses) a few months after surgery, with no serious eye complications reported.\n- The four studies we analysed were small, often done at a single centre, and had some methodological weaknesses, so our confidence in the results is limited.\n- We recommend larger, well‑designed multicentre trials with longer follow‑up to confirm any benefits and to monitor for possible harms.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why does it matter?\nA macular hole is a small, full‑thickness break in the centre of the retina – the part of the eye that captures sharp, detailed images. When this hole forms, people lose central vision, making reading, recognizing faces, or driving difficult. A “large” macular hole is wider than 400 µm (about the width of a thin human hair) at its narrowest point. Because the macula provides the sharpest vision, even a tiny defect can have a big impact on daily life.\n\nHow are large macular holes usually treated and what are the challenges?\nThe most common surgery is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In PPV the surgeon removes the gel‑like fluid (vitreous) that fills the eye and then peels away a thin retinal layer called the internal limiting membrane (ILM). Peeling the ILM helps the hole edges come together. This works well for small holes but often fails for large holes, leaving patients with persistent vision loss. Some surgeons use an “inverted ILM flap” technique: instead of removing the ILM completely, they create a small flap and fold it back over the hole, providing a scaffold that may help the tissue heal.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare standard PPV with ILM peeling to PPV with the inverted ILM flap technique for large macular holes. Specifically, we looked at whether the flap method improves visual outcomes (measured as best‑corrected visual acuity on a logMAR chart – a chart that measures how sharp vision is) and increases the rate of hole closure, while also checking safety.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched databases up to December 2022 for randomised controlled trials that directly compared the two surgical approaches in people with large macular holes. We combined the results of the eligible trials and assessed the certainty of the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified four randomised controlled trials involving 275 participants (285 eyes). Most participants were women (63%) and were aged between 60 and 66 years. The trials were conducted in India, Poland and Mexico and followed participants for up to 12 months. All trials compared standard PPV with ILM peeling to PPV with the inverted ILM flap. No serious eye complications were reported.\n\nThe inverted ILM flap technique probably improves visual acuity three months after surgery compared with conventional peeling. It also probably raises the overall chance of hole closure by about ten more closures per hundred surgeries and increases the chance of achieving a type 1 closure (a complete, stable closure) by about five more per hundred surgeries.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence because the trials were small, often unmasked (participants and surgeons knew which treatment was used), and sometimes lacked complete outcome data. The studies also varied in whether cataract surgery was performed alongside PPV, which could affect results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched for relevant trials up to December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

The source reports a risk ratio of 1.31 (≈31 more closures per 100 surgeries), but the draft says “about five per hundred”, which understates the effect and is factually inaccurate.\n\nAdditional clarity and style issues to address:\n1. **Inaccurate magnitude statement** – \"about five more per hundred patients\" is wrong. Rewrite to: \"about 30 more per hundred surgeries\" (or \"around a 30% increase\").\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"It also probably raises the overall chance that the macular hole will close—about ten more closures per hundred surgeries—and probably raises the chance of achieving a type 1 macular‑hole closure by about five more per hundred patients.\" This exceeds 30 words and mixes two ideas. Rewrite as two shorter sentences: \"It also probably raises the overall chance that the macular hole will close—about ten more closures per hundred surgeries. It probably increases the chance of a type 1 closure by roughly 30 per hundred surgeries.\"\n3. **Passive voice** – \"No serious eye complications were reported.\" Change to active: \"The studies reported no serious eye complications.\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – \"The inverted ILM flap technique probably improves visual acuity three months after surgery compared with conventional peeling.\" Replace noun‑>verb: \"The inverted ILM flap technique probably improves vision three months after surgery compared with conventional peeling.\"\n5. **Technical term without plain explanation** – \"logMAR chart\" appears only once and may still be unclear. Add a brief definition: \"a logMAR chart, which measures how clearly you can see letters at a distance.\"\n\nMetrics support these suggestions: the draft shows unusually high noun count (158, P90), smog index (14.3, P90), complex words (141, P90) and long words (189, P90), indicating dense, noun‑heavy language. Passive voice count is 18 (P75), confirming excess passive constructions. Reducing these will improve readability and align the text with typical PLS patterns.",

Passive voice is also high (18, P‑75). These metric deviations corroborate the identified clarity and style issues."
