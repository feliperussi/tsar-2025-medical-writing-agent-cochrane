  "plain_title": "Is a flipped‑over thin eye membrane (inverted internal limiting membrane flap) more effective than removing that membrane (conventional internal limiting membrane peeling) during eye surgery (pars plana vitrectomy) for closing large central retinal holes (large macular holes)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "The inverted internal limiting membrane flap technique (a method where a thin retinal layer is folded back over the hole) probably leads to a higher chance that a large macular hole (a hole in the central retina) closes and may result in better best‑corrected visual acuity (sharpness of vision measured with glasses) after a few months, and no serious eye complications were reported in the studies.",
    "The available studies were small, often done at a single centre, and had some methodological limitations, so the overall confidence in these findings is limited.",
    "Future research should include larger, well‑designed multicentre trials with longer follow‑up to confirm any benefits and to monitor for possible harms."

      "subheading": "What is a macular hole and why does it matter?",
      "content": "A macular hole is a small, full‑thickness break in the centre of the retina – the part of the eye that captures sharp, detailed images. When this hole forms, people lose central vision, making activities such as reading, recognizing faces, or driving difficult. A \"large\" macular hole is defined as being wider than 400 micrometres (about the width of a thin human hair) at its narrowest point. Because the macula is responsible for the sharpest vision, even a tiny defect can have a big impact on daily life."

    {
      "subheading": "How are large macular holes usually treated and what are the challenges?",
      "content": "The most common surgery for macular holes is called pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In this procedure the surgeon removes the gel‑like fluid (vitreous) that fills the eye and then peels away a thin layer of tissue on the retina called the internal limiting membrane (ILM). Removing the ILM helps the edges of the hole come together and close. While PPV with ILM peeling works well for small holes, it often fails to close larger holes, leaving patients with persistent vision loss. To try to improve success, some surgeons use an \"inverted ILM flap\" technique: instead of completely removing the ILM, they create a small flap and fold it back over the hole, providing a scaffold that may help the tissue heal."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to compare two surgical approaches for large macular holes – the standard PPV with ILM peeling versus PPV with the inverted ILM flap technique. Specifically, they looked at whether the flap method leads to better visual outcomes (measured as best‑corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, on a logMAR chart) and higher rates of hole closure, while also assessing safety."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared pars plana vitrectomy with an inverted internal limiting membrane flap to conventional internal limiting membrane peeling for large macular holes, selecting randomized controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatment groups). We combined their results to assess visual and anatomical outcomes and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We included four randomized controlled trials involving 275 participants (285 eyes) with large idiopathic macular holes (basal diameter >400 µm). Most participants were women (63%) and were aged between about 60 and 66 years. The trials were conducted in three countries: two in India, one in Poland, and one in Mexico. All studies compared standard pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with conventional internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling to PPV using the inverted ILM flap technique. Follow‑up ranged up to 12 months, with some studies also performing cataract surgery alongside PPV. No conflicts of interest or external funding were reported for any of the trials."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Visual acuity and macular‑hole closure",
      "content": "The inverted ILM flap technique probably improves visual acuity three months after surgery compared with conventional peeling. It also probably increases the overall chance that the macular hole will close—about ten more closures per hundred surgeries—and probably raises the chance of achieving a type 1 macular‑hole closure by about five more per hundred patients."

  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to December 2022 of search."
