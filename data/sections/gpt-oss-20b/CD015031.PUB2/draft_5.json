  "draft": "Does using a thin folded‑over retinal layer (inverted ILM flap) close large macular holes better than removing it (ILM peeling) during eye surgery?\n\nKey messages\n– The inverted ILM flap technique probably raises the chance that a large macular hole closes and may improve sharpness of vision a few months after surgery.  \n– It probably increases overall hole closure by about ten extra closures per 100 surgeries and boosts complete (type 1) closure by roughly 30 % – about 30 per 100 surgeries (RR = 1.31).  \n– The evidence comes from four small trials with some methodological limits, so larger, well‑designed studies are needed to confirm benefits and monitor harms.\n\nWhat is a macular hole and why does it matter?  \nA macular hole is a small, full‑thickness break in the centre of the retina – the light‑sensing layer at the back of the eye. When this hole forms, people lose central vision, making reading, recognizing faces, or driving difficult. A “large” macular hole is wider than 400 µm (about the width of a thin human hair). Because the macula provides the sharpest vision, even a tiny defect can have a big impact on daily life.\n\nHow are large macular holes usually treated and what are the challenges?  \nThe most common surgery is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). In PPV the surgeon removes the gel‑like fluid (vitreous) that fills the eye and then peels away a thin retinal layer called the internal limiting membrane (ILM). Peeling the ILM helps the hole edges come together. This works well for small holes but often fails for large holes, leaving patients with persistent vision loss. Some surgeons use an “inverted ILM flap” technique: instead of removing the ILM completely, they create a small flap and fold it back over the hole, providing a scaffold that may help the tissue heal.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare standard PPV with ILM peeling to PPV with the inverted ILM flap technique for large macular holes. Specifically, we examined whether the flap method improves visual outcomes (sharpness of vision measured with glasses, using a standard logMAR chart – a scale doctors use worldwide) and increases the rate of hole closure, while also checking safety.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases up to December 2022 for randomised controlled trials that directly compared the two surgical approaches in people with large macular holes. We combined the results of eligible trials and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified four randomised controlled trials involving 275 participants (285 eyes). Most participants were women (63 %) and were aged between 60 and 66 years. The trials were conducted in India, Poland and Mexico and followed participants for up to 12 months. No serious eye complications were reported.\n\nThe inverted ILM flap technique probably improves vision three months after surgery compared with conventional peeling. It also probably increases the overall chance that the macular hole will close – about ten extra closures per 100 surgeries – and probably raises the chance of achieving a complete (type 1) closure by roughly 30 % (about 30 per 100 surgeries, RR = 1.31).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have limited confidence because the trials were small, often unmasked (participants and surgeons knew which treatment was used), and sometimes lacked complete outcome data. The studies also differed in whether cataract surgery was performed alongside PPV, which could affect results.\n\nWhat next?  \nWe need larger, well‑designed multicentre trials with longer follow‑up to confirm any benefits and to monitor for possible harms.",
