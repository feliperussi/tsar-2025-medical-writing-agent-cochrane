  "draft": "Is a programmed dose given at set times (automated mandatory bolus) better than a steady drip (continuous infusion) for epidural pain relief (pain relief through a tube placed in the back) during labour?\n\nKey messages\n- Using an automated mandatory bolus (AMB) reduces breakthrough pain – about 30 fewer women per 1,000 experience pain that needs extra medication or anaesthetist help – and it lowers the amount of local anaesthetic (the drug that blocks pain) used.\n- AMB may increase maternal satisfaction with pain relief, and it does not change the rates of Caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery (forceps or vacuum), the overall length of labour analgesia, or newborn Apgar scores (a quick health check after birth).\n- The evidence is of moderate certainty, meaning the findings are fairly reliable but not definitive; larger, well‑designed studies are still needed.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare AMB with basal infusion (BI), a continuous steady drip, for maintaining epidural analgesia in women at term. Specifically we asked whether AMB:\n- Reduces the number of women who have breakthrough pain needing anaesthetist help;\n- Affects the rates of Caesarean or instrumental delivery;\n- Changes the total amount of local anaesthetic used, the length of labour, maternal satisfaction after birth, or newborn Apgar scores.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, WHO‑ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 31 December 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors for unpublished data. We included randomised controlled trials that compared AMB with BI for labour epidural analgesia. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results in meta‑analyses and rated confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 18 trials involving 4 590 healthy women at term. Thirteen trials enrolled only first‑time mothers; the others included both first‑time and experienced mothers. All trials compared AMB with BI; some also allowed patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) on top of the assigned regimen. The studies used various drug mixes (ropivacaine, levobupivacaine or bupivacaine combined with fentanyl or sufentanil).\n\n- Breakthrough pain: AMB probably reduces breakthrough pain (risk ratio 0.71). This translates to about 30 fewer women per 1 000 experiencing pain that needs extra medication.\n- Local anaesthetic use: AMB probably lowers hourly local anaesthetic consumption by roughly 0.8 mg (in bupivacaine equivalents).\n- Caesarean delivery: AMB makes little or no difference (risk ratio 0.85).\n- Instrumental delivery: AMB makes little or no difference (risk ratio 0.85).\n- Duration of labour analgesia: AMB makes little or no difference (average 9 minutes shorter, not statistically significant).\n- Maternal satisfaction: Narrative reports suggest AMB may increase satisfaction, but data were not pooled.\n- Newborn Apgar scores: AMB makes little or no difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the results. Some trials were not blinded, so participants and clinicians knew the assigned method. Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted. The studies varied in participant characteristics and delivery techniques, which adds uncertainty.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse patients: (1) the term “breakthrough pain” is used without a plain‑language definition; (2) statistical jargon such as “risk ratio 0.71” appears without explanation; (3) the first key‑message bullet is overly long and packed with parentheses, making it hard to follow; (4) many nominalisations and complex, long words increase reading difficulty (nominalisations = 21, smog = 14.1, complex_words = 120, long_words = 168) – all well above typical PLS ranges. These issues need to be rewritten before the summary can be approved. Suggested rewrites: - Define breakthrough pain: “Breakthrough pain – pain that returns despite the epidural and needs extra medication – …”. - Explain risk ratio: “The chance of needing extra pain relief was about 30% lower with AMB (the risk was 0.71 times that with a continuous drip).” - Split the first key‑message into two shorter bullets and replace parentheses with brief explanations. - Reduce nominalisations and replace long words with simpler alternatives (e.g., “we found” instead of “the review found”, “use” instead of “utilise”).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms overall to typical patterns but deviates on five metrics: nominalisation (21, beyond typical ≤13), smog index (14.1, above median 12.1), complex_words_dc (255, above median 160), complex_words (120, above median 84), and long_words (168, above median 122). These indicate higher lexical complexity than usual for Cochrane PLS texts."
