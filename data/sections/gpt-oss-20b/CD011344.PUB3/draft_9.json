  "draft": "Is a programmed dose given at set times (automated mandatory bolus) better than a steady drip (continuous infusion) for epidural pain relief during labour?\n\nKey messages\n- Using an automated mandatory bolus (AMB) reduces breakthrough pain – pain that needs extra medication or a doctor’s help – and lowers the amount of local anaesthetic (the drug that blocks pain signals) used.\n- Mothers often feel more satisfied with their pain relief when AMB is used.\n- AMB does not noticeably change the rates of Caesarean delivery (surgical birth), instrumental delivery (birth with forceps or vacuum), the length of labour analgesia, or the newborn’s Apgar scores (a quick health check after birth). The evidence is of moderate certainty, meaning we are reasonably sure of these findings but further research could change them.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and how is it given during labour?  \nDuring labour many women experience strong pain in the abdomen, pelvis and perineum. A common way to relieve this pain is an epidural, where medicines are injected into the “epidural space” – a small area just outside the spinal cord. The medicines usually include a local anaesthetic (a drug that blocks pain signals) and often an opioid (a pain‑relieving drug). Once the epidural catheter is in place, we can deliver the medication in two main ways:  \n- **Basal infusion (BI):** a continuous, steady flow of medication is given around the clock.  \n- **Automated mandatory bolus (AMB):** a set dose is automatically given at regular intervals (for example, every 30 minutes). Women can also give themselves extra doses when needed – this is called patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe compared AMB with BI in women at term. Specifically we asked whether AMB:  \n- Reduces the number of women who experience breakthrough pain that needs an anaesthetist’s help;  \n- Affects the rates of Caesarean delivery or instrumental delivery;  \n- Changes the total amount of local anaesthetic used, the length of labour, maternal satisfaction after birth, or newborn Apgar scores.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, WHO‑ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 31 December 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors for unpublished data. Two reviewers independently selected randomised trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results using meta‑analysis and rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 18 randomised trials that together enrolled 4 590 healthy women at term. Thirteen trials enrolled only first‑time mothers, and five included both first‑time and experienced mothers. Researchers started epidurals in different ways: seven trials used a combined spinal‑epidural, ten used a standard epidural, and one used a dural puncture epidural. Different drug mixes were used, such as ropivacaine‑fentanyl, ropivacaine‑sufentanil, levobupivacaine‑fentanyl, levobupivacaine‑sufentanil and bupivacaine‑fentanyl.  \n\nOur analysis shows that AMB probably reduces breakthrough pain. About 30 fewer women per 1 000 experience breakthrough pain with AMB than with BI. AMB also probably lowers local anaesthetic use by roughly 0.8 mg per hour. AMB probably makes little or no difference to Caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, or the overall duration of labour analgesia. Narrative data suggest that AMB may increase maternal satisfaction, and all studies reported no difference in newborn Apgar scores.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate certainty in these results. Some trials were not blinded, so participants and clinicians knew which method was being used. Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted. The studies varied in participant characteristics and delivery techniques, adding uncertainty.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe searched the literature up to December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms to most typical PLS patterns (66.7% of features in best quartile) but shows deviations in six metrics: high passive voice (22, beyond P90), high noun count (182, beyond P90), SMOG index 14.5 (beyond P90), many complex Dale‑Chall words (282, beyond P90), many complex words (133, beyond P90) and many long words (179, beyond P90). These suggest the text is more noun‑heavy and uses longer, less familiar words than typical PLS, supporting the need to simplify language and increase active voice."
