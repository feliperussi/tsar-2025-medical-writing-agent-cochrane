  "draft": "Is a programmed dose (automated mandatory bolus) better than a steady drip (continuous infusion) for epidural pain relief during labour?\n\nKey messages\n- An automated mandatory bolus (AMB) likely reduces breakthrough pain – about 30 fewer women per 1,000 compared with a continuous basal infusion (BI) – and uses roughly 0.8 mg less local anaesthetic per hour.  \n- AMB may increase how satisfied mothers feel about their pain relief.  \n- AMB makes little or no difference to the rates of Caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, the overall length of labour analgesia, or newborn Apgar scores. We are moderately confident in these findings, meaning the evidence is fairly reliable but could change with new research.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and how is it given during labour?  \nDuring labour many women experience strong pain in the abdomen, pelvis and perineum. An epidural relieves this pain by injecting medicines into the “epidural space” – a small area just outside the spinal cord. The medicines usually include a local anaesthetic (a drug that blocks pain signals) and often an opioid (a pain‑relieving drug). Once a thin catheter is placed, the medication can be delivered in two main ways:  \n\n- **Basal infusion (BI):** a continuous, steady flow of medication is given around the clock.  \n- **Automated mandatory bolus (AMB):** a set dose is automatically given at regular intervals (for example, every 30 minutes). Women can also give themselves extra doses when needed – this is called patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe compared AMB with BI in women ≥ 37 weeks’ gestation. Specifically we asked whether AMB:  \n\n- Reduces the number of women who experience breakthrough pain that needs an anaesthetist’s help;  \n- Affects the rates of Caesarean delivery or instrumental delivery (use of forceps or vacuum);  \n- Changes the total amount of local anaesthetic used, the length of labour, maternal satisfaction after birth, or newborn health as measured by Apgar scores.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, WHO‑ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 31 December 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors for unpublished data. Two reviewers independently selected randomised trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results with meta‑analysis and rated our confidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 18 randomised trials that together enrolled 4 590 healthy women at term. Thirteen trials enrolled only first‑time mothers; five included both first‑time and experienced mothers. Epidurals were started in different ways (combined spinal‑epidural, standard epidural or dural (DPE)) and used various drug mixes (ropivacaine‑fentanyl, ropivacaine‑sufentanil, levobupivacaine‑fentanyl, levobupivacaine‑sufentanil, bupivacaine‑fentanyl).  \n\nOur analysis suggests that AMB reduces breakthrough pain – about 30 fewer women per 1 000 compared with BI. It also lowers local anaesthetic consumption by roughly 0.8 mg per hour. For Caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery and the overall duration of labour analgesia, AMB makes little or no difference. Narrative data from the trials indicate that AMB may increase maternal satisfaction, and all studies reported no difference in newborn Apgar scores.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in these results. Some trials were not blinded, so participants and clinicians knew which method was used. Not every trial reported all outcomes we wanted. The studies varied in participant characteristics and delivery techniques, which adds uncertainty.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions – the heading \"Key messages\" is not a question. In addition, several clarity and style problems would likely confuse readers:\n1. Unexplained jargon – terms such as \"breakthrough pain\", \"local anaesthetic\", \"PCEA\", \"combined spinal‑epidural\" and \"dural puncture epidural (DPE)\" appear without simple definitions. Rewrite: \"breakthrough pain (pain that isn’t controlled by the epidural and needs the anaesthetist’s help)\"; \"local anaesthetic (a medicine that blocks pain signals)\"; \"patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) – the option for the woman to give herself extra doses\"; \"combined spinal‑epidural (a technique that gives a small dose into the spinal space before the epidural)\"; \"dural puncture epidural (DPE) – a method where the dura is punctured but no drug is given into the spinal space\".\n2. Long, dense sentence in the Results section – \"We identified 18 randomised trials that together enrolled 4 590 healthy women at term. Thirteen trials enrolled only first‑time mothers; five included both first‑time and experienced mothers. Epidurals were started in different ways (combined spinal‑epidural, standard epidural or dural (DPE)) and used various drug mixes (ropivacaine‑fentanyl, ropivacaine‑sufentanil, levobupivacaine‑fentanyl, levobupivacaine‑sufentanil, bupivacaine‑fentanyl).\" Rewrite: \"We found 18 randomised trials involving 4 590 healthy women at term. Thirteen trials included only first‑time mothers; the other five included both first‑time and experienced mothers. The epidural was started in three ways – combined spinal‑epidural, standard epidural, or dural puncture epidural (DPE) – and the drug mixes varied (e.g., ropivacaine‑fentanyl, ropivacaine‑sufentanil, levobupivacaine‑fentanyl, levobupivacaine‑sufentanil, bupivacaine‑fentanyl).\"\n3. Excessive passive voice – the draft contains 23 passive constructions (well above the typical PLS range of 9‑23, flagged as P90). Passive sentences such as \"The evidence is up to date to December 2022 of search\" obscure who performed the search. Rewrite: \"We searched the literature up to December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\"\n4. Noun‑heavy wording – 162 nouns (P90) make the text feel dense. Converting noun‑heavy phrases to verbs improves flow. Example: \"The review found no evidence of increased adverse effects\" → \"We found no evidence that adverse effects increased.\"\n5. Missing question‑style heading for Key messages – change the heading to a question to meet the style guide. Rewrite: \"What are the key messages?\"\nThese changes address the most important clarity, style, and structural issues and bring the draft into line with the Master Style Guide and Cochrane PLS conventions.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (609 words) and scores well on most readability metrics (e.g., Flesch Reading Ease 49.3, FKGL 10.7). However, six metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: passive_voice (23, P90), nouns (162, P90), smog_index (14.5, P90), complex_words_dc (280, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (135, P90) and long_words (178, P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun density, and complex/long words, supporting the editorial suggestions to reduce passive voice, simplify vocabulary, and use more active verbs."
