  "draft": "Is a programmed dose given at set times (automated mandatory bolus) better than a steady drip (continuous infusion) for epidural pain relief (pain relief through a tube placed in the back) during labor?\n\nKey messages\n- Using an automated mandatory bolus (AMB) – a programmed dose given at set times – for epidural pain relief during labour leads to less breakthrough pain (pain that requires extra medication or doctor help) and uses less local anaesthetic (the pain‑relieving drug), and it may increase maternal satisfaction (how happy the mother feels about the pain relief); there were no reported differences in major harms such as Caesarean delivery (surgical birth), instrumental delivery (birth using forceps or vacuum), length of labour analgesia, or newborn Apgar scores (a quick health check after birth).\n- The review found no evidence of increased adverse effects with either method, and the overall quality of the evidence is moderate, meaning the findings are reasonably reliable but not definitive.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed studies to confirm whether AMB truly improves delivery outcomes and maternal satisfaction, and to explore any long‑term safety issues.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhat is epidural analgesia and how is it given during labour?\nDuring labour many women experience strong pain in the abdomen, pelvis and perineum. A common way to relieve this pain is an epidural, where medicines are injected into the \"epidural space\" – a small area just outside the spinal cord. The medicines usually include a local anaesthetic (a drug that blocks pain signals) and often an opioid (a pain‑relieving drug) to make the effect stronger. Once the epidural catheter is in place, the medication can be delivered in two main ways:\n* Basal infusion (BI): a continuous, steady flow of medication is given around the clock.\n* Automated mandatory bolus (AMB): a set dose is automatically given at regular time intervals (for example, every 30 minutes). Women may also have the option to give themselves extra doses when needed – this is called patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA).\nThe goal of any delivery method is to keep pain under control while avoiding side‑effects. When pain breaks through the epidural and requires the anaesthesiologist to intervene, it is called \"breakthrough pain\" and can be distressing for the mother.\nResearchers have not been sure which method – continuous basal infusion or automated bolus – works best. Some studies suggest the bolus approach might reduce breakthrough pain and use less medication, but the evidence has been limited and inconsistent.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors set out to compare automated mandatory bolus (AMB) with basal infusion (BI) for maintaining epidural analgesia in women at term. Specifically, they wanted to know whether AMB:\n* Reduces the number of women who experience breakthrough pain needing anaesthesiologist help;\n* Affects the rates of caesarean delivery (surgical birth) or instrumental delivery (use of forceps or vacuum);\n* Changes the total amount of local anaesthetic used, the length of labour, maternal satisfaction after birth, and newborn health as measured by Apgar scores.\nBy gathering all randomised trials on the topic, the review aimed to provide clear evidence on the benefits and possible harms of the two delivery techniques, helping clinicians choose the safest and most effective method for pain relief during labour.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared automated mandatory bolus with basal infusion for maintaining labour epidural analgesia, combined their results in meta‑analyses, and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 18 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 4,590 healthy women at term who were receiving labour epidural analgesia. Thirteen of the trials included only first‑time mothers (nulliparous) and the remaining five included both first‑time and experienced mothers; no studies involved pre‑term, multiple‑pregnancy, or other complicated pregnancies. All trials compared an automated mandatory bolus (AMB) delivery method with a continuous basal infusion (BI); some also looked at patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) alongside these regimens. The way epidural analgesia was started varied: seven trials used a combined spinal‑epidural technique, ten used epidural alone, and one used a dural puncture epidural. Different drug mixes were used across the studies, including ropivacaine‑fentanyl, ropivacaine‑sufentanil, levobupivacaine‑sufentanil, levobupivacaine‑fentanyl, and bupivacaine‑fentanyl. The abstract did not report the geographic locations of the trials, the length of follow‑up, or the sources of funding.\n\nMain results: Breakthrough pain and other outcomes\nAutomated mandatory bolus probably reduces the number of women who experience breakthrough pain during labour – about 30 fewer women per 1,000 compared with a continuous basal infusion. It also probably lowers the amount of local anaesthetic used, by roughly 0.8 mg per hour. For other important outcomes, automated mandatory bolus probably makes little or no difference to the rates of caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, or the overall duration of labour analgesia. It may increase maternal satisfaction with pain relief, and it probably makes little or no difference to newborn Apgar scores.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies provided all the data we were interested in, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft does not meet the mandatory style and length requirements. 1) Several subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"), which violates the Master Style Guide. 2) The total word count is 901, exceeding the 850‑word limit. 3) The text contains many long, passive, and noun‑heavy sentences that make it hard for patients to follow (e.g., 44 passive constructions, average 27.3 words per sentence, 261 nouns, 25 nominalisations). These issues reduce readability (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 32.5, Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 15.5). The following concrete revisions are needed to bring the PLS into compliance and improve clarity:\n\n1. **Subheading format** – Change headings to questions. Example: replace \"Key messages\" with \"What are the main findings?\"; replace \"Introduction/Aims\" with \"What did the review aim to find out?\"; replace \"Methods\" with \"How did we find the evidence?\"; replace \"Results\" with \"What did we find?\"; replace \"Limitations\" with \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"; replace \"Currency\" with \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n\n2. **Reduce word count** – Trim redundant phrasing and combine sentences. For instance, the opening paragraph can be shortened to: \"Is a programmed dose given at set times (automated mandatory bolus) better than a steady drip (continuous infusion) for epidural pain relief during labour?\" This alone saves ~15 words. Further cuts throughout the text will bring the total under 850 words.\n\n3. **Shorten long sentences** – Example problematic sentence: \"Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces the number of women who experience breakthrough pain during labour – about 30 fewer women per 1,000 compared with a continuous basal infusion.\" Rewrite as two shorter sentences: \"Automated mandatory bolus probably reduces breakthrough pain. About 30 fewer women per 1,000 experience pain compared with continuous basal infusion.\"\n\n4. **Convert passive voice to active voice** – Problematic: \"The abstract did not report the geographic locations of the trials, the length of follow‑up, or the sources of funding.\" Rewrite: \"We did not report the trials’ geographic locations, follow‑up length, or funding sources.\"\n\n5. **Reduce noun‑heavy, nominalised language** – Problematic phrase: \"The evidence is up to date to December 2022 of search.\" Rewrite: \"We searched up to December 2022.\"\n\nThese changes will lower the passive‑voice count, reduce average sentence length, cut the number of nouns and nominalisations, and raise readability scores toward typical PLS ranges (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease >40, Flesch‑Kincaid Grade <13).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows major deviations: word count 901 (>850 limit); words per sentence 27.3 (P90, too long); passive voice 44 (BEYOND_P90, excessive); nominalizations 25 (P90); nouns 261 (BEYOND_P90); readability scores very low (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 32.5, P10; Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 15.5, P90). These metrics confirm the need to shorten sentences, use active voice, reduce noun density, and bring the text within the word limit."
