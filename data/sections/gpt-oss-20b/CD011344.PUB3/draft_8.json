  "draft": "Is a programmed dose given at set times (automated mandatory bolus) better than a steady drip (continuous infusion) for epidural pain relief during labour?\n\nKey messages\n- An automated mandatory bolus (a programmed dose given at set times) reduces breakthrough pain – pain that needs extra medication or a doctor’s help – and uses less local anaesthetic, the drug that relieves pain.  \n- Mothers may feel more satisfied with their pain relief when an automated mandatory bolus is used.  \n- The method does not change the rates of Caesarean delivery (surgical birth), instrumental delivery (birth using forceps or vacuum), the length of labour analgesia, or the newborn’s Apgar scores (a quick health check after birth). The evidence is of moderate certainty, meaning we are reasonably sure of these findings but further research could change them.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and how is it given during labour?  \nDuring labour many women experience strong pain in the abdomen, pelvis and perineum. An epidural relieves this pain by injecting medicines into the epidural space (a small area just outside the spinal cord). The medicines usually include a local anaesthetic (a drug that blocks pain signals) and often an opioid (a drug that adds extra pain relief). Once the epidural catheter is in place, the medication can be delivered in two main ways:  \n- **Basal infusion (BI):** a continuous, steady flow of medication is given around the clock.  \n- **Automated mandatory bolus (AMB):** a set dose is automatically given at regular intervals (for example, every 30 minutes). Women can also give themselves extra doses when needed – this is called patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe compared AMB with BI in women at term. Specifically we asked whether AMB:  \n- Reduces the number of women who experience breakthrough pain that needs an anaesthetist’s help;  \n- Affects the rates of Caesarean delivery or instrumental delivery;  \n- Changes the total amount of local anaesthetic used, the length of labour, maternal satisfaction after birth, or newborn Apgar scores.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, WHO‑ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 31 December 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors for unpublished data. Two reviewers independently selected randomised trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results using meta‑analysis and rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found 18 randomised trials involving 4 590 healthy women at term. Thirteen trials enrolled only first‑time mothers (women who have not given birth before), while five included both first‑time and experienced mothers. The way epidurals were started differed: seven trials used a combined spinal‑epidural, ten used a standard epidural, and one used a dural puncture epidural. Different drug mixes were used, such as ropivacaine‑fentanyl, ropivacaine‑sufentanil, levobupivacaine‑fentanyl, levobupivacaine‑sufentanil and bupivacaine‑fentanyl.  \n\nOur analysis shows that AMB probably reduces breakthrough pain – about 30 fewer women per 1 000 compared with BI – and probably lowers local anaesthetic use by roughly 0.8 mg per hour. AMB probably makes little or no difference to Caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, or the overall duration of labour analgesia. Narrative data suggest AMB may increase maternal satisfaction, and all studies reported no difference in newborn Apgar scores.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate certainty in these results. Some trials were not blinded, so participants and clinicians knew which method was used. Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted. The studies varied in participant characteristics and delivery techniques, adding uncertainty.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe searched the literature up to December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

Reducing passive voice and simplifying noun‑heavy sentences will bring the text closer to typical PLS style and improve patient understanding.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (e.g., Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 11, words per sentence 18.9) but shows significant deviations in passive voice (27, beyond P90), noun count (183, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.5, beyond P90), and complex‑word metrics (complex_words 135, complex_words_dc 287, long_words 177, all beyond P90). These metric outliers support the editorial recommendation to reduce passive constructions, simplify noun‑heavy sentences, and lower overall lexical complexity."
