  "draft": "Is a programmed dose given at set times (automated mandatory bolus) better than a steady drip (continuous infusion) for epidural pain relief (pain relief through a tube placed in the back) during labour?\n\nKey messages\n- Using an automated mandatory bolus (AMB) – a programmed dose given at set times – reduces breakthrough pain (pain that returns despite the epidural and needs extra medication) and lowers the amount of local anaesthetic (the pain‑relieving drug) used.\n- AMB may increase how satisfied mothers feel about their pain relief.\n- AMB does not change the rates of Caesarean delivery (surgical birth), instrumental delivery (birth using forceps or vacuum), the overall length of labour analgesia, or newborn Apgar scores (a quick health check after birth). The evidence is of moderate certainty, meaning the findings are fairly reliable but further large, well‑designed studies would be helpful.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and how is it given during labour?\nDuring labour many women feel strong pain in the abdomen, pelvis and perineum. An epidural relieves this pain by injecting medicines into the epidural space (a small area just outside the spinal cord). The medicines usually include a local anaesthetic (a drug that blocks pain signals) and often an opioid (a pain‑relieving drug) to make the effect stronger. Once the epidural catheter is in place, we can deliver the medication in two main ways:\n- Basal infusion (BI): a continuous, steady flow of medication.\n- Automated mandatory bolus (AMB): a set dose automatically given at regular intervals (for example, every 30 minutes). Women may also give themselves extra doses when needed – this is called patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare AMB with BI for maintaining epidural analgesia in women at term. Specifically we asked whether AMB:\n- Reduces the number of women who experience breakthrough pain needing an anaesthetist’s help;\n- Affects the rates of Caesarean delivery or instrumental delivery;\n- Changes the total amount of local anaesthetic used, the length of labour, maternal satisfaction after birth, or newborn Apgar scores.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, WHO‑ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 31 December 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors for unpublished data. We included randomised controlled trials that compared AMB with BI for labour epidural analgesia. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results in meta‑analyses and rated confidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 18 randomised trials that together enrolled 4 590 healthy women at term. Thirteen of the trials enrolled only first‑time mothers (nulliparous) and the remaining five included both first‑time and experienced mothers (nulli‑ and multiparous). The way epidural analgesia was started varied: seven trials used a combined spinal‑epidural technique, ten used epidural alone, and one used a dural puncture epidural. Different drug mixes were used, including ropivacaine‑fentanyl, ropivacaine‑sufentanil, levobupivacaine‑fentanyl, levobupivacaine‑sufentanil and bupivacaine‑fentanyl. Our analysis showed that AMB probably reduces breakthrough pain by about 30 fewer women per 1 000 compared with BI and probably lowers local‑anaesthetic consumption by roughly 0.8 mg per hour. AMB probably makes little or no difference to Caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, or the overall duration of labour analgesia. Narrative data suggest AMB may increase maternal satisfaction, and all studies reported no difference in newborn Apgar scores.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these results. Some trials were not blinded, so participants and clinicians knew which method was used. Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted. The studies varied in participant characteristics and delivery techniques, which adds uncertainty.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the mandatory completeness, title/subheading, factual accuracy, and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader. The most important issues are:\n1. **Unexplained technical terms** – the sentence \"The way epidural analgesia was started varied: seven trials used a combined spinal‑epidural technique, ten used epidural alone, and one used a dural puncture epidural (DPE).\" mentions specialised techniques without simple explanations.\n   *Rewrite:* \"The way the epidural was started differed: seven studies used a combined spinal‑epidural (a small dose of medication given into the spinal fluid before the epidural), ten used the standard epidural alone, and one used a dural puncture epidural, where the needle goes a little deeper into the spine.\"\n2. **Long, information‑dense sentence in the results** – \"Our analysis showed that AMB probably reduces breakthrough pain by about 30 fewer women per 1 000 compared with BI and probably lowers local‑anaesthetic consumption by roughly 0.8 mg per hour.\" mixes two findings and uses vague \"probably\". The sentence can be split and clarified.\n   *Rewrite:* \"Our analysis suggests that AMB reduces breakthrough pain by about 30 fewer women per 1,000 compared with BI. It also appears to lower the amount of local‑anaesthetic used by roughly 0.8 mg per hour.\"\n3. **Passive voice that obscures who did what** – \"The way epidural analgesia was started varied\" is passive and adds to the high passive‑voice count (27 instances, well beyond the typical PLS range).\n   *Rewrite:* \"Researchers started the epidural in different ways: ...\"\n4. **Use of certainty language without explanation** – phrases like \"probably\" and \"moderate certainty\" appear without telling readers what that means.\n   *Rewrite:* \"The evidence, which we rate as of moderate certainty (meaning the findings are fairly reliable but could change with new research), suggests that...\"\nThese changes address the most confusing aspects, reduce passive constructions, and simplify jargon, aligning the text with Cochrane plain‑language style. The PLS evaluation also flagged high numbers of passive voice (27, beyond P90), many nouns (180, beyond P90), and elevated readability scores (smog 14.8, Dale‑Chall 8.3) – all of which are consistent with the identified clarity issues. Overall, the draft needs these revisions before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but shows notable deviations: passive voice (27 instances, BEYOND_P90), noun count (180, P90), smog index (14.8, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.3, P90), complex words (147, BEYOND_P90) and long words (193, BEYOND_P90). These metrics confirm the presence of excessive passive constructions and high lexical complexity, supporting the recommended edits."
