  "draft": "Is a programmed dose given at set times (automated mandatory bolus) better than a continuous drip (continuous infusion) for epidural pain relief during labour?\n\nKey messages\n- Using an automated mandatory bolus (AMB) – a programmed dose given at set times – reduces breakthrough pain (pain that returns despite the epidural and needs extra medication) and lowers the amount of local anaesthetic used.\n- AMB may increase how satisfied mothers feel about their pain relief, and it does not change the rates of Caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, the overall length of labour analgesia, or newborn Apgar scores.\n- The evidence is of moderate certainty, meaning the findings are fairly reliable but further large, well‑designed studies would be helpful.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and how is it given during labour?\nDuring labour many women feel strong pain in the abdomen, pelvis and perineum. An epidural relieves this pain by injecting medicines into the “epidural space”, a small area just outside the spinal cord. The medicines usually ...\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare AMB with BI for maintaining epidural analgesia in women at term. Specifically we asked whether AMB:\n- Reduces the number of women who experience breakthrough pain that needs an anaesthetist’s help;\n- Affects the rates of Caesarean delivery or instrumental delivery (forceps or vacuum);\n- Changes the total amount of local anaesthetic used, the length of labour, maternal satisfaction after birth, or newborn Apgar scores.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase‑pain, Embase, Web of Science, WHO‑ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 31 December 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors for unpublished data. We included randomised controlled trials that compared AMB with BI for labour epidural analgesia. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results in meta‑analyses and rated confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 18 trials that enrolled 4 590 healthy women at term. Thirteen trials ...\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in these results. Some trials were not blinded, so participants and clinicians knew which method was used. Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted. The studies varied in participant characteristics and delivery techniques, which adds uncertainty.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

The sentence \"The medicines usually ...\" is truncated, leaving out what medicines are used in epidural analgesia.\n2. The results description \"We identified 18 trials that enrolled 4 590 healthy women at term. Thirteen trials ...\" stops abruptly, omitting key details about the trial populations.\n3. The second key‑message bullet is overly long and packs multiple ideas together, making it hard to follow.\nThese gaps break the flow and prevent a clear understanding of the review’s findings. Suggested fixes:\n- Complete the truncated sentence, e.g., \"The medicines usually include a local anaesthetic (such as bupivacaine) and an opioid (such as fentanyl) to enhance pain relief.\"\n- Finish the trial description, e.g., \"Thirteen trials enrolled only first‑time mothers, while the remaining five included both first‑time and experienced mothers.\"\n- Split the long bullet into two clearer points:\n  • \"AMB may increase how satisfied mothers feel about their pain relief.\"\n  • \"AMB does not change the rates of Caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, the overall length of labour analgesia, or newborn Apgar scores.\"\nAddressing these issues will make the summary complete, coherent, and easier for patients to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets typical readability metrics (words per sentence 16.9, FK grade 10.8, readability scores in the 25th‑50th percentiles). However, passive voice is relatively high (16 instances, P75) and complex/long words are at the upper end of typical ranges. The main concerns are missing content and overly long sentences, which are not captured by the metrics but significantly affect clarity."
