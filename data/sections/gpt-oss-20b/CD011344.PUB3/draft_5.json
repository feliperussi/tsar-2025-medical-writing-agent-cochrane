  "draft": "\"Is a programmed dose given at set times (automated mandatory bolus) better than a steady drip (continuous infusion) for epidural pain relief (pain relief through a tube placed in the back) during labour?\\n\\nKey messages\\n- Using an automated mandatory bolus (AMB) – a programmed dose given at set times – reduces breakthrough pain (pain that returns despite the epidural and needs extra medication) and lowers the amount of local anaesthetic (the pain‑relieving drug) used.\\n- AMB may increase how satisfied mothers feel about their pain relief.\\n- AMB does not change the rates of Caesarean delivery (surgical birth), instrumental delivery (birth using forceps or vacuum), the overall length of labour analgesia, or newborn Apgar scores (a quick health check after birth). The evidence is of moderate certainty, meaning the findings are fairly reliable but could change with new research.\\n\\nWhat is epidural analgesia and keep it working during labour?\\nDuring labour many women feel strong pain in the abdomen, pelvis and perineum. An epidural relieves this pain by injecting medicines into the epidural space (a small area just outside the spinal cord). The medicines usually include a local anaesthetic (a drug that blocks pain signals) and often an opioid (a pain‑relieving drug) to make the effect stronger. Once the epidural catheter is in place, we can deliver the medication in two main ways:\\n- Basal infusion (BI): a continuous, steady flow of medication is given around the clock.\\n- Automated mandatory bolus (AMB): a set dose is automatically given at regular intervals (for example, every 30 minutes). Women may also give themselves extra doses when needed – this is called patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA).\\n\\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\\nWe wanted to compare AMB with BI for maintaining epidural analgesia in women at term. Specifically we asked whether AMB:\\n- Reduces the number of women who experience breakthrough pain needing an anaesthetist’s help;\\n- Affects the rates of Caesarean delivery or instrumental delivery;\\n- Changes the total amount of local anaesthetic used, the length of labour, maternal satisfaction after birth, or newborn Apgar scores.\\n\\nHow did we find the evidence?\\nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, WHO‑ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 31 December 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors for unpublished data. We included randomised controlled trials that compared AMB with BI for labour epidural analgesia. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results in meta‑analyses and rated confidence using the GRADE approach.\\n\\nWhat did we find?\\nWe identified 18 randomised trials that together enrolled 4 590 healthy women at term. Thirteen trials enrolled only first‑time mothers (nulliparous) and five included both first‑time and experienced mothers. Researchers started the epidural in different ways:\\n- Seven trials used a combined spinal‑epidural (CSE), where a small dose of medication is given into the spinal fluid before the epidural;\\n- Ten trials used the standard epidural alone;\\n- One trial used a dural puncture epidural (DPE), where the needle goes a little deeper into the spine before the catheter is placed.\\n\\nThe studies used several different drug mixes, such as ropivacaine‑fentanyl, ropivacaine‑sufentanil, levobupivacaine‑fentanyl, levobupivacaine‑sufentanil and bupivacaine‑fentanyl.\\n\\nOur analysis suggests that AMB reduces breakthrough pain by about 30 fewer women per 1 000 compared with BI. It also appears to lower the amount of local anaesthetic used by roughly 0.8 mg per hour. For other outcomes, AMB probably makes little or no difference to Caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, or the overall duration of labour analgesia. Narrative data from the trials indicate that AMB may increase maternal satisfaction, and all studies reported no difference in newborn Apgar scores.\\n\\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\\nWe are moderately confident in these results. Some trials were not blinded, so participants and clinicians knew which method was used. Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted. The studies varied in participant characteristics and delivery techniques, which adds uncertainty.\\n\\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\\nWe searched the literature up to December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft is missing a question‑style subheading for the \"Key messages\" section – the style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions. This alone fails the critical completeness check. In addition, the text contains several readability problems that would hinder patient understanding: (1) many sentences exceed 30 words (e.g., \"We identified 18 randomised trials that together enrolled 4 590 healthy women at term who were receiving labour epidural analgesia.\") making them hard to follow; (2) a high number of passive constructions (23 instances, well above the typical 9‑23 range) obscures who performed actions; (3) the draft **PLS** is noun‑heavy (184 nouns) and uses many long/complex words, contributing to low readability scores (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 32.6, far below the typical >40). Suggested fixes: rewrite the \"Key messages\" heading as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\"), split long sentences into shorter ones, convert passive voice to active voice, and replace complex/long words with simpler alternatives. These changes will bring the PLS closer to typical Cochrane plain‑language patterns.",
