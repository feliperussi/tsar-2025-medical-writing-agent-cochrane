  "draft": "Is a programmed dose given at set times (automated mandatory bolus) better than a steady drip (continuous infusion) for epidural pain relief during labour?\n\nKey messages\n- Using an automated mandatory bolus (AMB) – a programmed dose given at set times – reduces breakthrough pain (pain that needs extra medication or a doctor’s help) and lowers the amount of local anaesthetic (the pain‑relieving drug) used.  \n- AMB may increase mothers’ satisfaction with their pain relief.  \n- AMB does not change the rates of Caesarean delivery (surgical birth) or instrumental delivery (birth using forceps or vacuum). It also does not affect how long labour analgesia lasts or the newborn’s Apgar scores (a quick health check after birth). We judged the evidence to be of moderate certainty, meaning we are reasonably sure of the findings but further research could change them.\n\nWhat is epidural analgesia and how is it given during labour?  \nDuring labour many women feel strong pain in the abdomen, pelvis and perineum. An epidural relieves this pain by injecting medicines into the epidural space (a small area just outside the spinal cord). We usually combine a local anaesthetic (a drug that blocks pain signals) with an opioid (a drug that adds extra pain relief). Once the epidural catheter is in place, the medication can be delivered in two main ways:  \n- **Basal infusion (BI):** a continuous, steady flow of medicine is given around the clock.  \n- **Automated mandatory bolus (AMB):** a set dose is automatically given at regular intervals (for example, every 30 minutes). Women can also give themselves extra doses when needed – this is called patient‑controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe compared AMB with BI in women at term. Specifically we asked whether AMB:  \n- Reduces the number of women who experience breakthrough pain that needs an anaesthetist’s help;  \n- Affects the rates of Caesarean delivery or instrumental delivery;  \n- Changes the total amount of local anaesthetic used, the length of labour, maternal satisfaction after birth, or newborn Apgar scores.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, WHO‑ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 31 December 2022. We also screened reference lists and contacted study authors for unpublished data. Two reviewers independently selected randomised trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled the results from the individual studies together (a technique called a meta‑analysis) to see the overall effect, and we rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 18 randomised trials that enrolled 4 590 healthy women at term. Thirteen trials included only first‑time mothers (nulliparous) and five included both first‑time and experienced mothers. (Nulliparous means a woman who has not given birth before.) The way epidurals were started varied: seven trials used a combined spinal‑epidural, ten used a standard epidural, and one used a dural puncture epidural. Different drug mixes were used, such as ropivacaine‑fentanyl, ropivacaine‑sufentanil, levobupivacaine‑fentanyl, levobupivacaine‑sufentanil and bupivacaine‑fentanyl.  \n\nOur analysis shows that AMB probably reduces breakthrough pain – about 30 fewer women per 1 000 compared with BI – and probably lowers local anaesthetic use by roughly 0.8 mg per hour. AMB probably makes little or no difference to Caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery, or the overall duration of labour analgesia. Narrative data suggest AMB may increase maternal satisfaction, and all studies reported no difference in newborn Apgar scores.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate certainty in these results, meaning we are reasonably sure of the findings but further research could change them. Some trials were not blinded, so participants and clinicians knew which method was used. Not all trials reported every outcome we wanted. The studies varied in participant characteristics and delivery techniques, adding uncertainty.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe searched the literature up to December 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

Thirteen trials enrolled only first‑time mothers, while five included both first‑time and experienced mothers. (First‑time mothers are called nulliparous.) The epidural start technique differed: seven used a combined spinal‑epidural, ten used a standard epidural, and one used a dural puncture epidural.\"\n2. **Technical jargon without simple explanation** – the term \"nulliparous\" is only parenthetically defined and may still be unfamiliar. *Rewrite*: replace with \"first‑time mothers (women who have not given birth before)\" throughout.\n3. **Passive‑voice construction** – \"The evidence is up to date to December 2022 of search.\" This passive phrasing obscures who performed the search. *Rewrite*: \"We searched the literature up to December 2022, so the evidence is current to that date.\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy key‑message bullet** – \"Using an automated mandatory bolus (AMB) – a programmed dose given at set times – reduces breakthrough pain (pain that needs extra medication or a doctor’s help) and lowers the amount of local anaesthetic (the pain‑relieving drug) used.\" The sentence is long and noun‑dense. *Rewrite*: \"An automated mandatory bolus (a programmed dose given at set times) reduces breakthrough pain – pain that needs extra medication or a doctor’s help – and uses less local anaesthetic, the drug that relieves pain.\"\nThese issues are reflected in the metric report: 27 passive‑voice instances (well above the typical range), 184 nouns (far above the median), and high SMOG (14.5) and complex‑word counts. Reducing passive constructions, simplifying terminology, and breaking long sentences will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and includes all required sections, but several linguistic metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: passive voice (27 instances, beyond P90), noun count (184, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.5, beyond P90), complex words (137, beyond P90) and long words (184, beyond P90). These indicate excessive noun density and complexity, supporting the need for the clarity improvements listed above."
