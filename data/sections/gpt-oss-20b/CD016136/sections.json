  "plain_title": "Is giving iron through a vein (intravenous iron) safer and more effective than taking iron pills (oral iron) for treating iron‑deficiency anemia during pregnancy?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Giving iron through a vein (intravenous iron) probably leads to a small increase in blood‑carrying protein (haemoglobin) levels and reduces the chance of low iron (anaemia) during pregnancy compared with taking iron pills (oral iron), and it does not appear to change the risk of heavy bleeding after birth (post‑partum haemorrhage), need for blood transfusion, or breastfeeding rates; serious side‑effects were not clearly increased, but the evidence on safety is limited.",
    "Important outcomes such as how mothers feel about the treatment (maternal satisfaction) and detailed safety information were rarely reported, and the few data that exist on serious complications like maternal death or intensive‑care admission are very uncertain.",
    "More well‑designed studies that follow women through pregnancy and after birth are needed to provide clearer information on rare but serious harms and to the standardise how outcomes are measured and reported."

      "subheading": "Why is iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy a concern?",
      "content": "During pregnancy many women develop iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), a condition where the blood does not have enough iron to make healthy red blood cells. This is usually measured by a low haemoglobin (Hb) level – the protein that carries oxygen in the blood. When Hb falls below 11 g/dL, the World Health Organization says a woman has anaemia. Low iron can make a mother feel tired, weak, and short‑of‑breath, and it can increase the risk of complications around the time of birth, such as heavy bleeding after delivery (post‑partum haemorrhage, or PPH) and the need for a blood transfusion."

    {
      "subheading": "What treatments are used for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy?",
      "content": "The most common way to treat IDA is with oral iron tablets (such as ferrous sulfate). Some women, however, do not absorb enough iron from pills or experience side‑effects like stomach upset. In recent years, doctors have started giving iron directly into a vein – called intravenous (IV) iron – using medicines such as iron sucrose or ferric carboxymaltose. IV iron can raise iron levels more quickly, but it is more expensive and requires a clinic visit."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to compare IV iron with oral iron to see which works better and is safer for pregnant women with IDA. Specifically, they looked at how each treatment affected blood‑iron levels (haemoglobin), the presence of anaemia before and after birth, the risk of heavy bleeding after delivery, the need for blood transfusions, and any side‑effects or serious health problems for the mother."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared intravenous with oral iron in pregnant women with iron‑deficiency anaemia, combined their findings on effectiveness and safety, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard assessment criteria."
    }

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 13 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 3,939 pregnant women with iron‑deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin below 11 g/dL). The women were between 13 and 37 weeks of pregnancy. Most of the studies were carried out in India and several African countries; the remaining ones were in other low‑ and middle‑income settings. All participants were women. The trials compared intravenous iron preparations (iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose, ferric derisomaltose, ferumoxytol) with oral iron salts (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate). The most common head‑to‑head comparison was intravenous iron sucrose versus oral ferrous sulfate."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Intravenous iron probably reduces anaemia during pregnancy",
      "content": "Intravenous iron probably increases haemoglobin levels slightly during pregnancy and probably reduces the proportion of pregnant women who are anaemic. It also probably raises haemoglobin around the time of birth and reduces anaemia at birth. After delivery, intravenous iron may increase haemoglobin slightly and may reduce anaemia, although the evidence is less certain. There was little or no difference in the risk of postpartum haemorrhage, the need for blood transfusion, breastfeeding rates, maternal mortality, severe infections, prolonged hospital stay, intensive‑care admission, or other adverse events."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting to the intervention, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2024 of search."
