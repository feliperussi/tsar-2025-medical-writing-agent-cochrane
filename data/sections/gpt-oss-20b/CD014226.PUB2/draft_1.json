  "draft": "Is a minimally invasive repair with a graft that has holes (fenestrated endovascular repair) better than open surgery or no treatment for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (bulging of the main abdominal artery)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- We could not answer whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR – a minimally invasive procedure that uses a heading with holes to keep blood flowing to important arteries) is better than open surgical repair (OSR – a traditional operation that opens the abdomen) or no treatment for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs – dangerous bulges in the main abdominal artery) because no randomised trials comparing these approaches were found, so the benefits and possible harms remain unknown.\n- Conducting research on complex AAAs is difficult because these aneurysms are relatively uncommon and vary a lot in shape and location, which makes it hard to recruit enough participants for high‑quality studies.\n- Future work should focus on well‑designed randomised trials that directly compare FEVAR with open surgery or conservative management, and that follow patients for longer periods to assess survival, complications, and quality of life.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a concern?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulging, weakened part of the main blood vessel (the aorta) that runs through the belly. When the wall of the aorta stretches, it can become thin and may burst, which is life‑threatening. Most AAAs a result, the condition is serious and needs treatment. Complex AAAs are those that are:\n* Close to the kidney arteries, making repair more difficult.\nThe usual ways to treat AAAs are:\n* Open surgical repair (OSR): a surgeon makes a large cut in the abdomen, removes the damaged part of the aorta and replaces it with a synthetic tube. This is effective but involves a big operation and a long recovery.\n* Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR): a less invasive method where a thin, tube‑like graft is threaded through the blood vessels to the aneurysm. The graft has small windows (fenestrations) that line up with the kidney arteries, allowing blood to keep flowing to the kidneys without opening the abdomen.\n* Conservative (non‑operative) management: monitoring the aneurysm without surgery, usually chosen when the risk of operation outweighs the benefit.\nDoctors are still unsure which approach works best for these complex AAAs, especially regarding survival, complications, and quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to discover whether fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is a safer or more effective option compared with open surgical repair (OSR) or with simply watching the aneurysm (conservative management). Specifically, they looked for evidence from randomised trials about:\n* Mortality within 30 days and after one year (overall and aneurysm‑related death).\n* Length of hospital stay after the procedure.\n* Kidney injury, need for additional procedures, and whether the graft stays open.\n* Patient‑reported outcomes such as quality of life and side‑effects.\nIn short, the review set out to compare the benefits and harms of the newer, less‑invasive FEVAR technique with the traditional open surgery or with no surgery at all.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies comparing fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or non‑operative care for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms, combined any available results, and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no studies that compared fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) with open surgical repair or conservative management for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. Because no eligible trials were identified, no participants were enrolled and we have no information about study duration, funding sources, participant characteristics (such as age or gender), study settings, or details of the interventions and comparators. Consequently, we cannot tell whether FEVAR makes any difference to outcomes compared with open surgery or conservative management.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check: several required subheadings are not phrased as questions (Key messages, Methods, Limitations, Currency). This breaches the Master Style Guide (5.3 Structure) which mandates question‑style subheadings. Additionally, the text contains a number of clarity and style problems that would confuse readers: unclear phrasing, overly long sentences, and excessive nominalisations. The most important improvements are: 1. Re‑write subheadings as questions (e.g., change \"Key messages\" to \"What are the key messages?\"). 2. Simplify the confusing sentence \"Most AAAs a result, the condition is serious and needs treatment.\" to a clear statement. 3. Split the long, double‑negative sentence in the Limitations section into two shorter sentences. 4. Reduce the nominalisations such as \"conducting research\" → \"doing research\" and \"future work should focus\" → \"we should focus future work\". 5. Replace some complex/long words (e.g., \"conservative (non‑operative) management\") with simpler alternatives (e.g., \"watchful waiting\"). These changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability. The PLS evaluation shows high nominalisation (23, beyond P90), many nouns (184, beyond P90) and high SMOG, complex‑word and long‑word counts, confirming the need to simplify language and reduce noun‑heavy constructions.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits (698 words) and has average sentence length (19.4 words, P25). Readability scores are moderate (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 41.5, P50). However, several metrics deviate strongly from typical PLS patterns: nominalisations (23, P90), noun count (184, P90), SMOG index (15.6, BEYOND_P90), complex words (167, BEYOND_P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (296, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many complex words, supporting the editorial recommendation to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
