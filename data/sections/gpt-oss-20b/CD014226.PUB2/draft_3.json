  "draft": "Is a minimally invasive repair with a graft that has holes (fenestrated endovascular repair) better than open surgery or no treatment for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (bulging of the main abdominal artery)?\n\nKey messages\n- We could not tell whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) – a less‑invasive procedure that uses a graft with small windows – is better than open surgical repair (OSR) or watchful waiting. We found no randomised trials that compare these approaches, so the benefits and harms remain unknown.\n- Research on complex AAAs is difficult because the condition is rare and the aneurysms vary a lot in shape and location, making it hard to recruit enough participants for high‑quality studies.\n- Future work should focus on well‑designed randomised trials that directly compare FEVAR with OSR or watchful waiting and that follow patients for longer periods to assess survival, complications, and quality of life.\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a concern?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulging, weakened part of the main blood vessel (the aorta) that runs through the belly. When the wall stretches, it can become thin and may burst, which is life‑threatening. Most AAAs need treatment. Complex AAAs are those that are close to the kidney arteries, making repair more difficult.\n\nThe usual ways to treat AAAs are:\n- Open surgical repair (OSR): a surgeon makes a large cut in the abdomen, removes the damaged part of the aorta and replaces it with a synthetic tube. This works well but involves a big operation and a long recovery.\n- Fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR): a less‑invasive method where a thin, tube‑like graft is threaded through the blood vessels to the aneurysm. The graft has small windows that line up with the kidney arteries, allowing blood to keep flowing to the kidneys without opening the abdomen.\n- Watchful waiting: monitoring the aneurysm without surgery, usually chosen when the risk of operation outweighs the benefit.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover whether FEVAR is a safer or more effective option compared with OSR or with watchful waiting. Specifically, we looked for studies where participants were randomly assigned to receive either FEVAR or another treatment and that reported:\n- Death within 30 days and after one year (overall and aneurysm‑related)\n- Length of hospital stay after the procedure\n- Kidney injury, need for additional procedures, and whether the graft stays open\n- Patient‑reported outcomes such as quality of life and side‑effects\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched multiple medical databases for studies that compared FEVAR with OSR or watchful waiting for complex AAAs. We pooled any results we could find and judged how reliable the evidence was.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible randomised trials. Because no studies met our criteria, no participants were enrolled and we have no information on study size, funding, participant characteristics, settings, or details of the interventions. Consequently, we cannot say whether FEVAR changes outcomes compared with OSR or watchful waiting.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it does not cover the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that **all subheadings must be phrased as questions** – the heading \"Key messages\" is not a question. In addition, three clarity‑style issues are likely to confuse readers:\n1. **Title wording** – \"graft that has holes\" is vague and the phrase \"no treatment\" is inconsistent with the term \"watchful waiting\" used later. *Rewrite*: \"Is a minimally invasive repair with a graft that has small windows (fenestrated endovascular repair) better than open surgery or watchful waiting for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (bulging of the main abdominal artery)?\"\n2. **Long, compound sentence in Methods** – \"We searched multiple medical databases for studies that compared FEVAR with OSR or watchful waiting for complex AAAs. We pooled any results we could find and judged how reliable the evidence was.\" This can be split for easier reading. *Rewrite*: \"We searched several medical databases for studies that compared FEVAR with open surgery or watchful waiting for complex AAAs. Because no eligible trials were found, we could not pool any results or assess the reliability of the evidence.\"\n3. **High proportion of difficult words (complex_words_dc = 215, P90)** – many technical terms (e.g., \"fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair\", \"conservative management\") are not fully explained for a lay audience. Simplify or add brief definitions. *Example rewrite*: replace \"fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR)\" with \"fenestrated repair (FEVAR) – a technique that uses a thin tube with small openings to keep blood flowing to important arteries\" and replace \"conservative (non‑operative) management\" with \"watchful waiting – monitoring the aneurysm without surgery\".\nThese changes, together with converting the \"Key messages\" heading into a question (e.g., \"What are the main messages?\"), will bring the draft into full compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft generally conforms to typical Cochrane PLS patterns (overall high conformity, most metrics in the P25‑P75 range). Readability scores are good (Flesch reading ease 52, grade‑level ~11). The only notable deviation is the high count of difficult words (complex_words_dc = 215, P90), indicating the need to simplify vocabulary. Passive voice is within the typical range, and sentence length (21 words on average) is acceptable."
