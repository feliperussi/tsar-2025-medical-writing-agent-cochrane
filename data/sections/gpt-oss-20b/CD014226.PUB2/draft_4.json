  "draft": "Is a minimally invasive repair with a graft that has small windows (fenestrated endovascular repair) better than open surgery or watchful waiting for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (bulging of the main abdominal artery)?\n\nWhat are the main messages?\n- We could not tell whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR – a technique that uses a thin tube with small openings to keep blood flowing to important arteries) is better than open surgical repair (OSR – a traditional operation that opens the abdomen) or watchful waiting (monitoring the aneurysm without surgery), because no randomised trials comparing these approaches were found.\n- Research on complex AAAs is difficult. The condition is rare and the aneurysms vary a lot in shape and location, making it hard to recruit enough participants for high‑quality studies.\n- Future work should focus on well‑designed randomised trials that compare FEVAR with OSR or watchful waiting and that follow patients for longer periods to assess survival, complications and quality of life.\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a concern?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulging, weakened part of the main blood vessel (the aorta) that runs through the belly. When the wall stretches, it can become thin and may burst, which is life‑threatening. Most AAAs need treatment. Complex AAAs are those that are close to the kidney arteries, making repair more difficult.\n\nWhat are the usual ways to treat AAAs?\n- Open surgical repair (OSR): a surgeon makes a large cut in the abdomen, removes the damaged part of the aorta and replaces it with a synthetic tube. This works well but involves a big operation and a long recovery.\n- Fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR): a less‑invasive method where a thin, tube‑like graft is threaded through the blood vessels to the aneurysm. The graft has small windows that line up with the kidney arteries, allowing blood to keep flowing to the kidneys without opening the abdomen.\n- Watchful waiting: the aneurysm is monitored without surgery, usually when the risk of an operation outweighs the benefit.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover whether FEVAR is a safer or more effective option compared with OSR or with watchful waiting. Specifically, we looked for randomised trials that reported:\n- Death within 30 days and after one year (overall and aneurysm‑related)\n- Length of hospital stay after the procedure\n- Kidney injury, need for additional procedures and whether the graft stays open\n- Patient‑reported outcomes such as quality of life and side‑effects\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched several medical databases for studies that compared FEVAR with open surgery or watchful waiting for complex AAAs. Because no eligible trials were found, we could not pool any results or assess the reliability of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no studies that compared FEVAR with OSR or watchful waiting for complex AAAs. No participants were enrolled, and we have no information about study size, funding, participant characteristics, settings or details of the interventions. Consequently, we cannot say whether FEVAR changes outcomes compared with the other approaches.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it does not cover the people, interventions, comparators or outcomes we were interested in, and because there are too few studies to be certain about any result.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains three significant issues that could confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained medical term** – \"renal arteries\" appears in the description of FEVAR without a simple definition. Readers may not know these are the arteries that supply the kidneys. *Suggested rewrite*: \"...the graft has small windows that line up with the renal arteries (the blood vessels that supply the kidneys)...\"\n2. **Wordy sentence that obscures the main point** – \"Because no eligible trials were found, we could not pool any results or assess the reliability of the evidence.\" The clause is long and uses abstract language. *Suggested rewrite*: \"No eligible trials were found, so we could not combine results or judge how reliable the evidence is.\"\n3. **Inconsistent terminology for the non‑surgical option** – The draft uses both \"watchful waiting\" and \"conservative (non‑operative) management\" for the same approach, which may leave readers unsure whether these are different strategies. *Suggested rewrite*: Choose one term and use it consistently, e.g., \"watchful waiting (also called conservative management)\" and then stick to that term throughout.\nThese issues reduce readability and may leave patients uncertain about key concepts. The PLS evaluation also flags two linguistic metrics that support the need for simplification: the draft has a very high count of unfamiliar complex words (complex_words_dc = 220, beyond the typical median) and many long words (long_words = 168). Reducing jargon and shortening sentences will bring these metrics closer to typical PLS ranges and improve overall clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (overall high conformity), but two metrics deviate markedly: complex_words_dc (220, in the P90 range) and long_words (168, also in the P90 range). These indicate the text uses more unfamiliar and lengthy words than usual, supporting the recommendation to simplify terminology and shorten sentences."
