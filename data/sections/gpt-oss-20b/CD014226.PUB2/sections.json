  "key_messages": [
    "We could not answer whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR – a minimally invasive procedure that uses a graft with holes to keep blood flowing to important arteries) is better than open surgical repair (OSR – a traditional operation that opens the abdomen) or no treatment for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs – dangerous bulges in the main abdominal artery) because no randomised trials comparing these approaches were found, so the benefits and possible harms remain unknown.",
    "Conducting research on complex AAAs is difficult because these aneurysms are relatively uncommon and vary a lot in shape and location, which makes it hard to recruit enough participants for high‑quality studies.",
    "Future work should focus on well‑designed randomised trials that directly compare FEVAR with open surgery or conservative management, and that follow patients for longer periods to assess survival, complications, and quality of life."

      "subheading": "What is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a concern?",
      "content": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulging, weakened part of the main blood vessel (the aorta) that runs through the belly. When the wall of the aorta stretches, it can become thin and may burst, which is life‑threatening. Most AAAs a result, the condition is serious and needs treatment. Complex AAAs are those that are close to the kidney arteries, making repair more difficult.\n\nThe usual ways to treat AAAs are:\n* Open surgical repair (OSR): a surgeon makes a large cut in the abdomen, removes the damaged part of the aorta and replaces it with a synthetic tube. This is effective but involves a big operation and a long recovery.\n* Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR): a less invasive method where a thin, tube‑like graft is threaded through the blood vessels to the aneurysm. The graft has small windows (fenestrations) that line up with the kidney arteries, allowing blood to keep flowing to the kidneys without opening the abdomen.\n* Conservative (non‑operative) management: monitoring the aneurysm without surgery, usually chosen when the risk of operation outweighs the benefit.\n\nDoctors are still unsure which approach works best for these complex AAAs, especially regarding survival, complications, and quality of life."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to discover whether fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is a safer or more effective option compared with open surgical repair (OSR) or with simply watching the aneurysm (conservative management). Specifically, they looked for evidence from randomised trials about:\n* Mortality within 30 days and after one year (overall and aneurysm‑related death).\n* Length of hospital stay after the procedure.\n* Kidney injury, need for additional procedures, and whether the graft stays open.\n* Patient‑reported outcomes such as quality of life and side‑effects.\n\nIn short, the review set out to compare the benefits and harms of the newer, less‑invasive FEVAR technique with the traditional open surgery or with no surgery at all."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found no studies that compared fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) with open surgical repair or conservative management for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. Because no eligible trials were identified, no participants were enrolled and we have no information about study duration, funding sources, participant characteristics (such as age or gender), study settings, or details of the interventions and comparators. Consequently, we cannot tell whether FEVAR makes any difference to outcomes compared with open surgery or conservative management."
