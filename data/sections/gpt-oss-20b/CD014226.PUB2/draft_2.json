  "draft": "Is a minimally invasive repair with a graft that has holes (fenestrated endovascular repair) better than open surgery or no treatment for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (bulging of the main abdominal artery)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We could not tell whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR – a minimally invasive procedure that uses a graft with holes to keep blood flowing to important arteries) is better than open surgical repair (OSR – a traditional operation that opens the abdomen) or watchful waiting (no surgery) for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs – dangerous bulges in the main abdominal artery) because we found no randomised trials that compare these approaches, so the benefits and harms remain unknown.\n- Doing research on complex AAAs is hard because these aneurysms are relatively rare and vary a lot in shape and location, making it difficult to recruit enough participants for high‑quality studies.\n- We should focus future work on well‑designed randomised trials that directly compare FEVAR with open surgery or watchful waiting and that follow patients for longer periods to assess survival, complications, and quality of life.\n\nWhat is an abdominal aortic aneurysm and why is it a concern?\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulging, weakened part of the main blood vessel (the aorta) that runs through the belly. When the wall of the aorta stretches, it can become thin and may burst, which is life‑threatening. Most AAAs are serious and need treatment. Complex AAAs are those that are close to the kidney arteries, making repair more difficult.\n\nThe usual ways to treat AAAs are:\n- Open surgical repair (OSR): a surgeon makes a large cut in the abdomen, removes the damaged part of the aorta and replaces it with a synthetic tube. This works well but involves a big operation and a long recovery.\n- Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR): a less invasive method where a thin, tube‑like graft is threaded through the blood vessels to the aneurysm. The graft has small windows (fenestrations) that line up with the kidney arteries, allowing blood to keep flowing to the kidneys without opening the abdomen.\n- Watchful waiting: monitoring the aneurysm without surgery, usually chosen when the risk of operation outweighs the benefit.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover whether FEVAR is a safer or more effective option compared with OSR or with watchful waiting. Specifically, we looked for randomised trials that reported:\n- Death within 30 days and after one year (overall and aneurysm‑related)\n- Length of hospital stay after the procedure\n- Kidney injury, need for additional procedures, and whether the graft stays open\n- Patient‑reported outcomes such as quality of life and side‑effects\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared fenestrated endovascular repair with open surgery or watchful waiting for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. We combined any available results and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe did not identify any eligible trials, so no participants were enrolled. We therefore have no information about study size, funding, participant characteristics, settings, or details of the interventions. Because we have no data, we cannot say whether FEVAR changes outcomes compared with open surgery or watchful waiting.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it does not cover the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several reader‑confusing elements. (1) The term “randomised trials” is used without a plain‑language definition, leaving lay readers unsure what it means. (2) The first key‑message bullet is a single, 45‑word sentence packed with parentheses and multiple clauses, making it hard to follow. (3) The overall text relies on many long, polysyllabic words (e.g., “fenestrated”, “endovascular”, “conservative management”), reflected in the metric deviations (complex_words = 125, long_words = 180, smog_index = 13.9) which push the readability beyond typical PLS levels. These issues would likely confuse or frustrate patients reading the summary.\n\nSuggested improvements:\n1. **Define “randomised trials”.** Quote: “Specifically, we looked for randomised trials that reported:” – Explain: readers may not know what a randomised trial is. Rewrite: “Specifically, we looked for studies where participants were randomly assigned to receive either FEVAR or another treatment, and that reported:”.\n2. **Split the long key‑message sentence.** Quote: “We could not tell whether fenestrated endovascular repair … because we found no randomised trials that compare these approaches, so the benefits and harms remain unknown.” – Explain: the sentence is 45 words with several parentheses, making it dense. Rewrite into two sentences: “We could not tell whether fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) – a minimally invasive procedure that uses a graft with holes – is better than open surgical repair (OSR) or watchful waiting. We found no randomised trials that compare these approaches, so the benefits and harms remain unknown.”\n3. **Replace high‑complexity words with simpler alternatives.** Quote: “fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR)” – Explain: “fenestrated” and “endovascular” are technical. Rewrite: “fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) – a less‑invasive procedure that uses a specially designed graft with small windows”. Apply similar simplifications throughout (e.g., replace “conservative (non‑operative) management” with “watchful waiting”).\n4. **Reduce parenthetical overload.** Quote: “fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR – a minimally invasive procedure that uses a graft with holes to keep blood flowing to important arteries)” – Explain: nested parentheses interrupt flow. Rewrite: “fenestrated endovascular repair (FEVAR) – a minimally invasive procedure that uses a graft with holes to keep blood flowing to important arteries.”\n5. **Clarify the “What did we do?” sentence.** Quote: “We combined any available results and assessed our confidence in the evidence.” – Explain: vague for lay readers. Rewrite: “We pooled any results we could find and judged how reliable the evidence is.”\n\nThese changes address the three major clarity problems and also bring the complex_words, long_words, and smog_index metrics closer to typical PLS ranges (target complex_words < 84, long_words < 122, smog_index < 12).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and includes all required sections, but readability metrics show high complexity: smog_index (13.9, P90), complex_words_dc (242, P90), complex_words (125, P90) and long_words (180, P90) exceed typical PLS ranges, indicating many difficult words. Other metrics (e.g., words_per_sentence 23.2, passive_voice 14) are within normal ranges. The deviations support the need to simplify language and shorten sentences."
