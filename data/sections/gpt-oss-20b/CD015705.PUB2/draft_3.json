Front‑line staff – doctors, nurses, community health workers and others who interact directly with patients – are often called “street‑level bureaucrats” (people who must make everyday decisions for patients while working with limited tools). To fill the gap between what is expected of them and what the workplace provides, many reach for the mobile phones, tablets or other gadgets they already own. Using a personal and professional device can make them more flexible, allow quicker answers to patients, and help keep sensitive information out of weak formal systems. At the same time this practice can create new problems: workers may have to pay for calls or data themselves, lower‑paid staff may feel a heavier financial burden, patient privacy can be at risk when information is stored on a personal phone, and important data may never enter the official health records, creating a hidden “shadow IT” system.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about these informal mobile‑device practices?  \nWe set out to explore how healthcare workers, their managers and other professionals think about, experience and actually use personal mobile phones and other devices to support daily work. By gathering and analysing qualitative studies from around the world, we wanted to understand the benefits, the challenges and the broader implications of these unofficial, innovative solutions for both staff and patients.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus. We looked for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that examined healthcare workers’ views, experiences and practices of informal mobile‑device use. We extracted the findings and used a method called thematic synthesis (grouping similar ideas together) to keep the evidence organized. We then judged how confident we are in each finding using a standard approach called GRADE‑CERQual (which rates the certainty of evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe examined 30 studies published between 2013 and 2022. The studies came from high‑, middle‑ and low‑income countries and covered many health‑care settings and professional groups. Most reports focused on personal mobile phones rather than tablets.  \n\nWhen staff use their own phones, they become more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs. Personal devices also let workers keep some patient information out of weak formal systems and enable more personal, socially appropriate communication with colleagues and patients.  \n\nAt the same time, personal phone use adds financial costs for staff, especially lower‑level workers and those in low‑resource settings. It can create inequities because not all workers can afford calls, data or airtime. Using phones after hours adds extra workload and can be hard to ignore at home. Storing or sharing patient information on personal phones can breach confidentiality. Relying on informal phone solutions also weakens formal health‑system processes such as record‑keeping and coordination, and can lead to distractions from calls, messages or social media.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe evidence comes mainly from qualitative studies, which may not capture every perspective. Many primary reports omitted details such as participants’ ages, genders or exact numbers, so we could not assess how representative the findings are across all health‑worker groups.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe ran our searches in August 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",
