  "draft": "What are the benefits and challenges of healthcare workers using their personal mobile phones (their own phones) and other devices to support their work?\n\nKey messages\n– Using a personal phone lets staff be more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients, and can keep some patient information out of weak official systems.  \n– Personal phone use can cost workers money, add work after hours, risk patient privacy and create inequities, especially for lower‑level staff.  \n– In many places the practice has become normal, creating pressure to be constantly reachable, causing distractions and a hidden “shadow IT” system – unofficial technology that stores and shares information outside official health records.\n\nWhy do healthcare workers sometimes use their own mobile phones and other devices at work?  \nIn many facilities the official ways to communicate and share information are missing, broken or too slow. Front‑line staff – doctors, nurses, community health workers and others who see patients every day – are sometimes called “street‑level bureaucrats”. This simply means they must make important decisions with limited tools. To fill the gap between what is expected of them and what the workplace provides, they often reach for phones, tablets or other gadgets they already own. A personal device can make them more flexible, allow quicker answers to patients and help keep sensitive information out of weak official systems.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about these personal‑device practices?  \nWe wanted to understand how health‑care workers, their managers and other professionals think about, experience and actually use personal phones and other devices to support daily work. By gathering qualitative studies from around the world, we aimed to identify the benefits, the challenges and the broader implications of these unofficial, innovative solutions for staff and patients.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that examined personal‑device use. We collected the findings and grouped similar ideas together – a process called thematic synthesis – to organise the evidence. We then rated how sure we are about each finding using a simple system called GRADE‑CERQual, which tells us how confident we can be in the results.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe examined 30 studies published between 2013 and 2022. The studies came from high‑, middle‑ and low‑income countries and covered many health‑care settings and professional groups. Most reports focused on personal mobile phones rather than tablets.  \n\nWhen staff use their own phones, they become more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs. Personal devices also let workers keep some patient information out of weak official systems and enable more personal, socially appropriate communication with colleagues and patients.  \n\nAt the same time, personal phone use creates new problems. Workers often have to pay for calls or data themselves. Lower‑paid staff feel a heavier financial burden, especially in low‑resource settings. Storing patient information on a personal phone can put privacy at risk. Important data may never enter official health records, creating a hidden “shadow IT” system – unofficial technology that operates outside the formal record‑keeping system. Using phones after hours adds extra workload and makes it hard to ignore work calls at home. Frequent alerts can also distract staff from patient care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nAll of the evidence comes from qualitative studies, which may not capture every perspective. Many primary reports omitted details such as participants’ ages, genders or exact numbers, so we could not assess how representative the findings are across all health‑worker groups.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe ran our searches in August 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required completeness, title/subheading format, factual accuracy and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Vague phrase “weak official systems”** – readers are not told why the official systems are described as weak. *Rewrite*: “weak official systems (i.e., official communication tools that are unreliable or under‑resourced)”.\n2. **Jargon and insufficient explanation of “GRADE‑CERQual”** – the term is only briefly described and may still be unclear. *Rewrite*: “a simple method (GRADE‑CERQual) that tells us how confident we are in each finding”.\n3. **Over‑dense paragraph under “What did we find?”** – many ideas are packed into one long paragraph, making it hard to follow. *Rewrite*: break into bullet points or short paragraphs, e.g.,\n   - “When staff use their own phones they become more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs.”\n   - “Personal devices also let workers keep some patient information out of unreliable official systems and enable more personal, socially appropriate communication.”\n   - “However, using personal phones can create new problems…”.\n4. **Repeated hyphenated term “personal‑device”** – the hyphenated compound is unnecessary and adds reading difficulty. *Rewrite*: use the plain phrase “personal device” throughout.\n5. **Bullet‑point style in Key messages is dense** – each bullet contains several ideas separated by commas, which can overwhelm readers. *Rewrite*: split each bullet into two short points or use separate dash‑listed items.\nThese issues are reflected in the metric analysis: the draft has unusually high counts of nouns (172 vs median ≈ 116), complex words (123 vs median ≈ 84), long words (190 vs median ≈ 122) and especially unfamiliar Dale‑Chall words (281 BEYOND P90). Reducing noun density and simplifying vocabulary will improve readability. Overall, the draft needs the above revisions before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to most typical patterns (high overall conformity), but four metrics deviate: nouns, complex_words, long_words and complex_words_dc are above the median (P90 or beyond). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long or unfamiliar words, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce noun density."
