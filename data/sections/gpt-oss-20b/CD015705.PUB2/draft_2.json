  "draft": "What are the benefits and challenges of healthcare workers using their personal mobile phones (their own phones) and other devices to support their work?\n\nKey messages\n– Personal phones let staff be flexible, efficient and responsive to patients, but they can cost workers money, add work after hours, risk patient privacy, and increase inequities, especially for lower‑level staff (moderate‑high confidence).  \n– In many settings, using personal phones has become normal practice, creating pressure to be constantly reachable and leading to distractions and a parallel “shadow IT” system (unofficial technology that stores and shares information outside formal records).  \n– Future research should explore how health systems can keep the benefits of personal phone use while reducing costs, workload, privacy risks and inequities, and should look at ways to support lower‑level staff and provide training on safe information use.\n\nWhy do healthcare workers sometimes use their own mobile phones and other devices at work?  \nWe see that official communication and information systems are often missing, broken or too slow. Front‑line staff – doctors, nurses, community health workers and others who interact directly with patients – are described as “street‑level bureaucrats”, a term that means they must make everyday decisions for patients while working with limited tools and resources. To fill the gap between what is expected of them and what the workplace provides, many reach for the mobile phones, tablets or other gadgets they already own. Using a personal device can make them more flexible, allow quicker answers to patients, and help keep sensitive information out of weak formal systems.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about these informal mobile‑device practices?  \nWe set out to explore how healthcare workers, their managers and other professionals think about, experience and actually use personal mobile phones and other devices to support daily work. By gathering and analysing qualitative studies from around the world, we wanted to understand the benefits, the challenges and the broader implications of these unofficial, innovative solutions for both staff and patients.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that examined healthcare workers’ views, experiences and practices of informal mobile‑device use. We extracted data, performed a thematic synthesis and rated our confidence in each finding using the GRADE‑CERQual approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe examined 30 studies published between 2013 and 2022 from high‑, middle‑ and low‑income countries and covering many healthcare settings and professional groups. Most reports focused on personal mobile phones rather than tablets. When staff use their own phones, they become more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs. At the same time, personal phone use adds financial costs for staff, creates inequities—especially for lower‑level workers and those in low‑resource settings—and raises the risk that patient information may be shared in ways that compromise confidentiality. Relying on informal phone solutions also weakens formal health‑system processes such as record‑keeping and coordination.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe evidence comes mainly from qualitative studies, which may not capture every perspective or provide detailed participant demographics. Because the primary reports often omitted ages, genders and exact numbers of participants, we could not assess how representative the findings are across all health‑worker groups.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe searches were run in August 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural and factual requirements, but three key clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained technical jargon** – the methods section mentions “thematic synthesis” and “GRADE‑CERQual” without any plain‑language explanation, leaving readers unsure what these terms mean.\n2. **Overly long, dense sentence in the methods** – “We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that examined healthcare workers’ views, experiences and practices of informal mobile‑device use.” This 24‑word sentence packs several ideas and could be split for easier reading.\n3. **Bullet‑point sentence that bundles many concepts** – the first key‑message bullet crams four separate impacts (flexibility, cost, after‑hours work, privacy risk, inequity) into one long clause, making it hard to follow.\nThese issues are reflected in the metric report (high noun count, many complex words, and a Dale‑Chall score above the typical range), confirming that the text is noun‑heavy and uses less‑familiar vocabulary. Addressing them will bring the draft into better alignment with typical PLS patterns and improve readability for patients.\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Replace jargon: “We analysed the studies using a method called thematic synthesis, which groups similar ideas together, and we judged how confident we are in each finding using a standard approach (GRADE‑CERQual).”\n- Split the long methods sentence: “We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus. We looked for qualitative and mixed‑methods studies that explored healthcare workers’ views, experiences and practices of informal mobile‑device use.”\n- Break the bullet point into separate lines: “- Personal phones let staff be flexible, efficient and responsive to patients.\n- However, they can cost workers money and add work after hours.\n- They may risk patient privacy.\n- They can increase inequities, especially for lower‑level staff (moderate‑high confidence).”",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights five deviations: noun count (170, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.6, P90), complex words (272, P90), complex words‑DC (127, P90) and long words (189, P90). These indicate the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many unfamiliar or multi‑syllable words, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce noun density."
