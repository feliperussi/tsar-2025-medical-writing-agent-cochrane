  "draft": "What are the benefits and challenges of healthcare workers using their personal mobile phones (no markdown heading)\n\n**Key messages**\n- Healthcare workers use their own mobile phones (personal devices) to fill gaps in formal communication systems, which can make care more flexible, efficient and responsive and can help keep some patient information private, but this also costs workers money, adds extra work outside normal hours, can risk patient confidentiality, and may increase inequities (unequal access and burden) among staff, especially lower‑level workers; we have moderate to high confidence in these findings.\n- In many settings the informal use of personal phones has become a normal part of work, creating pressure from colleagues and managers to be constantly reachable and leading to distractions and a parallel “shadow IT” system (unofficial technology that stores and shares information outside formal records).\n- Future research should examine how health systems can retain the benefits of personal phone use while reducing costs, workload, privacy risks and inequities, and should investigate ways to support lower‑level staff, provide training on safe information use, and assess the overall impact on patient safety and system performance.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy do healthcare workers sometimes use their own mobile phones and other devices at work?\nIn many health facilities, the official systems for communication and information are missing, broken, or too slow. Front‑line staff – the and others who interact directly with patients – are often called “street‑level bureaucrats”. This term simply means people who have to make everyday decisions for patients while working with limited tools and resources. To fill the gap between what is expected of them and what the workplace provides, many of these workers reach for the mobile phones, tablets or other gadgets they already own. Using a personal device can make them more flexible, allow quicker answers to patients, and help keep sensitive information out of weak formal systems. At the same time, this informal practice can create new problems: workers may have to pay for calls or data themselves, lower‑paid staff may feel a heavier financial burden, patient privacy can be at risk when information is stored on a personal phone, and important data may never enter the official health records, creating a hidden “shadow IT” system.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about these informal mobile‑device practices?\nThe authors set out to explore how health‑care workers, their managers and other professionals think about, experience and actually use personal mobile phones and other devices to support their daily work. By gathering and analysing qualitative studies from around the world, they wanted to understand the benefits, the challenges and the broader implications of these unofficial, innovative solutions for both staff and patients.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched databases for qualitative (and mixed‑methods) studies that examined healthcare workers’ views, experiences and practices of informal mobile device use, extracted and thematically synthesized their findings, and rated our confidence in each finding using the GRADE‑CERQual approach.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 30 qualitative or mixed‑methods studies published between 2013 and 2022. These studies were carried out in a range of high‑, middle‑ and low‑income countries and covered many healthcare settings and professional groups. Most of the reports focused on the informal use of personal mobile phones rather than other devices such as tablets. The abstract does not give the total number of participants, their ages, genders, health conditions, how long each study lasted, or the funding sources for the primary studies.\n\nThe findings suggest that when healthcare workers use their own mobile phones, they probably become more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs. However, using personal phones probably adds financial costs for staff and creates inequities, especially for lower‑level workers and those in low‑resource settings. It also probably raises the risk that patient information may be shared in ways that compromise confidentiality, and relying on informal mobile phone solutions probably weakens formal health‑system and coordination.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are confident that ...\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical style requirement: subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide (5.3 Structure) and therefore the review cannot be approved. In addition, several clarity issues would confuse readers:\n1. **Unfinished Limitations section** – the text reads \"We are confident that ...\" and provides no actual limitation information.\n2. **Overly long, jargon‑heavy bullet point** – the first key‑message bullet runs over 40 words and includes technical terms like “shadow IT” without a clear, simple definition.\n3. **Long, complex sentence in Results** – \"In many settings the informal use of personal phones has become a normal part of work, creating pressure from colleagues and managers to be constantly reachable and leading to distractions and a parallel “shadow IT” system (unofficial technology that stores and shares information outside formal records).\" This exceeds 30 words and mixes several ideas, making it hard to follow.\n4. **Missing explanation of “street‑level bureaucrats”** – the term is introduced but not defined in plain language for a patient audience.\n5. **Parenthetical note in the title** – \"(no markdown heading)\" is unnecessary and confusing for readers.\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Change subheadings to questions, e.g., \"What are the key‑messages?\", \"Why did we conduct this review?\", \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n- Replace the incomplete Limitations sentence with a brief statement such as: \"The evidence is based on qualitative studies, which may not capture all perspectives, and the review could not assess the exact number of participants or their demographics.\"\n- Shorten the first key‑message bullet: \"Personal phones help staff be flexible and responsive, but they can cost workers money, add work after hours, risk patient privacy, and increase inequities, especially for lower‑level staff (moderate‑high confidence).\"\n- Split the long Results sentence into two: \"In many settings, using personal phones has become normal work practice. This creates pressure to be constantly reachable and can lead to distractions and a parallel “shadow IT” system, where information is stored outside official records.\"\n- Add a plain‑language definition: \"‘Street‑level bureaucrats’ are front‑line health workers who make everyday decisions for patients with limited resources.\"\n- Remove \"(no markdown heading)\" from the title and ensure the title is a clear question.\nMetrics support these edits: the draft has a high average sentence length (25.3 words, P90) and a high noun count (199, P90), contributing to dense, hard‑to‑read sentences. Reducing sentence length and noun density will improve readability scores (e.g., lower SMOG, Gunning Fog, and Dale‑Chall indices).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate overall conformity but highlights several deviations: words per sentence (25.26, P90), noun count (199, P90), and complexity metrics (SMOG 14.27, Dale‑Chall 8.82, complex words 142, long words 222) are all beyond typical PLS ranges, indicating the text is longer, more noun‑heavy, and uses many complex words. These metric alerts align with the identified clarity issues and suggest the draft would benefit from shorter sentences, fewer nouns, and simpler vocabulary."
