  "key_messages": [
    "Healthcare workers use their own mobile phones (personal devices) to fill gaps in formal communication systems, which can make care more flexible, efficient and responsive and can help keep some patient information private, but this also costs workers money, adds extra work outside normal hours, can risk patient confidentiality, and may increase inequities (unequal access and burden) among staff, especially lower‑level workers; we have moderate to high confidence in these findings.",
    "In many settings the informal use of personal phones has become a normal part of work, creating pressure from colleagues and managers to be constantly reachable and leading to distractions and a parallel “shadow IT” system (unofficial technology that stores and shares information outside formal records).",
    "Future research should examine how health systems can retain the benefits of personal phone use while reducing costs, workload, privacy risks and inequities, and should investigate ways to support lower‑level staff, provide training on safe information use, and assess the overall impact on patient safety and system performance."

      "content": "In many health facilities, the official systems for communication and information are missing, broken, or too slow. Front‑line staff – the doctors, nurses, community health workers and others who interact directly with patients – are often called “street‑level bureaucrats”. This term simply means people who have to make everyday decisions for patients while working with limited tools and resources. To fill the gap between what is expected of them and what the workplace provides, many of these workers reach for the mobile phones, tablets or other gadgets they already own. Using a personal device can make them more flexible, allow quicker answers to patients, and help keep sensitive information out of weak formal systems. At the same time, this informal practice can create new problems: workers may have to pay for calls or data themselves, lower‑paid staff may feel a heavier financial burden, patient privacy can be at risk when information is stored on a personal phone, and important data may never enter the official health records, creating a hidden “shadow IT” system."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to discover about these informal mobile‑device practices?",
      "content": "The authors set out to explore how health‑care workers, their managers and other professionals think about, experience and actually use personal mobile phones and other devices to support their daily work. By gathering and analysing qualitative studies from around the world, they wanted to understand the benefits, the challenges and the broader implications of these unofficial, innovative solutions for both staff and patients."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We examined 30 qualitative or mixed‑methods studies published between 2013 and 2022. These studies were carried out in a range of high‑, middle‑ and low‑income countries and covered many healthcare settings and professional groups. Most of the reports focused on the informal use of personal mobile phones rather than other devices such as tablets. The abstract does not give the total number of participants, their ages, genders, health conditions, how long each study lasted, or the funding sources for the primary studies.\n\nThe findings suggest that when healthcare workers use their own mobile phones, they probably become more flexible, efficient and responsive to patients’ needs. However, using personal phones probably adds financial costs for staff and creates inequities, especially for lower‑level workers and those in low‑resource settings. It also probably raises the risk that patient information may be shared in ways that compromise confidentiality, and relying on informal mobile phone solutions probably weakens formal health‑system processes such as record‑keeping and coordination."
