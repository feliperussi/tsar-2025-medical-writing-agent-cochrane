  "draft": "Is more intensive blood pressure control better than usual care for preventing eye damage (diabetic retinopathy) in people with diabetes?\n\nKey messages\n– More intensive blood‑pressure control modestly lowers the chance of developing new diabetic eye disease over about five years, especially in people with type 2 diabetes who already have high blood pressure. It does not clearly slow worsening of existing disease and may increase low‑blood‑pressure episodes, but it does not raise the risk of death.\n– In people with diabetes who do not have high blood pressure, the current evidence does not show a clear benefit of tighter blood‑pressure control for preventing eye damage, and we have limited information on severe eye disease or loss of vision.\n– Longer‑term studies are needed to understand both benefits and harms of intensive blood‑pressure control across all types of diabetes and to include outcomes that matter to patients, such as vision loss, quality of life and costs.\n\nWhat is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?\nDiabetic retinopathy is damage to the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the retina, the light‑sensing part at the back of the eye. High blood sugar can make these vessels leak, swell or close, leading to blurry vision, loss of sight and, in severe cases, blindness. It is one of the most common eye complications of diabetes and a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide.\n\nHow might blood pressure control influence eye health in people with diabetes?\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) adds extra stress to the already vulnerable retinal vessels, potentially speeding up the development and worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Lowering blood pressure could therefore reduce the chance of new eye damage (incidence) or slow the worsening of existing damage (progression). However, studies have shown mixed results, and it is unclear whether tighter blood‑pressure targets help all people with diabetes or only those who already have hypertension.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to gather all randomised trials that compared more intensive blood‑pressure control with less intensive control, usual care or placebo in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We looked for effects on the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, on its progression, on visual acuity (sharpness of vision), and on side‑effects, quality of life and costs.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched electronic databases and trial registries up to 3 September 2021. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results for incidence, progression and related outcomes and judged confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 29 randomised trials that enrolled 27 185 people with diabetes (4 620 with type 1 and 22 565 with type 2). Trials lasted from less than a year to nine years and were conducted in North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Participants included both those with normal blood pressure and those with hypertension. The intensive approach used antihypertensive drugs, tighter blood‑pressure targets or different drug classes, compared with a less intensive or usual‑care approach. Funding sources varied, with some trials fully or partially supported by pharmaceutical companies.\n\nWhat were the main results, including mortality?\nIntensive blood‑pressure control probably reduces the chance of developing new diabetic eye disease by about 5 fewer people per 100 over five years. It may also lower the combined risk of new or worsening eye disease by about 6 fewer per 100, although the evidence is uncertain. The intervention makes little or no difference to progression of existing disease, to severe complications such as proliferative retinopathy, macular swelling or vitreous bleeding, and its effect on visual acuity remains unclear. Intensive control may reduce the risk of death, but the evidence is not conclusive (risk ratio 0.87, 95 % CI 0.76 to 1.00). It probably increases low‑blood‑pressure episodes (hypotension) by about 2 more cases per 100 people.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate because the trials involved different types of participants, used varied treatment methods, and many were small. The limited number of studies for some outcomes means we cannot be certain about the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised is current to September 2021.",

The treatment may also prevent about 6 more cases of either new or worsening eye disease, but we are not sure how strong this effect is.\"\n2. **Very long sentences** – several sentences exceed 30 words, making them hard to follow.\n   - Problematic sentence: \"It probably makes little or no difference to the progression of existing disease, the risk of severe eye complications such as proliferative retinopathy, macular swelling or vitreous bleeding, and the impact on visual acuity is unclear.\"\n   - Rewrite: \"The treatment does not appear to change how existing eye disease gets worse. It also does not reduce the risk of serious complications such as proliferative retinopathy, macular swelling, or vitreous. We still do not know whether it helps keep vision sharp.\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy, complex wording** – the draft has 225 nouns, 155 complex words, and a SMOG index of 15.1, far above typical PLS ranges, which reduces readability.\n   - Problematic phrase: \"The adverse event reported most often (13 of 29 trials) was death, yielding an estimated RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.00; 13 studies; 13,979 participants; I2= 0%; moderate certainty evidence).\"\n   - Rewrite: \"The most common serious side‑effect was death. The evidence suggests the treatment might lower the chance of death slightly (about 2 fewer deaths per 100 people), but the result is not certain.\"\n4. **Missing question format for the \"Key messages\" heading** – change it to a question to meet the style guide.\n   - Suggested heading: \"What are the key messages?\"\n5. **Passive constructions** – a few passive phrases remain (e.g., \"The evidence we summarised is current to September 2021\").
