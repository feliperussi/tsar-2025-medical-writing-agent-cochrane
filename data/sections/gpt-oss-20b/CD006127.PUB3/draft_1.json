  "draft": "Is more intensive blood pressure control better than usual care for preventing eye damage (diabetic retinopathy) in people with diabetes?\n\n- More intensive blood pressure control (treating to lower blood pressure more strongly) modestly reduces the chance of developing diabetic eye disease (new cases) over about five years, especially in people with type 2 diabetes who already have high blood pressure, but it does not clearly slow worsening of existing disease and may increase episodes of low blood pressure (hypotension) while not increasing the risk of death; the evidence comes from a moderate amount of reliable research.\n- In people with diabetes who do not have high blood pressure, the current evidence does not show a clear benefit of tighter blood pressure control for preventing eye damage, and there is limited information on other important outcomes such as severe eye disease or loss of vision.\n- Further long‑term studies are needed to better understand both the benefits and harms of intensive blood pressure control across different types of diabetes, and to include outcomes that matter to patients such as vision loss, quality of life, and costs.\n\n**What is diabetic retinopathy and why is it a problem?**\nDiabetic retinopathy is damage to the tiny blood vessels in the back of the eye (the retina) that can happen when a person has diabetes. Over time, high blood sugar can make these vessels leak, swell, or close, leading to blurry vision, loss of sight, and even blindness. It is one of the most common eye complications of diabetes and a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide. While good control of blood sugar is known to help prevent or slow this damage, doctors have also wondered whether keeping blood pressure (the force of blood against artery walls) low might protect the eyes as well.\n\n**How might blood pressure control influence eye health in people with diabetes?**\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) can add extra stress to the already vulnerable retinal vessels, potentially speeding up the development and worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Some studies have suggested that lowering blood pressure could reduce the chance of new eye damage (incidence) or slow the worsening of existing damage (progression). However, the results have not been consistent, and it is unclear whether tighter blood‑pressure targets are beneficial for all people with diabetes or only for those who already have high blood pressure.\n\n**What did the review aim to find out?**\nThe authors set out to gather and evaluate all the evidence from randomised trials that compared more intensive blood‑pressure control with less intensive control, usual care, or placebo in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. They wanted to know whether tighter blood‑pressure control reduces the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, slows its progression, preserves visual acuity (sharpness of vision), and what side‑effects, quality‑of‑life impacts, or costs might be involved.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies comparing more intensive versus less intensive blood pressure control in people with diabetes, combined their results on retinopathy incidence, progression and related outcomes, and assessed confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe identified 29 randomised trials that together enrolled 27,185 people with diabetes (4,620 with type 1 and 22,565 with type 2). The studies lasted from less than a year up to nine years and were carried out in many regions, including North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Participants included both people with normal blood pressure and those with hypertension. The trials compared a more intensive approach to controlling blood pressure – using antihypertensive drugs, tighter blood‑pressure targets or different drug classes – with a less intensive or usual‑care approach. Funding was mixed: eight trials were fully funded by pharmaceutical companies, ten received partial industry support, nine were funded by other sources and two did not disclose funding.\n\n**Main results: Mortality and other outcomes**\nIntensive blood‑pressure control probably reduces the chance of developing new diabetic eye disease by about 5 fewer people per 100 over five years, and may slightly lower the combined risk of new or worsening eye disease (around 6 fewer per 100), though the evidence is uncertain. It probably makes little or no difference to the progression of existing eye disease, the risk of severe eye complications such as proliferative retinopathy, macular swelling or vitreous bleeding, and the impact on visual acuity is unclear. More intensive control probably reduces the risk of death by about 2 fewer deaths per 100 people. However, it may increase the chance of low blood pressure (hypotension) by about 2 more cases per 100 people.\n\n**Limitations of the evidence**\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the treatment, and because the studies were very small and there were not enough studies to be sure about the results.\n\n**Evidence currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2021 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails two critical style checks: (1) many subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., “Methods”, “Main results: Mortality and other outcomes”, “Limitations of the evidence”, “Evidence currency”), which breaches the Master Style Guide; (2) the opening key‑message bullet is a single, 55‑word run‑on sentence that overwhelms readers. In addition, the statement that intensive blood‑pressure control \"probably reduces the risk of death by about 2 fewer deaths per 100 people\" overstates the evidence – the source data show a non‑significant RR of 0.87, so a claim of probable reduction is inaccurate. These issues, together with the overall high noun and complex‑word density (261 nouns, 162 complex words) and long average sentence length (27 words), make the summary harder to read than typical Cochrane PLSs.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – rewrite non‑question headings as questions, e.g., change \"Methods\" to \"How did we find the evidence?\"; change \"Main results: Mortality and other outcomes\" to \"What were the main results, including mortality?\"; change \"Limitations of the evidence\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"; change \"Evidence currency\" to \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n2. **Run‑on key‑message bullet** – split the long sentence into two or three shorter points. Example rewrite: \"More intensive blood‑pressure control modestly reduces the chance of developing new diabetic eye disease over about five years, especially in people with type 2 diabetes who already have high blood pressure. It does not clearly slow worsening of existing disease and may increase low‑blood‑pressure episodes, but it does not increase the risk of death. The evidence comes from a moderate amount of reliable research.\"\n3. **Overstated claim about death** – adjust to reflect the uncertainty: \"Intensive control may reduce the risk of death, but the evidence is not conclusive (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.00).\"\n4. **Reduce noun and complex‑word density** – replace noun‑heavy phrases with active verbs, e.g., change \"The adverse event reported most often (13 of 29 trials) was death\" to \"Most trials (13 of 29) reported death as the most common adverse event\"; replace \"hypotension was reported in two trials, with an RR of 2.04\" with \"Two trials found that low blood pressure occurred twice as often with intensive treatment (RR 2.04).\"\n5. **Shorten long sentences** – break sentences that exceed 30 words. For example, the sentence \"Intensive blood‑pressure control probably reduces the chance of developing new diabetic eye disease by about 5 fewer people per 100 over five years, and may slightly lower the combined risk of new or worsening eye disease (around 6 fewer per 100), though the evidence is uncertain.\" can be split into two: \"Intensive blood‑pressure control probably reduces the chance of developing new diabetic eye disease by about 5 fewer people per 100 over five years. It may also lower the combined risk of new or worsening eye disease by about 6 fewer per 100, although the evidence is uncertain.\"\n\nThese changes will bring the summary into line with the style guide, improve readability (lowering the average sentence length and noun count), and ensure factual accuracy.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (843 words) but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: average sentence length is high (27.2 words, P90), noun count is far above typical (261, BEYOND_P90), and complex‑word counts (complex_words 162, complex_words_dc 347) and long‑word count (257) are all beyond the 90th percentile. Passive voice is moderate (12, P50) but active voice is acceptable. These metric deviations support the need to shorten sentences, reduce noun‑heavy phrasing, and simplify vocabulary."
