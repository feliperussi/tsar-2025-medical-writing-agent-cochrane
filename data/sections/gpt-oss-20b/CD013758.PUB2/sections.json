  "key_messages": [
    "Feeding healthy full‑term babies formula with higher protein (more protein in the milk) does not show a clear benefit for growth – it makes little or no difference to underweight (low weight for age), stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), or to overweight (high weight for age) and obesity (excess body fat) – and it does not appear to increase common adverse events (unwanted side‑effects such as diarrhea, vomiting, or milk allergy); however, the studies are few and the evidence is uncertain.",
    "Comparing standard‑protein formula with lower‑protein formula also shows little or no difference in growth measures (underweight, stunting, wasting) or in the frequency of adverse events during the first months of life.",
    "Because the current research is limited in size, follow‑up time, and quality, more well‑designed, longer‑term studies are needed to determine whether the amount of protein in infant formula truly affects growth, weight status, and safety."

      "subheading": "Why does the amount of protein in infant formula matter for healthy babies?",
      "content": "Many babies are fed infant formula instead of breast‑milk, especially when breastfeeding is not possible or is supplemented. Formula provides the calories and nutrients a baby needs to grow. One of the key nutrients is protein, which helps build the body’s tissues.\n\nFormulas can contain different amounts of protein – usually measured as grams of protein per 100 calories (kcal). Some products are marketed as “high‑protein” (at least 2.5 g per 100 kcal) because they may help babies gain weight faster in the first year of life. Others have a “standard” or “low‑protein” content (less than about 1.8 g per 100 kcal).\n\nParents and health professionals want to know whether giving babies more protein is beneficial or harmful. Too little protein could lead to poor growth, while too much might increase the risk of becoming overweight or obese later on. The review looks at common growth problems measured by:\n- **Underweight** – weight lower than expected for a child’s age.\n- **Stunting** – height lower than expected for age, indicating chronic growth restriction.\n- **Wasting** – low weight relative to height, indicating acute undernutrition.\n\nThese outcomes are expressed as **z‑scores**, which compare a child’s measurement to a reference population; a score of 0 means average, while negative scores indicate below‑average growth. The balance of benefits (better growth) and harms (possible future overweight, digestive issues, or allergies) of high‑protein formulas is not clear, prompting a systematic review.\n\n*Key terms explained:*\n- **Protein content (g/100 kcal):** amount of protein in the formula relative to its energy.\n- **Randomised controlled trial (RCT):** a study where participants are randomly assigned to different groups to compare outcomes, considered the gold standard for testing interventions.\n- **Z‑score:** a statistical way to show how far a measurement deviates from the average of a reference group."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to compare the effects of feeding healthy, full‑term infants formula with different protein levels. Specifically, they wanted to know:\n1. Whether high‑protein formula (≥ 2.5 g per 100 kcal) leads to better or worse growth compared with standard‑protein formula, and whether it changes the risk of becoming overweight or obese later in childhood.\n2. Whether standard‑protein formula differs from low‑protein formula (≤ 1.8 g per 100 kcal for exclusive feeding) in terms of growth outcomes and safety.\n3. What adverse events (such as diarrhoea, vomiting, or milk‑protein allergy) might be associated with higher or lower protein formulas.\n4. If there are any differences in overall mortality (death from any cause).\n\nIn short, the review aimed to evaluate the **benefits and harms** of higher versus lower protein intake in formula‑fed term infants, using evidence from randomised controlled trials."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 11 randomised controlled trials that together included 1,185 healthy, full‑term babies. All infants were fed infant formula for at least three consecutive months from birth. The studies were carried out in high‑income countries and involved both boys and girls of all ethnic backgrounds, with no underlying serious or congenital diseases. Babies were usually followed up through their first year of life, and the longest follow‑up reported was up to 11 years. The trials compared formulas that differed in protein content: high‑protein formula (≥2.5 g per 100 kcal) versus standard‑protein formula, and standard‑protein formula versus low‑protein formula (less than 1.8 g per 100 kcal for exclusive feeding or less than 1.7 g per 100 kcal when complementary foods were introduced). No information on study funding was provided."

      "content": "Feeding babies a high‑protein formula probably makes little or no difference to their weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age or weight‑for‑height during the first year, but the evidence is very uncertain. The same high‑protein formula probably also makes little or no difference to the chance of being overweight or obese by age five, again with very uncertain evidence. It probably does not change the risk of diarrhoea, vomiting or milk‑protein allergy in the first year, though the certainty is low.\n\nWhen a standard‑protein formula is compared with a low‑protein formula, the results are similar: there is probably little or no difference to growth measures (weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age, weight‑for‑height) in the first year, and the evidence is very uncertain. The risk of diarrhoea, vomiting or milk‑protein hypersensitivity in the first four months also appears to be little or no different, but the certainty remains low."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the formula, and the studies were very small with few participants, so we cannot be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search."
