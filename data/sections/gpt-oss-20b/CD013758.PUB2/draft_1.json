  "draft": "Is feeding healthy full‑term babies formula with higher protein (more protein) versus lower protein (less protein) better for their growth and health?\n\nKey messages\n- Feeding healthy full‑term babies formula with higher protein (more protein in the milk) does not show a clear benefit for growth – it makes little or no difference to underweight (low weight for age), stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), or to overweight (high weight for age) and obesity (excess body fat) – and it does not appear to increase common adverse events (unwanted side‑effects such as diarrhea, vomiting, or milk allergy); however, the studies are few and the evidence is uncertain.\n- Comparing standard‑protein formula with lower‑protein formula also shows little or no difference in growth measures (underweight, stunting, wasting) or in the frequency of adverse events during the first months of life.\n- Because the current research is limited in size, follow‑up time, and quality, more well‑designed, longer‑term studies are needed to determine whether the amount of protein in infant formula truly affects growth, weight status, and safety.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhy does the amount of protein in infant formula matter for healthy babies?\nMany babies are fed infant formula instead of breast‑milk, especially when breastfeeding is not possible or is supplemented. Formula provides the calories and nutrients a baby needs to grow. One of the key nutrients is protein, which helps build the body’s tissues.\n\nFormulas can contain different amounts of protein – usually measured as grams of protein per 100 calories (kcal). Some products are marketed as “high‑protein” (at least 2.5 g per 100 kcal) because they may help babies gain weight faster in the first year of life. Others have a “standard” or “low‑protein” content (less than about 1.8 g per 100 kcal).\n\nParents and health professionals want to know whether giving babies more protein is beneficial or harmful. Too little protein could lead to poor growth, while too much might increase the risk of becoming overweight or obese later on. The review looks at common growth problems measured by:\n- Underweight – weight lower than expected for a child’s age.\n- Stunting – height lower than expected for age, indicating chronic growth restriction.\n- Wasting – low weight relative to height, indicating acute undernutrition.\n\nThese outcomes are expressed as z‑scores, which compare a child’s measurement to a reference population; a score of 0 means average, while negative scores indicate below‑average growth. The balance of benefits (better growth) and harms (possible future overweight, digestive issues, or allergies) of high‑protein formulas is not clear, prompting a systematic review.\n\nKey terms explained:\n- Protein content (g/100 kcal): amount of protein in the formula relative to its energy.\n- Randomised controlled trial (RCT): a study where participants are randomly assigned to different groups to compare outcomes, considered the gold standard for testing interventions.\n- Z‑score: a statistical way to show how far a measurement deviates from the average of a reference group.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors set out to compare the effects of feeding healthy, full‑term infants formula with different protein levels. Specifically, they wanted to know:\n1. Whether high‑protein formula (≥ 2.5 g per 100 kcal) leads to better or worse growth compared with standard‑protein formula, and whether it changes the risk of becoming overweight or obese later in childhood.\n2. Whether standard‑protein formula differs from low‑protein formula (≤ 1.8 g per 100 kcal for exclusive feeding) in terms of growth outcomes and safety.\n3. What adverse events (such as diarrhoea, vomiting, or milk‑protein allergy) might be associated with higher or lower protein formulas.\n4. If there are any differences in overall mortality (death from any cause).\n\nIn short, the review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of higher versus lower protein intake in formula‑fed term infants, using evidence from randomised controlled trials.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing higher‑protein with lower‑protein infant formula in healthy term infants to assess benefits and harms, combined the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 11 randomised controlled trials that together included 1,185 healthy, full‑term babies. All infants were fed infant formula for at least three consecutive months from birth. The studies were carried out in high‑income countries and involved both boys and girls of all ethnic backgrounds, with no underlying serious or congenital diseases. Babies were usually followed up through their first year of life, and the longest follow‑up reported was up to 11 years. The trials compared formulas that differed in protein content: high‑protein formula (≥2.5 g per 100 kcal) versus standard‑protein formula, and standard‑protein formula versus low‑protein formula (less than 1.8 g per 100 kcal for exclusive feeding or less than 1.7 g per 100 kcal when complementary foods were introduced). No information on study funding was provided.\n\nMain results: Growth and health outcomes\nFeeding babies a high‑protein formula probably makes little or no difference to their weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age or weight‑for‑height during the first year, but the evidence is very uncertain. The same high‑protein formula probably also makes little or no difference to the chance of being overweight or obese by age five, again with very uncertain evidence. It probably does not change the risk of diarrhoea, vomiting or milk‑protein allergy in the first year, though the certainty is low.\n\nWhen a standard‑protein formula is compared with a low‑protein formula, the results are similar: there is probably little or no difference to growth measures (weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age, weight‑for‑height) in the first year, and the evidence is very uncertain. The risk of diarrhoea, vomiting or milk‑protein hypersensitivity in the first four months also appears to be little or no different, but the certainty remains low.\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the formula, and the studies were very small with few participants, so we cannot be certain about the results.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical checks: (1) Subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"), which breaches the Master Style Guide requirement. (2) Word count is 1,078 words, exceeding the 850‑word limit for a Plain Language Summary. (3) The text contains many long, passive, and noun‑heavy sentences that reduce readability. \n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Key messages\". Problem: Not a question, making navigation harder for readers. Rewrite: \"What are the main findings?\". Apply similarly to other headings (e.g., \"Why does protein matter?\" for Introduction/Aims, \"How did we find the evidence?\" for Methods, \"What did we find?\" for Results, \"What are the limitations?\" for Limitations, \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\" for Currency).\n2. **Reduce length** – Quote: \"Feeding babies a high‑protein formula probably makes little or no difference to their weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age or weight‑for‑height during the first year, but the evidence is very uncertain.\" Problem: 33‑word sentence; contributes to high words_per_sentence (25.7, beyond P90). Rewrite: \"High‑protein formula probably does not change weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age, or weight‑for‑height in the first year, and the evidence is very uncertain.\"\n3. **Active voice** – Quote: \"The risk of diarrhoea, vomiting or milk‑protein allergy in the first year, though the certainty is low.\" Problem: Passive construction obscures who assessed the risk. Rewrite: \"We found low certainty that high‑protein formula changes the risk of diarrhoea, vomiting, or milk‑protein allergy in the first year.\"\n4. **Cut down noun‑heavy sections** – Quote: \"The trials compared formulas that differed in protein content: high‑protein formula (≥2.5 g per 100 kcal) versus standard‑protein formula, and standard‑protein formula versus low‑protein formula (less than 1.8 g per 100 kcal for exclusive feeding or less than 1.7 g per 100 kcal when complementary foods were introduced).\" Problem: Long, noun‑dense sentence; contributes to high noun count (297, beyond P90) and high nominalization (25, beyond P90). Rewrite: \"We compared three formula types: high‑protein (≥2.5 g/100 kcal), standard‑protein, and low‑protein (<1.8 g/100 kcal for exclusive feeding, <1.7 g/100 kcal with complementary foods).\"\n5. **Simplify vocabulary** – Quote: \"The balance of benefits (better growth) and harms (possible future overweight, digestive issues, or allergies) of high‑protein formulas is not clear, prompting a systematic review.\" Problem: Complex words and long words inflate SMOG (16.6) and Dale‑Chall scores. Rewrite: \"It is unclear whether high‑protein formula improves growth or increases risks like overweight, stomach problems, or allergies, so we reviewed the evidence.\"\n\nThese changes will bring the word count below 850, convert subheadings to questions, shorten sentences (target <22 words per sentence), reduce passive voice (aim <13 instances), and lower noun and complex‑word density, aligning the draft with typical PLS patterns. \n\n**Metrics support**: The draft shows 31 passive constructions (BEYOND_P90), 25 nominalizations (BEYOND_P90), 297 nouns (BEYOND_P90), 220 complex words (BEYOND_P90), and a words‑per‑sentence average of 25.7 (BEYOND_P90). Addressing these metrics through the suggested edits will improve readability and conformity.",

These suggest the draft is overly dense, passive, and noun‑heavy, contributing to the high word count (1,078 > 850). Reducing sentence length, passive constructions, and complex vocabulary will bring the summary into the typical PLS percentile ranges."
