  "draft": "Is feeding healthy full‑term babies formula with higher protein (more protein) versus lower protein (less protein) better for their growth and health?\n\nKey messages\n- High‑protein formula probably does not change weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age, or weight‑for‑height in the first year, and it probably does not affect the chance of being overweight or obese by age five; the evidence is very uncertain.  \n- Standard‑protein formula compared with low‑protein formula shows little or no difference in growth measures or in common side‑effects such as diarrhoea, vomiting, or milk‑protein allergy during the first months of life; the evidence is also very uncertain.  \n- Because the studies were small, short‑term and of low quality, we need larger, longer‑lasting trials to know whether protein amount truly influences growth, weight status or safety.\n\nWhat are the main findings?  \nWe identified 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled 1,185 healthy, full‑term infants from high‑income countries. All babies received formula for at least three consecutive months from birth. The trials compared three types of formula: high‑protein (≥2.5 g protein per 100 kcal), standard‑protein, and low‑protein (<1.8 g per 100 kcal for exclusive feeding, <1.7 g when complementary foods were added).\n\nWhat did the review look at?  \nWe focused on growth outcomes measured by z‑scores – a statistical way of showing how far a child’s weight or height is from the average of a reference population. Negative z‑scores indicate below‑average growth. We also examined underweight (low weight for age), stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), overweight/obesity (high weight for age or excess body fat), and adverse events such as diarrhoea, vomiting or milk‑protein allergy.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n- When we compared high‑protein with standard‑protein formula, the pooled data suggest little or no difference in weight‑for‑age, height‑for‑age or weight‑for‑height during the first year. The same pattern held for overweight or obesity at five years of age.  \n- The risk of diarrhoea, vomiting or milk‑protein allergy in the first year was also similar between the two groups, but the certainty of this evidence is low.  \n- Comparing standard‑protein with low‑protein formula gave comparable results: growth measures in the first year were probably unchanged, and the frequency of the same adverse events in the first four months was probably similar.  \nOverall, the evidence is of very low or low certainty because the trials were small, some participants may have known which formula they received, and not all outcomes were reported consistently.\n\nWhy does protein amount matter?  \nProtein helps build a baby’s tissues, but too little could limit growth while too much might increase the risk of later overweight, digestive problems or allergies. Parents and health professionals therefore want to know whether higher protein offers any benefit or poses any harm.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, OpenGrey) and trial registries up to October 2022. Four review authors independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results using random‑effects meta‑analysis and rated confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nWe are not confident in the findings because many trials were open‑label (participants could see which formula they received), some did not report all outcomes we needed, the study populations and formula delivery methods varied, and the total number of infants was small. These factors reduce the certainty of the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence we summarised reflects searches completed in October 2022. New trials may have been published since then and could change the conclusions.\n\nWhat next?  \nWe need well‑designed, larger RCTs that follow infants for several years to determine whether the amount of protein in infant formula truly influences growth, weight status and safety. Until such data are available, we cannot recommend higher‑protein formula for better growth or lower‑protein formula for safety.",

Minor clarity refinements are recommended: (1) change passive phrasing – e.g., replace “The risk of diarrhoea, vomiting or milk‑protein allergy in the first year was also similar between the two groups…” with an active version “We found a similar risk of diarrhoea, vomiting or milk‑protein allergy in the first year for both groups…”. (2) split the long noun‑heavy sentence about evidence certainty into two shorter sentences for easier reading. (3) streamline the sentence on the certainty of evidence for overweight/obesity at five years to avoid the “again with very uncertain evidence” clause. These tweaks align the text with the style guide and address the high noun count, complex‑word, and long‑word metrics (nouns 190, complex_words 141, long_words 170, complex_words_dc 299) that are above typical PLS ranges.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (55.6% of features in best quartile). Readability scores are strong (Flesch Reading Ease 63.9, Grade 9.4). However, the draft deviates on noun count, SMOG index, complex words, long words, and Dale‑Chall complex words, all exceeding typical PLS medians, indicating a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style that can be softened with the suggested edits."
