  "key_messages": [
    "Medicines such as mexiletine (a sodium‑channel‑blocking drug) appear to lessen muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with non‑dystrophic myotonia (a genetic muscle‑channel disorder), but they do not show clear benefit for stiffness in myotonic dystrophy (a systemic muscle disease); common side effects (adverse events) include stomach upset, tiredness and headache, and overall the evidence is limited.",
    "Other drugs that have been tested, such as lamotrigine (a sodium‑channel‑blocking drug), may improve how quickly muscles relax (relaxation time) and may improve overall wellbeing (quality of life), but the evidence is uncertain and the studies were small; many other agents showed little or no effect.",
    "Because most trials involved few participants and short follow‑up (the period of observation after treatment), larger, well‑designed studies are needed to determine which medicines work best, who may not respond, and the long‑term safety of these treatments."

      "subheading": "What is myotonia and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Myotonia is a condition where the muscles take longer than normal to relax after a movement, leading to stiffness, cramps, sudden \"locking\" of the muscles, pain and fatigue. It occurs in two main groups of disorders:\n\n* **Non‑dystrophic myotonia** – a genetic problem that mainly affects the muscle’s ion channels (the tiny gates that control electrical signals in muscle cells) and causes muscle stiffness without the other organ problems seen in dystrophic forms.\n* **Myotonic dystrophy** – a more widespread disease that also involves muscle weakness, heart rhythm problems, cataracts and other systemic issues, in addition to myotonia.\n\nThese symptoms can be disabling, making everyday tasks such as walking, writing or climbing stairs difficult and reducing quality of life. Several medicines have been tried to ease the stiffness, including drugs that block sodium channels (e.g., mexiletine), tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, calcium‑channel blockers, taurine and steroids, but the evidence for how well they work and how safe they are has been unclear.\n\n*Explanation of jargon:*\n- **Ion channels** are proteins that let charged particles move in and out of cells, helping muscles contract and relax.\n- **Sodium channel blockers** are medicines that reduce the flow of sodium ions, which can calm the over‑excitable muscle cells that cause myotonia."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors set out to answer two questions:\n1. **How effective are drug treatments at reducing the muscle stiffness that people with myotonia experience?** They looked for studies that measured patients’ own reports of improvement in myotonia.\n2. **How well are these drugs tolerated?** They examined the frequency and type of side‑effects reported in the trials.\n\nTo do this, they gathered all randomised controlled trials (the most reliable type of study) that compared any drug used for myotonia with a placebo, no treatment, or another active drug, and evaluated the quality of the evidence.\n\nThe goal was to provide clear, up‑to‑date information for clinicians and patients about which medicines are likely to help and what risks they might carry."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 17 double‑blind or single‑blind randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 392 people with myotonia (219 had myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 had non‑dystrophic myotonia). The trials were small (9 to 59 participants each) and generally at high risk of bias. They compared a range of drug treatments – most often mexiletine and lamotrigine – with placebo or other active drugs. Other agents that were tested in these small studies included phenytoin, imipramine, procainamide, clomipramine, nifedipine, tocainide, diazepam, quinine, diphenylhydantoin and taurine. The abstract does not give details about how long participants were followed, their ages, gender, severity of disease, the countries where the studies were carried out, or who funded the research. No randomised trials were found for several drugs that have been suggested for future research, such as acetazolamide, flecainide, ranolazine and lacosamide."

      "subheading": "Main results: Effects of mexiletine and lamotrigine",
      "content": "Mexiletine probably reduces myotonia in people with non‑dystrophic myotonia and probably improves hand‑grip strength slightly. It also probably reduces EMG‑measured myotonia and may improve quality of life in this group. In people with myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine probably shortens hand‑grip relaxation time but makes little or no difference to overall clinical myotonia or quality of life. Mexiletine may cause side‑effects such as gastrointestinal upset, lethargy and headache.\n\nLamotrigine may improve relaxation time and probably improves quality of life in people with non‑dystrophic myotonia, but it probably increases side‑effects like headache, fatigue and rash. The evidence for other medications is unclear."

  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2023 of search."
