  "draft": "\"How effective and safe are medicines for treating muscle stiffness (myotonia) in people with myotonic disorders (muscle‑stiffness conditions)?\\n\\n**What are the key messages?**\\n– Medicines such as mexiletine (a sodium‑channel‑blocking drug) probably reduce muscle stiffness in non‑dystrophic myotonia, but they show little benefit for stiffness in myotonic dystrophy; common side‑effects include stomach upset, tiredness and headache, and the overall evidence is limited.  \\n– Lamotrigine (another sodium‑channel blocker) may speed muscle relaxation and improve quality of life in non‑dystrophic myotonia, but the evidence is uncertain and comes from small studies; other drugs showed little or no effect.  \\n– Most trials enrolled few participants and followed them for a short time, so larger, well‑designed studies are needed to identify the best medicines, the people who may not respond, and the long‑term safety of treatments.\\n\\n**What is myotonia and why does it matter?**\\nMyotonia is a condition where muscles take longer than normal to relax after a movement, causing stiffness, cramps, sudden “locking,” pain and fatigue. It occurs in two main groups:  \\n– **Non‑dystrophic myotonia** – a genetic problem that mainly affects the muscle’s ion channels (tiny gates that control electrical signals) and causes stiffness without other organ problems.  \\n– **Myotonic dystrophy** – a systemic disease that adds muscle weakness, heart rhythm issues, cataracts and other complications to the stiffness.  \\n\\nThese symptoms can make everyday tasks such as walking, writing or climbing stairs difficult and lower quality of life. Researchers have tried several medicines—including sodium‑channel blockers (e.g., mexiletine), tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, calcium‑channel blockers, taurine and steroids—but the evidence for how well they work and how safe they are has been unclear.  \\n\\n*Explanation of terms:*  \\n– **Ion channels** are proteins that let charged particles move in and out of cells, helping muscles contract and relax.  \\n– **Sodium‑channel blockers** reduce the flow of sodium ions, calming over‑excitable muscle cells that cause myotonia.\\n\\n**What did the researchers want to find out?**\\nThe review team asked two questions:  \\n1. How effective are drug treatments at reducing the muscle stiffness that people with myotonia experience? They looked for studies that measured patients’ own reports of improvement.  \\n2. How well are these drugs tolerated? They examined the frequency and type of side‑effects reported.  \\n\\nTo answer these questions, they gathered all randomised controlled trials (the most reliable study type) that compared any drug for myotonia with a placebo, no treatment, or another active drug, and they assessed the quality of the evidence.\\n\\n**How did we do the review?**\\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registers for studies testing drug treatments for myotonia. We combined findings on effectiveness and side‑effects and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\\n\\n**What did we find?**\\nWe identified 17 double‑blind or single‑blind randomised trials that enrolled a total of 392 people (219 with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 173 with non‑dystrophic myotonia). Each trial included 9 to 59 participants and generally had a high risk of bias. The studies compared a range of drugs—most often mexiletine and lamotrigine—with placebo or other active agents. Other tested drugs included phenytoin, imipramine, procainamide, clomipramine, nifedipine, tocainide, diazepam, quinine, diphenylhydantoin and taurine. No trials examined several suggested drugs such as acetazolamide, flecainide, ranolazine or lacosamide.  \\n\\n**What were the effects of mexiletine and lamotrigine?**  \\n– Mexiletine probably reduces myotonia and slightly improves hand‑grip strength in non‑dystrophic myotonia; it also likely lowers EMG‑measured myotonia and may improve quality of life. In myotonic dystrophy, mexiletine probably shortens hand‑grip relaxation time but makes little or no difference to overall clinical myotonia or quality of life. Common side‑effects are gastrointestinal upset, lethargy and headache.  \\n– Lamotrigine may improve muscle relaxation time and probably enhances quality of life in non‑dystrophic myotonia, but it likely increases side‑effects such as headache, fatigue and rash. Evidence for other medications remains unclear.\\n\\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\\nWe have moderate confidence in the findings because participants may have known which treatment they received, some trials did not report all outcomes we needed, and all studies were very small.\\n\\n**How current is the evidence?**\\nThis review updates our previous work and includes all evidence up to the March 2023 search date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several patient‑unfriendly expressions that would likely confuse readers. \n1. **Unexplained technical terms** – e.g., \"high risk of bias\", \"double‑blind or single‑blind randomised trials\", \"EMG‑measured myotonia\", \"cross‑over\" and \"moderate‑certainty evidence\" are used without plain‑language definitions. \n   *Rewrite*: \"The studies were carefully designed so that neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received the medicine or a placebo (double‑blind). Some studies were small and may have had problems that could affect the results (high risk of bias). EMG is a test that records the electrical activity of muscles. A cross‑over study means each participant tried both the medicine and a placebo at different times. \"Moderate‑certainty evidence\" means we are fairly confident in the result, but more research could change it.\"\n2. **Evidence‑certainty language that is vague for patients** – phrases like \"likely\", \"probably\" and \"moderate‑certainty evidence\" are repeated, making it hard to know how strong the findings are. \n   *Rewrite*: Replace with clearer statements such as \"The research suggests that mexiletine reduces stiffness in non‑dystrophic myotonia, but the benefit is small and we are not completely sure because the studies were small.\"\n3. **Long, noun‑heavy sentence** – \"Mexiletine probably reduces myotonia and slightly improves hand‑grip strength in non‑dystrophic myotonia; it also likely lowers EMG‑measured myotonia and may improve quality of life.\" This 27‑word sentence packs several ideas and uses many nouns, reducing readability. \n   *Rewrite*: \"In people with non‑dystrophic myotonia, mexiletine usually makes muscles relax faster and may make hand‑grip a little stronger. It also often reduces the abnormal muscle signals seen on EMG tests and could improve overall wellbeing.\"\nThese three issues (technical jargon, vague certainty language, and overly long noun‑heavy sentences) are the most likely to confuse patients. Addressing them will bring the summary in line with the Cochrane plain‑language style and improve readability.\n\n**Metrics support**: The evaluation shows high counts of nouns (226, beyond the typical range), nominalizations (22), and long words (228), confirming the draft is noun‑heavy and complex. The words‑per‑sentence average (25.7) is above the typical PLS range, indicating sentences are longer than ideal. Reducing these will directly improve the identified clarity problems.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft deviates from typical plain‑language patterns: words per sentence (25.7, P90), nominalizations (22, P90), nouns (226, beyond P90), and several readability indices (gunning fog 21, SMOG 15.3, Dale‑Chall 9.3) are all higher than usual for Cochrane PLSs. These metrics confirm the need to shorten sentences, use fewer nouns and nominalizations, and replace complex words with simpler alternatives."
