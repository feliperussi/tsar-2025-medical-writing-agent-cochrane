  "plain_title": "Do stimulant medicines (like modafinil) help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a genetic muscle disorder)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Stimulant medicines such as modafinil (a drug that increases alertness) may reduce how sleepy people with myotonic dystrophy feel during the day, but the evidence is limited; we are not sure they improve objective sleepiness tests (tests that measure how quickly a person falls asleep or how well they can stay awake) or overall quality of life, and they may increase the chance of unwanted effects (side effects).",
    "The available studies only looked at short‑term use (up to four weeks) in adult outpatients, so we do not know whether any benefits or harms continue over longer periods.",
    "Future research should include larger, longer‑term randomised trials to clarify whether stimulant medicines truly help daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy and to better understand their safety."

      "subheading": "What is excessive daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Myotonic dystrophy is a genetic muscle disorder that often causes people to feel very sleepy during the day, a symptom called hypersomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness. This tiredness can make everyday activities such as work, driving, or studying difficult and can lower quality of life. Because the sleepiness is not caused by a lack of nighttime sleep, doctors look for medicines that can help keep people awake and alert."

    {
      "subheading": "What are psychostimulants and how might they help?",
      "content": "Psychostimulants are medicines, such as modafinil, that increase brain activity and promote wakefulness. They are already used for conditions like narcolepsy and are being given more often to people with myotonic dystrophy who have daytime sleepiness."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether psychostimulant medicines reduce excessive daytime sleepiness and improve quality of life in people with myotonic dystrophy, and whether these medicines cause any harmful side effects. To answer this, they looked at all randomised trials that compared a psychostimulant with a placebo or no treatment."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies evaluating psychostimulants for excessive daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."
    }
  ],
  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified six randomised trials that together enrolled 136 adults (aged 18‑70) with genetically or electromyographically confirmed myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. All studies were short‑term (up to four weeks) and five used a cross‑over design. The only psychostimulant evaluated was modafinil, compared with placebo or no treatment. The abstract did not report funding sources, trial locations, gender distribution, disease severity, long‑term outcomes, or subgroup analyses."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Subjective sleepiness",
      "content": "Evidence is uncertain about improvements in objective wakefulness tests (MWT) or sleep latency (MSLT) and about effects on quality of life. The trials suggest psychostimulants may reduce how sleepy people feel, as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, but they may also increase the risk of side effects."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and because the studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search."
