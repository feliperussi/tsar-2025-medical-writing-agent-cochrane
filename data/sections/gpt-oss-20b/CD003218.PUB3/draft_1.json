  "draft": "Do stimulant medicines (like modafinil) help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a genetic muscle disorder)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Stimulant medicines such as modafinil (a drug that increases alertness) may reduce how sleepy people with myotonic dystrophy feel during the day, but the evidence is limited; we are not sure they improve objective sleepiness tests (tests that measure how quickly a person falls asleep or how well they can stay awake) or overall quality of life, and they may increase the chance of unwanted effects (side effects).\n- The available studies only looked at short‑term use (up to four weeks) in adult outpatients, so we do not know whether any benefits or harms continue over longer periods.\n- Future research should include larger, longer‑term randomised trials to clarify whether stimulant medicines truly help daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy and to better understand their safety.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is excessive daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy and why is it a problem?\nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic muscle disorder that often causes people to feel very sleepy during the day, a symptom or hypersomnia called excessive daytime sleepiness. This tiredness can make everyday activities such as work, driving, or studying difficult and can lower quality of life. Because the sleepiness is not caused by a lack of nighttime sleep, doctors look for medicines that can help keep people awake and alert.\n\nWhat are psychostimulants and how might they help?\nPsychostimulants are medicines, such as modafinil, that increase brain activity and promote wakefulness. They are already used for conditions like narcolepsy and are being given more often to people with myotonic dystrophy who have daytime sleepiness.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether psychostimulant medicines reduce excessive daytime sleepiness and improve quality of life in people with myotonic dystrophy, and whether these medicines cause any harmful side effects. To answer this, they looked at all randomised trials that compared a psychostimulant with a placebo or no treatment.\n\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies evaluating psychostimulants for excessive daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six randomised trials that together enrolled 136 adults (or 18‑70 years) with genetically or electromyographically confirmed myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. All studies were short‑term (up to four weeks) and five used a cross‑over design. The only psychostimulant evaluated was modafinil, compared with placebo or no treatment. The abstract did not report funding sources, trial locations, gender distribution, disease severity, long‑term outcomes, or subgroup analyses.\n\nMain results: Subjective sleepiness\nEvidence is uncertain about improvements in objective wakefulness tests (MWT) or sleep latency (MSLT) and about effects on quality of life. The trials suggest psychostimulants may reduce how sleepy people feel, as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, but they may also increase the risk of side effects.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check that **all subheadings must be phrased as questions**. The sections \"Methods\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are labelled with plain headings rather than questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, several sentences contain unexplained technical jargon (e.g., \"cross‑over design\", \"MWT\", \"MSLT\") that a lay reader is unlikely to understand, and one sentence exceeds 30 words, making it hard to follow. Suggested fixes: \n1. Change subheadings to questions – e.g., \"How did we find the evidence?\" (Methods), \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" (Limitations), \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\" (Currency). \n2. Define jargon: rewrite \"cross‑over design\" as \"a study where participants receive both the stimulant and placebo at different times\"; rewrite \"MWT (Maintenance of Wakefulness Test)\" and \"MSLT (Multiple Sleep Latency Test)\" with brief explanations. \n3. Shorten the long sentence: \"We identified six randomised trials that together enrolled 136 adults (aged 18‑70) with genetically or electromyographically confirmed myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia.\" → \"We identified six randomised trials that enrolled a total of 136 adults (aged 18‑70) with confirmed myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia.\" \nThese changes will bring the draft into full compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients. The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity, but the high counts of nouns (159, above the typical median) and complex/long words (e.g., 127 complex words, 188 long words) reflect the jargon issue and support the need to simplify language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and shows good overall conformity (55.6% of features in the best quartile). Readability scores are within typical ranges, but several metrics deviate: nouns (159, P90), SMOG index (14.4, P90), complex words (127, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (230, P90) and long words (188, P90) are higher than median, indicating the text is noun‑heavy and contains many complex/long terms. Reducing jargon and simplifying wording will address these deviations."
