  "draft": "Do stimulant medicines (like modafinil) help reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in people with myotonic dystrophy (a genetic muscle disorder)?\n\nKey messages\n– Modafinil may make people with myotonic dystrophy feel less sleepy during the day, but the evidence is limited and we are unsure whether it improves objective sleep tests or overall quality of life; it may also increase side‑effects.  \n– All studies lasted only up to four weeks and involved adult out‑patients, so we do not know if benefits or harms continue over longer periods.  \n– Larger, longer‑term randomised trials are needed to confirm whether stimulants truly help daytime sleepiness and to clarify their safety.\n\nWhat is excessive daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy and why does it matter?  \nMyotonic dystrophy is a genetic muscle disorder that often causes hypersomnia (excessive daytime sleepiness). This tiredness can make everyday activities such as work, driving or studying difficult and can lower quality of life. Because the sleepiness is not caused by a lack of nighttime sleep, doctors look for medicines that can keep people awake and alert.\n\nWhat are psychostimulants and how might they help?  \nPsychostimulants are medicines, such as modafinil, that increase brain activity and promote wakefulness. They are already used for conditions like narcolepsy and are being given more often to people with myotonic dystrophy who have daytime sleepiness.\n\nWhat did we aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether psychostimulants reduce excessive daytime sleepiness, improve quality of life, and cause any harmful side‑effects in people with myotonic dystrophy. To answer this, we looked for all randomised trials that compared a psychostimulant with a placebo or no treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP up to 5 January 2023. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined results where possible and rated our confidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified six randomised trials that enrolled a total of 136 adults (aged 18‑70) with genetically or electromyographically confirmed myotonic dystrophy and hypersomnia. All trials were short‑term (up to four weeks) and five used a cross‑over design (a study where participants receive both the stimulant and placebo at different times). The only stimulant tested was modafinil.\n\nSubjective sleepiness  \nFive trials measured how sleepy participants felt using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (a questionnaire that asks how likely a person is to fall asleep in everyday situations). Modafinil reduced scores by about 2.5 points, suggesting participants felt less sleepy.\n\nObjective sleep tests  \nData from three trials on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT – measures how long a person can stay awake) and from the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT – measures how quickly a person falls asleep) were very uncertain, with wide confidence intervals and low certainty evidence.\n\nSide‑effects  \nPeople taking modafinil were about 1.7 times more likely to experience adverse events, but the increase was not statistically clear.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe trials involved few participants, used different designs, and only examined short‑term outcomes. We could not assess long‑term benefits or harms, and we lacked data on subgroups such as disease severity or gender.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence we summarised is current to the search date of January 2023.",

      "feedback": "Critical issue: the subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, violating the style guide requirement that all section subheadings be questions. This alone fails the mandatory completeness check. In addition, several clarity and style problems could confuse readers: (1) the first key‑message bullet is a long, compound sentence that mixes several ideas; (2) the term \"adverse events\" is technical and should be replaced with the plain‑language \"side effects\"; (3) the phrase \"The only stimulant tested was modafinil\" is passive‑sounding and could be clearer; (4) the draft contains a high proportion of complex and long words (SMOG index 14.4, 124 complex words, 168 long words) which makes the text harder for a lay audience. Suggested rewrites: • Change heading to \"What are the key messages?\" • Split the first bullet into two shorter bullets, e.g., \"Modafinil may make people with myotonic dystrophy feel less sleepy during the day. However, the evidence is limited and we are unsure whether it improves objective sleep tests or overall quality of life, and it may also increase side‑effects.\" • Replace \"adverse events\" with \"side effects\" in the results paragraph. • Rephrase \"The only stimulant tested was modafinil\" as \"Only one stimulant, modafinil, was tested in the studies.\" These changes address the most important readability concerns while aligning with the master style guide. The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within word‑count limits and has good overall conformity, but the SMOG index, complex‑word and long‑word counts are in the P90 range, confirming the need to simplify language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits (569 words) and shows good overall conformity (50% best‑quartile rate). Most metrics are within typical PLS ranges, but four features deviate: SMOG index (14.4, P90), complex words (124, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (228, P90) and long words (168, P90). These can be reduced by simplifying vocabulary and shortening sentences."
