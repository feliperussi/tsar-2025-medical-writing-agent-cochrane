  "draft": "Is asthma education delivered at home (home‑based education) more effective than standard care (usual care) or less intensive teaching for children?\n\nKey messages\n– Home‑based asthma education (teaching delivered at the child’s home) shows little or no clear benefit for preventing emergency‑department visits or the need for oral corticosteroids (medicines taken by mouth to reduce inflammation). The evidence is very uncertain and no harmful effects were reported.  \n– Some studies suggest that home‑based education may improve quality of life (overall well‑being and daily functioning) and that a more intensive home programme might lower the chance of hospital admission, but these findings are also uncertain.  \n– The existing trials differ a lot in how they were carried out and are generally of limited quality, so more well‑designed research using consistent outcomes is needed.\n\nWhat is asthma and why does it matter for children?\nAsthma is a long‑term lung condition that makes the airways swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. When asthma gets worse (an “exacerbation”) a child may need urgent care, a short course of strong medicines called oral corticosteroids, or a hospital stay. These attacks disrupt school, sleep, and daily activities and can be stressful for families.\n\nWhy might teaching families at home help?\nEffective asthma care includes learning how the disease works, how to avoid triggers (such as dust, pollen, or smoke), and how to use inhalers correctly. Home‑based education can reach families who have trouble traveling to a clinic because of limited money or transport. It also lets educators see the home environment and spot everyday triggers. We do not yet know whether this approach improves outcomes compared with usual care delivered elsewhere.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to determine whether face‑to‑face asthma education provided in the home reduces important outcomes for children aged 2–18 years. Specifically, we examined whether home‑based programmes lower the number of asthma attacks that lead to emergency‑room visits or require oral corticosteroids, and whether they improve quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance, and hospitalisations compared with usual care, waiting‑list control, or less‑intensive education delivered outside the home.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched several databases up to October 2022. We looked for randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to different groups) that compared home‑based asthma education with usual care or with a less‑intensive programme. Two reviewers selected the studies, extracted the data, and used the GRADE system (a method for judging how confident we can be in the evidence) to rate certainty.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 26 trials that together included 5 122 children and adolescents (ages 1–18 years). All trials compare face‑to‑face, home‑based education (delivered to the child, the caregiver, or both) with usual care, waiting‑list control, or a less‑intensive programme. The reports did not give details about where the trials were done, who funded them, or participants’ gender and other demographics.\n\nWhat are the main results for emergency‑department visits?\nProviding home‑based asthma education probably makes little or no difference to how often children visit the emergency department. The evidence for this is very uncertain. Even when the education programme is more intensive, the effect on emergency‑department visits remains likely to be little or none, with the same high level of uncertainty.\n\nWhat do we know about other outcomes?\nEvidence for improvements in quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance, and hospitalisations is also very uncertain. Some studies hint at a possible benefit for quality of life and a lower chance of hospital admission with more intensive home programmes, but the certainty is low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the results because participants and educators often knew which group they were in, the studies used different methods, and many trials were small. These factors increase uncertainty.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates a previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to October 2022.",

The evidence for this is very uncertain.\" The phrase \"makes little or no difference to how often\" is cumbersome. *Rewrite:* \"Providing home‑based asthma education probably does not reduce the number of emergency‑department visits. The evidence for this is very uncertain.\"\nThese issues stem from the draft’s high scores on passive voice (27 instances, beyond the typical range), nominalisation (28 instances), noun count (202, far above the median), and complex‑word metrics (SMOG 14.5, complex words 150, long words 201). Reducing passive constructions, replacing nominalisations with active verbs, and shortening sentences will bring the text into the typical PLS pattern and improve patient comprehension.",

These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy phrasing, and high lexical complexity, which align with the identified clarity issues."
