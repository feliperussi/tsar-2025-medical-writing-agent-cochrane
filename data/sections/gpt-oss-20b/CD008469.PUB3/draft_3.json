  "draft": "Is asthma education delivered at home (home‑based education) more effective than standard care (usual care) or less intensive teaching for children?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Home‑based asthma education shows little or no clear benefit for preventing emergency‑department visits or the need for oral corticosteroids (medicines taken by mouth to reduce inflammation). The evidence is very uncertain and no harmful effects were reported.  \n– Some studies suggest that home‑based education may improve quality of life (overall well‑being and daily functioning) and that a more intensive home programme might lower the chance of hospital admission, but these findings are also uncertain.  \n– The existing trials differ a lot in how they were done and are generally of limited quality, so more well‑designed research using consistent outcomes is needed.\n\nWhat is asthma and why does it matter for children?\nAsthma is a long‑term lung condition that makes the airways swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. When asthma gets worse (an “exacerbation”) a child may need urgent care, a short course of strong medicines called oral corticosteroids, or a hospital stay. These attacks disrupt school, sleep, and daily activities and can be stressful for families.\n\nWhy might teaching families at home help?\nEffective asthma care includes learning how the disease works, how to avoid triggers (like dust, pollen, or smoke), and how to use inhalers correctly. Home‑based education can reach families who have trouble traveling to a clinic because of limited money or transport. It also lets educators see the home environment and spot everyday triggers. We do not yet know whether this approach improves outcomes compared with usual care delivered elsewhere.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe aimed to determine whether face‑to‑face asthma education provided in the home reduces important outcomes for children aged 2–18 years. Specifically, we examined whether home‑based programmes lower the number of asthma attacks that lead to emergency‑room visits or require oral corticosteroids, and whether they improve quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance, and hospitalisations compared with usual care, waiting‑list control, or less‑intensive education delivered outside the home.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched multiple databases up to October 2022 for randomised controlled trials that compared home‑based asthma education with usual care or less‑intensive programmes. Two reviewers selected studies, extracted data, and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 26 trials that together included 5 122 children and adolescents (ages 1–18 years). All trials compared face‑to‑face, home‑based education (delivered to the child, the caregiver, or both) with usual care, waiting‑list control, or a less‑intensive programme. The reports did not provide details about where the trials were done, who funded them, or participants’ gender and other demographics.\n\nWhat are the main results for emergency‑department visits?\nWe found that providing home‑based asthma education probably makes little or no difference to how often children visit the emergency department. The evidence for this is very uncertain. Even when the education programme is more intensive, the effect on emergency‑department visits remains likely to be little or none, with the same high level of uncertainty.\n\nWhat do we know about other outcomes?\nEvidence for improvements in quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance, and hospitalisations is also very uncertain. Some studies hint at a possible benefit for quality of life and a lower chance of hospital admission with more intensive home programmes, but the certainty is low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the results because participants and educators often knew which group they were in, the studies used different methods, and many trials were small. These factors increase uncertainty.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates a previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to October 2022.",

Patients may not know what these mean. \n   *Rewrite*: \"We used the GRADE system (a method for judging how confident we can be in the evidence) and looked at randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to different groups) that compared face‑to‑face education (the educator meets the family in person) with usual care.\"\n\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"We searched multiple databases up to October 2022 for randomised controlled trials that compared home‑based asthma education with usual care or less‑intensive programmes.\" (23 words) packs several ideas together and can be hard to follow. \n   *Rewrite*: \"We searched several databases up to October 2022. We looked for studies that compared home‑based asthma education with usual care or with a less‑intensive programme.\"\n\n3. **High passive voice and noun‑heavy phrasing** – The draft contains many passive constructions (e.g., \"The evidence is very uncertain\") and nominalisations such as \"the existing trials differ a lot in how they were done and are generally of limited quality\". This makes the text feel abstract and harder to read. \n   *Rewrite*: Change to active voice and use verbs: \"The trials vary a lot in how they were carried out, and most are of limited quality. Because of this, we are not confident in the results.\"\n\nAddressing these three points will reduce the passive‑voice count (currently 25, beyond the typical P90 range), lower nominalisations (28, also beyond P90), and bring the number of complex and long words closer to typical PLS levels, improving overall readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (55.6% of features in the best quartile) but notable deviations: passive voice (25 instances, BEYOND_P90), nominalisation (28, BEYOND_P90), nouns (195, P90), SMOG index (14.3, P90), and high counts of complex/long words. These metrics indicate the draft is more passive, noun‑heavy and uses many long or complex words than typical Cochrane PLS texts, supporting the recommended edits."
