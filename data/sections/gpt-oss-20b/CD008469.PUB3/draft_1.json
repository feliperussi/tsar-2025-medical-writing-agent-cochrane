  "draft": "Is asthma education delivered at home (home‑based education) more effective than standard care (usual care) or less intensive teaching for children?\n\nKey messages\n- Home‑based asthma education (teaching delivered at the child's home) shows little or no clear benefit compared with usual care (standard care) or less‑intensive teaching for preventing emergency department visits or the need for oral corticosteroids (medication taken by mouth to reduce inflammation); the evidence is very uncertain and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Some studies suggest that home‑based education may improve quality of life (overall well‑being and daily functioning) for children, and that a more intensive home‑based program might reduce the chance of hospitalisation (being admitted to hospital), but these findings are also uncertain.\n- Because the existing trials differ a lot in how they were done and are generally of limited quality, more well‑designed research using consistent outcomes is needed to determine which components of home‑based education are most effective for children with asthma.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhat is asthma and why does it matter for children?\nAsthma is a long‑term lung condition that makes the airways swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. It affects millions of children worldwide. When asthma gets worse—called an \"exacerbation\"—a child may need urgent care, a short course of strong medicines called oral corticosteroids, or a hospital stay. These attacks disrupt school, sleep, and daily activities and can be stressful for families.\n\nWhy might teaching families at home help?\nEffective asthma care includes learning how the disease works, how to avoid triggers (like dust, pollen, or smoke), and how to use inhalers correctly. Home‑based education can reach families who have trouble traveling to a clinic, such as those with limited money or transport, and it takes place in a familiar setting where everyday triggers can be identified. However, it is not yet clear whether education delivered at home improves outcomes compared with usual care given elsewhere.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review aimed to determine whether face‑to‑face asthma education provided in the home reduces important outcomes for children aged 2‑18 years. Specifically, the authors examined whether home‑based programs lower the number of asthma attacks that lead to emergency‑room visits or require oral corticosteroids, and whether they improve quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance, and hospitalisations compared with usual care, waiting‑list control, or less‑intensive education delivered outside the home.\n\nMethods\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies evaluating home‑based asthma education for children and caregivers, combined their findings, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 26 randomised controlled trials that together included 5,122 children and adolescents with asthma, aged 1 to 18 years. The studies covered the full range of asthma severity, from mild to severe. All trials compared face‑to‑face, home‑based asthma education programmes (delivered to the child, the caregiver, or both) with usual care, waiting‑list controls, or less‑intensive education delivered outside the home or in a less‑intensive home‑based format. The abstract did not provide details about where the trials were conducted, who funded them, or the gender or other demographic characteristics of the participants.\n\nMain results: Emergency department visits\nProviding home‑based asthma education to children and their families probably makes little or no difference to the number of emergency department visits, and the evidence is very uncertain. Even when the education programme is more intensive, the effect on emergency department visits remains likely to be little or none, with the same high level of uncertainty.\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the education, and the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.",

Suggested improvements: 1. Rewrite long sentences into shorter, active‑voice statements. 2. Convert subheadings into question form (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\", \"What did the study aim to find?\"). 3. Reduce technical jargon and nominalizations; replace with plain language. 4. Provide missing contextual details (e.g., trial locations, funding, participant demographics) if available, or explicitly note their absence. 5. Ensure sentence length stays under 20 words on average to meet plain‑language standards.",

These indicate the draft is overly dense, uses many passive constructions and technical terms, and exceeds typical sentence length for plain‑language summaries."
