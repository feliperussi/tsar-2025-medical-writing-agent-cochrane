  "draft": "Is asthma education delivered at home (home‑based education) more effective than standard care (usual care) or less intensive teaching for children?\n\nKey messages\n– Home‑based asthma education shows little or no clear benefit for preventing emergency‑department visits or the need for oral corticosteroids (medicines taken by mouth to reduce inflammation); the evidence is very uncertain and no harmful effects were reported.  \n– Some studies suggest that home‑based education may improve quality of life (overall well‑being and daily functioning) and that a more intensive home programme might lower the chance of hospital admission, but these findings are also uncertain.  \n– The existing trials differ a lot in how they were done and are generally of limited quality, so more well‑designed research using consistent outcomes is needed.\n\nWhat is asthma and why does it matter for children?\nAsthma is a long‑term lung condition that makes the airways swell and narrow, causing wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. When asthma gets worse (an “exacerbation”) a child may need urgent care, a short course of oral corticosteroids, or a hospital stay. These attacks disrupt school, sleep, and daily activities and can be stressful for families.\n\nWhy might teaching families at home help?\nEffective asthma care includes learning how the disease works, how to avoid triggers (such as dust, pollen, or smoke), and how to use inhalers correctly. Home‑based education can reach families who have trouble traveling to a clinic, for example because of limited money or transport. It also lets educators see the home environment and identify everyday triggers. We do not yet know whether this approach improves outcomes compared with usual care delivered elsewhere.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe aimed to determine whether face‑to‑face asthma education provided in the home reduces important outcomes for children aged 2–18 years. Specifically, we examined whether home‑based programmes lower the number of asthma attacks that lead to emergency‑room visits or require oral corticosteroids, and whether they improve quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance, and hospitalisations compared with usual care, waiting‑list control, or less‑intensive education delivered outside the home.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched multiple databases up to October 2022 for randomised controlled trials that compared home‑based asthma education with usual care or less‑intensive programmes. Two reviewers selected studies, extracted data, and rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 26 trials involving 5 122 children and adolescents (ages 1–18 years). The trials covered the full range of asthma severity. All compared face‑to‑face, home‑based education (delivered to the child, the caregiver, or both) with usual care, waiting‑list control, or a less‑intensive programme. The reports did not give details about where the trials were conducted, who funded them, or participants’ gender or other demographics.\n\nProviding home‑based education probably makes little or no difference to the number of emergency‑department visits, and the evidence is very uncertain. The same uncertainty applies to more intensive home programmes. Evidence for improvements in quality of life, symptom‑free days, school attendance, and hospitalisations is also very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the results because participants and educators often knew which group they were in, the studies used different methods and small sample sizes, and the overall quality of the trials was low. These factors increase uncertainty.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates a previous Cochrane review and includes studies searched up to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failed: not all subheadings are phrased as questions – the heading \"Key messages\" is a noun phrase, not a question. This breaches the style requirement that every subheading be a question. Additionally, the draft contains several clarity and style issues that could confuse readers:\n1. Subheading not a question – \"Key messages\" should be re‑phrased as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\").\n2. Long, combined sentence – \"Providing home‑based education probably makes little or no difference to the number of emergency‑department visits, and the evidence is very uncertain.\" This packs two ideas together and may overwhelm a lay reader. Split it into two short sentences.\n3. Wordy phrasing – \"The reports did not give details about where the trials were conducted, who funded them, or participants’ gender or other demographics.\" The phrase \"did not give details about\" is verbose; a simpler construction improves readability.\n4. High passive voice and nominalisation – The draft registers 25 passive constructions and 25 nominalisations, far above the typical PLS range (median ≈13). Converting passive sentences to active voice and replacing noun‑forms with verbs will make the text clearer.\n5. Noun‑heavy sentences – With 182 nouns (well above the median of 116), the text feels dense. Re‑writing some noun‑heavy clauses into verb‑driven sentences will reduce cognitive load.\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Change heading to: \"What are the key messages?\"\n- Split sentence: \"Providing home‑based education probably makes little or no difference to the number of emergency‑department visits. The evidence for this is very uncertain.\"\n- Simplify wording: \"The reports did not provide details about where the trials were done, who funded them, or participants’ gender and other demographics.\"\n- Convert passive to active where possible, e.g., replace \"The evidence is very uncertain\" with \"We are very uncertain about the evidence.\"\n- Reduce noun density by turning phrases like \"the number of emergency‑department visits\" into \"how often children visit the emergency department\".\nThese changes will align the summary with the Master Style Guide and improve readability for patients.\n\nMetrics support: the PLS evaluation shows 25 passive voice instances (BEYOND_P90), 25 nominalisations (BEYOND_P90), 182 nouns (BEYOND_P90), and high complex‑word counts, confirming the need to simplify language and increase active constructions.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (Flesch‑Reading Ease 51.6, FKGL 10.7) are within the better quartile. However, several metrics deviate strongly: passive_voice (25, BEYOND_P90), nominalization (25, BEYOND_P90), nouns (182, BEYOND_P90), smog_index (14.0, BEYOND_P90), and complex‑word counts (complex_words 137, complex_words_dc 271) are all far above typical PLS ranges, indicating overly noun‑heavy, passive, and complex language. These metric alerts align with the editorial suggestions to use more active voice, fewer nominalisations, and simpler wording."
