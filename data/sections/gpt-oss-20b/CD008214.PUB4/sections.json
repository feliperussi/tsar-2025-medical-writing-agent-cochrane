  "key_messages": [
    "Giving anti‑VEGF injections (drugs that block abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before vitrectomy (eye surgery to remove scar tissue) probably improves vision about six months after surgery, lowers the chance of bleeding during and after the operation, and reduces the risk of retinal tears (small tears in the back layer of the eye) during surgery; no serious side effects were reported, but the evidence comes from studies with methodological limitations, so confidence is limited.",
    "The impact of anti‑VEGF on the need for additional surgery or on the use of silicone oil tamponade (silicone oil placed in the eye to hold the retina in place) remains uncertain because the available data are imprecise.",
    "Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up and standardized outcome measures to confirm these benefits and to assess any potential harms or longer‑term effects."

      "subheading": "What is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why does it matter?",
      "content": "Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced stage of eye disease that can develop in people with diabetes. In PDR, abnormal, fragile blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina – the light‑sensing tissue at the back of the eye. These new vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, and lead to serious vision loss or even blindness. Because the blood vessels are weak, they often cause bleeding inside the eye and can create scar tissue that pulls the retina away from its normal position."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "How is PDR usually treated and what problems can still occur?",
      "content": "The main surgical treatment for the complications of PDR is a procedure called pars plana vitrectomy. During vitrectomy, a surgeon removes the cloudy gel (vitreous) that fills the eye and clears any blood, scar tissue, or detached retina. While vitrectomy can restore sight, the operation itself can be risky. Surgeons may encounter bleeding, create tiny holes in the retina, or cause the retina to detach during or after the surgery. After the operation, patients can still experience bleeding inside the eye (called postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage), need additional surgeries, or require a special oil (silicone oil tamponade) to hold the retina in place. These complications can delay recovery and reduce the final visual outcome."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to determine whether giving anti‑vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‑VEGF) medicines into the eye around the time of vitrectomy could improve outcomes. Anti‑VEGF drugs shrink the abnormal new blood vessels that cause bleeding in PDR. The authors examined randomised trials to see if peri‑operative anti‑VEGF use reduced surgical complications (such as bleeding, retinal holes, and need for extra surgery) and whether it led to better vision after the operation."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 28 randomised controlled trials that together involved 1,914 eyes of people undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (such as non‑clearing vitreous haemorrhage, macula‑involving tractional retinal detachment, or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment). The studies were carried out in many countries, most often in China (11 trials), followed by Iran (3), Italy (2), Mexico (2) and single trials in South Korea, the United Kingdom, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the United States, Indonesia and Pakistan. In each trial, participants received an anti‑VEGF injection into the eye around the time of surgery (either before or during the operation) in addition to the standard vitrectomy, and were compared with participants who had vitrectomy alone. The review reports outcomes at about six months after surgery, but does not give details on participants’ ages, gender balance, or the funding sources of the individual trials. No studies reported quality‑of‑life outcomes or the proportion of eyes with very poor vision (counting fingers or worse)."

      "subheading": "Main results: Anti‑VEGF reduces bleeding and retinal tears after vitrectomy",
      "content": "Giving an anti‑VEGF injection around the time of vitrectomy probably leads to a large reduction in early postoperative bleeding – about 12 eyes out of 100 bleed early with anti‑VEGF compared with 31 out of 100 without it. It also probably reduces late postoperative bleeding, with about 10 out of 100 eyes bleeding late when anti‑VEGF is used versus 23 out of 100 without it. Intra‑operative retinal tears are also probably reduced, occurring in about 12 out of 100 eyes with anti‑VEGF versus 31 out of 100 eyes without. There is low‑certainty evidence that anti‑VEGF may improve visual acuity six months after surgery, but the effect is uncertain. It is unclear whether anti‑VEGF reduces the need for repeat surgery for early bleeding or for retinal detachment, and evidence is very low certainty about any effect on the need for silicone oil tamponade during surgery."
