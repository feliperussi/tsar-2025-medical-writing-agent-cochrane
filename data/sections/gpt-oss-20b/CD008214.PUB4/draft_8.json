  "draft": "Does giving anti‑VEGF eye injections (drugs that block abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before vitrectomy (eye surgery that removes scar tissue) improve vision and lower bleeding risk in people with advanced diabetic eye disease?\n\nKey messages  \n– Giving an anti‑VEGF injection before or during vitrectomy probably improves vision about six months after surgery, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had some problems.  \n– Giving anti‑VEGF probably reduces bleeding during and after surgery and also lowers the chance of retinal tears (small holes in the back layer of the eye). We are more confident about this benefit because it comes from better‑quality studies.  \n– No serious side‑effects were reported, but the evidence comes from small trials with methodological limitations, so our overall confidence is limited.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why does it matter?  \nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced stage of eye disease that can develop in people with diabetes. In PDR, fragile new blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina – the light‑sensing tissue at the back of the eye. These vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, and create scar tissue that pulls the retina away, leading to serious vision loss or blindness.\n\nHow is PDR usually treated and what problems can still occur?  \nSurgeons treat the complications with a surgery called pars plana vitrectomy. During vitrectomy the surgeon removes the gel‑like substance (vitreous) that fills the eye and clears any blood, scar tissue, and detached retina. The operation can restore sight, but it can also cause bleeding, create tiny holes in the retina, or lead to retinal detachment during or after surgery. After the operation patients may experience postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (bleeding inside the eye), need additional surgeries, or require silicone oil tamponade (silicone oil placed in the eye to hold the retina in place). These complications can delay recovery and reduce the final visual outcome.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether giving an anti‑VEGF injection around the time of vitrectomy reduces surgical complications – such as bleeding, retinal tears, and the need for extra surgery – and whether it leads to better vision after the operation.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared vitrectomy with and without anti‑VEGF in people with PDR. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The search was current to June 2022.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 28 randomised trials that together involved 1 914 eyes undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for PDR complications (non‑clearing, macula‑involving tractional retinal detachment, or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment). In each trial participants received an anti‑VEGF injection (either before or during surgery) in addition to standard vitrectomy, and we compared them with eyes that had vitrectomy alone. No study reported quality‑of‑life outcomes or the proportion of eyes with very poor vision (counting‑fingers vision).\n\nWhat are the main results?  \n– Early postoperative bleeding (within four weeks) occurred in 12 % of eyes that received anti‑VEGF versus 31 % without it.  \n– Late postoperative bleeding (after four weeks) occurred in 10 % versus 23 %.  \n– Retinal tears during surgery occurred in 12 % versus 31 %.  \n– Six months after surgery, eyes that received anti‑VEGF tended to have slightly better vision, but because the studies were small and had limitations we are not confident about this result.  \n– Fewer eyes needed another operation for bleeding after anti‑VEGF (4 % vs 13 %), but the data are uncertain.  \n– No serious side‑effects were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMost trials were small and did not mask participants or surgeons, so performance bias may have influenced the results. Because of these limitations we have limited confidence in the evidence, especially for visual outcomes and for the need for additional surgery.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe searched the literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

Additionally, several clarity and style issues were identified:\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Key messages\" should be re‑worded as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\").\n2. **Long, compound bullet sentences** – The first bullet under Key messages combines two ideas in one long sentence, making it hard to follow. Suggested rewrite: \"Giving an anti‑VEGF injection before or during vitrectomy probably improves vision about six months after surgery. However, the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.\"\n3. **Passive voice** – \"No serious side‑effects were reported\" hides who looked for side‑effects. Rewrite as: \"We did not find any serious side‑effects.\"\n4. **Nominalisation and noun‑heavy phrasing** – In the Results section the sentence \"We identified 28 randomised trials that together involved 1 914 eyes undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for PDR complications...\" can be simplified to \"We found 28 randomised trials that together included 1 914 eyes that had pars plana vitrectomy for PDR complications.\"\n5. **Complex / long words** – Terms like \"peri‑operative\" and \"intra‑operative\" can be replaced with simpler phrasing such as \"around the time of surgery\" and \"during surgery\" to lower the SMOG and complex‑word counts.\nThese changes will improve readability, reduce passive constructions, and bring the draft into full compliance with the style guide while also addressing metric deviations (high nominalisation, noun count, SMOG, and complex‑word scores).",

However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in nominalisation (23, P90), noun count (193, P90), SMOG index (14.8, P90), and especially complex words (157, BEYOND_P90) and long words (188, P90). These metrics support the need to reduce noun‑heavy phrasing and simplify vocabulary."
