  "draft": "Does giving anti‑VEGF eye injections (drugs that block abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before vitrectomy (eye surgery that removes scar tissue) improve vision and lower bleeding risk in people with advanced diabetic eye disease?\n\nKey messages  \n– Giving anti‑VEGF injections before vitrectomy probably improves vision about six months after surgery, lowers the chance of bleeding during and after the operation, and reduces the risk of small retinal tears; no serious side‑effects were reported, but the evidence comes from small studies with methodological limitations, so confidence is limited.  \n– We are very uncertain whether anti‑VEGF reduces the need for additional surgery or the use of silicone‑oil tamponade (silicone oil placed in the eye to hold the retina in place) because the available data are sparse and imprecise.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm these benefits and to assess any longer‑term harms.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why does it matter?  \nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced stage of eye disease that can develop in people with diabetes. In PDR, fragile new blood vessels grow on the retina – the light‑sensing layer at the back of the eye. These vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, and create scar tissue that pulls the retina away, leading to serious vision loss or blindness.\n\nHow is PDR usually treated and what problems can still occur?  \nThe main surgical treatment for PDR complications is pars plana vitrectomy – a procedure that removes the cloudy gel (vitreous) that fills the eye and clears blood, scar tissue, or a detached retina. Vitrectomy can restore sight, but the operation can be risky. Surgeons may encounter bleeding, create tiny holes in the retina, or cause the retina to detach during or after surgery. After the operation patients can still experience postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (bleeding inside the eye), need additional surgeries, or require silicone‑oil tamponade to hold the retina in place. These complications can delay recovery and reduce the final visual outcome.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether giving anti‑VEGF medicine into the eye around the time of vitrectomy reduces surgical complications – such as bleeding, retinal tears, and the need for extra surgery – and whether it leads to better vision after the operation.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries and the WHO ICTRP for randomised controlled trials that compared vitrectomy with and without peri‑operative anti‑VEGF in people with PDR. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The search was current to June 2022.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 28 randomised trials involving 1 914 eyes. All participants had pars plana vitrectomy for the following PDR complications: non‑clearing vitreous haemorrhage, macula‑involving tractional retinal detachment, or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment. In each trial participants received an anti‑VEGF injection (either before or during surgery) in addition to standard vitrectomy, and were compared with eyes that had vitrectomy alone. No study reported quality‑of‑life outcomes or the proportion of eyes with very poor vision (counting‑fingers vision).\n\nWhat are the main results?  \nEarly postoperative bleeding occurred in about 12 % of eyes that received anti‑VEGF compared with 31 % without it. Late bleeding (after four weeks) occurred in about 10 % versus 23 % without anti‑VEGF. Intra‑operative retinal tears were seen in about 12 % of anti‑VEGF eyes versus 31 % without. These reductions are supported by moderate to high certainty evidence. Vision measured six months after surgery was slightly better in the anti‑VEGF group, but the evidence is low‑certainty, so we cannot be sure of a true benefit. The need for repeat surgery or for silicone‑oil tamponade showed very uncertain effects because the data were sparse and imprecise. No serious side‑effects were reported in any trial.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMost trials were small and did not mask participants or surgeons, so performance bias may have influenced results. Confidence in the evidence is limited, especially for visual outcomes and for the need for additional surgery.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe searched the literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

These issues reduce readability despite the overall good metric scores. The draft should be revised to address these points before it can be approved.\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Key messages: split into three short bullet points, each starting with a verb (e.g., “We found that anti‑VEGF injections probably improve vision…”, “They probably lower the chance of bleeding…”, “Evidence is limited, so confidence is low.”).\n- Define POVCH at first mention: “post‑operative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (POVCH – bleeding inside the eye after surgery)”.\n- Change passive to active: “The trials did not report any serious side‑effects.”\n- Explain pars plana vitrectomy: “pars plana vitrectomy – a surgery that removes the cloudy gel inside the eye and clears blood or scar tissue.”\n- Rewrite nominalised sentence: “We are unsure whether anti‑VEGF reduces the need for another operation or for silicone‑oil because the data are few and imprecise.”",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to typical patterns on most metrics (words per sentence 19, FK grade 10, Flesch reading ease 55, active voice 70). However, it deviates strongly on nominalisation (21, beyond P90), noun count (202, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.2, beyond P90), and complex word counts (322 complex_words_dc, 170 complex_words, both beyond P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long or complex words, supporting the need to simplify wording and reduce nominalisations."
