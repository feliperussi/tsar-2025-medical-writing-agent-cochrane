  "draft": "Does giving anti‑VEGF eye injections (drugs that block abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before vitrectomy (eye surgery that removes scar tissue) improve vision and lower bleeding risk in people with advanced diabetic eye disease?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– Giving anti‑VEGF injections probably improves vision about six months after vitrectomy, but the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had some problems.  \n– Giving anti‑VEGF injections probably reduces bleeding during and after surgery and also lowers the chance of retinal tears (small holes in the back layer of the eye). We are more confident about this benefit because it comes from better‑quality studies.  \n– No serious side‑effects were reported, but the evidence comes from small trials with methodological limitations, so our overall confidence is limited.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and why does it matter?  \nPDR is an advanced stage of diabetic eye disease. In PDR, fragile new blood vessels grow on the retina – the light‑sensing tissue at the back of the eye. These vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, and cause scar tissue that pulls the retina away, leading to serious vision loss or blindness.\n\nHow is PDR usually treated and what problems can still occur?  \nThe main surgical treatment is pars plana vitrectomy. During vitrectomy the surgeon removes the cloudy gel (vitreous) that fills the eye and clears any blood, scar tissue, or detached retina. The operation can restore sight, but it can also cause bleeding, create tiny retinal holes, or lead to retinal detachment during or after surgery. After the operation patients may experience postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (bleeding inside the eye after surgery), need additional surgeries, or require silicone oil tamponade (silicone oil placed in the eye to hold the retina in place). These complications can delay recovery and reduce the final visual outcome.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether giving anti‑VEGF medicine into the eye around the time of vitrectomy reduces surgical complications – such as bleeding, retinal tears, and the need for extra surgery – and whether it leads to better vision after the operation.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared vitrectomy with and without peri‑operative anti‑VEGF in people with PDR. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The search was current to June 2022.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 28 randomised trials that together involved 1 914 eyes undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for PDR complications (non‑clearing vitreous haemorrhage, macula‑involving tractional retinal detachment, or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment). In each trial participants received an anti‑VEGF injection (either before or during surgery) in addition to standard vitrectomy, and we compared them with eyes that had vitrectomy alone. No study reported quality‑of‑life outcomes or the proportion of eyes with very poor vision (counting‑fingers vision).\n\nWhat are the main results?  \n– Early postoperative bleeding (within four weeks) occurred in 12 % of eyes that received anti‑VEGF versus 31 % without it.  \n– Late postoperative bleeding (after four weeks) occurred in 10 % versus 23 %.  \n– Retinal tears during surgery occurred in 12 % versus 31 %.  \n– Vision measured six months after surgery was a little better with anti‑VEGF, but we are not very sure about this benefit because the studies were small and had some problems.  \n– Fewer eyes needed another operation for bleeding after anti‑VEGF (4 % vs 13 %), but the data are uncertain.  \n– No serious side‑effects were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMost trials were small and did not mask participants or surgeons, so performance bias may have influenced the results. Because of these limitations we have limited confidence in the evidence, especially for visual outcomes and for the need for additional surgery.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe searched the literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required sections, title format, factual accuracy and word‑count checks, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a patient reader. 1) Jargon not fully explained: the term “pars plana vitrectomy” appears without a plain‑language definition. Suggested rewrite: “The main surgery, called pars plana vitrectomy, removes the gel‑like substance (vitreous) inside the eye.” 2) Nominalised, noun‑heavy sentence: “The review set out to determine whether giving anti‑vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‑VEGF) medicines into the eye around the time of vitrectomy could improve outcomes.” Rewrite to active language: “We wanted to find out if giving an anti‑VEGF injection before or during vitrectomy improves results.” 3) Passive voice and unclear agency: “The main surgical treatment is pars plana vitrectomy.” Rewrite: “Surgeons treat the complications with a surgery called pars plana vitrectomy.” 4) Long, complex result sentence: “Vision measured six months after surgery was a little better with anti‑VEGF, but we are not very sure about this benefit because the studies were small and had some problems.” Rewrite: “Six months after surgery, eyes that received anti‑VEGF tended to have slightly better vision, but because the studies were small and had limitations we are not confident about this result.” 5) Unexplained term “peri‑operative” used in several places; replace with “around the time of surgery” or define it the first time it appears. These issues stem from the metric analysis showing high nominalisation (21), many nouns (187) and a large number of complex words (157) and complex Dale‑Chall words (305), indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and technical than typical PLS. Addressing the above rewrites will bring the draft into line with Cochrane plain‑language style and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and scores well on readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 56.9, grade 9.99). However, it deviates from typical PLS patterns in nominalisation, noun count, SMOG index, and especially in complex words (both total and Dale‑Chall), which are far above the median (BEYOND_P90). These metric outliers support the need to reduce noun‑heavy phrasing and simplify vocabulary."
