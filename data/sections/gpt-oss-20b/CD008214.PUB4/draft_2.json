  "draft": "Does giving anti‑VEGF eye injections (drugs that block abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before vitrectomy (eye surgery to remove scar tissue) improve vision and lower bleeding risk in people with advanced diabetic eye disease?\n\nKey messages\n– Giving anti‑VEGF injections around the time of vitrectomy probably reduces early and late bleeding inside the eye and cuts the chance of retinal tears during surgery.  \n– The injection may improve vision about six months after surgery, but the evidence is uncertain.  \n– We need larger, well‑designed trials to confirm benefits and to check for any longer‑term harms.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why does it matter?  \nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced eye complication of diabetes. Fragile new blood vessels grow on the retina – the light‑sensing layer at the back of the eye. These vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, and cause scar tissue that pulls the retina away, leading to serious vision loss or blindness.\n\nHow is PDR usually treated and what problems can still occur?  \nThe main surgery for PDR complications is pars plana vitrectomy. During vitrectomy the surgeon removes the cloudy gel (vitreous) that fills the eye and clears blood, scar tissue, or a detached retina. The operation can restore sight, but it carries risks. Surgeons may encounter bleeding, create tiny holes in the retina, or cause the retina to detach during or after the procedure. After surgery patients can still experience bleeding inside the eye (post‑operative vitreous cavity haemorrhage), need additional operations, or require silicone oil to hold the retina in place. These complications can delay recovery and reduce the final visual outcome.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether giving anti‑VEGF medicine into the eye around the time of vitrectomy reduces surgical complications – such as bleeding, retinal holes, and the need for extra surgery – and whether it leads to better vision after the operation.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries and the WHO ICTRP for randomised controlled trials that compared vitrectomy with and without peri‑operative anti‑VEGF in people with PDR. The search was run up to June 2022. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 28 trials involving 1 914 eyes that underwent vitrectomy for PDR complications such as non‑clearing vitreous haemorrhage, macula‑involving tractional retinal detachment or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment. Trials were conducted in many countries, most often China. All participants received an anti‑VEGF injection (either before or during surgery) in addition to standard vitrectomy, and were compared with eyes that had vitrectomy alone. No trial reported quality‑of‑life outcomes or the proportion of eyes with very poor vision (counting‑fingers vision).\n\nWhat are the main results?  \nEarly post‑operative bleeding occurred in about 12 % of eyes that received anti‑VEGF compared with 31 % without it. Late bleeding (after four weeks) occurred in about 10 % versus 23 % without anti‑VEGF. Intra‑operative retinal tears were seen in about 12 % of anti‑VEGF eyes versus 31 % without. These reductions are probably real and are supported by moderate to high certainty evidence. Vision measured six months after surgery was slightly better in the anti‑VEGF group, but the evidence is low‑certainty, so we cannot be sure of a true benefit. The need for repeat surgery or for silicone oil tamponade showed very uncertain effects because the data were sparse and imprecise.\n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nMost trials were small and did not mask participants or surgeons, so performance bias may have influenced results. The overall confidence in the evidence is limited, especially for visual outcomes and for the need for additional surgery.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe searched the literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",
