  "draft": "Does giving anti‑VEGF eye injections (drugs that block abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before vitrectomy (eye surgery that removes scar tissue) improve vision and lower bleeding risk in people with advanced diabetic eye disease?\n\nKey messages  \n– Giving anti‑VEGF injections probably improves vision about six months after vitrectomy, but we are not very sure about this benefit because the studies were small and had some problems.  \n– Giving anti‑VEGF injections probably reduces bleeding during and after surgery and also lowers the chance of small retinal tears (tiny holes in the back layer of the eye). We are more confident about this benefit because it comes from better‑quality studies.  \n– No serious side‑effects were reported, but the evidence comes from small trials with methodological limitations, so our overall confidence is limited.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why does it matter?  \nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced stage of eye disease that can develop in people with diabetes. In PDR, fragile new blood vessels grow on the retina – the light‑sensing tissue at the back of the eye. These vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, and create scar tissue that pulls the retina away, leading to serious vision loss or blindness.\n\nHow is PDR usually treated and what problems can still occur?  \nThe main surgical treatment for PDR complications is pars plana vitrectomy. During vitrectomy a surgeon removes the cloudy gel (vitreous) that fills the eye and clears any blood, scar tissue, or detached retina. The operation can restore sight, but it can also cause bleeding, create tiny holes in the retina, or lead to retinal detachment during or after surgery. After the operation patients may experience postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (POVCH – bleeding inside the eye after surgery), need additional surgeries, or require silicone‑oil tamponade (silicone oil placed in the eye to hold the retina in place). These complications can delay recovery and reduce the final visual outcome.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether giving anti‑VEGF medicine into the eye around the time of vitrectomy reduces surgical complications – such as bleeding, retinal tears, and the need for extra surgery – and whether it leads to better vision after the operation.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared vitrectomy with and without peri‑operative anti‑VEGF in people with PDR. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The search was current to June 2022.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 28 randomised trials that together involved 1 914 eyes undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for PDR complications (non‑clearing vitreous haemorrhage, macula, or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment). In each trial participants received an anti‑VEGF injection (either before or during surgery) in addition to standard vitrectomy, and we compared them with eyes that had vitrectomy alone. No study reported quality‑of‑life outcomes or the proportion of eyes with very poor vision (counting‑fingers vision).\n\nWhat are the main results?  \n– Early postoperative bleeding (within four weeks): 12 % of eyes that received anti‑VEGF versus 31 % without it.  \n– Late postoperative bleeding (after four weeks): 10 % versus 23 %.  \n– Retinal tears during surgery: 12 % versus 31 %.  \n– Vision measured six months after surgery was a little better with anti‑VEGF, but we are not very sure about this benefit because the studies were small and had some problems.  \n– We do not know whether anti‑VEGF reduces the need for another operation or the use of silicone oil; the data are very limited.  \n– Fewer people needed another operation for bleeding after anti‑VEGF (4 % vs 13 %), but the data are uncertain.  \n– No serious side‑effects were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMost trials were small and did not mask participants or surgeons, so performance bias may have influenced the results. Because of these limitations we have limited confidence in the evidence, especially for visual outcomes and for the need for additional surgery.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe searched the literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check: the subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, which violates the Master Style Guide requirement that all subheadings be question‑style. In addition, the text contains several clarity and readability issues that would hinder a patient audience: (1) high lexical complexity – the draft has 158 complex words (3+ syllables) and 187 long words (7+ characters), far above the typical PLS range, making sentences harder to understand; (2) noun‑heavy sentences – 199 nouns exceed the usual range, leading to dense, less engaging prose; (3) occasional long sentences (e.g., the opening title question runs 31 words) that could be split for easier reading. Suggested fixes: rewrite the \"Key messages\" heading as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\"); replace complex/long words with simpler alternatives (e.g., \"anti‑VEGF\" instead of \"anti‑vascular endothelial growth factor\", \"eye bleeding\" instead of \"postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage\"); break down noun‑heavy sentences into active‑voice, verb‑focused statements; and shorten any sentence exceeding 30 words. These changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights five deviations: nouns (199, P90), smog_index (14.8, P90), complex_words_dc (313, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (158, BEYOND_P90), and long_words (187, P90). These indicate the draft is more noun‑dense and uses more complex and long words than typical Cochrane PLS texts, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce noun count."
