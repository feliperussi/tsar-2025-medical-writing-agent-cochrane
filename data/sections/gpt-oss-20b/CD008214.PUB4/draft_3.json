  "draft": "Does giving anti‑VEGF eye injections (drugs that block abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before vitrectomy (eye surgery that removes scar tissue) improve vision and lower bleeding risk in people with advanced diabetic eye disease?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Giving anti‑VEGF injections around the time of vitrectomy probably reduces early and late bleeding inside the eye and cuts the chance of small retinal tears during surgery.  \n– Vision may be a little better about six months after surgery, but the evidence is uncertain.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to confirm benefits and to check for any longer‑term harms.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why does it matter?\nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced stage of eye disease that can develop in people with diabetes. In PDR, fragile new blood vessels grow on the retina – the light‑sensing layer at the back of the eye. These vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, and create scar tissue that pulls the retina away, leading to serious vision loss or blindness.\n\nHow is PDR usually treated and what problems can still occur?\nThe main surgical treatment for PDR complications is pars plana vitrectomy (a type of eye surgery that removes the cloudy gel, called vitreous, from inside the eye). During vitrectomy the surgeon clears blood, scar tissue, or a detached retina. The operation can restore sight, but it carries risks. Surgeons may encounter bleeding, create tiny holes in the retina, or cause the retina to detach during or after the procedure. After surgery patients can still experience postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (bleeding inside the eye after surgery), need additional operations, or require silicone oil tamponade (a special oil placed in the eye to hold the retina in place). These complications can delay recovery and reduce the final visual outcome.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether giving anti‑VEGF medicine into the eye around the time of vitrectomy reduces surgical complications – such as bleeding, retinal tears, and the need for extra surgery – and whether it leads to better vision after the operation.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries and the WHO ICTRP for randomised controlled trials that compared vitrectomy with and without peri‑operative anti‑VEGF in people with PDR. We ran the search up to June 2022. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 28 randomised trials that together involved 1 914 eyes undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for PDR complications such as non‑clearing vitreous haemorrhage, macula‑involving tractional retinal detachment, or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment. In each trial participants received an anti‑VEGF injection (either before or during surgery) in addition to standard vitrectomy, and were compared with eyes that had vitrectomy alone. No trial reported quality‑of‑life outcomes or the proportion of eyes with very poor vision (counting‑fingers vision).\n\nWhat are the main results?\nEarly postoperative bleeding occurred in about 12 % of eyes that received anti‑VEGF compared with 31 % without it. Late bleeding (after four weeks) occurred in about 10 % versus 23 % without anti‑VEGF. Intra‑operative retinal tears were seen in about 12 % of anti‑VEGF eyes versus 31 % without. These reductions are probably real and are supported by moderate to high certainty evidence. Vision measured six months after surgery was slightly better in the anti‑VEGF group, but the evidence is low‑certainty, so we cannot be sure of a true benefit. The need for repeat surgery or for silicone oil tamponade showed very uncertain effects because the data were sparse and imprecise.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMost trials were small and did not mask participants or surgeons, so performance bias may have influenced results. Confidence in the evidence is limited, especially for visual outcomes and for the need for additional surgery.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nWe searched the literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

This makes the summary factually incomplete. Additionally, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Missing side‑effect statement** – Key message 1 should note that serious side‑effects were not reported.\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – “We identified 28 randomised trials that together involved 1 914 eyes undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for PDR complications such as non‑clearing vitreous haemorrhage, macula‑involving tractional retinal detachment, or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment.” This exceeds 30 words and packs many technical terms.\n3. **Passive construction** – “The need for repeat surgery or for silicone oil tamponade showed very uncertain effects because the data were sparse and imprecise.” Passive voice hides who is uncertain.\n4. **Noun‑heavy bullet points** – The key messages list nouns (“reduces bleeding”, “cuts the chance”) without strong verbs, reducing readability.\n5. **Jargon without brief definition** – “pars plana vitrectomy” appears in several places without a short lay definition, which may confuse patients.\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Add to Key Message 1: “No serious side‑effects were reported in the studies.”\n- Split the long sentence: “We identified 28 randomised trials involving 1 914 eyes. All participants had pars plana vitrectomy for PDR complications such as non‑clearing vitreous haemorrhage, macula‑involving tractional retinal detachment, or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment.”\n- Use active voice: “We are very uncertain about whether anti‑VEGF reduces the need for repeat surgery or silicone‑oil tamponade because the data are sparse.”\n- Revise bullet points to start with verbs: “Reduces early and late bleeding inside the eye and cuts the chance of small retinal tears during surgery.”\n- Briefly define the surgery: “pars plana vitrectomy – a procedure that removes the cloudy gel (vitreous) from inside the eye.”\n\nMetrics support these edits: the draft shows unusually high counts of complex words (152, BEYOND_P90), long words (183, BEYOND_P90), and nouns (192, P90), indicating dense, noun‑heavy language. The passive voice count (14) is in the higher quartile, confirming the need to shift to active constructions. Reducing these will improve readability and align the text with typical PLS patterns.",

These indicate overly complex, noun‑heavy language that should be simplified. Reducing complexity and passive voice will bring the draft in line with PLS standards."
