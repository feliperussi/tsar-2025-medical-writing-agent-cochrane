  "draft": "Does giving anti‑VEGF eye injections (drugs that block abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before vitrectomy (eye surgery that removes scar tissue) improve vision and lower bleeding risk in people with advanced diabetic eye disease?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– Giving an anti‑VEGF injection before or during vitrectomy probably improves vision about six months after surgery. However, the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.  \n– Giving anti‑VEGF probably reduces bleeding during and after surgery and also lowers the chance of retinal tears (small holes in the back layer of the eye). We are more confident about this benefit because it comes from higher‑quality studies.  \n– We did not find any serious side‑effects, but the evidence comes from small trials with limitations, so our confidence is limited.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why does it matter?  \nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced stage of eye disease that can develop in people with diabetes. In PDR, fragile new blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina – the light‑sensing tissue at the back of the eye. These vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, and create scar tissue that pulls the retina away, leading to serious vision loss or blindness.\n\nHow is PDR usually treated and what problems can still occur?  \nThe main surgical treatment for PDR complications is pars plana vitrectomy. During vitrectomy the surgeon removes the gel‑like vitreous that fills the eye and clears any blood, scar tissue, or detached retina. The operation can restore sight, but it can also cause bleeding, create tiny holes in the retina, or lead to retinal detachment during or after surgery. After the operation patients may experience postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (bleeding inside the eye), need additional surgeries, or require silicone oil tamponade (silicone oil placed in the eye to hold the retina in place). These complications can delay recovery and reduce the final visual outcome.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether giving anti‑VEGF injections around the time of vitrectomy reduces surgical complications – such as bleeding, retinal tears, and the need for extra surgery – and whether it leads to better vision after the operation.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared vitrectomy with and without anti‑VEGF in people with PDR. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The search was current to June 2022.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe found 28 randomised trials that together included 1 914 eyes that had pars plana vitrectomy for PDR complications (non‑clearing vitreous haemorrhage, macula‑involving tractional retinal detachment, or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment). In each trial participants received an anti‑VEGF injection either before or during surgery in addition to standard vitrectomy, and we compared them with eyes that had vitrectomy alone. No study reported quality‑of‑life outcomes or the proportion of eyes with very poor vision (counting‑fingers vision).\n\nWhat are the main results?  \n– Early postoperative bleeding (within four weeks) occurred in 12 % of eyes that received anti‑VEGF versus 31 % without it.  \n– Late postoperative bleeding (after four weeks) occurred in 10 % versus 23 %.  \n– Retinal tears during surgery occurred in 12 % versus 31 %.  \n– Six months after surgery, eyes that received anti‑VEGF tended to have slightly better vision, but because the studies were small and had limitations we are not confident about this result.  \n– Fewer eyes needed another operation for bleeding after anti‑VEGF (4 % vs 13 %), but the data are uncertain.  \n– We did not find any serious side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMost trials were small and did not mask participants or surgeons, so performance bias may have influenced the results. Because of these limitations we have limited confidence in the evidence, especially for visual outcomes and for the need for additional surgery.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe searched the literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",
