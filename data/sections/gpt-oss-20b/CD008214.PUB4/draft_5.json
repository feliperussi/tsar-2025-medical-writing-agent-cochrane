  "draft": "Does giving anti‑VEGF eye injections (drugs that block abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before vitrectomy (eye surgery to remove scar tissue) improve vision and lower bleeding risk in people with advanced diabetic eye disease?\n\nKey messages  \n– We found that anti‑VEGF injections probably improve vision about six months after vitrectomy.  \n– We found that anti‑VEGF injections probably lower the chance of bleeding during and after surgery and reduce the risk of small retinal tears.  \n– We found that the evidence comes from small studies with methodological limitations, so our confidence in these benefits is limited.\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why does it matter?  \nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced stage of eye disease that can develop in people with diabetes. In PDR, fragile new blood vessels grow on the retina – the light‑sensing layer at the back of the eye. These vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, and create scar tissue that pulls the retina away, leading to serious vision loss or blindness.\n\nHow is PDR usually treated and what problems can still occur?  \nThe main surgical treatment for PDR complications is pars plana vitrectomy – a surgery that removes the cloudy gel (vitreous) inside the eye and clears any blood, scar tissue, or detached retina. Vitrectomy can restore sight, but the operation can be risky. Surgeons may encounter bleeding, create tiny holes in the retina, or cause the retina to detach during or after the procedure. After surgery patients can still experience postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (POVCH – bleeding inside the eye after surgery), need additional operations, or require silicone‑oil tamponade (silicone oil placed in the eye to hold the retina in place). These complications can delay recovery and reduce the final visual outcome.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether giving anti‑VEGF medicine into the eye around the time of vitrectomy reduces surgical complications – such as bleeding, retinal tears, and the need for extra surgery – and whether it leads to better vision after the operation.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries and the WHO ICTRP for randomised controlled trials that compared vitrectomy with and without peri‑operative anti‑VEGF in people with PDR. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The search was current to June 2022.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 28 randomised trials involving 1 914 eyes. All participants had pars plana vitrectomy for non‑clearing vitreous haemorrhage, macula‑involving tractional retinal detachment, or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment. In each trial participants received an anti‑VEGF injection (either before or during surgery) in addition to standard vitrectomy, and we compared them with eyes that had vitrectomy alone. No study reported quality‑of‑life outcomes or the proportion of eyes with very poor vision (counting‑fingers vision).\n\nWhat are the main results?  \nEarly postoperative bleeding (POVCH within four weeks) occurred in about 12 % of eyes that received anti‑VEGF compared with 31 % without it. The late bleeding (after four weeks) occurred in about 10 % versus 23 % without anti‑VEGF. Intra‑operative retinal tears were seen in about 12 % of anti‑VEGF eyes versus 31 % without. These reductions are supported by moderate to high certainty evidence. Vision measured six months after surgery was slightly better in the anti‑VEGF group, but the evidence is low‑certainty, so we cannot be sure of a true benefit. We are unsure whether anti‑VEGF reduces the need for another operation or for silicone‑oil because the data are few and imprecise. The trials did not report any serious side‑effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMost trials were small and did not mask participants or surgeons, so performance bias may have influenced results. Because of these limitations we have limited confidence in the evidence, especially for visual outcomes and for the need for additional surgery.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe searched the literature up to June 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural and factual requirements, but three key clarity problems would likely confuse patients:\n1. **Unexplained evidence‑certainty language** – Quote: \"low‑certainty evidence\" and \"moderate to high certainty evidence\". Why problematic: Patients are unlikely to understand what ‘certainty’ means in this context, which can obscure how much confidence they should place in the results. Suggested rewrite: \"We are not very sure about the vision benefit because the studies were small and had some problems. We are more confident that the treatment reduces bleeding, based on better‑quality studies.\"\n2. **Dense paragraph in the ‘What are the main results?’ section** – Quote: \"Early postoperative bleeding (etc.)... The trials did not report any serious side‑effects.\" Why problematic: The long run‑on sentence packs many numbers and qualifiers, making it hard to follow. Suggested rewrite: break into bullet points:\n   - Early bleeding after surgery: 12 % with anti‑VEGF vs 31 % without.\n   - Late bleeding: 10 % vs 23 %.\n   - Retinal tears during surgery: 12 % vs 31 %.\n   - Vision at six months may be a little better, but we are not sure.\n   - We do not know if it reduces the need for extra surgery or silicone oil.\n   - No serious side‑effects were reported.\n3. **Noun‑heavy wording that reduces readability** – Quote: \"The need for revision surgery for POVCH occurred less frequently in the anti‑VEGF group compared with control, but the confidence intervals were wide and compatible with no effect (4% versus 13%, RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.28; 4 studies 207 eyes; moderate‑certainty evidence).\" Why problematic: The sentence contains many nouns and technical details, making it difficult for a lay reader. Suggested rewrite: \"Fewer people needed another operation for bleeding after anti‑VEGF (4 % vs 13 %), but the data are uncertain.\"\nThese changes address the most patient‑impacting clarity gaps while keeping the content accurate.\n\n**Metrics support**: The PLS evaluation shows unusually high noun count (190, beyond typical), many complex words (153) and long words (183), which aligns with the identified noun‑heavy and jargon issues. Reducing these will improve readability scores and match typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms to most PLS patterns (66.7% in best quartile) but deviates on five metrics: nouns (190, above typical 83‑202), smog index (14.7, above typical <12), complex words (153, above typical <84), complex Dale‑Chall words (299, far above typical <160), and long words (183, above typical <122). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex/long words, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce noun density."
