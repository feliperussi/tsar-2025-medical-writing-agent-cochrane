  "draft": "Does giving anti‑VEGF eye injections (drugs that block abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before vitrectomy (eye surgery to remove scar tissue) improve vision and lower bleeding risk in people with advanced diabetic eye disease?\n\n- Giving anti‑VEGF injections (drugs that block abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before vitrectomy (eye surgery to remove scar tissue) probably improves vision about six months after surgery, lowers the chance of bleeding during and after the operation, and reduces the risk of retinal tears (small tears in the back layer of the eye) during surgery; no serious side effects were reported, but the evidence comes from studies with methodological limitations, so confidence is limited.\n- The impact of anti‑VEGF on the need for additional surgery or on the use of silicone oil tamponade (silicone oil placed in the eye to hold the retina in place) remains uncertain because the available data are imprecise.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up and standardized outcome measures to confirm these benefits and to assess any potential harms or longer‑term effects.\n\nINTRODUCTION / AIMS\n\nWhat is proliferative diabetic retinopathy and why does it matter?\nProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced stage of eye disease that can develop in people with diabetes. In PDR, abnormal, fragile blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina – the light‑sensing tissue at the back of the eye. These new vessels can bleed, pull on the retina, and lead to serious vision loss or even blindness. Because the blood vessels are weak, they often cause bleeding inside the eye and can create scar tissue that pulls the retina away from its normal position.\n\nHow is PDR usually treated and what problems can still occur?\nThe main surgical treatment for the complications of PDR is a procedure called pars plana vitrectomy. During vitrectomy, a surgeon removes the cloudy gel (vitreous) that fills the eye and clears any blood, scar tissue, or detached retina. While vitrectomy can restore sight, the operation itself can be risky. Surgeons may encounter bleeding, create tiny holes in the retina, or cause the retina to detach during or after the surgery. After the operation, patients can still experience bleeding inside the eye (called postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage), need additional surgeries, or require a special oil (silicone oil tamponade) to hold the retina in place. These complications can delay recovery and reduce the final visual outcome.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review set out to determine whether giving anti‑vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‑VEGF) medicines into the eye around the time of vitrectomy could improve outcomes. Anti‑VEGF drugs shrink the abnormal new blood vessels that cause bleeding in PDR. The authors examined randomised trials to see if peri‑operative anti‑VEGF use reduced surgical complications (such as bleeding, retinal holes, and need for extra surgery) and whether it led to better vision after the operation.\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched for studies that compared vitrectomy with and without peri‑operative anti‑VEGF in people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 28 randomised controlled trials that together involved 1,914 eyes of people undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (such as non‑clearing vitreous haemorrhage, macula‑involving tractional retinal detachment, or combined tractional‑rhegmatogenous detachment). The studies were carried out in many countries, most often in China (11 trials), followed by Iran (3), Italy (2), Mexico (2) and single trials in South Korea, the United Kingdom, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the United States, Indonesia and Pakistan. In each trial, participants received an anti‑VEGF injection into the eye around the time of surgery (either before or during the operation) in addition to the standard vitrectomy, and were compared with participants who had vitrectomy alone. The review reports outcomes at about six months after surgery, but does not give details on participants’ ages, gender balance, or the funding sources of the individual trials. No studies reported quality‑of‑life outcomes or the proportion of eyes with very poor vision (counting fingers or worse).\n\nMain results: Anti‑VEGF reduces bleeding and retinal tears after vitrectomy\nGiving an anti‑VEGF injection around the time of vitrectomy probably leads to a large reduction in early postoperative bleeding – about 12 eyes out of 100 bleed early with anti‑VEGF compared with 31 out of 100 without it. It also probably reduces late postoperative bleeding, with about 10 out of 100 eyes bleeding late when anti‑VEGF is used versus 23 out of 100 without it. Intra‑operative retinal tears are also probably reduced, occurring in about 12 out of 100 eyes with anti‑VEGF versus 31 out of 100 eyes without. There is low‑certainty evidence that anti‑VEGF may improve visual acuity six months after surgery, but the effect is uncertain. It is unclear whether anti‑VEGF reduces the need for repeat surgery for early bleeding or for retinal detachment, and evidence is very low certainty about any effect on the need for silicone oil tamponade during surgery.\n\nLIMITATIONS\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\nCURRENCY\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft exceeds the 850‑word limit (886 words) and several subheadings are not phrased as questions, breaching the Master Style Guide (e.g., “Methods Summary” and “CURRENCY”). These are critical failures. In addition, the text contains multiple clarity and style problems that would confuse patients: long, jargon‑heavy sentences, excessive passive voice, and noun‑heavy phrasing. The most urgent improvements are:\n1. **Subheading format** – change “Methods Summary” to a question such as “How did we find the evidence?” and change “CURRENCY” to “How up‑to‑date is this review?”.\n2. **Word count** – trim the text by about 40 words; the easiest way is to remove redundant phrases and combine bullet points.\n3. **Long sentences & jargon** – e.g., \"Giving anti‑VEGF injections (drugs that block abnormal blood‑vessel growth) before vitrectomy (eye surgery to remove scar tissue) probably improves vision about six months after surgery, lowers the chance of bleeding during and after the operation, and reduces the risk of retinal tears (small tears in the back layer of the eye) during surgery; no serious side effects were reported, but the evidence comes from studies with methodological limitations, so confidence is limited.\" This 55‑word sentence is hard to follow and repeats explanations. Rewrite as three short sentences.\n4. **Passive voice** – the draft uses passive constructions such as \"The evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.\" Rewrite actively: \"We searched the literature up to June 2022.\"\n5. **Noun‑heavy wording** – phrases like \"the peri‑operative use of anti‑VEGF reduces the risk of late POVCH, probably results in lower early POVCH risk and may improve visual outcomes\" can be simplified to active verbs: \"Giving anti‑VEGF before surgery reduces early and late bleeding and may improve vision.\"\nThese changes will also address metric deviations: the current average of 26.1 words per sentence (P90) will drop below the typical 22‑word range; nominalizations will fall from 28 to under 13; noun count will be reduced; and readability indices (SMOG, complex words, long words) will improve, bringing the draft closer to the median percentiles. Overall, the draft needs to be shortened, re‑structured with question‑style subheadings, and rewritten for clearer, more active language before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is over the 850‑word limit and deviates markedly on several readability metrics: words per sentence (26.1, P90), nominalizations (28, BEYOND_P90), noun count (252, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (16.3, BEYOND_P90), and counts of complex/long words are all far above typical PLS ranges. These indicate the text is too dense, noun‑heavy, and uses many complex words, which aligns with the identified clarity and style issues."
