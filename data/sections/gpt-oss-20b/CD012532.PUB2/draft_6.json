  "draft": "Do immune‑checkpoint drugs (anti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies) help people with aggressive brain tumours (glioma) live longer?\n\nKey messages\n– Medicines that block PD‑1 or PD‑L1 do not appear to make people with glioblastoma (a fast‑growing brain tumour) live longer, and they may increase serious side‑effects. The studies are few, varied, and often of limited quality, so our confidence in this conclusion is low.  \n– A very small trial gave pembrolizumab (a PD‑1‑blocking drug) before and after tumour removal and suggested a possible survival benefit, but the trial was tiny and the result is uncertain.  \n– Larger, high‑quality randomised trials are needed to see whether any groups of patients might benefit and to assess benefits and harms over longer follow‑up.\n\nWhat is glioblastoma and why is it a problem?  \nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive adult brain tumour. It grows quickly, spreads throughout the brain, and is hard to remove completely with surgery. Because of its aggressiveness, the median survival after diagnosis is about 16 months – half of patients live longer and half live shorter. Common symptoms include headaches, seizures, and loss of thinking or movement abilities.\n\nWhat treatments are usually used and why might new drugs be needed?  \nStandard care for GBM includes maximal safe surgery, followed by radiotherapy (high‑energy X‑rays that kill cancer cells) and the chemotherapy pill temozolomide. Some patients also receive bevacizumab, a drug that blocks new blood‑vessel growth. Even with these treatments, most patients survive only a short time, so researchers look for new options. One promising idea is immune‑checkpoint inhibitors – medicines that block proteins (PD‑1 on immune cells and PD‑L1 on tumour cells) that normally keep the immune system from attacking the tumour. By blocking these proteins, the drugs aim to “release the brakes” on the immune system so it can recognise and destroy cancer cells. GBM creates an environment that suppresses immune activity, which may limit how well these drugs work.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe set out to discover whether drugs that block PD‑1 or PD‑L1 (anti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies) improve outcomes for adults with diffuse glioma, including GBM. We compared these medicines with placebo or with usual treatments, looking at overall survival, progression‑free survival, serious side‑effects, tumour response, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registers up to March 2024. We included randomised controlled trials that tested anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies in adults with diffuse glioma. Two reviewers extracted data on survival, disease progression, serious adverse events, tumour response and quality of life, and we rated the certainty of the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified seven trials that together enrolled 1 953 adults with grade 4 glioma (glioblastoma). Four trials enrolled people with recurrent disease and three enrolled newly diagnosed patients. All trials tested anti‑PD‑1 antibodies – mainly nivolumab or pembrolizumab – given alone or together with bevacizumab, radiotherapy or temozolomide. No trials of anti‑PD‑L1 agents were found.\n\nOur review found that anti‑PD‑1 therapy probably makes little or no difference to overall survival or progression‑free survival, whether the disease is recurrent or newly diagnosed. Specific findings include:  \n– Nivolumab showed little or no benefit compared with bevacizumab in recurrent GBM.  \n– A higher dose of bevacizumab combined with nivolumab did not improve survival.  \n– Adding bevacizumab to pembrolizumab, or giving pembrolizumab around surgery, gave unclear results.  \n– In newly diagnosed patients, nivolumab combined with radiotherapy (with or without temozolomide) made little or no difference to survival outcomes.  \n– In patients whose tumours have a methylated MGMT gene, the combination of nivolumab, temozolomide and radiotherapy increased serious side‑effects. MGMT is a gene that helps repair DNA; when it is “methylated” the tumour is more sensitive to temozolomide, and this may affect side‑effect risk.  \n– Nivolumab plus temozolomide showed little or no effect on survival in older patients.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in these conclusions. Many trials were small, and some participants may have known which treatment they received, which can introduce bias. The studies also differed in the types of patients enrolled and in how the treatments were delivered. These factors reduce our certainty about the exact size of any benefit or harm.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to March 2024, so the summary reflects all relevant randomised evidence available at that time.",
