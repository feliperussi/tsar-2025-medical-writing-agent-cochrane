  "draft": "\"Do immune‑checkpoint drugs (anti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies) help people with aggressive brain tumours (glioma) live longer?\\n\\nKey messages\\n- Medicines that block PD‑1 or PD‑L1 do not appear to make people with glioblastoma live longer, and they may increase serious side‑effects. The studies are few and of low quality, so our confidence is low.  \\n- A very small trial gave pembrolizumab (a PD‑1 blocker) before and after tumour removal and suggested a possible survival benefit, but the trial was tiny and the result is uncertain.  \\n- Larger, high‑quality randomised trials are needed to see whether any groups of patients might benefit and to assess benefits and harms over longer follow‑up.\\n\\nWhat is glioblastoma and why is it a problem?  \\nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and fast‑growing brain tumour in adults. It spreads quickly through the brain and is hard to remove completely with surgery. Because of its aggressiveness, the median survival after diagnosis is about 16 months – half of patients live longer and half live shorter. Common symptoms include headaches, seizures, and loss of thinking or movement abilities.\\n\\nWhat treatments are usually used and why might new drugs be needed?  \\nStandard care for GBM includes maximal safe surgery, followed by radiotherapy (high‑energy X‑rays that kill cancer cells) and the chemotherapy pill temozolomide. Some patients also receive bevacizumab, a drug that blocks new blood‑vessel growth. Even with these treatments, most patients survive only a short time, so researchers are looking for new options.  \\n\\nImmune‑checkpoint inhibitors are medicines that block proteins called PD‑1 on immune cells and PD‑L1 on tumour cells. These proteins normally keep the immune system from attacking the tumour. By blocking them, the drugs aim to “release the brakes” on the immune system so it can recognise and destroy cancer cells. GBM creates an environment that suppresses immune activity, which may limit how well these drugs work.\\n\\nWhat did we want to find out?  \\nWe set out to discover whether drugs that block PD‑1 or PD‑L1 (anti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies) improve outcomes for adults with diffuse glioma, including GBM. We compared these medicines with placebo or with usual treatments, looking at overall survival, progression‑free survival, serious side‑effects, tumour response, and quality of life.\\n\\nHow did we find the evidence?  \\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registers up to March 2024. We included randomised controlled trials that tested anti‑PD‑1 or anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies in adults with diffuse glioma. Two reviewers extracted data on survival, disease progression, serious adverse events, tumour response and quality of life, and we rated the certainty of the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\\n\\nWhat did we find?  \\nWe identified seven trials that together enrolled 1 953 adults with grade 4 glioma (glioblastoma). Four trials enrolled people with recurrent disease and three enrolled newly diagnosed patients. All trials tested anti‑PD‑1 antibodies – mainly nivolumab or pembrolizumab – given alone or together with bevacizumab, radiotherapy or temozolomide. No trials of anti‑PD‑L1 agents were found.\\n\\nAcross the studies, anti‑PD‑1 therapy probably makes little or no difference to overall survival or progression‑free survival, whether the disease is recurrent or newly diagnosed. Specific findings include:  \\n\\n- Nivolumab showed little or no benefit compared with bevacizumab in recurrent GBM.  \\n- Higher‑dose bevacizumab combined with nivolumab did not improve survival.  \\n- Adding bevacizumab to pembrolizumab, or giving pembrolizumab around surgery, gave unclear results.  \\n- In newly diagnosed patients, nivolumab combined with radiotherapy (with or without temozolomide) made little or no difference to survival outcomes.  \\n- The combination of nivolumab, temozolomide and radiotherapy increased serious adverse events in tumours with a methylated MGMT promoter (a DNA‑repair gene change that makes tumours more sensitive to temozolomide).  \\n- Nivolumab plus temozolomide showed little or no effect on survival in older patients.\\n\\nOverall, anti‑PD‑1 antibodies appear to have little impact on how long people with glioblastoma live or on tumour progression, and they may raise the risk of serious side‑effects.\\n\\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \\nWe have moderate confidence in these conclusions because many trials were small, some participants may have known which treatment they received (risk of bias), and the studies varied in patient characteristics and treatment delivery. The limited number of trials prevents firm conclusions, especially for sub‑groups.\\n\\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?  \\nWe searched the literature up to March 2024, so the summary reflects all relevant randomised evidence available at that time.",

Two headings – “Key messages” and “Immune‑checkpoint inhibitors are medicines…” – are statements rather than questions, breaching the Master Style Guide. In addition, several clarity problems would likely confuse a patient reader: (1) a jargon‑heavy, long sentence explaining checkpoint inhibitors; (2) a passive‑voice sentence that hides who performed the assessment; (3) a sentence that exceeds 30 words and packs multiple ideas together; (4) noun‑heavy phrasing that makes the text feel dense. These issues, combined with the metric analysis (19 passive constructions, 207 nouns, SMOG 15.2, Dale‑Chall 8.6, 176 complex words, 223 long words) indicate the draft is far from typical PLS patterns and needs revision before approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit (736 words) but deviates on several readability metrics: passive_voice (19, beyond P90), nouns (207, beyond P90), smog_index (15.2, beyond P90), dale_chall_readability (8.6, beyond P90), complex_words_dc (351, beyond P90), complex_words (176, beyond P90), and long_words (223, beyond P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun density, and lexical complexity, supporting the need for clearer, more active, and less jargon‑laden language."
