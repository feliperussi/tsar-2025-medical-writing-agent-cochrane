  "draft": "Does cleaning the bowel with laxatives (mechanical bowel preparation) and taking oral antibiotics before planned colon or rectal surgery reduce infections and leaks?\n\nKey messages:\n- Combined mechanical bowel cleaning (using laxatives to empty the colon) and oral antibiotics taken before elective colon or rectal surgery probably reduces the risk of wound infections (surgical site infections) and of leaks where the bowel is rejoined (anastomotic leaks) compared with using mechanical cleaning alone; the evidence is of moderate quality, and side‑effects were not well reported.\n- The review could not determine whether using oral antibiotics alone, or not preparing the bowel at all, changes the rates of infections or leaks, because the available studies were few and the evidence was of low quality.\n- Future research should include well‑designed trials that compare combined preparation with oral antibiotics alone or no preparation, report any side‑effects such as dehydration or electrolyte problems, and examine different types of colorectal surgery to clarify which patients benefit most.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhy is bowel preparation important before planned colorectal surgery?\nElective colorectal surgery – operations planned in advance to remove part of the colon or rectum – can be life‑saving but it also carries a risk of serious problems after the operation. The two most worrying complications are:\n\n* **Surgical site infection (SSI)** – an infection where the incision was made. This can cause pain, delay healing and sometimes need extra treatment with antibiotics or another operation.\n* **Anastomotic leakage** – a leak where the surgeon has re‑joined two ends of the bowel. A leak can lead to infection inside the abdomen and can be life‑threatening.\n\nThese complications are more common in colorectal surgery than in many other abdominal operations because the large bowel is normally full of bacteria. To try to lower the number of bacteria and to clear stool from the bowel before the cut is made, doctors use **pre‑operative bowel preparation**. This can be done in two ways:\n\n* **Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP)** – taking strong laxatives or using enemas to empty the bowel of its contents.\n* **Oral antibiotic bowel preparation (oAB)** – swallowing antibiotics that travel through the bowel to kill bacteria.\n\nSometimes both methods are used together (MBP + oAB). While using only the mechanical method has not shown clear benefits, it has been uncertain whether the combination of mechanical cleaning plus oral antibiotics truly reduces post‑surgical complications. Understanding this is important because bowel preparation can be uncomfortable and may cause side effects such as dehydration, so we need to know if the extra effort is worthwhile.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about combined bowel preparation?\nThe review authors set out to find out whether giving patients both mechanical cleaning and oral antibiotics before elective colorectal surgery is more effective at preventing post‑operative problems than other approaches. Specifically, they compared the combined method (MBP + oAB) with:\n\n* Mechanical preparation alone (MBP only)\n* Oral antibiotics alone (oAB only)\n* No bowel preparation at all (nBP)\n\nThey looked at randomised controlled trials – the most reliable type of study – to see how the different strategies affected the rates of surgical site infection, anastomotic leakage, death, and other outcomes such as how long patients stayed in hospital. In short, the goal was to determine if the combined preparation should be recommended as the standard practice before planned colorectal surgery.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared combined mechanical and oral‑antibiotic bowel preparation with other preparation methods or none in elective colorectal surgery, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 21 randomised controlled trials with a total of 5,264 adult participants undergoing elective colorectal surgery, most of which involved both colon and rectal resections for malignant and benign reasons. The trials compared combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation (MBP + oAB) with three different comparators: MBP alone (the most common comparison, evaluated in 21 trials), oral antibiotics alone (evaluated in three trials), and no bowel preparation (evaluated in a single trial). The abstract does not give details on follow‑up length, funding sources, participants’ age or gender distribution, or the countries where the studies were conducted, so information on study duration, funding, precise demographics, and geographic settings is not available.\n\nMain results: Surgical site infections\nCombined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation probably reduces surgical site infections. It also probably reduces anastomotic leakage. It probably makes little to no difference to mortality, postoperative ileus, and length of hospital stay. When compared with oral antibiotics alone or with no bowel preparation, the effect of combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation on surgical site infections, anastomotic leakage, mortality, postoperative ileus, and length of hospital stay is unclear.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to December 2021 of search.",
