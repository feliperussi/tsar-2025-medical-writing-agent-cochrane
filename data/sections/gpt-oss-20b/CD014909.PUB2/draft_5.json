  "draft": "Does cleaning the bowel with laxatives (mechanical bowel preparation) and taking oral antibiotics before planned colon or rectal surgery reduce infections and leaks?\n\nKey messages\n- Giving patients both a laxative bowel cleanse (mechanical bowel preparation) and oral antibiotics before elective colon or rectal surgery probably cuts surgical‑site infections by about 44 % and anastomotic leaks by about 40 % compared with a laxative cleanse alone; we have moderate‑certainty evidence for this.\n- We could not tell whether oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all, changes infection or leak rates because only a few small studies examined these comparisons and the evidence is low‑certainty.\n- Future trials should compare the combined approach with oral antibiotics alone or no preparation, record side‑effects such as dehydration or electrolyte problems, and include a broader range of patients and surgical settings.\n\nWhy is bowel preparation important before planned colorectal surgery?  \nElective colorectal surgery removes part of the colon or rectum and can save lives, but it also carries a risk of serious complications. The two most worrying problems are:\n- Surgical‑site infection (SSI) – an infection where the incision was made. It can cause pain, delay healing, and sometimes require extra antibiotics or another operation.\n- Anastomotic leak – a break where the surgeon reconnects the two ends of the bowel. A leak can lead to infection inside the abdomen and can be life‑threatening.\n\nThe large bowel normally contains many bacteria. To lower the bacterial load and clear stool before the cut, doctors use pre‑operative bowel preparation. This can be done in two ways:\n- Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) – taking strong laxatives or using enemas to empty the bowel.\n- Oral‑antibiotic bowel preparation (oAB) – swallowing antibiotics that travel through the bowel to kill bacteria.\n\nWhat did we aim to discover about combined bowel preparation?  \nWe wanted to know whether giving patients both MBP and oAB together works better than giving MBP alone, oAB alone, or no preparation at all. We focused on two outcomes that matter most to patients: surgical‑site infection and anastomotic leak. We also looked at death, postoperative ileus (a temporary loss of bowel movement), and length of hospital stay.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and trial registries on 15 December 2021. Two reviewers screened every record, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane tools. We combined the results with a random‑effects meta‑analysis (a statistical method that pools data while allowing for differences between studies) and rated our confidence in the evidence with GRADE (a system that grades the certainty of evidence).\n\nWhat did we find?  \n- Surgical‑site infection: The combined MBP + oAB reduced SSI risk by 44 % (risk ratio 0.56, 95 % CI 0.42‑0.74). The evidence is of moderate certainty.\n- Anastomotic leak: The combined approach reduced leak risk by 40 % (risk ratio 0.60, 95 % CI 0.36‑0.99). The evidence is of moderate certainty.\n- Mortality, postoperative ileus, and length of hospital stay showed little or no difference between combined preparation and MBP alone.\n- When we compared the combined method with oAB alone or with no preparation, the effects on SSI, leak, mortality, ileus, and hospital stay remained unclear because the evidence is low‑certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \n- Most trials were small and conducted at a single centre, which may limit how well the results apply to other hospitals.\n- Definitions of SSI and leak varied between studies, creating some inconsistency.\n- Some trials did not blind participants or outcome assessors, increasing the risk of bias.\n- The majority of participants came from high‑income countries; results may differ in low‑ and middle‑income settings.\n- Only a few studies reported side‑effects such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe latest eligible trial was published before our search date of 15 December 2021. Therefore, the evidence reflects data up to December 2021.\n\nWhat should future research address?  \n- Larger, multicentre trials that use uniform definitions for SSI and leak.\n- Studies that include low‑ and middle‑income settings to test generalisability.\n- Direct comparisons of different oral‑antibiotic regimens to find the safest and most effective option.\n- Systematic reporting of side‑effects such as dehydration or electrolyte problems.\n- Longer follow‑up to assess delayed complications and quality of life.",

Then we rated our confidence in the evidence with GRADE, a system that grades how certain we are about the findings.\"\n2. **Unexplained technical terms** – terms such as \"random‑effects meta‑analysis\", \"GRADE\", \"risk ratio\" and \"confidence interval\" appear without plain‑language definitions. Patients may not understand these. *Rewrite*: after each term add a brief lay explanation, e.g., \"risk ratio (a measure that tells us how much the risk changes compared with the usual treatment)\".\n3. **Ambiguous risk‑reduction wording** – \"The combined MBP + oAB reduced SSI risk by 44 % (risk ratio 0.56…)\" could be read as an absolute 44‑percentage‑point drop. *Rewrite*: \"The combined preparation lowered the chance of a surgical‑site infection by about 44% (the risk was about half as high as with a laxative cleanse alone).\"\n4. **Heavy noun‑and‑nominalisation load** – the draft contains 36 nominalisations and 218 nouns (both far beyond typical PLS ranges), making sentences noun‑heavy and harder to follow. Example: \"The majority of participants came from high‑income countries; results may differ in low‑ and middle‑income settings.\" *Rewrite*: \"Most participants were from high‑income countries, so the results might be different in poorer settings.\"\nThese issues, together with the metric profile (high nominalisation, many complex/long words, and a smog index of 15.3), indicate the text is more difficult than typical Cochrane PLSs and needs simplification before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (747 words) and scores well on readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 53, FK grade 10.7).

These indicate excessive noun‑heavy and complex language, supporting the need to reduce nominalisations and simplify vocabulary."
