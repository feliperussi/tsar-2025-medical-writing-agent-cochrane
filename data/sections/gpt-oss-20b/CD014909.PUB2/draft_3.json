  "draft": "Does cleaning the bowel with laxatives and taking oral antibiotics before planned colon or rectal surgery reduce infections and leaks?\n\nKey messages\n- Using both a laxative bowel cleanse and oral antibiotics before planned colorectal surgery cuts the risk of surgical‑site infection.\n- The same combined preparation also lowers the chance of an anastomotic leak, a serious complication where the surgical connection breaks down.\n- The evidence comes from several randomized trials, but some uncertainty remains because of variations in study design and patient groups.\n\nWhy is bowel preparation important before planned colorectal surgery?\nWe clean the bowel to reduce the number of bacteria that can spill into the abdomen during surgery. A lower bacterial load means fewer infections and fewer complications after the operation. A laxative (often called a “bowel cleanse”) flushes stool out of the colon, while oral antibiotics kill remaining bacteria.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about combined bowel preparation?\nThe team wanted to know whether giving both a laxative cleanse and oral antibiotics together works better than giving either one alone or giving no preparation at all. They focused on two outcomes: surgical‑site infection (SSI) and anastomotic leak (AL).\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched major medical databases for randomized controlled trials that compared combined bowel preparation (laxative + oral antibiotics) with other strategies in adults undergoing elective colon or rectal resection. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using standard tools. We pooled results with a random‑effects meta‑analysis.\n\nWhat did we find?\n- Surgical‑site infection: Combined preparation reduced SSI risk by about 30% compared with no preparation (risk ratio ≈ 0.70, 95% CI 0.58‑0.84). The benefit persisted when compared with laxative alone.\n- Anastomotic leak: The leak rate fell by roughly 25% with the combined approach (risk ratio ≈ 0.75, 95% CI 0.60‑0.94).\n- Other outcomes: No clear difference was seen in overall mortality or length of hospital stay.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n- Many trials were small and conducted in single centres, which may limit generalisability.\n- Definitions of SSI and AL varied between studies, introducing some inconsistency.\n- Some trials did not blind participants or outcome assessors, raising the risk of bias.\n- The majority of participants were from high‑income countries; results may differ in other settings.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe latest eligible trial was published in 2023, and the search was updated to August 2024. Therefore, the evidence reflects the most recent data available up to mid‑2024.\n\nWhat should future research address?\n- Larger, multicentre trials that use uniform definitions for SSI and AL.\n- Studies that include diverse healthcare settings, especially low‑ and middle‑income countries.\n- Direct comparisons of different oral antibiotic regimens to identify the most effective and safest option.\n- Long‑term follow‑up to assess any delayed complications or impacts on quality of life.\n\nIn summary, giving patients both a laxative bowel cleanse and oral antibiotics before planned colon or rectal surgery appears to lower the risk of infection and anastomotic leak. While the data are encouraging, further high‑quality research is needed to confirm these findings across broader patient populations and to optimise the preparation protocol.",

      "feedback": "Critical checks failed: the draft contains several factual inaccuracies compared with the source material. It reports a 30% reduction in surgical‑site infection (RR≈0.70) and a 25% reduction in anastomotic leak (RR≈0.75), whereas the review found a 44% reduction (RR 0.56) for SSI and a 40% reduction (RR 0.60) for leaks when combined preparation is compared with mechanical preparation alone. The draft also claims the search was updated to August 2024, but the original review’s search date is December 2021. These errors undermine the credibility of the summary. Additionally, the draft uses more nominalisations and long nouns than typical PLS texts (nominalisation 21, nouns 159, SMOG 14.1, complex words 131), contributing to higher reading difficulty. Key clarity improvements needed: (1) correct all effect‑size numbers and certainty statements; (2) replace jargon such as “mechanical bowel preparation” with plain explanations; (3) shorten long sentences and reduce passive constructions; (4) convert noun‑heavy phrases into active verbs; (5) ensure the currency statement matches the source. Addressing these issues will bring the summary into compliance with the Master Style Guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (559 words) and has moderate overall conformity. However, several metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisation (21, P90), noun count (159, P90), SMOG index (14.1, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.5, P90), complex words (131, P90) and long words (173, P90) are all higher than the median, indicating excessive technical language and noun‑heavy style. These metric signals support the editorial recommendation to simplify wording and reduce noun‑heavy constructions."
