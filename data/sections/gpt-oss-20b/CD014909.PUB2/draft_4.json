  "draft": "Does cleaning the bowel with laxatives (mechanical bowel preparation) and taking oral antibiotics before planned colon or rectal surgery reduce infections and leaks?\n\nKey messages\n- Using both a laxative bowel cleanse and oral antibiotics before elective colon or rectal surgery probably cuts surgical‑site infections by about 44% and anastomotic leaks by about 40% compared with a laxative cleanse alone; the evidence is of moderate certainty.\n- The review could not determine whether oral antibiotics alone, or no bowel preparation at all, changes infection or leak rates because the available studies were few and the evidence was low‑certainty.\n- Future trials should compare combined preparation with oral antibiotics alone or no preparation, report side‑effects such as dehydration, and include a wider range of patients and surgical settings.\n\nWhy is bowel preparation important before planned colorectal surgery?  \nElective colorectal surgery removes part of the colon or rectum and can save lives, but it also carries a risk of serious complications. The two most worrying problems are:\n- Surgical‑site infection (SSI) – an infection where the incision was made, causing pain, delayed healing, and sometimes extra antibiotics or another operation.\n- Anastomotic leak – a break where the surgeon reconnects two ends of the bowel, which can lead to infection inside the abdomen and be life‑threatening.\n\nThe large bowel normally contains many bacteria. To lower the bacterial load and clear stool before the cut, doctors use pre‑operative bowel preparation. This can be done in two ways:\n- Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) – taking strong laxatives or enemas to empty the bowel.\n- Oral antibiotic bowel preparation (oAB) – swallowing antibiotics that travel through the bowel to kill bacteria.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about combined bowel preparation?  \nWe wanted to know whether giving patients both MBP and oAB together works better than giving MBP alone, oAB alone, or no preparation at all. We focused on two outcomes: surgical‑site infection and anastomotic leak.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and trial registries on 15 December 2021. Two reviewers screened each record, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane tools. We combined results with a random‑effects meta‑analysis and rated our confidence in the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?  \n- Surgical‑site infection: Combined MBP + oAB reduced SSI risk by 44% (risk ratio 0.56, 95 % CI 0.42‑0.74). The evidence is of moderate certainty.\n- Anastomotic leak: Combined MBP + oAB reduced leak risk by 40% (risk ratio 0.60, 95 % CI 0.36‑0.99). The evidence is of moderate certainty.\n- Mortality, postoperative ileus, and length of hospital stay showed little or no difference between the groups.\n- When compared with oral antibiotics alone or with no preparation, the effects on SSI, leak, mortality, ileus, and hospital stay remain unclear because the evidence is low‑certainty.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \n- Many trials were small, single‑centre studies, which may limit how well the results apply to other settings.\n- Definitions of SSI and leak varied between studies, creating some inconsistency.\n- Some trials did not blind participants or outcome assessors, increasing risk of bias.\n- Most participants came from high‑income countries; results may differ elsewhere.\n- Side‑effects of the preparation were reported in only a few studies.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe latest eligible trial was published before our search date of 15 December 2021. Therefore, the evidence reflects data up to December 2021.\n\nWhat should future research address?  \n- Larger, multicentre trials that use uniform definitions for SSI and leak.\n- Studies that include low‑ and middle‑income settings to test generalisability.\n- Direct comparisons of different oral‑antibiotic regimens to find the safest and most effective option.\n- Systematic reporting of side‑effects such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.\n- Longer follow‑up to assess delayed complications and quality of life.\n\nIn summary, giving patients both a laxative bowel cleanse and oral antibiotics before planned colon or rectal surgery probably lowers the risk of wound infection and anastomotic leak compared with a laxative cleanse alone. While the findings are encouraging, more high‑quality research is needed to confirm these benefits across diverse patient groups and to optimise the preparation protocol.",

Suggested rewrites are provided for each issue. These problems are reflected in the metrics: nominalizations (35, BEYOND_P90), nouns (211, BEYOND_P90), complex words (163, BEYOND_P90) and SMOG index (15.3, BEYOND_P90) all far exceed typical PLS ranges, indicating the text is too dense for the intended audience.",

Readability scores (Flesch‑Reading Ease 51, Grade 11) are higher than typical PLS (grade 11‑16), but the high nominalization and noun counts still hinder plain‑language clarity."
