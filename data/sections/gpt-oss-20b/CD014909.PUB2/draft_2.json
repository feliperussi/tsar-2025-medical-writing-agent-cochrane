The two most common problems are:\n- Surgical site infection (SSI) – an infection at the incision site that can cause pain, delay healing and sometimes need extra antibiotics or another operation.\n- Anastomotic leak – a leak where the surgeon has re‑joined two ends of the bowel; this can lead to infection inside the abdomen and can be life‑threatening.\n\nThese complications are more frequent in colorectal surgery because the large bowel normally contains many bacteria. To reduce bacterial load and clear stool before the cut, doctors use pre‑operative bowel preparation. This can be done in two ways:\n- Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) – taking strong laxatives or using enemas to empty the bowel.\n- Oral antibiotic bowel preparation (oAB) – swallowing antibiotics that travel through the bowel to kill bacteria.\n\nSometimes both methods are used together (MBP + oAB). While MBP alone has not shown clear benefits, it has been uncertain whether adding oral antibiotics improves outcomes.\n\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about combined bowel preparation?\nWe set out to find out whether giving patients both MBP and oAB before elective colorectal surgery reduces post‑operative problems more than other strategies. Specifically, we compared the combined method (MBP + oAB) with:\n- MBP alone,\n- oAB alone,\n- No bowel preparation (nBP).\n\nWe examined randomised controlled trials – the most reliable type of study – to see how each strategy affected rates of SSI, anastomotic leak, death, and other outcomes such as length of hospital stay.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, trial registries and reference lists up to 15 December 2021. We included randomised trials that compared MBP + oAB with any of the three alternatives in adults undergoing elective colorectal surgery. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled results using risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95 % confidence intervals and rated the certainty of the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 21 trials involving 5 264 adults who had elective colorectal surgery. Most participants underwent colon or rectal resections for cancer or benign disease. The trials compared MBP + oAB with:\n- MBP alone (21 trials),\n- oAB alone (3 trials),\n- No preparation (1 trial).\n\nThe studies did not report detailed participant ages, genders, or locations, and only four trials recorded side‑effects of the bowel preparation.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nSurgical site infection\n- MBP + oAB probably reduces SSI compared with MBP alone (RR 0.56, moderate‑certainty evidence). This means the risk is about 44 % lower.\n- When MBP + oAB is compared with oAB alone or with no preparation, the effect on SSI is unclear because few low‑quality studies are available.\n\nAnastomotic leak\n- MBP + oAB probably reduces anastomotic leak compared with MBP alone (RR 0.60, moderate‑certainty evidence), a reduction of about 40 %.\n- Evidence for a difference versus oAB alone or no preparation is uncertain.\n\nOther outcomes\n- Mortality, postoperative ileus (temporary and length of hospital stay showed little or no difference between MBP + oAB and MBP alone.\n- Data on side‑effects such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalance were sparse, so we cannot comment on harms.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings, but several issues reduce certainty:\n- Participants and clinicians often knew which preparation was used, which could influence results.\n- Not all trials reported every outcome we were interested in.\n- The studies varied in patient groups, surgical types and the exact MBP or oAB regimens used.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to 15 December 2021, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.\n\nWhat should future research address?\nNew trials should compare MBP + oAB directly with oAB alone and with no preparation, record any side‑effects such as dehydration or electrolyte problems, and examine different types of colorectal surgery to identify which patients benefit most.",

In addition, several clarity problems would confuse readers: 1) Long, dense sentences (e.g., “We identified 21 trials involving 5 264 adults who had elective colorectal surgery…”) make the key message hard to follow. 2) Excessive passive constructions (“The studies did not report detailed participant ages…”) obscure who did what. 3) Heavy noun‑heavy, technical phrasing (“combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation”) without simpler alternatives can overwhelm a lay audience. Suggested rewrites are provided below. Metrics support these observations: passive_voice = 22 (P90), nominalization = grade, nouns = 240 (BEYOND_P90), smog_index = 17 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words = 204 (BEYOND_P90), long_words = 251 (BEYOND_P90).
