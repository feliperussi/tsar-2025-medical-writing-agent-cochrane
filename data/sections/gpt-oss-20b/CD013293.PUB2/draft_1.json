  "draft": "What treatment (surgery, clot‑removal, or clot‑dissolving) is most effective for a blocked dialysis access (arteriovenous fistula (direct artery‑vein connection) or graft (tube linking artery and vein))?\n\n**Key messages**\n- The review could not determine whether surgery, clot‑removal (mechanical thrombectomy) or clot‑dissolving (thrombolysis) works best for a blocked dialysis access; the available studies did not show a clear advantage for any approach in keeping the access open, preventing failure, or avoiding adverse events (harmful side effects), and harms were rarely reported.\n- Most of the included trials were small, had design limitations, and were at high risk of bias, so confidence in the findings is low; important outcomes such as death, access dysfunction, successful dialysis, and patient‑important measures were seldom measured.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies that directly compare these treatments and report both benefits and harms over longer periods are needed to answer this important question.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is a blocked dialysis access a problem for people who need haemodialysis?\nPeople with kidney failure often need haemodialysis, a treatment that cleans the blood using a special tube called a vascular access. The most common types of access are an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) – a direct connection made by surgeons between an artery and a vein – and an arteriovenous graft (AVG) – a short piece of plastic tube that links the artery and vein. Over time these connections can become blocked by a blood clot, a condition known as thrombosis. When this happens the patient can no longer use the fistula or graft and must rely on a temporary tube called a catheter. Catheter use carries higher risks of infection, blockage of larger veins, and repeated hospital stays. Because a working access is essential for life‑sustaining dialysis, finding the best way to clear a blocked fistula or graft is a major clinical concern.\n\nWhat did the review aim to discover about treatments for blocked dialysis access?\nThe authors set out to compare the different ways doctors try to restore a blocked AVF or AVG. These methods include: (1) mechanical thrombectomy – using a device to physically pull the clot out; (2) thrombolysis – giving medicine that dissolves the clot; and (3) surgical procedures – repairing or re‑connecting the access. The review asked: which of these approaches works best at keeping the access open (called \"primary patency\"), how often do they succeed technically, and what are the risks of serious or minor complications? In short, the goal was to determine the effectiveness and safety of each treatment option for people on haemodialysis whose access has thrombosed.\n\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that evaluated interventions for thrombosed dialysis fistulas or grafts, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 14 randomised (or quasi‑randomised) trials that together enrolled 1,176 people receiving haemodialysis who had a thrombosed arteriovenous fistula or graft. The studies compared three main types of treatment for the blocked access: various mechanical thrombectomy techniques, different thrombolytic (clot‑dissolving) approaches, and surgical procedures. Details such as participants’ ages, gender, severity of the problem, follow‑up length, geographic location and funding sources were not reported in the abstract, and many of the trials were judged to be at high risk of bias, partly because of industry involvement. Overall, the review could not determine whether any of these treatments improve the risk of dialysis access failure, the chance that the access stays open after 30 days (primary patency), technical success of the procedure, or the occurrence of adverse events. In other words, we do not know if any of the methods is better or safer for people with a blocked dialysis access.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "Critical checks failed because several required subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., Methods, Limitations, Currency). This breaches the Master Style Guide (5.3 Structure). Additionally, the draft contains excessive passive voice (24 instances, well beyond the typical PLS range) and many long, noun‑heavy sentences that reduce readability (SMOG 14.3, complex words 143, long words 203). These issues create potential confusion for patients and lower the overall clarity.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – rewrite headings as questions:\n   - Current: \"Methods\" → Suggested: \"How did we find and evaluate the studies?\"\n   - Current: \"Limitations\" → Suggested: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n   - Current: \"Currency\" → Suggested: \"How up‑to‑date is the evidence?\"\n2. **Passive voice** – replace passive constructions with active voice. Example: \"Details such as participants’ ages… were not reported\" → \"The studies did not report participants’ ages…\" (reduces passive count).\n3. **Long, noun‑heavy sentences** – break up the first key‑message bullet into two shorter sentences and replace heavy nouns with verbs. Example rewrite: \"The review could not determine whether surgery, clot‑removal (mechanical thrombectomy) or clot‑dissolving (thrombolysis) works best for a blocked dialysis access. The available studies showed no clear advantage for any approach in keeping the access open, preventing failure, or avoiding side‑effects, and harms were rarely reported.\"\n4. **Complex vocabulary** – swap long words for simpler alternatives (e.g., \"approximately\" → \"about\", \"utilize\" → \"use\"). This will lower the complex‑word and long‑word counts.\n5. **Bullet‑point formatting** – ensure each bullet starts with a dash (‑) and add a blank line before the next heading to improve white‑space separation.\n\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide, reduce passive voice (target <13 instances), and improve readability metrics toward typical PLS ranges.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits (663 words) but deviates markedly on several metrics: passive_voice 24 (BEYOND_P90), nouns 198 (P90), SMOG 14.3 (P90), dale_chall_readability 8.46 (P90), complex_words 143 (P90), complex_words_dc 306 (BEYOND_P90), and long_words 203 (P90). These indicate excessive passivity, noun density, and lexical complexity, confirming the need for the suggested edits."
