  "key_messages": [
    "The review could not determine whether surgery, clot‑removal (mechanical thrombectomy) or clot‑dissolving (thrombolysis) works best for a blocked dialysis access; the available studies did not show a clear advantage for any approach in keeping the access open, preventing failure, or avoiding adverse events (harmful side effects), and harms were rarely reported.",
    "Most of the included trials were small, had design limitations, and were at high risk of bias, so confidence in the findings is low; important outcomes such as death, access dysfunction, successful dialysis, and patient‑important measures were seldom measured.",
    "Larger, well‑designed studies that directly compare these treatments and report both benefits and harms over longer periods are needed to answer this important question."

      "subheading": "Why is a blocked dialysis access a problem for people who need haemodialysis?",
      "content": "People with kidney failure often need haemodialysis, a treatment that cleans the blood using a special tube called a vascular access. The most common types of access are an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) – a direct connection made by surgeons between an artery and a vein – and an arteriovenous graft (AVG) – a short piece of plastic tube that links the artery and vein. Over time these connections can become blocked by a blood clot, a condition known as thrombosis. When this happens the patient can no longer use the fistula or graft and must rely on a temporary tube called a catheter. Catheter use carries higher risks of infection, blockage of larger veins, and repeated hospital stays. Because a working access is essential for life‑sustaining dialysis, finding the best way to clear a blocked fistula or graft is a major clinical concern."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to discover about treatments for blocked dialysis access?",
      "content": "The authors set out to compare the different ways doctors try to restore a blocked AVF or AVG. These methods include: (1) mechanical thrombectomy – using a device to physically pull the clot out; (2) thrombolysis – giving medicine that dissolves the clot; and (3) surgical procedures – repairing or re‑connecting the access. The review asked: which of these approaches works best at keeping the access open (called \"primary patency\"), how often do they succeed technically, and what are the risks of serious or minor complications? In short, the goal was to determine the effectiveness and safety of each treatment option for people on haemodialysis whose access has thrombosed."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 14 randomised (or quasi‑randomised) trials that together enrolled 1,176 people receiving haemodialysis who had a thrombosed arteriovenous fistula or graft. The studies compared three main types of treatment for the blocked access: various mechanical thrombectomy techniques, different thrombolytic (clot‑dissolving) approaches, and surgical procedures. Details such as participants’ ages, gender, severity of the problem, follow‑up length, geographic location and funding sources were not reported in the abstract, and many of the trials were judged to be at high risk of bias, partly because of industry involvement. Overall, the review could not determine whether any of these treatments improve the risk of dialysis access failure, the chance that the access stays open after 30 days (primary patency), technical success of the procedure, or the occurrence of adverse events. In other words, we do not know if any of the methods is better or safer for people with a blocked dialysis access."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.",
