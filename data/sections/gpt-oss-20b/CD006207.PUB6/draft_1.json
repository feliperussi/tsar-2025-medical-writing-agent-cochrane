  "draft": "Do things like masks, hand washing, and keeping distance help stop the spread of respiratory viruses?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Current research does not show a clear benefit of wearing medical or surgical masks in the community for preventing flu‑like or COVID‑like illness, and any side effects of mask use were rarely reported; hand hygiene (cleaning hands with soap or sanitizer) probably reduces the overall number of respiratory infections, though its effect on specific flu‑like illness is uncertain.\n- Studies comparing tight‑fitting N95/P2 respirators (masks that filter out most particles) with regular medical or surgical masks did not demonstrate a consistent advantage in preventing respiratory illness, and discomfort from wearing either type of mask was mentioned but not well measured.\n- Because many studies had design limitations, low adherence to the interventions, and limited reporting of harms, more well‑designed trials are needed to determine how effectively masks, hand hygiene, and physical distancing prevent respiratory viruses and to understand any unwanted effects.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy are acute respiratory virus infections a global health concern?\nViruses that cause sudden breathing problems – such as the flu (influenza), SARS, and COVID‑19 – can spread quickly through whole communities and even across countries. When many people get sick at the same time, hospitals can become overwhelmed and everyday life is disrupted. While medicines (antiviral drugs) and shots (vaccines) help, they are not always enough to stop a virus from moving from person to person, especially when a new virus appears or when a vaccine is not yet available. Because of this, researchers look at simple, physical ways to block the spread, like keeping distance, washing hands, or wearing masks.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about physical measures to stop these infections?\nThe authors wanted to know whether everyday actions that do not involve drugs – for example screening people at entry points, isolating sick individuals, quarantining contacts, keeping physical distance, using personal protective equipment (such as masks, glasses, or gowns), practising hand‑washing or hand‑sanitising, and even gargling – actually reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses. To answer this, they gathered and analysed results from randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to an intervention or a comparison group) that tested these physical interventions in settings ranging from schools and homes to hospitals and crowded neighbourhoods.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies evaluating physical measures (e.g., masks, hand hygiene, distancing) to interrupt or reduce the spread of acute respiratory viruses, combined their findings, and assessed confidence in the evidence based on study quality and size.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined 78 randomised (including cluster) controlled trials – 11 of them added during the COVID‑19 pandemic – that together enrolled about 610,872 participants. The studies were carried out in six countries (Mexico, Denmark, Bangladesh, England and Norway) and covered a wide range of settings, from suburban schools and childcare centres to hospital wards, crowded inner‑city areas in low‑income countries and an immigrant neighbourhood in a high‑income country. Participants were very diverse, including community members of all ages, school‑aged children, healthcare workers and household residents. The interventions tested were physical measures: medical or surgical masks versus no mask, N or P2 respirators versus medical or surgical masks, and hand‑hygiene programmes versus no intervention. No randomised trials of gowns, gloves, face shields or entry‑port screening were found.\n\nThe review found that wearing medical or surgical masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the risk of getting flu‑like illness or laboratory‑confirmed influenza infection. Using N95 or P2 respirators instead of medical or surgical masks probably makes little or no difference to laboratory‑confirmed influenza infection, and may reduce flu‑like illness slightly, although the evidence is uncertain. Practising hand hygiene probably reduces the chance of acquiring a respiratory infection slightly.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of e people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, the evidence does not cover all of the people or situations we are interested in, and the studies were very small or based on few events.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.",

Hand hygiene (washing hands with soap or using sanitizer) probably reduces the overall number of respiratory infections, but its effect on specific flu‑like illness is uncertain.\"\n2. **Unclear wording in the results paragraph** – \"The review found that wearing medical or surgical masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the risk of getting flu‑like illness or laboratory‑confirmed influenza infection.\" The phrase \"makes little or no difference\" is vague. *Rewrite*: \"The review found that wearing medical or surgical masks in the community probably does not reduce the risk of getting flu‑like illness or laboratory‑confirmed influenza.\"\n3. **Run‑on sentence with a typo in the limitations section** – \"We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were done in different types of e people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, the evidence does not cover all of the people or situations we are interested in, and the studies were very small or based on few events.\" This sentence is overly long, contains a typo (\"e people\"), and packs many ideas together. *Rewrite*: \"We have little confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, the studies varied in the types of people and how the interventions were delivered, the evidence does not cover all groups or situations, and many studies were small with few events.\"\n4. **Subheadings not phrased as questions** – e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\".
