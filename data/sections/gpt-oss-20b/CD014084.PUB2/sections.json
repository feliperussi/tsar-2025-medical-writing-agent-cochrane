  "plain_title": "Does sinus surgery (endoscopic sinus surgery) improve nose symptoms and lung function in people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic lung disease) who have nasal polyps (growths in the nose)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "We are uncertain whether endoscopic sinus surgery (a minimally invasive operation to open the sinuses) improves nasal symptoms or lung function (how well the lungs work) in people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic lung disease) who have nasal polyps (growths in the nose), because only one small study with limited data was found; no serious harms were reported except a single bleeding episode that was quickly managed.",
    "The same limited evidence also does not show clear benefits of surgery on reducing bacterial colonisation, antibiotic use, pulmonary exacerbations (worsening of lung disease), or hospital admissions.",
    "More well‑designed, larger studies that follow participants for at least a year are needed to determine whether sinus surgery truly helps nasal and lung outcomes, and to assess any long‑term risks or benefits."

    {
      "subheading": "What is cystic fibrosis and how does it affect the nose and lungs?",
      "content": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that makes the fluid in the body thick and sticky. This thick fluid blocks tiny tubes in many organs, including the lungs and the sinuses (the air‑filled spaces behind the nose). When the sinuses cannot drain properly, people with CF often develop chronic rhinosinusitis – a long‑lasting inflammation of the sinus lining – and nasal polyps, which are soft, painless growths inside the nose. These problems can cause a blocked nose, trouble breathing through the nose, and may make lung infections worse because the sinuses can hold bacteria that travel to the lungs."

    {
      "subheading": "Why might surgery be used to treat sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis?",
      "content": "One way to help the sinuses drain is endoscopic sinus surgery. During this procedure a surgeon uses a thin camera and small instruments to open blocked sinus passages and remove nasal polyps. The idea is that by clearing the sinuses, medicines (such as nasal rinses or antibiotics) can work better, potentially reducing nose symptoms and also lowering the risk of lung infections."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to discover whether adding sinus surgery – either by itself or together with standard medical treatment – improves outcomes compared with medical treatment alone. Specifically, the authors wanted to know if surgery helps: (1) nasal symptoms and the amount of bacteria in the nose, (2) lung function, (3) the number of hospital stays, use of antibiotics, and episodes of lung worsening (pulmonary exacerbations), and (4) overall survival in people with cystic fibrosis who have chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that compared sinus surgery (with or without medical treatment) to medical treatment alone in people with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence."

  ],
  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified a single randomised controlled trial that enrolled 28 people with cystic fibrosis, chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. All participants were aged between 19 and 28 years; the review did not report their gender or how severe their disease was. The trial compared nasal irrigation alone (medical treatment) with nasal irrigation plus endoscopic polypectomy and extended sinusotomy (surgical treatment). No details were given about how long the study lasted, where it was carried out, or who funded it. The review found that we do not know whether adding sinus surgery to medical treatment improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial colonisation in the nose, lowers the need for antibiotics, decreases pulmonary exacerbations, or improves lung function."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search."
