  "draft": "Does sinus surgery (endoscopic sinus surgery) improve nose symptoms and lung function in people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic lung disease) who have nasal polyps (growths in the nose)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- We are uncertain whether endoscopic sinus surgery (a minimally invasive operation to open the sinuses) improves nasal symptoms or lung function (how well the lungs work) in people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic lung disease) who have nasal polyps (growths in the nose), because only one small study with limited data was found; no serious harms were reported except a single bleeding episode that was quickly managed.\n- The same limited evidence also does not show clear benefits of surgery on reducing bacterial colonisation, antibiotic use, pulmonary exacerbations (worsening of lung disease), or hospital admissions.\n- More well‑designed, larger studies that follow participants for at least a year are needed to determine whether sinus surgery truly helps nasal and lung outcomes, and to assess any long‑term risks or benefits.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and how does it affect the nose and lungs?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that makes the fluid in the body thick and sticky. This thick fluid blocks tiny tubes in many organs, including the lungs and the sinuses (the air‑filled spaces behind the nose). When the sinuses cannot drain properly, people with CF often develop chronic rhinosinusitis – a long‑lasting inflammation of the sinus lining – and nasal polyps, which are soft, painless growths inside the nose. These problems can cause a blocked nose, trouble breathing through the nose, and may make lung infections worse because the sinuses can hold bacteria that travel to the lungs.\n\nWhy might surgery be used to treat sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis?\nOne way to help the sinuses drain is endoscopic sinus surgery. During this procedure a surgeon uses a thin camera and small instruments to open blocked sinus passages and remove nasal polyps. The idea is that by clearing the sinuses, medicines (such as nasal rinses or antibiotics) can work better, potentially reducing nose symptoms and also lowering the risk of lung infections.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe review set out to discover whether adding sinus surgery – either by itself or together with standard medical treatment – improves outcomes compared with medical treatment alone. Specifically, the authors wanted to know if surgery helps: (1) nasal symptoms and the amount of bacteria in the nose, (2) lung function, (3) the number of hospital stays, use of antibiotics, and episodes of lung worsening (pulmonary exacerbations), and (4) overall survival in people with cystic fibrosis who have chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared sinus surgery (with or without medical treatment) to medical treatment alone in people with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified a single randomised controlled trial that enrolled 28 people with cystic fibrosis, chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. All participants were aged between 19 and 28 years; the review did not report their gender or how severe their disease was. The trial compared nasal irrigation alone (medical treatment) with nasal irrigation plus endoscopic polypectomy and extended sinusotomy (surgical treatment). No details were given about how long the study lasted, where it was carried out, or who funded it. The review found that we do not know whether adding sinus surgery to medical treatment improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial colonisation in the nose, lowers the need for antibiotics, decreases pulmonary exacerbations, or improves lung function.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check that all section subheadings must be phrased as questions. Headings such as \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the draft contains several clarity and readability problems that would confuse patients: (1) a very long, parenthesis‑heavy key‑message sentence that packs multiple ideas together; (2) excessive noun‑heavy phrasing and nominalisations (e.g., \"the review found that we do not know whether…\"), reflected in the metric spikes for nominalisation (24 → P90) and noun count (199 → P90); (3) technical terms such as \"bacterial colonisation\" and \"pulmonary exacerbations\" are not defined for a lay audience; (4) the overall readability scores are high (dale_chall_readability 8.75 → BEYOND_P90, smog_index 14.66 → P90), indicating the text is harder than typical PLS. Suggested top improvements: • Change main subheadings to questions (e.g., \"What is the background and why is this review needed?\", \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\"). • Split the first key‑message sentence into two shorter sentences and remove unnecessary parentheses: \"We are uncertain whether endoscopic sinus surgery (a minimally invasive operation to open the sinuses) improves nasal symptoms or lung function in people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. This uncertainty is because only one small study with limited data was found; the only serious harm reported was a single bleeding episode that was quickly managed.\". • Replace jargon with plain language or brief definitions (e.g., \"bacterial colonisation (bacteria living in the nose)\" and \"pulmonary exacerbations (worsening of lung disease)\"). • Reduce nominalisations and noun‑heavy phrasing: change \"The review found that we do not know whether adding sinus surgery to medical treatment improves…\" to \"We do not know whether adding sinus surgery to medical treatment improves…\". • Shorten sentences throughout to aim for 15‑20 words per sentence, which will lower the readability indices and bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns. These changes address the metric deviations (high nominalisation, noun count, complex‑word and long‑word counts) and improve patient‑friendly clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (662 words) but shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns.

Notable metric deviations include nominalisation (24 → P90), noun count (199 → P90), complex words (142 → P90), long words (198 → P90), and Dale‑Chall readability (8.75 → BEYOND_P90), indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical PLS.
