  "draft": "\"Does sinus surgery (endoscopic sinus surgery) improve nose symptoms and lung function in people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic lung disease)  ?  \\n\\nKey messages  \\n- We are uncertain whether endoscopic sinus surgery (a minimally invasive operation to open the sinuses) improves nasal symptoms or lung function in people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. This uncertainty stems from only one small study, and the only serious harm reported was a single bleeding episode that was quickly managed.  \\n- The same limited evidence does not show clear benefits of surgery on reducing bacterial colonisation in the nose, on antibiotic use, on worsening of lung disease (pulmonary exacerbations, i.e., flare‑ups of the lungs), or on hospital admissions.  \\n- Larger, well‑designed studies that follow participants for at least a year are needed to determine whether sinus surgery truly helps nasal and lung outcomes and to assess any long‑term risks or benefits.  \\n\\nWhat is cystic fibrosis and how does it affect the nose and lungs?  \\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that makes body fluids thick and sticky. The thick secretions block tiny tubes in many organs, including the lungs and the sinuses (the air‑filled spaces behind the nose). When the sinuses cannot drain, people with CF often develop chronic rhinosinusitis – long‑lasting inflammation of the sinus lining – and nasal and sinus polyps, which are soft, painless growths inside the nose. These problems can cause a blocked nose, difficulty breathing through the nose, and may worsen lung infections because the sinuses can hold bacteria that travel to the lungs.  \\n\\nWhy might surgery be used to treat sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis?  \\nEndoscopic sinus surgery uses a thin camera and small instruments to open blocked sinus passages and remove nasal polyps. By clearing the sinuses, medicines such as nasal rinses or antibiotics can work better, which might reduce nose symptoms and lower the risk of lung infections.  \\n\\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \\nWe wanted to know whether adding sinus surgery – either alone or together with standard medical treatment – improves outcomes compared with medical treatment alone. Specifically, we looked at:  \\n1. Nasal symptoms and the amount of bacteria in the nose.  \\n2. Lung function.  \\n3. Hospital stays, antibiotic use, and episodes of worsening lung disease (pulmonary exacerbations).  \\n4. Overall survival.  \\n\\nHow did we find the evidence?  \\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared sinus surgery (with or without medical treatment) to medical treatment alone in people with CF, chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. We combined any results we found and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.  \\n\\nWhat did we find?  \\nWe identified a single randomised controlled trial that enrolled 28 participants aged 19 to 28 years. The study compared nasal irrigation alone (medical treatment) with nasal irrigation plus endoscopic polypectomy and extended sinusotomy (surgical treatment). The trial did not report participants’ gender, disease severity, study length, location, or funding. The study did not provide data on survival. We do not know whether adding sinus surgery improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacterial colonisation, lowers antibiotic use, decreases pulmonary exacerbations, or improves lung function. One bleeding episode occurred during surgery and was managed without further problems.  \\n\\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \\nThe evidence is very limited because it comes from a single, small study. The study does not represent all people with CF, nor does it cover all outcomes we were interested in. Consequently, we have low confidence in the results.  \\n\\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \\nThe searches were last run in September 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\"",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the style check because the subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question (the guide requires all subheadings to be questions). Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers: (1) the term \"bacterial colonisation\" is not explained; (2) the surgical description \"endoscopic polypectomy and extended sinusotomy\" is too technical; (3) the second bullet point in the key messages is a long, dense sentence that mixes several ideas; (4) the phrase \"We combined any results we found\" is vague; (5) the draft contains many nominalisations and noun‑heavy constructions, reflected in the metrics (nominalisation = 25 > 13 target, nouns = 186 > 116 target, complex_words = 139 > 84 target, long_words = 191 > 122 target). These issues reduce readability for a lay audience. Suggested rewrites: change the heading to \"What are the key messages?\"; define bacterial colonisation as \"bacterial colonisation (bacteria living in the nose)\"; simplify the surgical term to \"removing polyps and opening the sinuses\"; split the long bullet into two shorter bullets; replace \"We combined any results we found\" with \"We combined the results of the studies we identified\". Addressing these points will bring the PLS into full compliance with the Master Style Guide and improve patient‑friendly clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability metrics (e.g., FKGL 10.38, words per sentence 16.5) are within the best quartile. However, it deviates on several complexity measures: nominalisation (25, beyond P90), nouns (186, beyond P90), smog index (14.6, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.81, beyond P90), complex words (139, beyond P90), long words (191, beyond P90), and complex words DC (317, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many complex words, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
