  "draft": "\"Does sinus surgery (endoscopic sinus surgery) improve nose symptoms and lung function in people with cystic fibrosis (a genetic lung disease) who have nasal polyps (growths in the nose)?\"\n\nKey messages\n- We are uncertain whether endoscopic sinus surgery (a minimally invasive operation to open the sinuses) improves nasal symptoms or lung function in people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. This uncertainty is because only one small study with limited data was found; the only serious harm reported was a single bleeding episode that was quickly managed.\n- The same limited evidence does not show clear benefits of surgery on reducing bacteria living in the nose, the need for antibiotics, worsening of lung disease (pulmonary exacerbations), or hospital admissions.\n- Larger, well‑designed studies that follow participants for at least a year are needed to determine whether sinus surgery truly helps nasal and lung outcomes and to assess any long‑term risks or benefits.\n\nWhat is the background and why is this review needed?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition that makes body fluids thick and sticky. The thick secretions block tiny tubes in many organs, including the lungs and the sinuses (the air‑filled spaces behind the nose). When the sinuses cannot drain, people with CF often develop chronic rhinosinusitis – long‑lasting inflammation of the sinus lining – and nasal polyps, which are soft, painless growths inside the nose. These problems can cause a blocked nose, difficulty breathing through the nose, and may worsen lung infections because the sinuses can hold bacteria that travel to the lungs.\n\nWhy might surgery be used to treat sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis?\nEndoscopic sinus surgery uses a thin camera and small instruments to open blocked sinus passages and remove nasal polyps. By clearing the sinuses, medicines such as nasal rinses or antibiotics can work better, which might reduce nose symptoms and lower the risk of lung infections.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether adding sinus surgery – either alone or together with standard medical treatment – improves outcomes compared with medical treatment alone. Specifically, we looked at (1) nasal symptoms and the amount of bacteria in the nose, (2) lung function, (3) hospital stays, antibiotic use, and episodes of worsening lung disease, and (4) overall survival.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared sinus surgery (with or without medical treatment) to medical treatment alone in people with CF, chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. We combined any results we found and assessed our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified a single randomised controlled trial that enrolled 28 participants aged 19 to 28 years. The trial compared nasal irrigation alone (medical treatment) with nasal irrigation plus endoscopic polypectomy and extended sinusotomy (surgical treatment). The study did not report gender, disease severity, study duration, location, or funding. We do not know whether adding sinus surgery improves nasal symptoms, reduces bacteria living in the nose, lowers the need for antibiotics, decreases episodes of worsening lung disease, or improves lung function. One bleeding episode occurred during surgery and was managed without further problems. No data on survival were reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is very limited because it comes from a single, small study. The study does not represent all people with CF, nor does it cover all outcomes we were interested in. Consequently, we have low confidence in the results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe searches were last run in September 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several reader‑confusing problems:\n1. **Overly long, complex sentence in the first key‑message bullet** – \"We are uncertain whether endoscopic sinus surgery (a minimally invasive operation to open the sinuses) improves nasal symptoms or lung function in people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps, because only one small study with limited data was found; the only serious harm reported was a single bleeding episode that was quickly managed.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words, mixes several ideas, and uses a semicolon, making it hard to follow. *Rewrite*: \"We are uncertain whether endoscopic sinus surgery (a minimally invasive operation to open the sinuses) improves nasal symptoms or lung function in people with cystic fibrosis who have nasal polyps. This is because only one small study with limited data was found, and the only serious harm reported was a single bleeding episode that was quickly managed.\"\n2. **Jargon without definition in the key‑messages** – the term “pulmonary exacerbations” appears in the second bullet without a simple explanation. Readers may not know it means “worsening of lung disease”. *Rewrite*: \"... worsening of lung disease (pulmonary exacerbations, i.e., flare‑ups of the lungs) ...\"\n3. **High passive‑voice and noun‑heavy phrasing** – sentences such as \"The study did not report gender, disease severity, study duration, location, or funding\" and \"The trial compared nasal irrigation alone (medical treatment) with nasal irrigation plus endoscopic polypectomy and extended sinusotomy (surgical treatment)\" are passive‑heavy and noun‑laden, reducing readability. *Rewrite*: \"The study omitted information about gender, disease severity, study length, location, and funding.\" and \"We compared nasal irrigation alone with nasal irrigation plus endoscopic polypectomy and extended sinusotomy.\"\nThese three issues are significant enough to impede patient understanding. The PLS evaluation metrics confirm the editorial concerns: passive_voice = 19 (P90), nominalization = 25 (P90), nouns = 189 (P90), smog_index = 14.6 (P90), dale_chall_readability = 8.5 (P90), complex_words_dc = 296 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words = 139 (P90), long_words = 193 (P90). The high counts of passive constructions, nominalisations, and complex/long words explain the readability problems identified. To achieve approval, the draft should be revised to shorten sentences, replace passive constructions with active voice, reduce noun‑heavy sentences, and add brief definitions for any technical terms used in key messages.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but shows moderate conformity overall. Several metrics are out of the typical PLS range: passive_voice (19, P90), nominalization (25, P90), nouns (189, P90), smog_index (14.6, P90), dale_chall_readability (8.5, P90), complex_words_dc (296, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (139, P90) and long_words (193, P90). These indicate excessive passive voice, noun‑heavy sentences, and high lexical complexity, supporting the need for the suggested clarity improvements."
