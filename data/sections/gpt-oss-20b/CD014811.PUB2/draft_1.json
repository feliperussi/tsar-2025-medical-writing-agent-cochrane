  "draft": "Is giving loop diuretics (water pills) as a steady drip (continuous infusion) better than giving them as quick pushes (bolus injection) for people with sudden worsening of heart failure (acute heart failure)?\n\nKey messages:\n- For people with acute heart failure (sudden worsening of heart failure), giving loop diuretics (water pills that help remove excess fluid) as a continuous infusion (steady drip) may lead to a small amount of extra weight loss compared with giving them as a bolus injection (quick push), but the evidence is very uncertain and there is no clear difference in overall death rates or in the risk of acute kidney injury (sudden worsening of kidney function).\n- Other important outcomes, such as how long patients stay in hospital, the chance of being readmitted after discharge, and overall mortality, also show little or no difference between the two delivery methods, but the available studies are limited and do not provide a clear answer.\n- More high‑quality research is needed, including larger trials that follow patients for longer periods and carefully assess both benefits and any potential harms, to determine whether one method of giving loop diuretics is truly better for treating acute heart failure.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhat is acute heart failure and how is it usually treated?\nAcute heart failure (AHF) is a sudden worsening of the heart’s ability to pump blood, often causing fluid to build up in the lungs and other parts of the body (called congestion). About 95 % of people with AHF experience this fluid overload, which can make breathing difficult and lead to swelling in the legs. To get rid of the excess fluid, doctors give medicines called \"loop diuretics\" – powerful water pills that help the kidneys flush out salt and water. These drugs can be given through a vein (intravenously) in two different ways: a quick, high‑dose \"bolus\" injection, or a slower, steady \"continuous infusion\" that runs over several hours.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to discover whether giving loop diuretics as a continuous infusion is more effective or safer than giving them as intermittent bolus injections for the first treatment of acute heart failure in adults (people classified as NYHA class III or IV, meaning they have severe symptoms). Specifically, they looked at outcomes such as how much weight patients lose (a sign of fluid removal), death rates, length of hospital stay, chances of being readmitted, and the risk of kidney injury.\n\nMethods\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared continuous infusion with bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics in adults with acute heart failure, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe included seven randomised controlled trials involving a total of 681 adult participants with acute heart failure (NYHA class III or IV) and fluid overload. The trials were conducted in 32 hospitals across seven countries in North America, Europe, and Asia, with data‑collection periods ranging from eight months to six years. All studies compared intravenous continuous infusion of loop diuretics with intermittent bolus injection of the same agents. The abstract did not provide details on participants’ age, gender distribution, or exact severity beyond NYHA class, and it did not disclose the funding sources for the trials.\nMain results: Continuous infusion versus bolus injection\nIt is unclear if continuous infusion changes weight loss compared with bolus injection. Continuous infusion may make little to no difference to death rates compared with bolus injection. It is unclear if continuous infusion changes the length of hospital stay compared with bolus injection. Continuous infusion may make little to no difference to readmission rates compared with bolus injection. Continuous infusion may make little to no difference to the risk of acute kidney injury compared with bolus injection. It is unclear if continuous infusion changes daily fluid balance compared with bolus injection.\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the studies were very small and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failed: several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide (e.g., \"Main results: Continuous infusion versus bolus injection\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). Additionally, the draft contains a number of clarity and style problems that would confuse readers:\n1. Long, dense sentences (e.g., \"Continuous infusion may make little to no difference to death rates compared with bolus injection.\") – hard to follow.\n2. Excessive passive voice and noun‑heavy constructions (e.g., \"It is unclear if continuous infusion changes weight loss compared with bolus injection.\") – obscures who did what.\n3. Inconsistent bullet formatting and missing blank lines between sections – reduces readability.\n4. Repetitive phrasing and lack of plain‑language definitions for terms like \"continuous infusion\" and \"bolus injection\".\nSuggested rewrites include turning all subheadings into questions, breaking long sentences into shorter ones, converting passive constructions to active voice, and using dashes for bullet points with clear spacing. These changes will align the summary with the style guide and improve patient‑friendly readability.\nMetrics support these observations: words_per_sentence is 28.6 (beyond P90), passive_voice 20 (P90), nominalization 32 (beyond P90), nouns 230 (beyond P90), and complex_words 135 (P90). These indicate the text is longer, more passive, and noun‑heavy than typical Cochrane PLSs, confirming the need for the recommended edits.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (744 words) but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: average sentence length (28.6 words) is beyond the P90 range, passive voice (20 instances) and nominalizations (32) are higher than typical, and noun count (230) and complex‑word counts are also above the norm. These deviations point to overly long, passive, and noun‑heavy prose, which reduces readability for a lay audience."
