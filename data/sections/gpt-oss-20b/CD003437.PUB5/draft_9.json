  "draft": "\"Is medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation (using external devices), or talk therapy (psychological therapy), alone or combined, effective for treating depression after a stroke?\"\n\nKey messages\n– Medication (drugs) and psychological therapy (talk therapy) each lowered the chance of still being depressed after a stroke.  \n– Adding non‑invasive brain stimulation (using external devices that stimulate the brain without surgery) to medication also reduced depression.  \n– Non‑invasive brain stimulation by itself showed little or no benefit, and medication was linked to more side‑effects affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal system (stomach and intestines).  \n– The evidence comes from a small number of weak studies, so we have low confidence in these results and need larger, better‑designed trials.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke and why does it matter?  \nMany people who have a stroke develop depression – a mood disorder that makes them feel sad, lose interest in activities, and have low energy. This depression can slow recovery, limit participation in rehabilitation, and lower overall quality of life. It is often missed by health professionals or treated inadequately. Common ways to treat it include medication (pharmacological treatment), talking‑based therapies (psychological therapy), and newer techniques that use gentle electrical currents on the scalp to stimulate the brain (non‑invasive brain stimulation).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or any combination of these helps reduce depression after stroke. We also examined whether these approaches cause harmful side‑effects. In other words, we compared each treatment (and some combinations) with doing nothing, a placebo, or usual care.\n\nHow did we look for the studies?  \nWe searched specialised registers, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, two clinical‑trial registers, reference lists and conference proceedings for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatment groups). The search was last updated in February 2022.\n\nHow did we‑combine the results?  \nWe pooled the results of the identified trials. For outcomes that gave numbers we measured the average differences; for yes‑or‑no outcomes we compared the proportion of people with the outcome. We also checked how consistent the results were across studies.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?  \nWe rated our confidence using the GRADE approach, which looks at study limitations, consistency, directness, precision and publication bias. Most evidence was judged very low‑certainty because the trials were small, often unblinded, and had methodological weaknesses.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 65 randomised controlled trials that enrolled 5 831 people who had a stroke and later developed depression.  \n\n– Medication reduced the proportion of people who still met criteria for depression. People who took medication were about 30 % less likely to remain depressed than those who took a placebo. Medication also cut the number of people with an inadequate response by about half, but it increased side‑effects affecting the brain and spinal cord and the stomach or intestines.  \n\n– Psychological therapy reduced depression. People who received talk therapy were about 23 % less likely to remain depressed than those who received usual care. This approach did not increase deaths or other adverse events.  \n\n– Non‑invasive brain stimulation alone showed little or no effect. The chance of still being depressed was similar to that in the control group, and the intervention did not affect mortality.  \n\n– Adding non‑invasive brain stimulation to medication reduced depression (about 23 % fewer people remained depressed) but did not improve the inadequate‑response rate.  \n\nWe found no usable evidence for combining psychological therapy with brain stimulation or for other combination strategies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the results because many studies were very small and participants often knew which treatment they received, increasing the risk of bias.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?  \nWe searched for studies up to February 2022, so the evidence reflects research available at that time.",

These issues need to be rewritten before the summary can be approved.\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- \"Medication also halved the number of people whose depression did not improve enough. However, it increased side‑effects affecting the brain and spinal cord, as well as the stomach and intestines.\"\n- \"We searched for studies up to February 2022, so the evidence reflects research available at that time.\"\n- Replace “inadequate response” with “depression that did not improve enough”.\n- Reduce nominalisations (e.g., change “How did we‑combine the results?” to “How did we combine the results?”) and substitute simpler words where possible.\n\nThese changes will lower the SMOG, complex‑word and nominalisation counts and bring the text into the typical PLS readability range.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but shows significant deviations in several linguistic metrics: nominalisations (41, beyond P90), nouns (192, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.6, beyond P90), complex words (169, beyond P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (292, beyond P90) and long words (202, beyond P90). These indicate a higher than typical level of lexical and syntactic complexity, supporting the need for simplification and active‑voice revisions."
