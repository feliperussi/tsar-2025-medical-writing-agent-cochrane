  "draft": "Is medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation (using external devices), or talk therapy (psychological therapy), alone or combined, effective for treating depression after a stroke?\n\nKey messages\n– Medication (drugs) and talk therapy each reduced depression after stroke.  \n– Adding non‑invasive brain stimulation to medication also appeared helpful.  \n– Brain stimulation by itself showed little or no benefit, and medication caused more side‑effects such as dizziness, headaches, and stomach or bowel problems.  \n– The evidence comes from a small number of studies with many weaknesses, so our confidence in these results is low and larger, well‑designed trials are needed.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke and why is it a problem?  \nMany people who have a stroke develop depression, a mood disorder that makes them feel sad, lose interest in activities, and have low energy. This depression can slow recovery, reduce participation in rehabilitation, and lower overall quality of life. Unfortunately, it is often missed by health professionals or not treated adequately. Common ways to treat post‑stroke depression include medicines (pharmacological treatment), talking‑based therapies (psychological therapy), and newer techniques that use gentle electrical currents on the scalp to stimulate the brain (or non‑invasive brain stimulation).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to find out whether medicines, non‑invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or any combination of these helps reduce depression after stroke. We also looked at whether these approaches cause harmful side effects. In other words, we compared each treatment (and some combinations) with doing nothing, a placebo, or usual care.\n\nHow did we find the studies?  \nWe searched specialised registers, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, two clinical‑trial registers, reference lists and conference proceedings for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatment groups). The search was last updated in February 2022.\n\nHow did we combine the results?  \nWe pooled data from the identified trials. For continuous outcomes we calculated mean differences or standardised mean differences; for dichotomous outcomes we calculated risk ratios, each with a 95 % confidence interval. We examined heterogeneity with the I² statistic.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?  \nWe rated our confidence using the GRADE approach, which considers study limitations, consistency, directness, precision and publication bias. Most evidence was judged very low‑certainty because the trials were small, often unblinded, and showed methodological weaknesses.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 65 randomised controlled trials that enrolled 5 831 people who had a stroke and later developed depression.  \n\n– Medication reduced the proportion of people who still met criteria for depression. People who took medication were about 30 % less likely to remain depressed compared with those who took a placebo (risk ratio 0.70). Medication also reduced inadequate response to treatment (risk ratio 0.47) but increased side‑effects such as dizziness, headaches, and stomach or bowel problems (risk ratios 1.55 and 1.62, respectively).  \n\n– Psychological therapy reduced depression. People who received talk therapy were about 23 % less likely to remain depressed compared with usual care (risk ratio 0.77). This approach did not increase deaths or other adverse events.  \n\n– Non‑invasive brain stimulation alone showed little or no effect. The risk ratio for remaining depressed was 0.67, indicating no clear benefit, and the intervention did not affect mortality.  \n\n– Adding non‑invasive brain stimulation to and medication reduced depression (risk ratio 0.77) but did not improve inadequate response.  \n\nWe found no usable evidence for combining psychological therapy with brain stimulation or for other combination strategies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the results because many studies were very small and participants often knew which treatment they received, increasing the risk of bias.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?  \nWe searched for studies up to February 2022, so the evidence reflects research available at that time.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the style check because the subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, which the style guide requires for all section headings. In addition, several clarity issues would confuse a lay reader: (1) statistical jargon such as \"risk ratio\" is used without explanation; (2) passive‑voice constructions (e.g., \"The risk ratio for remaining depressed was 0.67\") obscure who did what; (3) a long, dense sentence in the Methods section lists many databases in one stretch, making it hard to follow; (4) the text contains many nominalisations and long, complex words, contributing to a high SMOG index (15.8, beyond the typical P90 range) and excessive nominalisation count (40, beyond P90). These issues reduce readability despite the overall word count being acceptable. Suggested revisions: rewrite the \"Key messages\" heading as a question, replace \"risk ratio\" with a plain explanation (e.g., \"the chance of still being depressed was about 30% lower\"), convert passive sentences to active voice, split the long database‑search sentence into two shorter ones, and replace noun‑heavy phrases with verbs (e.g., \"We found\" instead of \"The findings showed\"). The metrics support these edits: passive_voice = 17 (high), nominalization = 40 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words = 176 (BEYOND_P90), long_words = 205 (BEYOND_P90), smog_index = 15.81 (BEYOND_P90).",

However, several features deviate strongly: nominalisations (40, beyond P90), total nouns (196, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.8, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall score (8.16, beyond P90), and counts of complex and long words are all far above typical PLS levels, indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than usual. These metric outliers align with the observed clarity and style issues."
