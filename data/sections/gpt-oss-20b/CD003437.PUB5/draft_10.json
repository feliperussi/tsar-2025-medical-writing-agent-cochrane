  "draft": "Is medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation (using external devices), or talk therapy (psychological therapy), alone or combined, effective for treating depression after a stroke?\n\nKey messages\n– Medication (drugs) and talk therapy each lowered the chance of still being depressed after a stroke.  \n– Adding non‑invasive brain stimulation (using external devices that stimulate the brain without surgery) to medication also reduced depression.  \n– Non‑invasive brain stimulation by itself showed little or no benefit, and medication increased side‑effects that affect the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and the stomach or intestines (gastro‑intestinal system).  \n– The evidence comes from a small number of weak studies, so we have low confidence in these results and need larger, better‑designed trials.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke and why does it matter?  \nMany people who have a stroke develop depression – a mood disorder that makes them feel sad, lose interest in activities, and have low energy. This depression can slow recovery, limit participation in rehabilitation, and lower overall quality of life. It is often missed by health professionals or treated inadequately. Common ways to treat it include medication (drugs), talk‑based therapies (psychological therapy), and newer techniques that use gentle electrical currents on the scalp to stimulate the brain (non‑invasive brain stimulation).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or any combination of these helps reduce depression after stroke. We also examined whether these approaches cause harmful side‑effects. In other words, we compared each treatment (and some combinations) with doing nothing, a placebo, or usual care.\n\nHow did we look for the studies?  \nWe searched specialised registers, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, two clinical‑trial registers, reference lists and conference proceedings for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatment groups). The search was last updated in February 2022.\n\nHow did we combine the results?  \nWe pooled the results of the identified trials. For outcomes that gave numbers we measured the average differences; for yes‑or‑no outcomes we compared the proportion of people with the outcome. We also checked how consistent the results were across studies.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?  \nWe rated our confidence using the GRADE approach, which looks at study limitations, consistency, directness, precision and publication bias. Most evidence was judged very low‑certainty because the trials were small, often unblinded, and had methodological weaknesses.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 65 randomised controlled trials that enrolled 5 831 people who had a stroke and later developed depression.  \n\n– Medication reduced the proportion of people who still met criteria for depression. People who took medication were about 30 % less likely to remain depressed than those who took a placebo. Medication also halved the number of people whose depression did not improve enough, but it increased side‑effects affecting the brain and spinal cord and the stomach or intestines.  \n\n– Psychological therapy reduced depression. People who received talk therapy were about 23 % less likely to remain depressed than those who received usual care. This approach did not increase deaths or other adverse events.  \n\n– Non‑invasive brain stimulation alone showed little or no effect. The chance of still being depressed was similar to that in the control group, and the intervention did not affect mortality.  \n\n– Adding non‑invasive brain stimulation to medication reduced depression (about 23 % fewer people remained depressed) but did not improve the rate of inadequate response.  \n\nWe found no usable evidence for combining psychological therapy with brain stimulation or for other combination strategies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the results because many studies were very small and participants often knew which treatment they received, increasing the risk of bias.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?  \nWe searched for studies up to February 2022, so the evidence reflects research available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the subheading format rule – the section heading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\"). This violates the Master Style Guide requirement that all subheadings be questions. Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers: (1) jargon and long explanations in the side‑effects sentence; (2) overly technical description of the methods (GRADE, pooling, etc.); (3) dense wording in the sentence about non‑invasive brain stimulation and medication combination; (4) nominalised language that makes sentences noun‑heavy. These issues are reflected in the metric analysis, which shows very high counts of nominalisations (40, beyond P90), long words (200, beyond P90), complex words (166, beyond P90) and a high SMOG index (15.5, beyond P90). Reducing nominalisations, simplifying vocabulary, and re‑phrasing the problematic sentences will improve readability and bring the draft into better conformity with typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit and has good sentence length (words_per_sentence 17, P25). Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 49.7, P75). However, several linguistic features deviate strongly from typical PLS texts: nominalisations (40, BEYOND_P90), nouns (190, P90), SMOG index (15.5, BEYOND_P90), complex words (166, BEYOND_P90), Dale‑Chall complex words (285, BEYOND_P90) and long words (200, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many complex, long words, which can hinder patient understanding."
