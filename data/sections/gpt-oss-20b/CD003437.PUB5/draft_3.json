  "draft": "Is medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation (using external devices), or talk therapy (psychological therapy), alone or combined, effective for treating depression after a stroke?\n\nKey messages\n– Medication (drugs) and psychological therapy (talk therapy) each gave some benefit in lowering depression after stroke, and combining medication with non‑invasive brain stimulation also looked helpful; brain stimulation alone showed little or no benefit, and medication caused more side‑effects affecting the brain‑spinal cord (central nervous system) and the stomach‑intestines (gastro‑intestinal system).  \n– The results come from a small number of short studies that often had study problems, and no trials tested several combination approaches, so our confidence in the findings is low.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to see the long‑term benefits and harms of each treatment and to find out which patients are most likely to benefit.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke and why does it matter?  \nMany people who have a stroke also develop depression, a mood disorder that makes them feel sad, lose interest in activities, and have low energy. This depression can slow recovery, limit participation in rehabilitation, and lower overall quality of life. It is often missed by health professionals or not treated well enough.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to discover whether medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or any combination of these approaches helps reduce depression after stroke, and whether they cause any harmful side‑effects. We compared each treatment (and some combinations) with doing nothing, a placebo, or usual care.\n\nHow did we look for the studies?  \nWe searched databases for randomised trials that tested the three treatments or their combinations in people with post‑stroke depression. We included studies up to February 2022.\n\nHow did we combine the results and assess confidence?  \nWe pooled the data from the identified trials to estimate overall effects. We judged our confidence in each result using standard GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 65 randomised controlled trials involving 5 831 participants who had a stroke and later developed depression. The evidence is very uncertain. Medication and psychological therapy each showed some benefit, but the certainty is low. Non‑invasive brain stimulation alone showed little or no effect. Combining medication with brain stimulation may reduce depression, but the certainty remains low. No usable evidence existed for combining psychological therapy with brain stimulation or for other combination strategies. Medication was linked to more side‑effects affecting the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal system.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the findings because many studies were small and participants often knew which treatment they received, which can bias results.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched for studies up to February 2022, so the evidence reflects research available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft contains several clarity problems that could confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Over‑long key‑message sentence** – \"Medication (drugs) and psychological therapy (talk therapy) each gave some benefit in lowering depression after stroke, and combining medication with non‑invasive brain stimulation also looked helpful; brain stimulation alone showed little or no benefit, and medication caused more side‑effects affecting the brain‑spinal cord (central nervous system) and the stomach‑intestines (gastro‑intestinal system).\" This sentence packs three separate ideas, uses many commas and semicolons, and repeats technical terms. *Rewrite*: \"Medication and talk therapy each reduced depression after stroke. Adding brain‑stimulation to medication also appeared helpful, but brain‑stimulation alone had little or no effect. Medication was linked to more side‑effects affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal system (stomach and intestines).\"\n2. **Unexplained jargon / redundant parentheticals** – The terms \"central nervous system (brain‑spinal cord)\" and \"gastro‑intestinal system (stomach‑intestines)\" are technical and the parentheticals repeat the same information, which can overwhelm readers. *Rewrite*: \"central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)\" and \"gastro‑intestinal system (stomach and intestines)\" or simply \"central nervous system\" and \"gastro‑intestinal system\" with a brief earlier definition.\n3. **Vague statement of certainty** – \"The evidence is very uncertain.\" does not convey the standard Cochrane wording and may leave readers unsure what \"very uncertain\" means. *Rewrite*: \"We have very low certainty about these findings (GRADE rating: very low).\"\n4. **Wordy description of study quality** – \"The results come from a small number of short studies that often had study problems\" is vague and uses the noun‑heavy phrase \"study problems\". *Rewrite*: \"The results come from a few small studies that often had methodological problems, so our confidence in the findings is low.\"\n5. **Nominalisations and complex words** – The draft uses many noun‑based phrases (e.g., \"assessment of confidence\", \"combination of treatments\") and a high number of unfamiliar words (214 complex Dale‑Chall words). This makes the text harder to read. Re‑write these as active verbs: \"We assessed our confidence\" → \"We judged our confidence\"; \"We looked at combinations of treatments\" → \"We examined combined treatments\".\n\nThese changes address the most confusing parts, reduce sentence length, replace jargon with plain language, and lower the nominalisation and complex‑word count.\n\n**Metrics support**: The PLS evaluation shows a nominalisation count of 31 (beyond the typical range) and 214 Dale‑Chall complex words (also beyond typical). Both indicate the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words, confirming the need to rewrite as suggested.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (66.7% best‑quartile rate), but two metrics deviate markedly: nominalisations (31, beyond P90) and Dale‑Chall complex words (214, beyond P90). These suggest the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many unfamiliar words, which aligns with the editorial recommendations to reduce nominalisations and simplify vocabulary."
