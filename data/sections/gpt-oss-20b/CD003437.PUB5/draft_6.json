  "draft": "Is medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation (using external devices), or talk therapy (psychological therapy), alone or combined, effective for treating depression after a stroke?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Medication (drugs) and psychological therapy (talk therapy) each reduced depression after stroke.  \n– Adding non‑invasive brain stimulation to medication, or to medication alone, also appeared helpful.  \n– Non‑invasive brain stimulation by itself showed little or no benefit, and medication caused more unwanted side effects affecting the brain and spinal cord and causing stomach or bowel problems.  \n– The evidence comes from a small number of studies that often had methodological weaknesses, so our confidence in the results is low and larger, well‑designed trials are needed.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke and why is it a problem?\nMany people who have a stroke develop depression, a mood disorder that makes them feel sad, lose interest in activities, and have low energy. This depression can slow recovery, reduce participation in rehabilitation, and lower overall quality of life. Unfortunately, it is often missed by health professionals or not treated adequately. Common ways to treat post‑stroke depression include medicines (pharmacological treatment), talking‑based therapies (psychological therapy), and newer techniques that use gentle electrical currents on the scalp to stimulate the brain (non‑invasive brain stimulation).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to discover whether medicines, non‑invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or any combination of these approaches helps reduce depression after stroke, and whether they cause harmful side effects. In other words, we compared each treatment‑option (and some combinations) with doing nothing, a placebo, or usual care.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched specialised registers, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, two clinical‑trial registers, reference lists and conference proceedings for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatment groups). The search was last updated in February 2022.\n\nHow did we combine the results?\nWe pooled data from the identified trials. For continuous outcomes we calculated mean differences or standardised mean differences; for dichotomous outcomes we calculated risk ratios, each with a 95 % confidence interval. We examined heterogeneity with the I² statistic.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe rated our confidence using the GRADE approach, which considers study limitations, consistency, directness, precision and publication bias. Most evidence was judged very low‑certainty because the trials were small, often unblinded, and showed methodological weaknesses.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 65 randomised controlled trials that enrolled 5 831 people who had a stroke and later developed depression.  \n– Medication reduced the proportion of people meeting criteria for depression (risk ratio 0.70) and reduced inadequate response to treatment (risk ratio 0. 47), but it also increased side effects affecting the brain and spinal cord (risk ratio 1.55) and causing stomach or bowel problems (risk ratio 1.62).  \n– Psychological therapy reduced depression (risk ratio 0.77) and did not increase deaths or adverse events.  \n– Non‑invasive brain stimulation alone showed little or no effect on depression (risk ratio 0.67) and did not affect mortality.  \n– Combining medication with non‑invasive brain stimulation reduced depression (risk ratio 0.77) but did not improve inadequate response.  \nNo usable evidence was found for combining psychological therapy with brain stimulation or for other combination strategies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the results because many studies were very small and participants often knew which treatment they received, increasing the risk of bias.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nThe evidence reflects searches completed up to February 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a patient‑focused audience:\n1. **Unexplained statistical terms** – The results section reports risk ratios (e.g., “risk ratio 0.70”) without any plain‑language explanation of what this means for a person’s chance of improvement. This leaves readers unsure of the practical impact.\n   *Rewrite:* “People who took medication were about 30% less likely to still meet the criteria for depression compared with those who took a placebo (risk ratio 0.70).”\n2. **Confusing wording in the key‑message bullet** – The bullet “Adding non‑invasive brain stimulation to medication, or to medication alone, also appeared helpful.” mixes two ideas and makes the meaning unclear.\n   *Rewrite:* “Adding non‑invasive brain stimulation to medication also appeared helpful.”\n3. **Technical jargon for side‑effects** – The phrase “more unwanted side effects affecting the brain and spinal cord and causing stomach or bowel problems” uses the term “central nervous system (CNS)” and “spinal cord”, which are unnecessary for a lay audience.\n   *Rewrite:* “Medication caused more side effects affecting the nervous system (such as dizziness or headaches) and more stomach or bowel problems.”\n4. **Passive‑voice and nominalisation** – Sentences like “The evidence reflects searches completed up to February 2022.” are passive and noun‑heavy, contributing to the high nominalisation count (38, beyond P90). Re‑phrasing in active voice improves readability.\n   *Rewrite:* “We searched for studies up to February 2022.”\n5. **Long, dense sentence** – “We wanted to discover whether medicines, non‑invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or any combination of these approaches helps reduce depression after stroke, and whether they cause harmful side effects.” (29 words) can be split for easier reading.\n   *Rewrite:* “We wanted to find out whether medicines, non‑invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or any combination of these helps reduce depression after stroke. We also looked at whether they cause harmful side effects.”\nThese three (or more) issues are significant enough to impede patient understanding, so the draft does not meet the clarity standards required for approval.\n\n**Metrics support**: The evaluation shows a high nominalisation count (38, BEYOND_P90) and a high number of complex words (168, BEYOND_P90) and long words (197, BEYOND_P90), confirming the draft is noun‑heavy and uses technical vocabulary. Passive voice instances (17, P75) also contribute to reduced readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit (613 words) and has average sentence length (19.16 words, P25). Readability scores are moderate (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 43.45, P50). However, several metrics deviate strongly from typical PLS patterns: nominalisations (38, BEYOND_P90), nouns (191, P90), SMOG index (15.4, BEYOND_P90), Dale‑Chall score (8.5, P90), complex words (168, BEYOND_P90) and long words (197, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many complex, long words, which aligns with the identified clarity and style issues."
