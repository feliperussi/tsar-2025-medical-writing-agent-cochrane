  "draft": "Is medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation (using gentle electrical currents on the scalp), or talk therapy (psychological therapy), alone or combined, effective for treating depression after a stroke?\n\n– Medication and talk therapy each showed some benefit in reducing post‑stroke depression, but the evidence is very uncertain; combining medication with non‑invasive brain stimulation also appeared helpful, while brain stimulation alone showed little or no benefit. Medication was linked to more side‑effects affecting the brain‑spinal cord (central nervous system) and the stomach‑intestine (gastro‑intestinal system).  \n– The findings come from a small number of trials that often had methodological weaknesses, and no studies examined several combination approaches, so our confidence in the results is low.  \n– We need larger, well‑designed trials to determine the long‑term benefits and harms of each treatment and to identify which patients are most likely to benefit.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**  \nWhat is depression after stroke and why is it a problem?  \nWe explain that many people who have a stroke develop depression – a mood disorder that causes sadness, loss of interest, and low energy. This depression slows recovery, limits participation in rehabilitation, and reduces quality of life. It is often missed or undertreated. Common treatments include medication (pharmacological treatment), talk‑based therapies (psychological therapy), and newer techniques that use gentle electrical currents on the scalp (non‑invasive brain stimulation).  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or any combination of these helps reduce depression after stroke and whether they cause harmful side‑effects. We compared each approach with doing nothing, a placebo, or usual care.\n\n**Methods**  \nHow did we search for studies?  \nWe looked for randomised trials that tested medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or their combinations in people with post‑stroke depression.  \n\nHow did we combine the results?  \nWe pooled the data from the identified trials to estimate overall effects.  \n\nHow did we assess confidence?  \nWe rated our confidence in the evidence using standard GRADE criteria.\n\n**Results**  \nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 65 randomised controlled trials involving 5,831 participants who had a stroke and later developed depression. The trials examined medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and some combinations. The evidence is very uncertain. Medication and talk therapy each showed some benefit, but the certainty is low. Non‑invasive brain stimulation alone showed little or no effect. Combining medication with brain stimulation may reduce depression, but the evidence remains low‑certainty. No usable evidence existed for combining talk therapy with brain stimulation or for other combination strategies.\n\n**Limitations**  \nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the findings because many studies were small, and participants often knew which treatment they received, which can bias results.\n\n**Currency**  \nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence reflects searches up to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft does not meet the mandatory structural requirements of a Cochrane Plain Language Summary. It is missing a separate \"Key messages\" section, and all subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). These omissions breach the Master Style Guide (section 5.3) and therefore the summary cannot be approved. Additionally, the text contains a high level of nominalisation (40 instances, beyond the P90 benchmark) and a high SMOG index (14.05, beyond the median), indicating the language is more complex than typical PLS texts. Reducing nominalisations and simplifying complex words would improve readability.\n\nKey improvements needed:\n1. Add a distinct \"Key messages\" section that lists the three core messages from the source of truth.\n2. Re‑write all subheadings as questions (e.g., \"What is depression after stroke and why does it matter?\", \"How did we find the studies?\" etc.).\n3. Reduce nominalisations by converting noun‑heavy phrases to verbs (e.g., change \"The findings come from a small number of trials that often had methodological weaknesses\" to \"We found that a small number of trials had methodological weaknesses\").\n4. Lower the SMOG and complex‑word counts by replacing multi‑syllable terms such as \"methodological weaknesses\" with simpler alternatives like \"study problems\".\n5. Ensure active voice throughout to align with the style guide (e.g., replace \"The evidence reflects searches up to February 2022\" with \"We searched up to February 2022\").\n\nThese changes will bring the summary into compliance with the required sections, improve clarity for patients, and align the linguistic metrics with typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms to many typical PLS metrics (e.g., words per sentence 14.32 P25, active voice 60 P75), but shows significant deviation in nominalisation (40, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (14.05, P90), and complex word counts (complex_words 131, complex_words_dc 227, both P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than usual, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
