  "plain_title": "Is medication, non‑invasive brain stimulation (using external devices), or talk therapy (psychological therapy), alone or combined, effective for treating depression after a stroke?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Medication (drugs) and psychological therapy (talk therapy) each showed some benefit in reducing depression after stroke, and combining medication with non‑invasive brain stimulation (using external devices that stimulate the brain without surgery) also appeared helpful; non‑invasive brain stimulation alone showed little or no benefit, and medication was linked to more adverse events (unwanted side effects) affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal system (stomach and intestines).",
    "The findings are based on a limited number of small studies, many of which had methodological weaknesses, and there were no trials for several combination approaches, so confidence in the results is low.",
    "More large, well‑designed trials are needed to determine the long‑term benefits and harms of each treatment and of combined approaches, and to identify which patients are most likely to benefit."

      "subheading": "What is depression after stroke and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Many people who have a stroke also develop depression, a mood disorder that makes them feel sad, lose interest in activities, and have low energy. This depression can slow down recovery, reduce the ability to take part in rehabilitation, and lower overall quality of life. Unfortunately, it is often missed by health professionals or not treated well enough. Common ways to treat depression include medicines (pharmacological treatment), talking‑based therapies (psychological therapy), and newer techniques that use gentle electrical currents on the scalp to stimulate the brain (non‑invasive brain stimulation)."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to discover whether medicines, non‑invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or any combination of these approaches help reduce depression after stroke, and whether they cause any harmful side effects. In other words, they set out to compare each treatment (and some combinations) with doing nothing, a placebo, or usual care, to see which options are most effective and safe for people recovering from stroke."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 65 randomised controlled trials with a total of 5,831 people who had a stroke and later developed depression. The trials tested a range of interventions: medicines, non‑invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and some combinations of these approaches. The abstract does not provide details about study duration, funding sources, participant ages or genders, or the locations where the studies were conducted.\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear whether medicines of any type reduce post‑stroke depression, and it is also unclear whether they cause brain‑related or gastrointestinal side‑effects. Psychological therapy alone also shows an unclear effect on depression after stroke. Combining medicines with brain stimulation may reduce depression, but the certainty is low. No usable evidence was found for combining psychological therapy with brain stimulation or for other combination strategies."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and the studies were very small.",
