  "draft": "Does giving zinc supplements (zinc tablets or syrup) reduce death, illness, and improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Giving zinc tablets or syrup to children aged 6 months to 12 years does not clearly reduce overall death (all‑cause mortality, meaning death from any cause), but it probably lowers the number of diarrhoea episodes (watery bowel movements) and leads to a small increase in height (growth in stature); however, it also increases the chance of vomiting (throwing up).\n- When zinc is taken together with iron (co‑supplementation, meaning both nutrients are given at the same time), the positive effects on diarrhoea and growth appear to be weaker.\n- More high‑quality (well‑designed with low risk of error) and longer‑term studies are needed to determine whether zinc can reduce death from specific infections (such as pneumonia or malaria) and to clarify the overall balance of benefits and harms, especially when combined with other nutrients.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is zinc deficiency a concern for children’s health?\nMany children, especially those living in low‑ and middle‑income countries, do not get enough zinc from their diet. Zinc is a mineral that helps the immune system work, protects against infections, and supports normal growth. When children lack zinc, they are more likely to become sick with illnesses such as diarrhoea, pneumonia (a type of lower‑respiratory‑tract infection), and malaria, and they may grow more slowly or become shorter than expected (called linear growth failure). Because these problems can lead to death (mortality) or long‑term health issues (morbidity), finding ways to prevent zinc deficiency is an important public‑health goal. One possible way to prevent deficiency is to give children a daily zinc supplement, often in the form of a syrup containing zinc sulfate.\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about giving zinc to children?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether giving zinc supplements to healthy children aged 6 months to 12 years can reduce the risk (chance) of dying from any cause, and specifically from diarrhoea, pneumonia, or malaria. They also wanted to know if zinc could lower the number of illness episodes (morbidity), help children grow taller, and improve blood levels of zinc and other nutrients. In short, the goal was to assess the overall benefits and possible harms of preventive zinc supplementation compared with giving no supplement or a placebo.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared preventive zinc supplementation with no zinc in children aged 6 months to 12 years, combined their results to assess effects on mortality, morbidity and growth, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included 96 randomised controlled trials involving 219,584 children aged 6 months to 12 years, the majority under five years old. The studies were carried out in 34 countries, with 87% conducted in low‑ or middle‑income settings. Preventive zinc was most often given as a syrup containing zinc sulfate at daily doses of 10–15 mg and was compared with no intervention, placebo, or a waiting‑list control. The median follow‑up duration was 26 weeks. No trials examined zinc fortification, sprinkles, therapeutic zinc use, or populations such as hospitalised or chronically ill children. Funding sources for the trials were not reported.\nMain results: Impact on child mortality and health\nZinc supplementation probably reduces deaths of lower‑respiratory‑tract infections and malaria, and probably reduces episodes of diarrho or slightly. It probably leads to a small increase in height. Zinc supplementation makes little to no difference to overall death rates, deaths from diarrhoea, and rates of lower‑respiratory‑tract illness. However, it increases the chance of vomiting.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2022 of search.",

All headings (Introduction/Aims, Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency) should be re‑phrased as questions.\n2. **Typo and unclear phrasing** – sentence: \"Zinc supplementation probably reduces ... episodes of diarrho or slightly.\" The word \"diarrho\" is incomplete and \"or slightly\" is vague. Rewrite to clearly state the effect on diarrhoea episodes.\n3. **Passive voice** – sentence: \"The studies were carried out in 34 countries...\" (passive). Rewrite in active voice to improve readability.\n4. **Passive voice / noun‑heavy** – sentence: \"Funding sources for the trials were not reported.\" (passive, noun‑heavy). Re‑write actively and more concisely.\n5. **Long, dense sentence** – sentence: \"Zinc supplementation makes little to no difference to overall death rates, deaths from diarrhoea, and rates of lower‑respiratory‑tract illness.\" This packs three ideas; split into two shorter sentences for clarity.\nThese changes will also address metric deviations (passive_voice = 22 (P90), nouns = 218 (BEYOND_P90), complex_words = 129 (P90), long_words = 185 (P90), complex_words_dc = 288 (BEYOND_P90)).
