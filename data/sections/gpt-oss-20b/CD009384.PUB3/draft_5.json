  "draft": "Does giving zinc supplements (zinc tablets or syrup) reduce death, illness, and improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years?\n\nKey messages\n– Giving zinc tablets or syrup to children 6 months‑12 years does not clearly lower overall death rates, but it probably reduces diarrhoea episodes and adds a small amount of height.  \n– When zinc is taken together with iron, the benefits for diarrhoea and growth become weaker.  \n– Zinc increases the chance of vomiting, so we need to weigh this harm against the benefits.\n\nWhy is zinc deficiency a concern for children’s health?  \nMany children, especially in low‑ and middle‑income countries, do not get enough zinc from food. Zinc is a mineral that helps the immune system work, protects against infections, and supports normal growth. Children who lack zinc are more likely to develop diarrhoea, pneumonia (a type of lower‑respiratory‑infection), malaria, and slower linear growth (stunted growth). These problems can lead to death (mortality) or long‑term illness (morbidity). Giving a daily zinc supplement, often as a syrup, is one way to prevent deficiency.\n\nWhat did we aim to discover about giving zinc to children?  \nWe wanted to know whether taking zinc supplements in healthy children aged 6 months‑12 years can (1) reduce the chance of dying from any cause, and specifically from diarrhoea, pneumonia, or malaria; (2) lower the number of illness episodes; (3) help children grow taller; and (4) improve blood levels of zinc and other nutrients. We also looked for any harms, such as vomiting.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared zinc supplements with no supplement, placebo, or a waiting‑list control in children 6 months‑12 years. Two reviewers screened each study, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of the studies. We combined the results from all eligible studies – a method called a meta‑analysis – and we judged how confident we are in the findings using a system called GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). GRADE rates evidence from high to very low certainty.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 96 trials that included 219 584 children, most of whom were under five years old. The trials were carried out in 34 countries; 87 % were low‑ or middle‑income settings. Most studies gave zinc as a syrup containing zinc sulfate at a daily dose of 10–15 mg and followed children for a median of 26 weeks. No trial examined zinc fortification, sprinkles, therapeutic zinc use, or children who were hospitalised or chronically ill.\n\nWhat are the main results on child mortality and health?  \n– Zinc probably reduces deaths caused by lower‑respiratory‑infections (including pneumonia) and malaria.  \n– Zinc makes little or no difference to overall death rates, deaths from diarrhoea, or the overall rate of respiratory illness.  \n– Zinc probably lowers the number of diarrhoea episodes slightly.  \n– Zinc likely adds a small increase in height.  \n– Zinc increases the chance that a child will experience vomiting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate‑certainty evidence, meaning we are reasonably confident but more research could change the estimates. There are not enough studies to be certain about many outcomes, especially long‑term effects and cause‑specific mortality. The evidence on zinc taken together with iron is limited, and those studies suggest the benefits become weaker.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to February 2022.",

This inaccuracy must be corrected. In addition, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers: (1) technical terms such as “moderate‑certainty evidence” and “GRADE” are used without plain‑language explanations; (2) some sentences are long and dense (e.g., the methods description), making them hard to follow; (3) the draft contains a high noun count and many complex words, which the metrics flag (nouns = 186 → P90, complex_words_dc = 259 → P90). Reducing noun‑heavy phrasing and replacing complex words with everyday language will improve readability. Addressing these points and correcting the statistic will bring the PLS into full compliance with the Master Style Guide and the factual source.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS meets word‑count, sentence length and readability targets (e.g., FKGL 8.9, Flesch Reading Ease 63.7). However, two metrics deviate markedly from typical PLS patterns: noun count (186, beyond the P90 range) and complex Dale‑Chall words (259, beyond the P90 range), indicating the text is noun‑heavy and uses many unfamiliar words. These metric signals support the editorial recommendation to simplify language and reduce noun‑heavy constructions."
