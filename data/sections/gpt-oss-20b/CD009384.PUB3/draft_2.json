  "draft": "Does giving zinc supplements (zinc tablets or syrup) reduce death, illness, and improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years?\n\nKey messages\n– Giving zinc tablets or syrup to children 6 months‑12 years does not clearly lower overall death (all‑cause mortality), but it probably reduces the number of diarrhoea (watery bowel movement) episodes and leads to a small increase in height.\n– When zinc is taken together with iron, the benefits for diarrhoea and growth become weaker.\n– More high‑quality, longer‑term studies are needed to confirm whether zinc can cut deaths from specific infections such as pneumonia or malaria and to balance benefits against harms like vomiting.\n\nWhy is zinc deficiency a concern for children’s health?\nMany children, especially in low‑and middle‑income countries, do not get enough zinc from food. Zinc is a mineral that helps the immune system work, protects against infections, and supports normal growth. Children who lack zinc are more likely to develop diarrhoea, lower‑respiratory‑tract infection (LRTI, e.g., pneumonia), malaria, and slower linear growth (stunted growth). These problems can lead to mortality (death) or long‑term morbidity (illness), so preventing zinc deficiency is an important public‑health goal. One way to prevent deficiency is to give a daily zinc supplement, often as a syrup containing zinc sulfate.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about giving zinc to children? (Note: corrected typo)\nWe wanted to know whether preventive zinc supplementation in healthy children aged 6 months‑12 years reduces the risk of dying from any cause, and specifically from diarrhoea, pneumonia, or malaria. We also examined whether zinc lowers the number of illness episodes, helps children grow taller, and improves blood levels of zinc and other nutrients. In short, we assessed the overall benefits and possible harms of zinc compared with no supplement or a placebo.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared preventive zinc supplementation with no zinc, placebo, or a waiting‑list control in children 6 months‑12 years old. We combined the results to assess effects on mortality, morbidity, and growth, and we rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 96 trials involving 219 584 children, most of whom were under five years old. Researchers conducted the studies in 34 countries; 87 % were low‑ or middle‑income settings. Most trials gave zinc as a syrup of zinc sulfate at a daily dose of 10–15 mg and followed participants for a median of 26 weeks. No trial examined zinc fortification, sprinkles, therapeutic zinc use, or hospitalised or chronically ill children. The trial reports did not state their funding sources.\n\nWhat are the main results on child mortality and health?\nZinc supplementation probably reduces deaths from lower‑respiratory‑tract infections and malaria, and probably lowers diarrhoea episodes slightly. It also probably leads to a small increase in height. Zinc makes little or no difference to overall death rates, deaths from diarrhoea, and rates of lower‑respiratory‑tract illness. However, it increases the chance of vomiting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings because there are not enough studies to be certain about many outcomes, especially long‑term effects and cause‑specific mortality.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the required style rule that all subheadings must be phrased as questions – the \"Key messages\" heading is not a question. In addition, several clarity problems could confuse readers:\n1. **Long, jargon‑heavy bullet** – \"Giving zinc tablets or syrup to children 6 months‑12 years does not clearly lower overall death (all‑cause mortality), but it probably reduces the number of diarrhoea (watery bowel movement) episodes and leads to a small increase in height.\" This mixes technical phrasing with parenthetical explanations, making the sentence hard to follow. Suggested rewrite: \"Giving zinc tablets or syrup to children aged 6 months‑12 years does not clearly reduce overall death rates, but it probably lowers the number of diarrhoea episodes and leads to a small increase in height.\"\n2. **Potentially contradictory statement** – \"Zinc supplementation probably reduces deaths of lower‑respiratory‑tract infections and malaria, and probably reduces episodes of diarrhoea slightly. It makes little or no difference to overall death rates, deaths from diarrhoea, and rates of lower‑respiratory‑tract illness.\" Readers may be confused. Clarify by separating cause‑specific and overall effects: \"Zinc probably reduces deaths caused by lower‑respiratory‑tract infections and malaria, and it probably lowers diarrhoea episodes a little. However, it makes little or no difference to overall death rates, deaths from diarrhoea, and the overall rate of lower‑respiratory‑tract illness.\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy paragraph in \"What did we find?\"** – The paragraph packs many nouns, making it dense. Break into two shorter paragraphs and use more verbs: \"We identified 96 trials that included 219,584 children, most under five years old. The studies were carried out in 34 countries, with 87 % in low‑ or middle‑income settings. Most trials gave zinc as a syrup containing zinc sulfate at a daily dose of 10–15 mg and followed participants for a median of 26 weeks. No trial examined zinc fortification, sprinkles, therapeutic zinc use, or hospitalised or chronically ill children.\"\n4. **Technical term without definition** – The phrase \"moderate‑certainty evidence\" appears in the source but is omitted in the draft, yet readers may still wonder about the certainty levels. Adding a brief definition helps: \"We have moderate‑certainty evidence (meaning we are reasonably confident, but more research could change the estimate).\"\n5. **Metric evidence** – The PLS evaluation shows unusually high noun count (194, beyond the typical P90 range) and many complex words (275 complex words, 118 long words). Reducing noun density and simplifying vocabulary will improve readability and align the draft with typical PLS patterns.\n\nTo meet the style guide, rename the \"Key messages\" heading to a question such as \"What are the key messages?\" and apply the suggested rewrites. After these changes the draft will satisfy all critical checks.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (high overall conformity) but deviates on five metrics: nouns (194, P90), dale_chall_readability (8.5, P90), complex_words_dc (275, P90), complex_words (118, P90), and long_words (171, P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex/long words, suggesting a need to simplify language and reduce noun density."
