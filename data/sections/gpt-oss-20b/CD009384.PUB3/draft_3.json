  "draft": "Does giving zinc supplements (zinc tablets or syrup) reduce death, illness, and improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years?  \n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– Giving zinc tablets or syrup to children aged 6 months‑12 years does not clearly reduce overall death rates (all‑cause mortality), but it probably lowers the number of diarrhoea episodes and leads to a small increase in height.  \n– When zinc is taken together with iron, the benefits for diarrhoea and growth become weaker.  \n– Zinc increases the chance of vomiting, so we need to weigh this harm against the benefits.  \n\nWhy is zinc deficiency a concern for children’s health?  \nMany children, especially in low‑and middle‑income countries, do not get enough zinc from food. Zinc is a mineral that helps the immune system work, protects against infections, and supports normal growth. Children who lack zinc are more likely to develop diarrhoea, lower‑respiratory‑tract infection (LRTI, e.g., pneumonia), malaria, and slower linear growth (stunted growth). These problems can lead to death (mortality) or long‑term illness (morbidity), making prevention a public‑health priority. One way to prevent deficiency is a daily zinc supplement, often given as a syrup.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about giving zinc to children?  \nWe wanted to know whether preventive zinc supplementation in healthy children aged 6 months‑12 years reduces the risk of dying from any cause, and specifically from diarrhoea, pneumonia, or malaria. We also examined whether zinc lowers the number of illness episodes, helps children grow taller, and improves blood levels of zinc and other nutrients. In short, we assessed the overall benefits and possible harms of zinc compared with no supplement or a placebo.  \n\nHow did we find and evaluate the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared preventive zinc supplementation with no zinc, placebo, or a waiting‑list control in children 6 months‑12 years old. Two reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results (meta‑analysis) and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 96 trials that included 219 584 children, most of whom were under five years old. The studies were carried out in 34 countries; 87 % were low‑or middle‑income settings. Most trials gave zinc as a syrup containing zinc sulfate at a daily dose of 10–15 mg and followed participants for a median of 26 weeks. No trial examined zinc fortification, sprinkles, therapeutic zinc use, or hospitalised or chronically ill children.  \n\nWhat are the main results on child mortality and health?  \nZinc probably reduces deaths caused by lower‑respiratory‑tract infections and malaria, and it probably lowers diarrhoea episodes a little. It also probably leads to a small increase in height. However, zinc makes little or no difference to overall death rates, deaths from diarrhoea, and the overall rate of lower‑respiratory‑tract illness. Zinc increases the chance of vomiting.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate‑certainty evidence (meaning we are reasonably confident, but more research could change the estimate) because there are not enough studies to be certain about many outcomes, especially long‑term effects and cause‑specific mortality.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to February 2022.",

Suggested rewrite: “When zinc is taken together with iron (co‑supplementation), the benefits for diarrhoea and growth become weaker.”\n2. **Long, noun‑heavy sentence in Methods** – “We searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared preventive zinc supplementation with no zinc, placebo, or a waiting‑list control in children 6 months‑12 years old.” (27 words) is dense and hard to follow. Suggested rewrite: “We searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared preventive zinc with no zinc, placebo, or a waiting‑list control in children aged 6 months to 12 years.”\n3. **Noun‑heavy, ambiguous result statement** – “Zinc probably reduces deaths caused by lower‑respiratory‑tract infections and malaria, and overall makes little or no difference to overall death rates, deaths from diarrhoea, and the overall rate of lower‑respiratory‑tract illness.” This sentence mixes several nouns and qualifiers, making the certainty unclear. Suggested rewrite: “Zinc probably lowers deaths from pneumonia and malaria, but it makes little or no difference to overall death rates, deaths from diarrhoea, or the overall rate of respiratory illness. It also slightly reduces diarrhoea episodes and modestly increases height, while increasing the chance of vomiting.”\nThese issues are supported by the PLS evaluation metrics, which show unusually high noun count (183, beyond typical P90) and a high number of complex Dale‑Chall words (256, also beyond P90), indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical Cochrane PLSs. Reducing noun density and simplifying terminology will improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most PLS patterns (overall high conformity), but two metrics deviate: nouns (183, beyond typical P90) and complex Dale‑Chall words (256, beyond typical P90). These suggest the text is unusually noun‑heavy and uses many unfamiliar words, supporting the need to simplify the language and reduce noun density."
