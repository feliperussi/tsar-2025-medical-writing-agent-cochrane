  "draft": "Does giving zinc supplements (zinc tablets or syrup) reduce death, illness, and improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years?\n\nKey messages\n– Giving zinc tablets or syrup to children 6 months‑12 years probably lowers diarrhoea episodes and adds a small amount of height, but it does not clearly lower overall death rates.  \n– When zinc is taken together with iron, the benefits for diarrhoea and growth become weaker.  \n– Zinc increases the chance of vomiting, so we need to weigh this harm against the benefits.\n\nWhy is zinc deficiency a concern for children’s health?  \nMany children, especially in low‑ and middle‑income countries, do not get enough zinc from food. Zinc is a mineral that helps the immune system work, protects against infections, and supports normal growth. Children who lack zinc are more likely to develop diarrhoea, pneumonia (a lower‑respiratory‑infection), malaria, and slower linear growth (stunted growth). These problems can lead to death (mortality, meaning how many children die) or long‑term illness (morbidity, meaning how many children get sick). Giving a daily zinc supplement, usually as a syrup containing zinc sulfate, is one way to prevent deficiency.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about giving zinc to children?  \nWe wanted to know whether preventive zinc supplements for healthy children aged 6 months‑12 years can (1) reduce the chance of dying from any cause and specifically from diarrhoea, pneumonia, or malaria; (2) lower the number of illness episodes; (3) help children grow taller; and (4) improve blood levels of zinc and other nutrients. We also looked for any harms, such as vomiting.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared zinc supplements with no supplement, placebo, or a waiting‑list control in children 6 months‑12 years. Two reviewers screened each study, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results in a meta‑analysis and used the GRADE system (a method that rates how confident we are in the evidence) to judge certainty. “Moderate‑certainty evidence” means we are fairly confident, but new research could change the result.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 96 RCTs that included 219 584 children, most of whom were under five years old. The trials were carried out in 34 countries; 87 % were in low‑ or middle‑income settings. Most studies gave zinc as a syrup containing zinc sulfate at a daily dose of 10–15 mg and followed children for a median of 26 weeks. No trial examined zinc fortification, sprinkles, therapeutic zinc use, or children who were hospitalised or chronically ill.  \n\nImpact on child mortality and health  \n– Zinc probably reduces deaths from lower‑respiratory‑infections (including pneumonia) and malaria, but the confidence intervals are wide, so the exact effect is uncertain.  \n– Zinc makes little or no difference to overall death rates, deaths from diarrhoea, or the overall rate of respiratory illness.  \n– Zinc probably lowers the number of diarrhoea episodes slightly.  \n– Zinc likely adds a small increase in height.  \n– Zinc increases the chance that a child will experience vomiting.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in the findings, but there are not enough studies to be certain about many outcomes, especially long‑term effects and cause‑specific mortality. Evidence on zinc taken together with iron is limited, and those studies suggest the benefits become weaker.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the required format check because not all subheadings are phrased as questions. Specifically, the headings \"Key messages\" and \"Impact on child mortality and health\" are statements rather than questions, which violates the style guide requirement. Additionally, a few clarity issues could confuse readers:\n1. \"Key messages\" – this heading does not tell the reader what question will be answered. Rewrite as a question such as \"What are the main findings?\".\n2. \"Impact on child mortality and health\" – this heading is noun‑heavy and does not pose a question. Rewrite as \"How does zinc affect child mortality and health?\".\n3. The sentence \"Zinc probably reduces deaths of lower‑respiratory‑infections (including pneumonia) and malaria, but the confidence intervals are wide, so the exact effect is uncertain.\" is long (27 words) and mixes technical terms without explanation. Break it up and define \"confidence intervals\" in plain language.\n4. The phrase \"moderately confident in the findings\" uses the term \"moderately confident\" without linking to the GRADE meaning. Replace with a clearer explanation for lay readers.\n5. The paragraph under \"What did we find?\" is dense; splitting into shorter paragraphs improves readability.\n\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Change heading \"Key messages\" to \"What are the main findings?\".\n- Change heading \"Impact on child mortality and health\" to \"How does zinc affect child mortality and health?\".\n- Rewrite the long sentence as: \"Zinc probably lowers deaths from lower‑respiratory‑infections (like pneumonia) and malaria. However, because the studies show a wide range of possible effects, we cannot be sure exactly how much the risk changes.\".\n- Replace \"We are moderately confident in the findings\" with \"We have moderate confidence in these results, meaning the evidence is fairly reliable but new studies could change the picture.\".\n- Insert a blank line after the paragraph ending with \"...most under the five years old.\" and start a new paragraph for the next topic.\n\nMetrics support these suggestions: the draft has a high noun count (190, P90) and many complex Dale‑Chall words (260, P90), indicating noun‑heavy, technical language. The readability scores are good (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 62.9, P75), but reducing noun density and simplifying complex words will further aid lay readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to typical patterns overall (83% of features in best quartile). However, two metrics deviate: nouns (190, P90) and complex Dale‑Chall words (260, P90), suggesting the text is noun‑heavy and uses many less‑familiar words. These deviations align with the identified clarity issues and support the recommended simplifications."
