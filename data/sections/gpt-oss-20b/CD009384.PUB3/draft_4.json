  "draft": "Does giving zinc supplements (zinc tablets or syrup) reduce death, illness, and improve growth in children aged 6 months to 12 years?\n\nKey messages\n– Giving zinc tablets or syrup to children aged 6 months‑12 years does not clearly lower overall death rates (all‑cause mortality), but it probably reduces diarrhoea episodes and leads to a small increase in height.  \n– When zinc is taken together with iron (co‑supplementation, meaning both nutrients are given at the same time), the benefits for diarrhoea and growth become weaker.  \n– Zinc increases the chance of vomiting, so we need to weigh this harm against the benefits.\n\nWhy is zinc deficiency a concern for children’s health?  \nMany children, especially in low‑ and middle‑income countries, do not get enough zinc from their diet. Zinc is a mineral that helps the immune system work, protects against infections, and supports normal growth. Children who lack zinc are more likely to develop diarrhoea, pneumonia (a type of lower‑respiratory‑tract infection), malaria, and slower linear growth (stunted growth). These problems can lead to death (mortality) or long‑term illness (morbidity), making prevention a public‑health priority. One way to prevent deficiency is a daily zinc supplement, often given as a syrup.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about giving zinc to children?  \nWe wanted to know whether preventive zinc supplementation in healthy children aged 6 months‑12 years reduces the risk of dying from any cause, and specifically from diarrhoea, pneumonia, or malaria. We also examined whether zinc lowers the number of illness episodes, helps children grow taller, and improves blood levels of zinc and other nutrients. In short, we assessed the overall benefits and possible harms of zinc compared with no supplement or a placebo.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared preventive zinc with no zinc, placebo, or a waiting‑list control in children aged 6 months to 12 years. Two reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We combined the results in a meta‑analysis and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 96 trials that included 219 584 children, most of whom were under five years old. The studies were carried out in 34 countries; 87 % were low‑ or middle‑income settings. Most trials gave zinc as a syrup containing zinc sulfate at a daily dose of 10–15 mg and followed participants for a median of 26 weeks. No trial examined zinc fortification, sprinkles, therapeutic zinc use, or hospitalised or chronically ill children.\n\nWhat are the main results on child mortality and health?  \nZinc probably lowers deaths from pneumonia and malaria, but it makes little or no difference to overall death rates, deaths from diarrhoea, or the overall rate of respiratory illness. Zinc probably reduces diarrhoea episodes slightly and leads to a modest increase in height. However, zinc also increases the chance of vomiting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have moderate‑certainty evidence, meaning we are reasonably confident but more research could change the estimates. There are not enough studies to be certain about many outcomes, especially long‑term effects and cause‑specific mortality.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies searched up to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check for a patient audience. 1) Several technical terms are used without plain explanations – “preventive zinc supplementation”, “meta‑analysis”, and the “GRADE approach” – which can leave readers confused. 2) The sentence “Zinc probably lowers deaths from pneumonia and malaria, but it makes little or no difference to overall death rates, deaths from diarrhoea, or the overall rate of respiratory illness.” packs multiple ideas and may be interpreted as contradictory; it should be split and the relationship explained. 3) The text is noun‑heavy (185 nouns, P90) and contains many complex words (255 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words, P90), making it harder to read. Re‑phrasing to use more verbs and everyday vocabulary will improve readability. Suggested rewrites: • Define meta‑analysis and GRADE in plain language (e.g., “We combined the results from all studies, a method called a meta‑analysis, and judged how confident we are using a system called GRADE.”). • Replace “preventive zinc supplementation” with “taking zinc supplements to prevent deficiency”. • Split the long sentence into two: “Zinc probably reduces deaths from pneumonia and malaria. However, it does not change the overall number of deaths, nor does it affect deaths from diarrhoea or the overall rate of respiratory illness.” These changes address the major clarity issues while keeping the content accurate and within the word limit.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (83% of features in best quartile). However, two metrics deviate: nouns (185, P90) and complex_words_dc (255, P90), indicating excessive noun density and many unfamiliar words. These metric signals support the editorial recommendation to simplify language and reduce noun‑heavy phrasing."
