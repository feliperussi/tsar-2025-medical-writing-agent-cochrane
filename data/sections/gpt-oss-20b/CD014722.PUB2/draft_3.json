  "draft": "Do primary health workers (clinic staff) and community health workers (local volunteers) prevent mental illness and improve well‑being in low‑ and middle‑income countries?\n\nKey messages\n– When primary‑level or community workers deliver mental‑health prevention programmes, people experience small improvements in anxiety, stress‑related symptoms, depression and overall quality of life, and may find daily activities easier.  \n– No harmful effects were reported, but the studies were few and had methodological weaknesses, so our confidence in these modest benefits is limited.  \n the studies were few and had methodological weaknesses, so our confidence in these modest benefits is limited.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up are needed to confirm the benefits and to explore any possible harms.\n\nWhy is mental health a concern in low‑ and middle‑income countries?  \nMany people in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) experience stress, anxiety, depression or other mental‑health problems, yet they often cannot reach professional services. There are not enough trained doctors or psychologists, resources are unevenly distributed, and stigma – the fear of being judged for having a mental‑health issue – can stop people from seeking help. Because of these barriers, preventing mental disorders and promoting well‑being before problems become severe is especially important.\n\nWhat are primary‑level and community‑worker interventions?  \nPrimary‑level workers are health staff who work in basic health centres, such as nurses or general practitioners. Community workers are local volunteers, teachers or lay health aides who receive training to deliver health programmes. Using these workers to deliver mental‑health programmes is called “task‑shifting” – moving tasks from scarce specialists to a broader workforce. This approach can help reach more people with preventive support and early treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several databases for randomized controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to groups) of primary‑level or community‑worker mental‑health promotion or prevention programmes in LMICs. We pooled the results and checked how reliable each study was and how confident we are in the results using standard quality‑assessment tools (risk‑of‑bias and GRADE criteria).\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 113 studies that together involved 32 992 participants. The trials were carried out in low‑, lower‑middle‑, upper‑middle‑ and mixed‑income settings and included both adults (83 studies) and children (30 studies). Primary‑level workers delivered the programmes in 38 studies, community workers in 71 studies, both types in 2 studies, and the provider was not reported in 2 studies. The programmes were classified as:\n\n– universal promotion (offered to everyone, 22 studies)  \n– selective prevention (targeting people who are at higher risk, 36 studies)  \n– indicated prevention (targeting people who already show early signs of a disorder, 55 studies)\n\nThe programmes were usually compared with usual care and were evaluated at three time‑frames: 0‑1 month, 1‑6 months and 7‑24 months after the intervention.\n\nWhat are the main results?  \nAdults  \n– Universal promotion probably reduced anxiety a little (moderate confidence).  \n– Universal promotion may have reduced distress or PTSD symptoms slightly (low confidence).  \n– Selective prevention probably reduced depressive symptoms a little (moderate confidence).  \n– Indicated prevention probably reduced functional impairment (difficulty with daily activities) a little (moderate confidence).  \n\nChildren  \n– Universal promotion may improve quality of life slightly (low confidence).  \n– Universal promotion may reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms a little (low confidence).  \n– Selective prevention probably reduced depressive symptoms a little (moderate confidence).  \n– Indicated prevention may reduce functional impairment slightly (low confidence).  \n\nNo study reported any harmful effects.\n\nHow sure are we about these findings?  \nWhen we say the evidence “probably” shows an effect, we have moderate confidence that the effect is real. When we say it “may” show an effect, our confidence is lower and the evidence is less certain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany studies did not blind participants to their group, some did not report all outcomes we wanted, and the studies varied in the people they included and how the programmes were delivered. These issues reduce our confidence in the size of the benefits.\n\nHow up to date is this review?  \nWe searched the literature up to November 2021, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat does this mean for future research?  \nFuture work should include larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up to confirm the benefits, check for any possible harms and identify the most effective ways to implement worker‑delivered interventions in different settings.",

Three major problems were identified:\n1. **Duplicate/unfinished bullet in Key Messages** – the line \"the studies were few and had methodological weaknesses, so our confidence in these modest benefits is limited.\" appears twice, once without a leading dash, creating confusion. Suggested rewrite: combine into a single bullet – \"- No harmful effects were reported, but the studies were few and had methodological weaknesses, so our confidence in these modest benefits is limited.\"\n2. **Excessive passive voice** – sentences such as \"The programmes were usually compared with usual care and were evaluated at three time‑frames...\" and \"The trials were carried out in low‑, lower‑middle‑, upper‑middle‑ and mixed‑income settings...\" hide who performed the actions, making the text harder for readers to follow. Rewrite actively, e.g., \"We usually compared the programmes with usual care and evaluated them at three time‑frames...\" and \"Researchers carried out the trials in low‑, lower‑middle‑, upper‑middle‑ and mixed‑income settings...\"\n3. **Unexplained technical terms** – terms like \"risk‑of‑bias\" and \"GRADE criteria\" appear without plain‑language definitions, leaving lay readers uncertain about their meaning. Add brief explanations, e.g., \"risk‑of‑bias (how likely a study’s results are affected by problems in how it was done)\" and \"GRADE criteria (a system we use to judge how confident we can be in the evidence)\".\nThese issues are supported by the metric report, which shows a high passive‑voice count (21, P90), a very high nominalisation count (39, BEYOND_P90) and a large number of complex/long words (SMOG 15.9, BEYOND_P90). Reducing passive constructions, nominalisations, and simplifying vocabulary will improve readability and bring the draft into better conformity with typical PLS patterns.",
