  "draft": "Do primary health workers (clinic staff) and community health workers (local volunteers) prevent mental illness and improve well‑being in low‑ and middle‑income countries?\n\n- Primary health workers (clinic staff) and community health workers (local volunteers) delivering mental‑health prevention programmes in low‑ and middle‑income countries can lead to small improvements in anxiety, stress‑related symptoms, depression and overall well‑being (quality of life), and may reduce difficulties in daily activities (functional impairment); no harmful effects were reported.\n- The evidence comes from a relatively small number of studies, many of which had methodological limitations, so confidence in these modest benefits is limited.\n- Future research should include larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up to confirm benefits, investigate any possible harms, and identify the most effective ways to implement worker‑delivered interventions in different settings.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is mental health a concern in low‑ and middle‑income countries?\nMany people living in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) experience stress, anxiety, depression, or other mental health problems, but they often have limited access to professional mental‑health services. There are not enough trained doctors or psychologists, resources are unevenly distributed, and stigma – the fear of being judged for having a mental health issue – can stop people from seeking help. Because of these barriers, preventing mental disorders and promoting well‑being before problems become severe is especially important in these settings.\n\nWhat are primary‑level and community‑worker interventions?\nPrimary‑level workers are health staff who work in basic health centres (for example, nurses or general practitioners). Community workers are people from the local community who receive training to deliver health programmes, such as teachers, volunteers, or lay health aides. Using these workers to deliver mental‑health programmes is called \"task‑shifting\" – moving some tasks from scarce specialists to a broader workforce. This approach could help reach more people with preventive support and early treatment for mental health issues.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether interventions delivered by primary‑level or community workers can improve mental health and prevent mental disorders in LMICs. Specifically, they examined: (1) how effective these programmes are for promoting overall mental well‑being and for preventing mental illness in the general population (universal prevention), in groups at higher risk (selective prevention), or in people showing early signs of a disorder (indicated prevention); and (2) whether delivering these programmes affects the use of health resources or costs. In short, the review sought evidence on the benefits and practicality of using locally available workers to support mental health in low‑resource settings.\n\n**Methods**\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomized controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to groups) of primary‑level or community‑worker mental‑health promotion or prevention interventions in low‑ and middle‑income countries, pooled their results, and assessed our confidence in the evidence using risk‑of‑bias and GRADE criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review covered 113 studies that together involved 32,992 participants from low- and middle-income countries. The trials were spread across different income settings: 19 were done in low-income nations, 27 in low-middle-income nations, 2 in middle-income nations, 58 in upper-middle-income nations and 7 in mixed settings. Both adults (83 studies) and children (30 studies) took part. The mental-health programmes were delivered by primary-level workers – 38 studies used primary-care health workers, 71 used community workers, 2 used both, and 2 did not report who delivered the intervention. The interventions were classified as universal prevention/promotion (22 studies), selective prevention (36 studies) and indicated prevention (55 studies) and were usually compared with usual care. Follow-up assessments were reported at three time-frames: 0-1 month, 1-6 months and 7-24 months after the intervention.\n\nMain results: Selective prevention probably reduces depressive symptoms in adults\nUsing primary-level workers to deliver selective mental-health prevention programmes probably reduces depressive symptoms in adults, although the reduction is likely to be small.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2021 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is required by the Master Style Guide. In addition, the first bullet point is overly long and dense, making it hard for readers to grasp the key messages. A few sentences use passive voice and noun‑heavy phrasing, contributing to the high nominalisation and noun counts flagged by the PLS evaluation (31 nominalisations, 236 nouns – both beyond the P90 range). These issues reduce clarity for a lay audience.\n\n**Top improvements needed:**\n1. **Subheading format** – Change non‑question headings to questions:\n   - Current: \"Main results: Selective prevention probably reduces depressive symptoms in adults\"\n   - Rewrite: \"What are the main results for selective prevention in adults?\"\n   - Current: \"Limitations\"\n   - Rewrite: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n   - Current: \"Currency\"\n   - Rewrite: \"How up to date is this review?\"\n2. **Overly long bullet point** – Break the first bullet into shorter, clearer points:\n   - Current: \"Primary health workers (clinic staff) and community health workers (local volunteers) delivering mental‑health prevention programmes in low‑and middle‑income countries can lead to small improvements in anxiety, stress‑related symptoms, depression and overall well‑being (quality of life), and may reduce difficulties in daily activities (functional impairment); no harmful effects were reported.\"\n   - Rewrite: \"- Primary health workers and community health workers delivering mental‑health prevention programmes can lead to small improvements in:\\n  • anxiety,\\n  • stress‑related symptoms,\\n  • depression,\\n  • overall well‑being (quality of life).\\n- They may also reduce difficulties in daily activities (functional impairment).\\n- No harmful effects were reported.\"\n3. **Passive voice** – Re‑write passive constructions in active voice:\n   - Current: \"The evidence is up to date to November 2021 of search.\"\n   - Rewrite: \"We searched the literature up to November 2021, so the evidence is current to that date.\"\n4. **Nominalisation and noun‑heavy sentences** – Replace noun forms with verbs to lower the noun count and improve readability:\n   - Current: \"The review covered 113 studies that together involved 32,992 participants...\"\n   - Rewrite: \"We included 113 studies with a total of 32,992 participants...\"\n5. **Jargon clarification** – Although \"task‑shifting\" is defined, reinforce the meaning in plain language for readers who may miss it:\n   - Add a brief parenthetical after the term: \"task‑shifting (moving tasks from scarce specialists to trained community workers)\".\n\n**Metric support:** The PLS evaluation shows 31 nominalisations and 236 nouns (both beyond the P90 threshold), a SMOG index of 15.45 and a Dale‑Chall score of 8.78, indicating higher than typical complexity.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (738 words) and scores around the median for most readability indices (e.g., Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 45.2, FKGL 12.9). However, it deviates markedly on several complexity metrics: nominalisation (31, beyond P90), noun count (236, beyond P90), SMOG (15.4, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall (8.78, beyond P90), and counts of complex and long words. These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses more complex vocabulary than typical Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
