  "draft": "Do primary health workers (clinic staff) and community health workers (local volunteers) prevent mental illness and improve well‑being in low‑ and middle‑income countries?\n\nKey messages\n– Primary health workers and community health workers who deliver mental‑health prevention programmes can produce small improvements in anxiety, stress‑related symptoms, depression and overall well‑being (quality of life).  \n– These programmes may also lessen difficulties in daily activities (functional impairment).  \n– No harmful effects were reported, but the evidence comes from a limited number of studies with methodological weaknesses, so confidence in the benefits is modest.\n\nWhy is mental health a concern in low‑ and middle‑income countries?  \nMany people in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) experience stress, anxiety, depression or other mental health problems, yet they often cannot reach professional mental‑health services. There are too few trained doctors or psychologists, resources are unevenly distributed, and stigma – the fear of being judged for having a mental health issue – can stop people from seeking help. Because of these barriers, preventing mental disorders and promoting well‑being before problems become severe is especially important.\n\nWhat are primary‑level and community‑worker interventions?  \nPrimary‑level workers are health staff who work in basic health centres, such as nurses or general practitioners. Community workers are local volunteers, teachers or lay health aides who receive training to deliver health programmes. Using these workers to deliver mental‑health programmes is called task‑shifting (moving tasks from scarce specialists to trained community workers). This approach can help reach more people with preventive support and early treatment.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched multiple databases for randomized controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to groups) of primary‑level or community‑worker mental‑health promotion or prevention programmes in LMICs. We pooled the results and judged our confidence in the evidence using risk‑of‑bias and GRADE criteria.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included 113 studies with a total of 32,992 participants. The trials were conducted in low‑, lower‑middle‑, upper‑middle‑ and mixed‑income settings and involved both adults (83 studies) and children (30 studies). Primary‑level workers delivered the interventions in 38 studies, community workers in 71 studies, both types in 2 studies, and the provider was not reported in 2 studies. The programmes were classified as universal prevention/promotion (22 studies), selective prevention (36 studies) or indicated prevention (55 studies) and were usually compared with usual care. Follow‑up assessments were reported at 0‑1 month, 1‑6 months and 7‑24 months after the intervention.\n\nWhat are the main results for selective prevention in adults?  \nWhen primary‑level workers delivered selective mental‑health prevention programmes, we observed a small reduction in depressive symptoms among adults. The effect was modest but suggests that these programmes can help lower depression levels.\n\nWhat are the main results for other outcomes?  \n– For universal promotion in adults, the programmes probably reduced anxiety slightly and may have reduced distress or PTSD symptoms a little.  \n– In children, the programmes may improve quality of life and may slightly reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n– Across age groups, the interventions may also reduce functional impairment (difficulties in daily activities).  \nNo harmful effects were reported in any study.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because many studies did not blind participants to their group, some did not report all outcomes we wanted, and the studies varied in populations and delivery methods. These factors increase uncertainty about the true size of the benefits.\n\nHow up to date is this review?  \nWe searched the literature up to November 2021, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\n\nWhat does this mean for future research?  \nFuture work should involve larger, well‑designed trials with longer follow‑up to confirm the benefits, check for any possible harms and identify the most effective ways to implement worker‑delivered interventions in different settings.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the checklist (all required sections, question‑style headings, factual accuracy, word‑count < 850) but contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained technical terms** – \"risk‑of‑bias and GRADE criteria\" appear in the Methods section without any plain‑language explanation. Readers may not understand what these mean.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We checked how reliable each study was and how confident we are in the results using standard quality‑assessment tools.\"\n2. **Unclear certainty language** – The results use words like \"probably\" and \"may\" to describe the strength of the evidence, but the meaning of these terms is not explained for a non‑expert audience.\n   *Rewrite:* \"When we say the evidence ‘probably’ shows an effect, it means we have moderate confidence that the effect is real; ‘may’ means the evidence is weaker and we are less certain.\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy, complex sentences** – Several sentences are dense with nouns and long words, contributing to high noun (210) and complex‑word counts (e.g., 155 complex words, 217 long words). This makes the text harder to read despite a decent Flesch‑Reading Ease score.\n   *Example problematic sentence:* \"When primary‑level workers delivered selective mental‑health prevention programmes, we observed a small reduction in depressive symptoms among adults.\"\n   *Rewrite:* \"When primary‑level workers ran selective prevention programmes, adults showed a small drop in depressive symptoms.\"\n4. **Missing brief definitions for key concepts** – Terms such as \"selective prevention\" and \"universal promotion\" are used without a short lay definition, leaving readers unsure what groups these refer to.\n   *Add after first use:* \"(selective prevention means targeting people who are at higher risk, while universal promotion is offered to everyone).\"\nThese issues are supported by the metric analysis, which shows unusually high counts of nouns, complex words, long words and nominalisations (e.g., 210 nouns, 155 complex words, 217 long words, 25 nominalisations), indicating the text is more noun‑heavy than typical PLSs. Addressing the points above will bring the draft into line with Cochrane plain‑language standards. Overall, while the structure and factual content are correct, the identified clarity problems are significant enough to require revision before the summary can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits (645 words) and has good sentence length (17.4 words per sentence, FK‑grade 10). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in noun density (210 nouns, beyond P90), complex‑word count (155, beyond P90), long‑word count (217, beyond P90), and nominalisations (25, beyond P90). These metrics confirm the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than usual, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce nominalisations."
