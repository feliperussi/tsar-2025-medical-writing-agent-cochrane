  "draft": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalized brain training) effective for helping people with mild to moderate dementia manage everyday activities?\n\n- Cognitive rehabilitation (personalized brain training) appears to help people with mild to moderate dementia improve their ability to carry out everyday activities (daily tasks such as dressing, cooking, and managing money) that are targeted in the training, with participants reporting they achieve their goals and feel satisfied.\n- The training may also give modest gains in confidence (self‑efficacy) and short‑term memory, while some studies noted small declines in overall functional ability (overall ability to perform daily tasks), memory, or anxiety; overall, no serious harmful effects were reported.\n- More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, explore long‑term effects, and understand how the training influences broader aspects of daily life and wellbeing for both people with dementia and their care partners.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?\nDementia is a condition that gradually harms memory, thinking and the ability to plan or carry out everyday tasks. When the disease is in its mild or moderate stage, people often still live at home but may struggle with simple activities such as cooking, managing money, or remembering appointments. These difficulties can reduce independence and increase the need for support from family members or professional caregivers. While medicines are sometimes used to try to slow the brain changes, they do not usually restore the lost ability to perform daily tasks. Because of this, non‑drug approaches that answer the practical problems of daily life are needed. One such approach is cognitive rehabilitation (CR) – a personalised, goal‑focused programme that helps a person with dementia practice and develop strategies for the specific activities they find most important, with the aim of keeping them as independent as possible.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about cognitive rehabilitation?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether CR really helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia do the everyday activities they target, and whether it also benefits other areas such as confidence, memory, attention, mood and quality of life. They also looked at whether CR has any effect—positive or negative—on the wellbeing of the people who care for them (the \"care partners\"). Finally, they sought to explore which factors (for example, the type of dementia, the length of the programme, or how it is delivered) might influence how well CR works.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that examined cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia (mainly randomised controlled trials, which randomly assign participants to groups). We pooled their results in random‑effects meta‑analyses and assessed confidence in the evidence using GRADE.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,702 people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia. Participants were on average 76–80 years old; the proportion of men ranged from about 29 % to 79 % across the studies. Most of those whose specific diagnosis was reported had Alzheimer’s disease (about 58 % of the total sample, representing 81 % of the diagnosed subgroup). All trials compared a personalised cognitive‑rehabilitation programme with an inactive control such as usual care. Outcomes were measured for both the people with dementia and their care partners, and assessments were made at medium‑term follow‑up (3–12 months). The abstract does not give details about the length of the intervention, the countries where the trials were conducted, or the sources of funding.\n\nMain results: Goal achievement\nCognitive rehabilitation led to a large increase in the number of people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia who achieved the everyday goals they set for themselves. Caregivers also reported a large increase in the participants’ goal achievement. In addition, participants reported a large increase in their satisfaction with how well they met their goals.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the required subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide (5.3). In addition, several clarity issues would confuse readers:\n1. Long, dense bullet‑point sentence – \"Cognitive rehabilitation (personalized brain training) appears to help people … with participants reporting they achieve their goals and feel satisfied.\" – combines multiple ideas and uses parentheses, making it hard to follow.\n2. Another long bullet uses a semicolon and mixes positive and negative effects – \"The training may also give modest gains … while some studies noted small declines …; overall, no serious harmful effects were reported.\" – the contrast is buried in a single sentence.\n3. Passive‑voice heavy sentence in the Limitations section – \"We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small…\" – the phrase \"were aware of which treatment they were getting\" is passive and obscures who did what.\n4. Noun‑heavy phrasing in the Results paragraph – \"Cognitive rehabilitation led to a large increase in the number of people … who achieved the everyday goals they set for themselves.\" – the sentence could be more active and verb‑focused.\n5. Lack of paragraph breaks after the bullet list and before each new subheading reduces white‑space, making the text appear as a wall of text.\nSuggested rewrites:\n- Change subheadings to questions, e.g., \"Why is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?\", \"What did the researchers aim to discover about cognitive rehabilitation?\", \"How did we find the evidence?\", \"What did we find?\", \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\", \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n- Rewrite bullet 1: \"Cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia do everyday tasks such as dressing, cooking and managing money. Participants said they reached their goals and felt satisfied with the training.\"\n- Rewrite bullet 2: \"The training gave modest gains in confidence and short‑term memory. Some studies reported small declines in overall functional ability, memory or anxiety, but no serious harms were found.\"\n- Rewrite the Limitations sentence in active voice: \"We are moderately confident in the evidence, but participants knew which treatment they received and the studies were small, so the results are less certain.\"\n- Simplify the Results sentence: \"People who received cognitive rehabilitation were much more likely to achieve the everyday goals they set, and caregivers noticed the same improvement.\"\n- Insert a blank line before each new subheading and after the bullet list to improve readability.\nThese changes address the most critical clarity and style problems and bring the draft into line with the style guide. The PLS evaluation also shows high nominalisation (25, beyond P90), excessive nouns (190, beyond P90), and elevated readability scores (SMOG 15.1, complex words 155, long words 225) indicating the text is more complex than typical PLS. Reducing nominalisations, nouns and long words as suggested will improve those metrics.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: nominalisation (25, beyond P90), noun count (190, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.1, beyond P90), complex words (155, beyond P90) and long words (225, beyond P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than usual PLS, supporting the need to simplify language, reduce nominalisations and shorten sentences."
