  "draft": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalized brain training) effective for helping people with mild to moderate dementia manage everyday activities?\n\nKey messages\n- Cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia improve everyday tasks such as dressing, cooking and managing money; participants say they reach their goals and feel satisfied.\n- The training gives modest gains in confidence (self‑efficacy) and short‑term memory, while some studies show small declines in overall functional ability, memory or anxiety; no serious harms were reported.\n- More large, well‑designed studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore long‑term effects for people with dementia and their care partners.\n\nWhy is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?\nDementia gradually‑impairs memory, thinking and planning, making everyday tasks harder. Even in the mild or moderate stage, many people still live at home but may struggle with simple activities such as cooking, managing money or remembering appointments. These difficulties reduce independence and increase reliance on family or professional caregivers. Medicines may slow brain changes but do not restore lost abilities, so non‑drug approaches that address practical problems are needed. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalised, goal‑focused programme that helps a person with dementia practice strategies for the activities they find most important, aiming to keep them as independent as possible.\n\nWhat did the researchers aim to discover about cognitive rehabilitation?\nWe wanted to know whether CR helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia perform the everyday activities they target, and whether it also improves confidence, memory, attention, mood or quality of life. We also examined whether CR affects the wellbeing of the people who care for them (care partners) and explored factors such as dementia type, programme length or delivery method that might influence effectiveness.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register for randomised controlled trials that compared CR with usual care or another inactive control. We pooled the results using random‑effects meta‑analyses and assessed confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified six randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,702 people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia. Participants were on average 76–80 years old; the proportion of men ranged from 29 % to 79 %. Most participants with a reported diagnosis had Alzheimer’s disease (about 59 % of the total sample). All trials compared a personalised CR programme with an inactive control such as usual care and measured outcomes for both people with dementia and their care partners at 3–12 months follow‑up.\n\nCognitive rehabilitation led to a large increase in the number of people who achieved the everyday goals they set. Caregivers also reported a large increase in participants’ goal achievement, and participants reported a large increase in satisfaction with how well they met their goals.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence, but participants knew which treatment they received and the studies were small, so the results are less certain.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence is current to October 2022.",
