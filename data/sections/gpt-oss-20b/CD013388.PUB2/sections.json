  "plain_title": "Is cognitive rehabilitation (personalized brain training) effective for helping people with mild to moderate dementia manage everyday activities?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Cognitive rehabilitation (personalized brain training) appears to help people with mild to moderate dementia improve their ability to carry out everyday activities (daily tasks such as dressing, cooking, and managing money) that are targeted in the training, with participants reporting they achieve their goals and feel satisfied.",
    "The training may also give modest gains in confidence (self‑efficacy) and short‑term memory, while some studies noted small declines in overall functional ability (overall ability to perform daily tasks), memory, or anxiety; overall, no serious harmful effects were reported.",
    "More well‑designed, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, explore long‑term effects, and understand how the training influences broader aspects of daily life and wellbeing for both people with dementia and their care partners."

      "subheading": "Why is everyday functioning a challenge for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia?",
      "content": "Dementia is a condition that gradually harms memory, thinking and the ability to plan or carry out everyday tasks. When the disease is in its mild or moderate stage, people often still live at home but may struggle with simple activities such as cooking, managing money, or remembering appointments. These difficulties can reduce independence and increase the need for support from family members or professional caregivers. While medicines are sometimes used to try to slow the brain changes, they do not usually restore the lost ability to perform daily tasks. Because of this, non‑drug approaches that answer the practical problems of daily life are needed. One such approach is cognitive rehabilitation (CR) – a personalised, goal‑focused programme that helps a person with dementia practice and develop strategies for the specific activities they find most important, with the aim of keeping them as independent as possible."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the researchers aim to discover about cognitive rehabilitation?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out whether CR really helps people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia do the everyday activities they target, and whether it also benefits other areas such as confidence, memory, attention, mood and quality of life. They also looked at whether CR has any effect—positive or negative—on the wellbeing of the people who care for them (the \"care partners\"). Finally, they sought to explore which factors (for example, the type of dementia, the length of the programme, or how it is delivered) might influence how well CR works."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that examined cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia (mainly randomised controlled trials, which randomly assign participants to groups). We pooled their results in random‑effects meta‑analyses and assessed confidence in the evidence using GRADE."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified six randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,702 people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia. Participants were on average 76–80 years old; the proportion of men ranged from about 29 % to 79 % across the studies. Most of those whose specific diagnosis was reported had Alzheimer’s disease (about 58 % of the total sample, representing 81 % of the diagnosed subgroup). All trials compared a personalised cognitive‑rehabilitation programme with an inactive control such as usual care. Outcomes were measured for both the people with dementia and their care partners, and assessments were made at medium‑term follow‑up (3–12 months). The abstract does not give details about the length of the intervention, the countries where the trials were conducted, or the sources of funding."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Goal achievement",
      "content": "Cognitive rehabilitation led to a large increase in the number of people with mild‑to‑moderate dementia who achieved the everyday goals they set for themselves. Caregivers also reported a large increase in the participants’ goal achievement. In addition, participants reported a large increase in their satisfaction with how well they met their goals."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to October 2022 of search."
