  "draft": "Is temporary blockage of blood flow to a distant part of the body (remote ischaemic preconditioning) beneficial compared with no blockage for people undergoing major blood‑vessel surgery?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), a brief, harmless blockage of blood flow to an arm or leg, probably does not change the risk of death around the time of surgery.  \n– It also appears to have little or no effect on heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, loss of a limb, length of hospital stay, or the time the operation takes.  \n– We judged the 14 included trials to be of moderate quality, so small benefits or harms cannot be completely ruled out.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to confirm whether RIPC offers any real advantage for patients undergoing major vascular or endovascular surgery.\n\nWhat health problems are associated with major vascular and endovascular surgery?  \nPeople who need major operations on large blood vessels – such as repair of an aortic aneurysm or opening blocked arteries – face serious complications. Even with modern care, they can experience death (mortality) or major health problems after the operation. Common complications include heart attacks (damage to the heart muscle), kidney problems (when the kidneys do not work well), strokes (brain damage from interrupted blood flow), loss of a limb, and longer stays in hospital.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why might it help?  \nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where we briefly stop blood flow to a part of the body that is not being operated on, using a blood‑pressure cuff on an arm or leg. This short, controlled blockage is thought to “train” the body’s cells to survive longer periods of reduced blood flow (ischaemia) that can occur during surgery. In simple terms, it gives the body a tiny stress so that it can protect its organs when a bigger stress happens during the operation.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nWe set out to discover whether using RIPC before elective (planned) major vascular or endovascular surgery makes a difference compared with not using it. Specifically, we wanted to know if RIPC reduces the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, loss of a limb, length of hospital stay, and the time needed for the operation or anaesthesia. We also looked for any harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 1 April 2022. We included randomised controlled trials that compared RIPC with no preconditioning in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. We extracted data on trial characteristics, the RIPC stimulus, and outcomes such as mortality, heart attack, kidney impairment, stroke, limb loss, hospital stay and operating time. We combined the results using random‑effects models and rated our confidence in the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 14 trials that together enrolled 1,295 participants (age range 64.5 to 76 years; 84 % men). All trials compared a short, reversible interruption of blood flow to a limb with no preconditioning. The pooled results suggest that RIPC probably makes little or no difference to any of the main outcomes after surgery. It did not clearly change the risk of peri‑operative death, heart attack, kidney impairment, stroke, or limb loss. It also did not affect the length of hospital stay or the time needed for the operation or anaesthesia.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in these findings because the number of studies is limited, the participants and RIPC methods varied, and the available data may over‑estimate benefits due to the small number of trials. This uncertainty means that small benefits or harms cannot be ruled out.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to April 2022.",

Patients are unlikely to know what these terms mean, which reduces understanding.\n   - *Quote*: \"We combined the results using random‑effects models and rated our confidence in the evidence with GRADE.\"\n   - *Rewrite*: \"We combined the results using a statistical method that looks at differences between studies, and we assessed how sure we are about the evidence using a standard grading system (GRADE) that rates confidence as low, moderate, or high.\"\n2. **Long, complex sentence about confidence** – The sentence in the Limitations section is 34 words and packs three reasons together, making it hard to follow.\n   - *Quote*: \"We are moderately confident in these findings because the number of studies is limited, the participants and RIPC methods varied, and the available data may over‑estimate benefits due to the small number of trials.\"\n   - *Rewrite*: \"We are moderately confident in these findings. This is because only a few studies were available, the participants and the way RIPC was given differed between studies, and the small number of trials might make the benefits look larger than they really are.\"\n3. **Undefined term \"peri‑operative\"** – The Results section uses \"peri‑operative death\" without defining the term, which may be unfamiliar to patients.\n   - *Quote*: \"It did not clearly change the risk of peri‑operative death, heart attack, kidney impairment, stroke, or limb loss.\"\n   - *Rewrite*: \"It did not clearly change the risk of death around the time of surgery (peri‑operative death), heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, or loss of a limb.\"\n4. **High passive‑voice usage** – The evaluation shows 19 passive constructions (P90), which can obscure who performed the actions and make the text feel less direct.\n   - *Example*: \"The number of studies is limited\" (passive‑style phrasing).\n   - *Rewrite*: Change to active voice where possible, e.g., \"Only a few studies were available.\"\n5. **Bullet point about trial quality is vague** – The key‑message bullet mixes assessment of quality with uncertainty, which could be clearer.\n   - *Quote*: \"We judged the 14 included trials to be of moderate quality, so small benefits or harms cannot be completely ruled out.\"\n   - *Rewrite*: \"The 14 trials were of moderate quality, meaning we cannot completely rule out small benefits or harms.\"\nThese issues together exceed the allowed number of significant clarity problems, so the PLS cannot be approved in its current form.\n\nAdditionally, the PLS evaluation metrics support these observations: the draft has a high passive‑voice count (19, beyond the typical P90 range) and elevated complexity metrics (smog index 14, complex words 124, long words 172), indicating the text is more complex than typical Cochrane PLSs. Reducing passive constructions and simplifying vocabulary will improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS meets word‑count limits and most readability indices (FKG 10.9, FRE 53.6) are within the better quartile, but six metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: passive_voice (19, P90), nouns (201, P90), smog_index (14, P90), complex_words_dc (263, P90), complex_words (124, P90), and long_words (172, P90). These suggest the draft is more noun‑heavy and uses many complex/long words, contributing to higher reading difficulty despite overall acceptable grade‑level scores."
