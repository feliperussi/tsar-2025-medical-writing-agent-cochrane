  "draft": "\"Is temporary blockage of blood flow to a distant part of the body (remote ischaemic preconditioning) beneficial compared with no blockage for people undergoing major blood‑vessel surgery?\\n\\nKey messages  \\n– Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), a brief, harmless blockage of blood flow to an arm or leg, probably does not change the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, loss of a limb, length of hospital stay, or the time the operation takes.  \\n– The 14 studies we examined were randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to receive the treatment or not) of moderate quality, so we cannot completely rule out small benefits or harms.  \\n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to find out whether RIPC offers any real advantage for patients having major vascular or endovascular surgery.\\n\\nWhat health problems are associated with major vascular and endovascular surgery?  \\nPeople who need major operations on large blood vessels – such as repairing an aortic aneurysm or opening blocked arteries – face serious complications. Even with modern care, they can experience death (mortality) or major health problems after the operation. Common complications include heart‑muscle damage (heart attack), kidney problems (when the kidneys do not work well), brain damage from interrupted blood flow (stroke), loss of a limb, and longer stays in hospital.\\n\\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why might it help?  \\nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where we briefly stop blood flow to a part of the body that is not being operated on, using a blood‑pressure cuff on an arm or leg. This short, controlled blockage is thought to “train” the body’s cells to survive longer periods of reduced blood flow (ischaemia) that can occur during surgery. In simple terms, it gives the body a tiny stress so that it can protect its organs when a bigger stress happens during the operation.\\n\\nWhat did we want to find out?  \\nWe set out to discover whether using RIPC before elective (planned) major vascular or endovascular surgery makes a difference compared with not using it. Specifically, we wanted to know if RIPC reduces the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, loss of a limb, length of hospital stay, and the time needed for the operation or anaesthesia. We also looked for any harms.\\n\\nHow did we find the evidence?  \\nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared RIPC with no preconditioning in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. We combined the results using a statistical method that looks at differences between studies, and we rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE system (a standard way of judging how sure we can be about the results).\\n\\nWhat did we find?  \\nWe identified 14 trials that together enrolled 1,295 participants (average age 64.5–76 years; 84 % men). All trials compared a short, reversible interruption of blood flow to a limb with no preconditioning. The pooled results suggest that RIPC probably makes little or no difference to any of the main outcomes after surgery. It did not clearly change the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, or loss of a limb. It also did not affect how long people stayed in hospital or how long the operation or anaesthetic took.\\n\\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \\nWe are moderately confident in these findings because only a few studies were available, the participants and the way RIPC was given differed between studies, and the small number of trials might make the benefits look larger than they really are.\\n\\nHow current is the evidence?  \\nThis review updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to April 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural and factual requirements, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse patients. The most important issues are:\n1. **Over‑long, dense sentences** – e.g., \"Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), a brief, harmless blockage of blood flow to an arm or leg, probably does not change the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, loss of a limb, length of hospital stay, or the time the operation takes.\" This 38‑word sentence bundles many outcomes, making it hard to follow. *Rewrite*: \"Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a short, harmless blockage of blood flow to an arm or leg. It probably does not change the risk of death, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, loss of a limb, how long you stay in hospital, or how long the operation takes.\"\n2. **Jargon without plain‑language equivalents** – terms such as \"peri‑operative mortality\", \"myocardial infarction\", \"renal impairment\", and \"ischaemia\" appear without simple explanations in the same paragraph. Patients may not understand them. *Rewrite*: replace with everyday words and add brief definitions, e.g., \"death around the time of surgery (peri‑operative mortality)\" → \"death around the time of surgery\"; \"myocardial infarction (heart attack)\" → \"heart attack (damage to the heart muscle)\"; \"renal impairment (kidney problems)\" → \"kidney problems\"; \"ischaemia (reduced blood flow)\" → \"reduced blood flow\".\n3. **Passive‑voice heavy sections** – the evaluation shows 19 passive constructions (P90). Example: \"The pooled results suggest that RIPC probably makes little or no difference to any of the main outcomes after surgery.\" This can be made more active. *Rewrite*: \"Our pooled analysis shows that RIPC probably makes little or no difference to the main outcomes after surgery.\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy, complex sentence in the limitations paragraph** – \"We are moderately confident in these findings because only a few studies were available, the participants and the way RIPC was given differed between studies, and the small number of trials might make the benefits look larger than they really are.\" This 38‑word sentence mixes several ideas. *Rewrite*: \"We are moderately confident in these findings, but only a few studies were available. The participants and the way RIPC was given differed between studies, and the small number of trials could make any benefit look larger than it really is.\"\n5. **Overall high lexical complexity** – metrics show many complex words (120, P90) and long words (159, P90). Simplify by replacing words like \"reversible interruption\" with \"short pause\", \"moderately confident\" with \"fairly sure\", and \"examination\" with \"look\".\n\nThese changes will reduce sentence length (current average 29.9 words, beyond P90), lower passive‑voice count, cut down on nouns and complex words, and bring the readability indices closer to typical PLS ranges.\n\n**Suggested priority edits**:\n- Break long sentences into two or three shorter ones (target ≤22 words per sentence).\n- Convert passive constructions to active voice.\n- Replace technical terms with everyday language or add brief parenthetical definitions.\n- Reduce noun‑heavy phrasing by using more verbs.\n- Choose shorter synonyms for long, multi‑syllable words.\n\nBy addressing these five points the summary will be clearer, more patient‑friendly, and align better with the Cochrane Plain Language style guide.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is 628 words (within the 850‑word limit) but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: words per sentence 29.9 (BEYOND_P90), passive voice 19 (P90), nouns 182 (P90), automated readability index 15.5 (P90), Gunning fog 19.6 (P90), complex words (Dale‑Chall) 256 (P90) and complex words 120 (P90). These indicate the text is longer, more passive, noun‑heavy, and lexically complex than most PLSs, supporting the need for the clarity improvements outlined above."
