  "draft": "Is temporary blockage of blood flow to a distant part of the body (remote ischaemic preconditioning) beneficial compared with no blockage for people undergoing major blood-vessel surgery?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Remote ischaemic preconditioning (temporary blocking of blood flow to a distant part of the body) probably does not change the risk of death around the time of surgery (perioperative mortality) or reduce major complications such as heart attack (myocardial infarction), kidney problems (renal impairment), brain attack (stroke), loss of a limb (limb loss), length of hospital stay (time spent in hospital), or length of the operation (time the surgery takes), and no clear increase in harms was reported.\n- The studies included were of moderate quality but the evidence is still uncertain, so small benefits or harms cannot be ruled out.\n- Future research should involve larger, well‑designed randomised trials that focus on important clinical outcomes and patient‑centred results to clarify whether remote ischaemic preconditioning offers any real advantage in major vascular surgery.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat health problems are associated with major vascular and endovascular surgery?\nPeople who need major operations on large blood vessels – such as surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm or to open blocked arteries – are at risk of serious complications. The procedures are life‑saving but can still lead to death (mortality) or serious health problems (morbidity) after the operation. Common complications include heart attacks (damage to the heart muscle), kidney problems (when the kidneys do not work well), strokes (damage to the brain from interrupted blood flow), loss of a limb, and longer stays in hospital. Even with modern care, these risks remain a major concern for patients and doctors.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why might it help?\nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where a blood pressure cuff or similar device briefly stops blood flow to a part of the body that is not being operated on, such as an arm or leg. This short, harmless blockage is thought to ‘train’ the body’s cells to better survive longer periods of reduced blood flow (ischaemia) that can occur during surgery. In simple terms, it is like giving the body a tiny, controlled stress so that it can protect its organs when a bigger stress happens during the operation.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review set out to discover whether using RIPC before elective (planned) major vascular or endovascular surgery makes a difference compared with not using it. Specifically, they wanted to know if RIPC reduces the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, loss of a limb, length of hospital stay, and the time needed for the operation or anaesthesia. They also examined whether RIPC might cause any harms.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched databases for studies comparing remote ischaemic preconditioning with no preconditioning in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery, combined their results to compare outcomes such such as mortality and complications, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 14 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,295 older adults (average age 64.5 to 76 years) undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. Most participants were men (about 84%). All the trials compared remote ischaemic preconditioning – a short, reversible interruption of blood flow to a limb – with no preconditioning.\n\nThe review found that remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little or no difference to the main outcomes after surgery. Specifically, it probably does not change the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, or loss of a limb. It also probably does not affect how long people stay in hospital, or the time taken for the operation or anaesthetic.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the studies that provide results are likely to exaggerate the benefits because they represent only a small set of the studies on the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022 of search.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the section subheadings are not phrased as questions, as required by the Master Style Guide. For example, the headings \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are statements rather than questions. This makes the structure less reader‑friendly for a plain‑language audience.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Key messages\". Problem: Not a question, breaking the guide’s rule and reducing navigability. Rewrite: \"What are the main findings?\".\n2. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Introduction/Aims\". Problem: Not a question. Rewrite: \"What health problems are linked to major vascular surgery and why might RIPC help?\".\n3. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Methods\". Problem: Not a question. Rewrite: \"How did we find and evaluate the studies?\".\n4. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Results\". Problem: Not a question. Rewrite: \"What did the studies show about RIPC?\".\n5. **Subheading format** – Quote: \"Limitations\". Problem: Not a question. Rewrite: \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\".\n\nAdditional clarity and readability tweaks (supported by the metric analysis):\n- The draft contains a very high noun count (223, beyond the 90th percentile) and many complex/long words (SMOG 15.1, complex words 152, long words 209). This makes sentences dense and harder to follow. Example problematic sentence: \"The review found that remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little or no difference to the main outcomes after surgery.\" Suggestion: \"We found that remote ischaemic preconditioning probably does not change the main outcomes after surgery.\"\n- Some sentences exceed 30 words, e.g., the introductory paragraph under \"What health problems are associated…\". Break into two shorter sentences for easier reading.\n- Passive voice appears 18 times (75th percentile). Convert to active voice where possible, e.g., change \"The review set out to discover whether using RIPC…\" to \"We set out to discover whether using RIPC…\".\n\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit and overall conforms to typical PLS patterns (good overall conformity). However, five metrics deviate markedly: noun count (223, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.1, beyond P90), complex words (152, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall complex words (294, beyond P90) and long words (209, beyond P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy and uses many long, complex words, which can hinder plain‑language readability."
