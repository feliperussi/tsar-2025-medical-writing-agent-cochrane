  "key_messages": [
    "Remote ischaemic preconditioning (temporary blocking of blood flow to a distant part of the body) probably does not change the risk of death around the time of surgery (perioperative mortality) or reduce major complications such as heart attack (myocardial infarction), kidney problems (renal impairment), brain attack (stroke), loss of a limb (limb loss), length of hospital stay (time spent in hospital), or length of the operation (time the surgery takes), and no clear increase in harms was reported.",
    "The studies included were of moderate quality but the evidence is still uncertain, so small benefits or harms cannot be ruled out.",
    "Future research should involve larger, well‑designed randomised trials that focus on important clinical outcomes and patient‑centred results to clarify whether remote ischaemic preconditioning offers any real advantage in major vascular surgery."

      "subheading": "What health problems are associated with major vascular and endovascular surgery?",
      "content": "People who need major operations on large blood vessels – such as surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm or to open blocked arteries – are at risk of serious complications. The procedures are life‑saving but can still lead to death (mortality) or serious health problems (morbidity) after the operation. Common complications include heart attacks (damage to the heart muscle), kidney problems (when the kidneys do not work well), strokes (damage to the brain from interrupted blood flow), loss of a limb, and longer stays in hospital. Even with modern care, these risks remain a major concern for patients and doctors."

      "subheading": "What is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why might it help?",
      "content": "Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where a blood pressure cuff or similar device briefly stops blood flow to a part of the body that is not being operated on, such as an arm or leg. This short, harmless blockage is thought to ‘train’ the body’s cells to better survive longer periods of reduced blood flow (ischaemia) that can occur during surgery. In simple terms, it is like giving the body a tiny, controlled stress so that it can protect its organs when a bigger stress happens during the operation."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to discover whether using RIPC before elective (planned) major vascular or endovascular surgery makes a difference compared with not using it. Specifically, they wanted to know if RIPC reduces the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, loss of a limb, length of hospital stay, and the time needed for the operation or anaesthesia. They also examined whether RIPC might cause any harms."

      "content": "We searched databases for studies comparing remote ischaemic preconditioning with no preconditioning in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery, combined their results to compare outcomes such as mortality and complications, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at 14 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1,295 older adults (average age 64.5 to 76 years) undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. Most participants were men (about 84%). All the trials compared remote ischaemic preconditioning – a short, reversible interruption of blood flow to a limb – with no preconditioning.\n\nThe review found that remote ischaemic preconditioning probably makes little or no difference to the main outcomes after surgery. Specifically, it probably does not change the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, or loss of a limb. It also probably does not affect how long people stay in hospital, or the time taken for the operation or anaesthetic."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the studies that provide results are likely to exaggerate the benefits because they represent only a small set of the studies on the intervention.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to April 2022 of search."
