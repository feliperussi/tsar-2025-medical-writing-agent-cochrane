  "draft": "Is temporary blockage of blood flow to a distant part of the body (remote ischaemic preconditioning) beneficial compared with no blockage for people undergoing major blood‑vessel surgery?\n\nKey messages\n– Remote ischaemic preconditioning (a short, harmless blockage of blood flow to an arm or leg) probably does not change the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, loss of a limb, length of hospital stay, or the time the operation takes.  \n– The evidence comes from 14 randomised trials involving 1,295 adults (average age 65‑76 years, 84 % men). The studies were of moderate quality, so small benefits or harms cannot be completely ruled out.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials are needed to confirm whether this technique offers any real advantage for patients undergoing major vascular or endovascular surgery.\n\nWhat health problems are associated with major vascular and endovascular surgery?  \nPeople who need major operations on large blood vessels – such as repair of an aortic aneurysm or opening blocked arteries – face serious complications. Even with modern care, they can experience death (mortality) or major health problems after the operation, including heart attacks (damage to the heart muscle), kidney problems (when the kidneys do not work well), strokes (brain damage from interrupted blood flow), loss of a limb, and longer stays in hospital.\n\nWhat is remote ischaemic preconditioning and why might it help?  \nRemote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a technique where we briefly stop blood flow to a part of the body that is not being operated on, using a blood‑pressure cuff on an arm or leg. This short, controlled blockage is thought to “train” the body’s cells to survive longer periods of reduced blood flow (ischaemia) that can occur during surgery. In simple terms, it gives the body a tiny stress so that it can protect its organs when a bigger stress happens during the operation.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?  \nWe set out to discover whether using RIPC before elective (planned) major vascular or endovascular surgery makes a difference compared with not using it. Specifically, we wanted to know if RIPC reduces the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, loss of a limb, length of hospital stay, and the time needed for the operation or anaesthesia. We also examined whether RIPC might cause any harms.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 1 April 2022. We included randomised controlled trials that compared RIPC with no preconditioning in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. We extracted data on trial characteristics, the RIPC stimulus, and outcomes such as mortality, heart attack, kidney impairment, stroke, limb loss, hospital stay and operating time. We combined the results using random‑effects models and assessed our confidence in the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 14 trials that together enrolled 1,295 participants (average age 64.5‑76 years, 84 % men). All trials compared a short, reversible interruption of blood flow to a limb with no preconditioning. The pooled results showed that RIPC probably makes little or no difference to any of the main outcomes after surgery. It did not clearly change the risk of peri‑operative death, heart attack, kidney impairment, stroke, or limb loss, and it did not affect how long people stayed in hospital or how long the operation or anaesthetic took.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are moderately confident in these findings because the number of studies is limited, the participants and RIPC methods varied, and the available data may over‑estimate benefits due to the small number of trials. This uncertainty means small benefits or harms cannot be ruled out.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThis review updates our previous work and includes all relevant studies up to April 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical checks because it contains a factual inaccuracy about participant age (it says “average age 65‑76 years” whereas the source reports an age **range** of 64.5‑76 years). This mis‑statement could mislead readers and breaches the requirement for factual accuracy. In addition, the \"Key messages\" heading is not phrased as a question, which does not follow the style guide’s sub‑heading rule. Several clarity and style problems also reduce readability:\n1. **Age wording** – \"average age 65‑76 years\" is contradictory and unclear.\n   *Rewrite*: \"age range 64.5‑76 years\".\n2. **Over‑long key‑message sentence** – \"Remote ischaemic preconditioning (a short, harmless blockage of blood flow to an arm or leg) probably does not change the risk of death around the time of surgery, heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, loss a limb, length of hospital stay, or the time the operation takes.\" This 30‑word sentence piles many outcomes together, making it hard to follow.\n   *Rewrite*: \"Remote ischaemic preconditioning (a short, harmless blockage of blood flow to an arm or leg) probably does not change the risk of death around the time of surgery. It also appears to have little or no effect on heart attacks, kidney problems, strokes, loss of a limb, how long a person stays in hospital, or how long the operation takes.\"\n3. **Passive construction** – \"The studies were of moderate quality, so small benefits or harms cannot be completely ruled out.\" Passive voice hides who judged the quality.\n   *Rewrite*: \"We judged the studies to be of moderate quality, so small benefits or harms cannot be completely ruled out.\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy sentence** – \"The pooled results showed that RIPC probably makes little or no difference to any of the main outcomes after surgery, heart attack, kidney impairment, stroke, or limb loss, and it did not affect how long people stayed in hospital or how long the operation or anaesthetic took.\" This sentence mixes nouns and verbs, reducing clarity.\n   *Rewrite*: \"The pooled results suggest that RIPC probably makes little or no difference to any of the main outcomes after surgery. It did not clearly change the risk of death, heart attack, kidney impairment, stroke, or limb loss, and it did not affect the length of hospital stay or the time needed for the operation or anaesthesia.\"\n5. **Missing question format for the \"Key messages\" heading** – Change to a question such as \"What are the key messages?\" to comply with the style guide.\n\nMetrics support these observations: the draft has a high noun count (204, beyond the 90th percentile), many complex words (131, beyond the 90th percentile) and long words (178, beyond the 90th percentile), and a SMOG index of 14.27 (beyond the 90th percentile). These figures explain the dense, noun‑heavy style and suggest the need to simplify vocabulary and shorten sentences. The passive‑voice count (18) is at the upper typical range (75th percentile). Overall, the factual and stylistic issues must be corrected before the PLS can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is within the 850‑word limit (674 words) and meets most percentile targets, but it deviates markedly on nouns (204, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (14.27, P90), complex words (131, P90), complex Dale‑Chall words (270, P90) and long words (178, P90). These deviations indicate a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style that reduces readability. Passive voice (18) is at the upper typical range (P75)."
