      "feedback": "The draft fails the mandatory completeness check – it only contains a single opening sentence and does not include any of the required sections (Title, Key messages, Background/Aims, Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency). The title and sub‑headings are missing, and the existing sentence is not phrased as a question, does not use first‑person plural pronouns, and is written in passive style. Because the PLS must guide patients through the review, the current draft provides no usable information.\n\n**Critical issues**\n1. **Missing sections** – The draft does not contain the seven mandatory sections outlined in the Master Style Guide.\n2. **Title/sub‑headings not in question form** – No title is present, and no sub‑headings are phrased as questions.\n3. **Lack of active voice and pronouns** – The draft contains 0 active‑voice constructions and 0 pronouns, far below the typical PLS range (active voice >29, pronouns >13). This makes the text feel impersonal and harder to follow.\n4. **Very low readability** – Flesch Reading Ease is 6.4 (should be >40), LIX is 69.7 (should be <54), and Dale‑Chall score is 10.7 (should be <7.7). The single sentence is overly dense for a patient audience.\n5. **No patient‑focused language** – No explanation of key terms (e.g., “remote ischaemic preconditioning”) and no context about why the review matters to patients.\n\n**Top improvements needed**\n- **Add the missing sections** – Insert a title, key messages, background/aims, methods, results, limitations, and currency sections as separate headings.\n- **Rewrite the opening sentence as a question and in active voice** – Original: \"Is temporary blockage ...\" → Suggested: \"What is remote ischaemic preconditioning and does it help people undergoing major blood‑vessel surgery?\"\n- **Introduce first‑person plural pronouns** – Replace impersonal phrasing with \"We searched…\", \"We found…\" to meet the style guide.\n- **Break the text into short paragraphs and bullet points** – Use dashes for list items and leave blank lines between headings and paragraphs.\n- **Simplify language and define jargon** – Replace terms like \"ischaemia\" with \"reduced blood flow\" and explain \"remote\" as \"a different part of the body\".\n\n**Supporting metrics** – The evaluation shows 0 active‑voice sentences and 0 pronouns (both below the P10 threshold), a Flesch Reading Ease of 6.4 (far below the typical median >40), and a LIX of 69.7 (beyond the P90 limit). These metric deviations confirm the readability and style problems identified above.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation indicates the draft is extremely short (1 sentence) with very low active‑voice (0) and pronoun use (0), resulting in a Flesch Reading Ease of 6.4 (far below the typical 40‑50 range) and a LIX of 69.7 (well above the typical 50‑62). These deviations highlight the need for more active, patient‑friendly language, additional content, and proper structure."
