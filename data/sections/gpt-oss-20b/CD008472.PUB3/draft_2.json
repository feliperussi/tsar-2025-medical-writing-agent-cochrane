  "draft": "Is temporary blockage of blood flow to a distant part of the body (remote ischaemic preconditioning) beneficial compared with no blockage for people undergoing major blood‑vessel surgery?\n\nWhat are the main findings?\n– Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), a brief, harmless blockage of blood flow to an arm or leg, probably does not change the risk of death around the time of surgery (peri‑operative mortality).  \n– RIPC probably does not reduce major complications such as heart attack (myocardial infarction), kidney problems (renal impairment), stroke, or loss of a limb.  \n– RIPC also probably does not shorten the hospital stay or the time the operation or anaesthesia takes, and no clear increase in harms was reported.  \nThe evidence comes from moderate‑quality studies, so small benefits or harms cannot be completely ruled out.\n\nWhat health problems are linked to major vascular surgery and why might RIPC help?\nPeople who need major operations on large blood vessels – for example, repair of an aortic aneurysm or opening a blocked artery – face serious risks. After surgery they can die (mortality) or develop serious health problems (morbidity) such as heart attacks, kidney failure, strokes, loss of a limb, and long hospital stays.  \nRIPC works by briefly stopping blood flow to a limb with a cuff. This short stress is thought to “train” cells to survive longer periods of reduced blood flow (ischaemia) that can occur during the operation, potentially protecting the organs.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registries up to 1 April 2022. We included randomised controlled trials that compared RIPC with no preconditioning in people undergoing elective major vascular or endovascular surgery. Two reviewers extracted data on mortality, heart attack, kidney problems, stroke, limb loss, hospital stay and operating time. We combined results using random‑effects models and rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did the studies show about RIPC?\nFourteen trials enrolled 1 295 participants (average age 65–76 years; 84 % men). All trials compared a short, reversible interruption of blood flow to a limb with no preconditioning. The pooled results showed:\n– No clear difference in peri‑operative mortality (RR 1.41, 95 % CI 0.59 to 3.40).  \n– No clear difference in heart attack (RR 0.82), kidney problems (RR 1.07), stroke (RR 0.33) or limb loss (RR 0.74).  \n– Hospital stay changed by less than one day (MD ‑0.94 days) and operating time changed by about six minutes (MD 5.8 minutes), both with confidence intervals crossing zero.  \nOverall, the evidence suggests little or no effect of RIPC on these outcomes.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the findings, but the evidence is limited. Few studies reported each outcome, the participants and RIPC protocols varied, and the small number of trials may over‑estimate benefits. This uncertainty means small effects cannot be excluded.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes all relevant studies up to April 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the structural and factual requirements, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a patient‑focused audience. The most important issues are:\n1. **Unexplained technical abbreviations** – terms such as “RR”, “MD”, and “confidence interval” appear without definition, making the results hard to understand.\n   *Problematic text*: \"No clear difference in peri‑operative mortality (RR 1.41, 95 % CI 0.59 to 3.40).\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"No clear difference in peri‑operative mortality – the risk was 1.41 times higher (risk ratio, RR) with a 95 % confidence interval from 0.59 to 3.40, which includes no effect.\"\n2. **Long, dense sentence in the key‑findings bullet** – the sentence combines several ideas, reducing readability.\n   *Problematic text*: \"RIPC also probably does not shorten the hospital stay or the time the operation or anaesthesia takes, and no clear increase in harms was reported.\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"RIPC also probably does not shorten the hospital stay. It does not appear to change the time needed for the operation or anaesthesia, and no clear increase in harms was reported.\"\n3. **Jargon that is not defined for lay readers** – words like “ischaemia”, “random‑effects models”, and “GRADE” are technical.\n   *Problematic text*: \"We combined results using random‑effects models and rated our confidence in the evidence with the GRADE approach.\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"We combined the results using a statistical method that accounts for differences between studies, and we assessed how confident we are in the evidence using a standard system called GRADE.\"\n4. **High noun density and many unfamiliar words** – the draft contains 165 nouns (well above the typical PLS range) and 220 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words, making sentences noun‑heavy and harder to read.\n   *Problematic excerpt*: \"Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), a brief, harmless blockage of blood flow to an arm or leg, probably does not change the risk of death around the time of surgery (peri‑operative mortality).\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) briefly stops blood flow to an arm or leg. This short, safe blockage probably does not change the chance of dying around the time of surgery.\"\nThese revisions reduce jargon, shorten sentences, and replace noun‑heavy phrasing with clearer verbs, aligning the summary with plain‑language best practices.\n\n**Supporting metrics**: The PLS evaluation shows a high noun count (165, beyond the typical ≤116) and a high number of complex Dale‑Chall words (220, beyond the typical ≤160). Both indicate the draft is more noun‑heavy and uses less‑familiar vocabulary than typical Cochrane PLS texts, confirming the need for the suggested simplifications.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns but deviates on two key metrics: nouns (165, above the median range) and complex Dale‑Chall words (220, above the median). These deviations suggest the text is noun‑heavy and uses many less‑familiar words, which can hinder readability for patients."
