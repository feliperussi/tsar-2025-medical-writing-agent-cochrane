  "draft": "Does taking colchicine (a low‑cost anti‑inflammatory medicine) help prevent heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular problems in people without heart disease?\n\nKey messages\n– We cannot be sure that colchicine prevents heart attacks, strokes or other cardiovascular events in people who have never had heart disease. The limited evidence hints that it might lower overall death, but this is very uncertain, and it may increase the chance of diarrhoea (loose stools).  \n– Most of the included studies were small, had design flaws (biases), or focused on conditions such as liver disease rather than heart disease, so their results are not reliable.  \n– Large, well‑designed randomised trials that follow participants for longer periods are needed to determine any true benefits or harms of colchicine for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.\n\nWhy is preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease important?  \nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) occurs when fatty deposits (plaque) build up in artery walls, narrowing them and restricting blood flow. This can cause heart attacks, strokes and other serious problems. ACVD is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Current treatments mainly lower cholesterol (for example, statins) and encourage healthy lifestyles, but inflammation – the body’s response to injury or infection – also makes plaques unstable. Because many people still experience heart attacks or strokes despite these treatments, finding extra ways to prevent ACVD is a public‑health priority.\n\nWhat is colchicine and why might it help?  \nColchicine is an old, inexpensive drug that was first used in ancient Egypt. It works by reducing inflammation, the same process that can worsen arterial plaque. Because it is cheap and already approved for conditions such as gout, researchers wonder whether it could lower the risk of a first heart attack, stroke or death in people who have never had a cardiovascular problem – a strategy called primary prevention (preventing disease before it starts).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?  \nWe aimed to determine whether colchicine, given to adults without existing heart or blood‑vessel disease, reduces the chance of dying, having a heart attack or having a stroke, and whether it causes important side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Heart Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that tested colchicine for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults without pre‑existing disease. Two or more reviewers selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 15 RCTs that enrolled a total of 1,721 participants (1,412 were analysed). Many participants had liver disease rather than a purely cardiovascular profile. Follow‑up ranged from 4 weeks to 728 weeks. The trials compared oral colchicine with placebo, with immunomodulating agents such as methotrexate, or with usual care/no treatment. No trial compared colchicine with non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids. No study reported outcomes for pericardial effusion, peripheral artery disease, heart failure or unstable angina.\n\nWhat did the review find about benefits and harms?  \n– All‑cause mortality: The evidence is very uncertain whether colchicine reduces overall death when used for primary prevention.  \n– Non‑fatal myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke: The evidence is very uncertain for any benefit or harm.  \n– Diarrhoea: Colchicine may increase the risk of diarrhoea, but the certainty of this finding is very low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMany trials were small and had design flaws that could bias the results. In some studies participants may have known which treatment they received, which can affect outcomes. The evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes, limiting how broadly we can apply the findings.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?  \nWe searched up to May 2023, so or the evidence reflects studies published or indexed by that date.",

These issues need to be addressed before the summary can be approved.",

These metric alerts support the editorial recommendation to simplify language, reduce noun‑heavy constructions, and break up long sentences."
