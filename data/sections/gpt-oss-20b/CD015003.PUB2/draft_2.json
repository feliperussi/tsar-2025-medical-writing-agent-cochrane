  "draft": "Does taking colchicine (a low‑cost anti‑inflammatory medicine) help prevent heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular problems in people without heart disease?\n\nKey messages\n- We could not be confident that colchicine prevents heart attacks, strokes or other cardiovascular problems in people who have never had heart disease. The limited evidence hints it might lower overall death, but this is very uncertain, and it may increase the chance of diarrhoea (loose stools).\n- Most of the studies had methodological problems, were small, or focused on conditions other than heart disease, so their findings are not reliable.\n- Large, well‑designed randomised trials that follow participants for longer periods are needed to determine any true benefits or harms of colchicine for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.\n\nWhy is preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease important?\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) occurs when fatty deposits (plaque) build up in artery walls, narrowing them and restricting blood flow. This can cause heart attacks, strokes and other serious problems. ACVD is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Current treatments mainly lower cholesterol and promote healthy lifestyles, but inflammation – the body’s response to injury or infection – also makes plaques unstable. Because many people still experience heart attacks or strokes despite these treatments, finding additional ways to prevent ACVD is a public‑health answer.\n\nWhat is colchicine and why might it help?\nColchicine is an old, inexpensive drug that was first used in ancient Egypt. It reduces inflammation, the same process that can worsen arterial plaque. Because it is cheap and already approved for conditions such as gout, researchers wonder whether it could lower the risk of a first heart attack, stroke or death in people who have never had a cardiovascular problem before – a strategy called primary prevention (preventing disease before it starts).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to determine whether colchicine, given to adults without existing heart or blood‑vessel disease, reduces the chance of dying, having a heart attack or having a stroke, and whether it causes important side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Heart Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP for randomised controlled trials that tested colchicine for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults without pre‑existing disease. We included trials that compared colchicine with placebo, other drugs or usual care. Two or more reviewers selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 15 randomised trials that enrolled 1,721 participants (1,412 analysed). Most participants had liver disease rather than a purely cardiovascular profile. Follow‑up ranged from 4 weeks to 728 weeks. The trials compared oral colchicine with placebo, with immunomodulating agents such as methotrexate, or with usual care/no treatment. No trials compared colchicine with NSAIDs, corticosteroids or other immunomodulators. No study reported outcomes for pericardial effusion, peripheral artery disease, heart failure or unstable angina.\n\nMain findings\n- All‑cause mortality: The evidence is very uncertain whether colchicine reduces overall death when used for primary prevention.\n- Non‑fatal myocardial infarction and stroke: The evidence is very uncertain for any benefit or harm.\n- Diarrhoea: Colchicine may increase the risk of diarrhoea, but the certainty of this finding is very low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany trials were small, had methodological problems and were at high risk of bias. Some participants may have known which treatment they received, which can affect results. The evidence does not cover all relevant populations or outcomes, limiting its applicability.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nWe searched up to May 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published or indexed by that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions – the section titled “Main findings” is not a question. This alone prevents approval. In addition, several clarity and style issues would likely confuse readers: (1) technical jargon such as “methodological problems” and “high risk of bias” is not explained; (2) the sentence under “What did we find?” is long and dense, making it hard to follow; (3) the phrase “the evidence is very uncertain” is repeated, creating redundancy; (4) passive constructions and nominalisations dominate (16 passive instances, 21 nominalisations, both above typical PLS ranges), reducing readability. Addressing these points – especially re‑phrasing the non‑question subheading and simplifying jargon – is required before the PLS can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices are within typical ranges (e.g., FKGL 11.5, words per sentence 18.6). However, several metrics deviate markedly: nominalisations (21, beyond P90), nouns (170, beyond P90), SMOG (14.5, beyond P90), complex words (151) and long words (207) are all well above median values, indicating a noun‑heavy, complex style. Passive voice count (16) is high (P75). These metric signals support the editorial observations about excessive nominalisation and passive constructions."
