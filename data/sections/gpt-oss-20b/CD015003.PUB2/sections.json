  "plain_title": "Does taking colchicine (a low‑cost anti‑inflammatory medicine) help prevent heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular problems in people without heart disease?",
  "key_messages": [
    "The review could not determine with confidence whether colchicine (a low‑cost anti‑inflammatory medicine) prevents heart attacks, strokes or other cardiovascular events (problems with the heart and blood vessels) in people without existing heart disease; the limited evidence hints at a possible reduction in overall death but is very uncertain, and colchicine may increase the chance of diarrhoea (loose stools).",
    "Most of the included studies had methodological problems (biases) and many were small or focused on conditions other than heart disease, which limits how much we can rely on their findings.",
    "More large, well‑designed randomised trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to receive colchicine or not) that follow participants for longer periods are needed to clarify any true benefits or harms of colchicine for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease."

      "subheading": "Why is preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease important?",
      "content": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) is a condition where fatty deposits (plaque) build up in the walls of arteries, narrowing them and making it harder for blood to flow. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and other serious problems. ACVD is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, affecting millions of people. Most current treatments focus on lowering cholesterol (for example, statin medicines) and encouraging healthy lifestyle changes, but inflammation – the body's response to injury or infection – also plays a key role in making plaques unstable and causing events. Because many people still have heart attacks or strokes despite these treatments, finding extra ways to prevent ACVD is a major public‑health priority."

      "subheading": "What is colchicine and why might it help?",
      "content": "Colchicine is a very old, inexpensive drug that was first‑used in ancient Egypt. It works by reducing inflammation, the same process that can worsen plaque in arteries. Because it is cheap and already approved for other conditions (like gout), researchers wonder whether it could lower the risk of a first heart attack, stroke, or death in people who have never had a cardiovascular problem before – a strategy called \"primary prevention\" (preventing disease before it starts)."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The authors of this Cochrane review set out to determine whether colchicine, when given to adults without any existing heart or blood‑vessel disease, actually reduces the chance of dying, having a heart attack, or having a stroke, and whether it causes any important side‑effects. In other words, they wanted to assess the benefits and harms of colchicine for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in the general population."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatment groups) testing colchicine for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults without existing disease, compared with placebo, other drugs or usual care; we combined their results and rated our confidence in the evidence using risk‑of‑bias and GRADE assessments."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified fifteen randomised controlled trials that enrolled a total of 1,721 adults without pre‑existing cardiovascular disease (1,412 were analysed). Many participants had liver disease rather than a purely cardiovascular profile. Follow‑up periods ranged from 4 weeks to 728 weeks. The interventions compared oral colchicine with placebo, with immunomodulating agents such as methotrexate, or with usual care/no treatment; no trials compared colchicine with NSAIDs, corticosteroids or other immunomodulators. The studies were conducted in various, unspecified settings and countries, and the abstract does not report funding sources. No trials reported outcomes for pericardial effusion, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, or unstable angina."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: All‑cause mortality",
      "content": "It is unclear whether colchicine reduces all‑cause mortality when used for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease; the evidence is very uncertain."
    }

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the studies were very small, and because the evidence does not cover all of the people and outcomes we are interested in.",
