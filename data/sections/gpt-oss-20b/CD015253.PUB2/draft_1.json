Actually keep as given)  \nIs using a nasal balloon (autoinflation) better than doing nothing for children with fluid‑filled ears (otitis media with effusion)?\n\n- Using a nasal balloon (autoinflation – a self‑administered technique where a child inflates a small balloon placed in the nose to create pressure that can open a blocked ear tube) may provide some benefit over doing nothing for children with fluid‑filled ears (otitis media with effusion – fluid in the middle ear), such as a modest improvement in ear‑related quality of life (how the ear condition affects daily life) and a slight reduction in the amount of fluid that remains, but the effect on restoring normal hearing is uncertain and there may be a small increase in ear pain (pain in the ear).  \n- The studies that were found were generally small, lasted only a short period, and mostly included children who were older than infants, so confidence in the overall findings is limited.  \n- Future research should involve larger, well‑designed trials that follow children for longer periods to clarify whether autoinflation truly improves hearing, how often ear pain occurs, and whether any benefits outweigh the inconvenience of regular use.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\n\nWhat is otitis? Actually subheading: What is otitis media with effusion and why does it matter for children?  \nOtitis media with effusion (OME) is a condition where fluid builds up in the middle part of the ear. It is very common in young children. The fluid can make it harder for sound to travel, leading to temporary hearing loss. When the hearing problem lasts for a long time, children may have trouble paying attention, develop behavioural issues, and fall behind in learning to speak and understand language. Because the middle‑ear space is connected to the back of the nose by a small tube called the Eustachian tube, problems with this tube can keep fluid trapped.  \n\nUsual ways to manage OME include:  \n- Watchful waiting – simply monitoring the child to see if the fluid clears on its own;  \n- Medical treatments such as nasal steroids or antibiotics (though these often do not remove the fluid);  \n- Surgical options like inserting tiny ventilation tubes (grommets) into the eardrum to let air in;  \n- Mechanical techniques that try to open the Eustachian tube, one of which is called autoinflation.  \n\nAutoinflation is a self‑administered method where the child (or a small balloon or a handheld device) blows air into the nose using a small balloon or a handheld device. The puff of air creates positive pressure in the nose and back of the throat, which can help open the Eustachian tube and let the trapped fluid drain out of the middle ear.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about autoinflation for OME?  \nThe authors wanted to know whether autoinflation is an effective and safe way to treat OME in children. Specifically, they looked at whether this technique helps children: regain normal hearing, improve quality of life related to ear problems, experience less pain or distress during treatment, and have the fluid in the ear disappear more quickly. They compared autoinflation with doing nothing (watchful waiting) or with other non‑surgical treatments, and they examined any possible harms, such as ear pain or damage to the eardrum.\n\n**Methods**  \nWe searched for studies that compared autoinflation with watchful waiting or other treatments in children with otitis media with effusion, combined their results to assess outcomes such as hearing and quality of life, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n\nWhat did we find?  \nThe review identified 11 randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that enrolled 1,036 children aged 6 months to 12 years with otitis media with effusion (OME). The studies were conducted in Europe and North America in both hospital and community settings. All trials compared a self‑administered autoinflation technique—using nasal balloons or handheld devices—with no treatment (watchful waiting). Participants were generally instructed to perform autoinflation two to three times daily for periods ranging from 2 to 12 weeks, and outcomes were assessed shortly after the intervention phase, with the longest follow‑up reported at 11 weeks. No information on funding sources was provided.\n\nMain results: Hearing and related outcomes  \nThe evidence does not show a clear benefit of autoinflation for restoring normal hearing in children with OME. Autoinflation may improve ear‑related quality of life, but its effect on ear pain remains uncertain. There is a slight reduction in the persistence of middle‑ear fluid, although the clinical importance of this finding is unclear.\n\n**Limitations**  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**  \nThe evidence is up to date or up to date to January 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the main section headings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"), which the Master Style Guide requires. In addition, the text contains several readability problems that would confuse patients: 27 passive‑voice constructions, 38 nominalisations, and an unusually high noun count (231) and complex‑word count (137). These metrics confirm the editorial concerns.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheadings as questions** – Current heading: \"Methods\". This does not tell the reader what they will learn. Suggested rewrite: \"How did we find and evaluate the evidence?\".\n2. **Passive voice** – Problematic sentence: \"The evidence does not show a clear benefit of autoinflation for restoring normal hearing in children with OME.\" This hides who evaluated the evidence. Suggested rewrite: \"We found no clear benefit of autoinflation for restoring normal hearing in children with OME.\".\n3. **Nominalisation / noun‑heavy phrasing** – Problematic phrase: \"The review identified 11 randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that enrolled 1,036 children…\". Suggested rewrite: \"We identified 11 trials that enrolled 1,036 children…\".\n4. **Long, complex sentences** – Problematic sentence (30+ words): \"Participants were generally instructed to perform autoinflation two to three times daily for periods ranging from 2 to 12 weeks, and outcomes were assessed shortly after the intervention phase, with the longest follow‑up reported at 11 weeks.\" Suggested rewrite: \"Children were asked to do autoinflation two to three times a day for 2–12 weeks. We measured outcomes soon after treatment; the longest follow‑up was 11 weeks.\".\n5. **Technical jargon without simple definition** – The term \"autoinflation\" is introduced but later used without reminder of its meaning. Add a brief definition the first time it appears in each section, e.g., \"autoinflation (blowing into a small nasal balloon to create pressure)\".\n\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide, reduce passive and noun‑heavy language, and make the summary easier for patients to read.",
