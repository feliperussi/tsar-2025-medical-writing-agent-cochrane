  "draft": "Is using a nasal balloon (autoinflation) better than doing nothing for children with fluid‑filled ears (otitis media with effusion)?\n\nKey messages\n- Autoinflation (blowing into a small nasal balloon to create pressure) may modestly improve ear‑related quality of life and slightly reduce the amount of fluid in the middle ear.\n- The studies do not show a clear benefit for restoring normal hearing, and we are uncertain whether autoinflation increases ear pain.\n- The evidence comes from small, short‑term trials, so we have limited confidence in these findings.\n\nWhat is otitis media with effusion and why does it matter for children?\nOtitis media with effusion (OME) is a build‑up of fluid in the‑middle part of the ear. It is very common in young children. The fluid can block sound, causing temporary hearing loss. When hearing loss lasts, children may struggle to pay attention, develop behavioural problems, and fall behind in language development. The middle‑ear space connects to the back of the nose through the Eustachian tube. If this tube does not open properly, fluid can stay trapped.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out about autoinflation for OME?\nWe wanted to know whether autoinflation is an effective and safe way to treat OME in children. Specifically, we examined whether the technique helps children:\n- regain normal hearing,\n- improve ear‑related quality of life,\n- experience less pain or distress, and\n- clear middle‑ear fluid more quickly.\nWe compared autoinflation with doing nothing (watchful waiting) or with other non‑surgical treatments and looked for any harms such as ear pain or eardrum damage.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and other sources up to 20 January 2023. We included randomised or quasi‑like trials that enrolled children aged 6 months to 12 years with OME. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 11 trials that enrolled 1 036 children. All trials compared a self‑administered autoinflation method (nasal balloon or handheld device) with no treatment. Children were asked to perform autoinflation two to three times a day for 2–12 weeks. We measured outcomes soon after treatment; the longest follow‑up was 11 weeks.\n\n- Hearing: We found no clear benefit of autoinflation for restoring normal hearing.\n- Quality of life: Autoinflation may lead to a modest improvement in ear‑related quality of life.\n- Ear pain: The evidence is uncertain, but one study suggested a possible increase in ear pain.\n- Fluid persistence: Autoinflation may slightly reduce the proportion of children whose fluid remains, although the clinical importance of this change is unclear.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe trials were small, varied in how they delivered the treatment, and mostly included children older than infants. Because of these differences and the short follow‑up, we or confidence in the results is low.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nYes. The search covered studies published up to January 2023, so the evidence reflects the most recent research available at that time.",

This typo makes the sentence unintelligible. *Rewrite*: \"Because of these differences and the short follow‑up, our confidence in the results is low.\"\\n2. **Unclear risk statement** – \"The evidence is uncertain, but one study suggested a possible increase in ear pain.\" The phrase mixes uncertainty with a suggestion of risk without indicating the low certainty of that finding. *Rewrite*: \"The evidence is of very low certainty, and one small study suggested that ear pain might be more common with autoinflation, but we are not sure.\"\\n3. **Ambiguous wording and heavy nominalisation** – \"The evidence may slightly reduce the proportion of children whose fluid remains, although the clinical importance of this change is unclear.\" The use of the noun \"proportion\" and double‑negative phrasing makes the meaning hard to grasp. *Rewrite*: \"The evidence suggests that autoinflation might slightly lower the number of children who still have fluid in the middle ear, but we do not know whether this small difference matters in practice.\"\\nThese issues affect readability and the ability of patients to understand the findings. The PLS evaluation also flagged a very high level of nominalisation (31 instances, beyond the P90 threshold), confirming that the draft relies heavily on noun‑heavy constructions that reduce clarity. Reducing nominalisations and correcting the above errors will bring the summary in line with Cochrane plain‑language standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most PLS metrics (word count 542, readability scores in the best quartile). However, nominalisation is markedly high (31 instances, BEYOND_P90), indicating excessive noun‑heavy phrasing. Passive voice is low (14, P75) and active voice high (57, P75), which is good. The main deviation is the over‑use of nominalisations, which aligns with the identified clarity issues."
