  "draft": "Is maturing eggs in the lab (in‑vitro maturation) more effective than standard IVF (in‑vitro fertilisation) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome trying to become pregnant?\n\nKey messages  \n– Current research does not give a clear answer about whether in‑vitro maturation (IVM – a lab technique that matures immature eggs before fertilisation) leads to more live births than standard IVF for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS – a hormonal condition that can cause infertility). The available studies are few and the results are uncertain.  \n– Better‑quality trials suggest that IVM may raise the risk of miscarriage after a confirmed pregnancy and may lower the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS – a potentially serious reaction to fertility medicines).  \n...

      "feedback": "The draft fails the mandatory completeness check – it only contains a title and a brief key‑messages list and does not include the required sections (Background/Aims, Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency). The Master Style Guide also requires every subheading to be phrased as a question, which is missing. In addition, the text is hard to read: sentences average 39.7 words (well above the typical 19‑28), active‑voice sentences are far below the norm (10 vs >29), pronouns are scarce (2 vs >13), and the Flesch reading ease is 22 (far below the typical >40). These metric deviations confirm the editorial concerns about long, passive‑heavy sentences and lack of conversational tone. To meet Cochrane PLS standards the draft needs to (1) add all missing sections with question‑style subheadings, (2) break long sentences into shorter ones (≤20 words), (3) rewrite passive constructions into active voice and use first‑person plural pronouns (we/our), (4) replace jargon with plain‑language definitions, and (5) format bullet points with dashes and ensure blank lines between headings and paragraphs.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit but deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns: words_per_sentence (39.7, BEYOND_P90), active_voice (10, BELOW_P10), pronouns (2, BELOW_P10), and flesch_reading_ease (22.3, BELOW_P10) are all far outside the normal ranges, indicating overly long, passive, and jargon‑heavy prose that needs substantial simplification."
