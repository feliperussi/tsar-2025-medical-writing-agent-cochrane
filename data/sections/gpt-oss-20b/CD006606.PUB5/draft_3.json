  "draft": "Is maturing eggs in the lab (in‑vitro maturation) more effective than standard IVF (in‑vitro fertilisation) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome trying to become pregnant?\n\nKey messages\n– Current research does not give a clear answer about whether in‑vitro maturation (IVM – a lab technique that matures immature eggs before fertilisation) leads to more live births than standard IVF for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS – a hormonal condition that can cause infertility). The studies are few and the results are uncertain.  \n– Better‑quality trials suggest that IVM may raise the risk of miscarriage after a confirmed pregnancy and may lower the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS – a potentially serious reaction to fertility medicines).  \n– Because the evidence is limited and uncertain, we need more large, well‑designed randomised trials to determine the true benefits and harms of IVM compared with IVF for women with PCOS, including long‑term outcomes for mother and baby.\n\nWhat is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and why does it affect a woman's ability to become pregnant?\nPCOS is a hormonal condition that affects about 8 %–13 % of women of child‑bearing age. It often causes irregular periods, higher levels of male‑type hormones, and ovaries that contain many small cysts. These changes can stop an egg from maturing and being released, leading to infertility – the inability to get pregnant after a year of regular, unprotected sex. About half of all women who seek help for infertility have PCOS.\n\nWhat are the usual assisted‑reproduction techniques for women with PCOS, and what problems can they cause?\nWhen natural conception is unlikely, doctors may use assisted reproductive technologies such as in‑vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI – a single sperm is injected directly into an egg). In IVF, we collect eggs from the ovaries, fertilise them with sperm in the laboratory, and place the resulting embryos back into the uterus. To collect enough eggs, women with PCOS often receive high doses of medicines that stimulate the ovaries (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, COH). This can lead to an over‑response: many immature eggs are retrieved, egg quality can be uneven, and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) increases.\n\nWhat is in‑vitro maturation (IVM) and how might it help women with PCOS?\nIVM is a technique where we collect immature eggs earlier – before they have fully developed in the body – and then allow them to mature in the laboratory. After maturation, we fertilise the eggs using IVF or ICSI. By retrieving eggs earlier, IVM aims to reduce the need for high‑dose stimulation medicines and therefore lower the risk of OHSS while still giving women a chance at pregnancy.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe set out to compare IVM (followed by IVF or ICSI) with the standard IVF/ICSI approach in women with PCOS. Specifically, we wanted to know whether IVM improves or harms important outcomes such as live‑birth rates, miscarriage rates, clinical‑pregnancy rates, the occurrence of OHSS, preterm birth, and congenital anomalies.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Open Grey, NICE fertility guidelines, reference lists of relevant papers and Google Scholar for randomised controlled trials that compared IVM with conventional IVF/ICSI in women with PCOS. Two reviewers selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data and rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe examined four randomised trials that enrolled a total of 810 women with PCOS who were trying to become pregnant using assisted reproduction. The trials compared IVM of early‑stage eggs (standard IVM or a newer IVM method) followed by IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI using a GnRH‑antagonist protocol (a medication that blocks premature hormone release).\n\nLive‑birth outcome\nWe cannot determine whether IVM changes the chance of having a baby compared with standard IVF. If about 46 % of women have a baby after IVF, IVM could result in roughly 13 % to 53 % of women having a baby.\n\nMiscarriage outcome\nBetter‑quality trials suggest that IVM may increase miscarriage after a confirmed pregnancy. If the miscarriage rate after IVF is about 20 %, IVM could raise it to between 20 % and 40 %.\n\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\nThe same trials show that IVM greatly reduces the risk of moderate or severe OHSS. If the OHSS rate after IVF is about 3.5 %, IVM could lower it to between 0 % and 2.4 %.\n\nOther outcomes\nThe evidence suggests little or no difference between IVM and IVF for preterm birth and for congenital anomalies, but the data are limited.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies had a high risk of bias because they lacked blinding and had incomplete reporting. Results varied across trials (high heterogeneity) and the data were imprecise due to small sample sizes and few events. These factors make reliable conclusions difficult.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates the previous Cochrane review and includes all evidence up to February 2023.\n\nWhat do we need next?\nWe need more large, well‑designed randomised trials that report long‑term outcomes for mothers and babies. Such studies will help us understand whether IVM should be offered as an alternative to standard IVF for women with PCOS.",
