  "key_messages": [
    "Current research does not provide a clear answer about whether in‑vitro maturation (IVM – a lab technique that matures immature eggs before fertilisation) leads to more live births than standard in‑vitro fertilisation (IVF – the usual method of fertilising eggs in the lab) for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS – a hormonal condition that can cause infertility). The available studies are limited and the results are uncertain.",
    "The same studies suggest that IVM may increase the chance of miscarriage after a clinical pregnancy (a pregnancy confirmed by an ultrasound heartbeat) and may lower the chance of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS – a potentially serious reaction to fertility medicines), with these findings coming from better‑quality trials.",
    "Because the evidence is limited and uncertain, more large, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to determine the true benefits and harms of IVM compared with IVF for women with PCOS, including long‑term outcomes for mother and baby."

      "subheading": "What is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and why does it affect a woman's ability to become pregnant?",
      "content": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS, is a hormonal condition that affects about 8%‑13% of women of child‑bearing age. It often causes irregular periods, high levels of male‑type hormones, and ovaries that contain many small cysts. These changes can make it hard for an egg to mature and be released, leading to infertility – the inability to get pregnant after a year of regular, unprotected sex. About half of all women who seek help for infertility have PCOS."

      "subheading": "What are the usual assisted‑reproduction techniques for women with PCOS, and what problems can they cause?",
      "content": "When natural conception is unlikely, doctors may use assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In IVF, eggs are collected from the ovaries, fertilised with sperm in a laboratory, and the resulting embryos are placed back into the uterus. ICSI is a variation where a single sperm is injected directly into an egg. To collect enough eggs, women with PCOS often receive high doses of medicines that stimulate the ovaries (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, or COH). This can lead to an over‑response: many immature eggs are retrieved, the quality of the eggs can be uneven, and there is a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially serious condition where the ovaries become swollen and fluid leaks into the body."

      "subheading": "What is in‑vitro maturation (IVM) and how might it help women with PCOS?",
      "content": "In‑vitro maturation (IVM) is a technique where immature eggs are collected earlier – before they have fully developed in the body‑cavity – and then allowed to mature in the laboratory. After maturation, the eggs can be fertilised using IVF or ICSI. By retrieving eggs earlier, IVM aims to reduce the need for high‑dose stimulation medicines and therefore lower the risk of OHSS while still giving women a chance at pregnancy."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to compare IVM (followed by IVF or ICSI) with the standard IVF/ICSI approach in women with PCOS. Specifically, they wanted to determine whether IVM improves or harms important outcomes such as live birth rates, miscarriage rates, clinical pregnancy rates, the occurrence of OHSS, preterm birth, and congenital anomalies. In other words, they aimed to assess the benefits and risks of using IVM as an alternative to conventional assisted reproduction for this group of women."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at four randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 810 women with polycystic ovarian syndrome who were trying to become pregnant using assisted reproductive technology. All participants were women of reproductive age, but the abstract did not give exact ages or other demographic details. The studies compared in‑vitro maturation (IVM) of germinal‑vesicle‑stage eggs – either a standard IVM method or a newer capacitation IVM protocol – followed by IVF or ICSI, with conventional IVF or ICSI using a GnRH‑antagonist protocol. The abstract did not report how long participants were followed, where the studies were carried out, or who funded them."

      "subheading": "Main results: Live birth",
      "content": "It is unclear whether IVM changes the chance of having a baby compared with standard IVF. If about 46 out of 100 women would have a baby with IVF, IVM could result in anywhere from about 13 to 53 babies per 100 women."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because many studies had a high risk of bias (e.g., lack of blinding and incomplete reporting), the results were inconsistent across trials (high heterogeneity), and the data were imprecise due to small sample sizes and few events, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023 of search."
