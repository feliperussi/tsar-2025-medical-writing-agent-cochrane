  "plain_title": "Do school support programs (education support services) help children and teens with long‑term illnesses (chronic health conditions) stay engaged in school and improve their grades?",
  "key_messages": [
    "We cannot be sure that school support programmes (education support services) improve school engagement (how often and how actively a child participates in school) or academic achievement (grades or test scores) for children and teens with chronic health conditions (long‑term illnesses), because only a few small, low‑quality studies were found and they gave mixed results; no harmful effects were reported.",
    "There is some limited evidence that these programmes may slightly improve mental health, such as self‑esteem (how positively a person feels about themselves), but the evidence is still uncertain.",
    "Future research needs larger, well‑designed studies that look at both benefits and any possible harms, and that follow children over longer periods to determine whether education support truly helps school participation and grades."

      "subheading": "Why are chronic health conditions a problem for school life?",
      "content": "A chronic health condition is a long‑lasting illness that does not resolve on its own and is rarely cured completely (e.g., asthma, diabetes, cancer, ADHD). Up to half of children and adolescents may have such a condition, and about 5 % have severe forms that limit daily activities. Frequent illness or treatment appointments and missed school days can reduce school engagement—the degree to which a student feels connected to, participates in, and enjoys school. Lower engagement is linked to poorer academic achievement, reduced social‑emotional development, and limited future opportunities. Education support services (such as tutoring, individualized learning plans, or school‑re‑entry programs) aim to keep these students learning and feeling part of school."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to (1) describe the types of educational support interventions that are being used for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, and (2) examine whether these interventions improve school engagement and academic achievement. Secondary outcomes of interest included mental health, quality of life, and the success of transitioning back to school after periods of illness."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched multiple health, education, and social‑science databases for studies involving children and adolescents with chronic health conditions that included educational support and reported outcomes on school engagement or academic achievement. Eligible studies were those that compared an educational support intervention with usual care or another intervention. Findings were summarised using vote‑counting of effect direction, and confidence in the evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach."
    }
  ],
  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We included four randomised controlled trials with a total of 359 children aged 4 to 18 years who had chronic health conditions. Three of the trials focused on children with cancer and one on children with attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). All studies compared an educational support intervention with usual care or no additional support. The abstract does not give details about gender distribution, severity of illness beyond the chronic diagnosis, the countries or settings, the length of the intervention periods, or the sources of funding."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: School engagement and related outcomes",
      "content": "Education support may increase school engagement, but we are very uncertain about the result. It may also increase academic achievement and the chance of a smooth transition back to school, again with very high uncertainty. There is a small possible increase in self‑esteem, but the evidence is also very uncertain."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small with not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2021 of search."
