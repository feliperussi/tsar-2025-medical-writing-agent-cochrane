  "draft": "Do school support programs (education support services) help children and teens with long‑term illnesses (chronic health conditions) stay engaged in school and improve their grades?\n\n**Key messages**\n- We cannot be sure that school support programmes (education support services) improve school engagement (how often and how actively a child participates in school) or academic achievement (grades or test scores) for children and teens with chronic health conditions (long‑term illnesses), because only a few small, low‑quality studies were found and they gave mixed results; no harmful effects were reported.\n- There is some limited evidence that these programmes may slightly improve mental health, such as self‑esteem (how positively a person feels about themselves), but the evidence is still uncertain.\n- Future research needs larger, well‑designed studies that look at both benefits and any possible harms, and that follow children over longer periods to determine whether education support truly helps school participation and grades.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy are chronic health conditions a problem for school life?\nA chronic health condition is a long‑lasting illness that does not resolve on its own and is rarely cured completely (e.g., asthma, diabetes, cancer, ADHD). Up to half of children and adolescents may have such a condition, and about 5 % have severe forms that limit daily activities. Frequent illness or treatment appointments and missed school days can reduce school engagement—the degree to which a student feels connected to, participates in, and enjoys school. Lower engagement is linked to poorer academic achievement, reduced social‑emotional development, and limited future opportunities. Education support services (such as tutoring, individualized learning plans, or school‑re‑entry programs) aim to keep these students learning and feeling part of school.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe review set out to (1) describe the types of educational support interventions that are being used for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, and (2) examine whether these interventions improve school engagement and academic achievement. Secondary outcomes of interest included mental health, quality of life, and the success of transitioning back to school after periods of illness.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched multiple health, education, and social‑science databases for studies involving children and adolescents with chronic health conditions that included educational support and reported outcomes on school engagement or academic achievement. Eligible studies were those that compared an educational support intervention with usual care or another intervention. Findings were summarised using vote‑counting of effect direction, and confidence in the evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe included four randomised controlled trials with a total of 359 children aged 4 to 18 years who had chronic health conditions. Three of the trials focused on children with cancer and one on children with attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). All studies compared an educational support intervention with usual care or no additional support. The abstract does not give details about gender distribution, severity of illness beyond the chronic diagnosis, the countries or settings, the length of the intervention periods, or the sources of funding.\nMain results: School engagement and related outcomes\nEducation support may increase school engagement, but we are very uncertain about the result. It may also increase academic achievement and the chance of a smooth transition back to school, again with very high uncertainty. There is a small possible increase in self‑esteem, but the evidence is also very uncertain.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small with not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2021 of search.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failed: subheadings are not phrased as questions, which the Master Style Guide requires. The draft uses generic headings (Key messages, Introduction/Aims, Methods, Results, Limitations, Currency) instead of question‑style headings (e.g., \"What did we find?\", \"How were the studies selected?\"). This structural issue must be corrected before the PLS can be approved. Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers:\n1. Long, parenthetical sentence in the first key message – overloads the reader with multiple definitions and clauses.\n2. Unexplained technical terms such as “vote‑counting”, “GRADE approach”, and “high uncertainty”.\n3. Complex noun‑heavy sentences (e.g., \"The abstract does not give details about gender distribution…\") that could be expressed more directly.\nThese issues are supported by the metrics: the draft has 14 passive constructions (P75) and a high nominalisation count (42, BEYOND_P90), indicating noun‑heavy phrasing. Reducing nominalisations and simplifying sentences will improve readability.\nSuggested top improvements:\n- Rewrite subheadings as questions (e.g., change \"Methods\" to \"How did we find the evidence?\").\n- Shorten the first key‑message sentence and split into two sentences.\n- Define or replace technical terms with plain language.\n- Convert noun‑heavy sentences to active‑voice verbs.\nAddressing the subheading format and the clarity points will bring the PLS into compliance with the style guide and improve patient‑readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability metrics (e.g., FKGL 13.4, FRE 41) are within typical PLS ranges. However, it deviates markedly in nominalisations (42, BEYOND_P90), noun count (214, BEYOND_P90), and complex word counts (complex_words 139, long_words 224, both BEYOND_P90), indicating a noun‑heavy, complex style. These metric deviations align with the identified clarity issues and support the need for more active, concise language."
