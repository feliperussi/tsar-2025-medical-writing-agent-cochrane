  "draft": "Do birth control pills that contain drospirenone (a synthetic hormone) reduce premenstrual syndrome symptoms and cause more side effects compared with placebo?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Drospirenone‑containing combined oral contraceptives (pills that include both estrogen and the synthetic hormone drospirenone) may reduce overall premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms compared with placebo (inactive pill), but the evidence is limited and comes from studies with methodological weaknesses; the pills also appear to cause more unwanted side effects, leading to more women stopping the medication.\n- These pills may also lead to modest improvements in daily functioning, such as work productivity, social activities, and relationships, although the supporting evidence is similarly limited.\n- Because the current research is not robust and does not address longer‑term use, less severe symptoms, or comparisons with other hormonal contraceptives, further well‑designed, longer‑duration studies are needed to clarify the true benefits and harms.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is premenstrual syndrome and why does it matter?\nMany women experience physical and emotional changes in the days before their period – this is called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). For some, the symptoms are very severe and are known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These symptoms can include mood swings, irritability, pain, and problems with sleep or concentration, and they can interfere with work, school, relationships and everyday activities. Because PMS and especially PMDD affect a large number of women of reproductive age, finding safe and effective ways to relieve these symptoms is an important health priority. Common approaches include lifestyle changes, antidepressant medicines, and hormonal treatments such as combined oral contraceptives (COCs). A COC contains two hormones – an estrogen and a progestin – that prevent pregnancy but can also influence menstrual‑related symptoms. One particular progestin, drospirenone, combined with a low dose of estrogen (ethinylestradiol), has been approved in some countries for treating PMDD in women who also want contraception.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review authors set out to answer two main questions: (1) Does a combined oral contraceptive that contains drospirenone and a low dose of estrogen reduce the severity of premenstrual symptoms in women with PMS or PMDD? and (2) Is this drospirenone‑containing pill safe, meaning does it cause more side‑effects or lead to people stopping the treatment compared with a placebo? By looking at all the relevant randomised trials, they aimed to determine how well the drospirenone pill works and whether any benefits are outweighed by potential harms.\n\n**Methods**\nWe identified studies that examined drospirenone‑containing combined oral contraceptives for premenstrual syndrome, extracted data on symptom improvement and adverse events, synthesized the results, and assessed the confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review included five randomised controlled trials involving a total of 858 women, most of whom were diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). All participants were female; the abstract did not give age ranges or other demographic details. The trials compared combined oral contraceptives that contain drospirenone and ethinylestradiol with a placebo. No studies compared drospirenone‑containing pills with other combined oral contraceptives. Details about how long each study lasted, the countries or settings where they were carried out, and the sources of funding were not reported.\n\nMain results: Effect on premenstrual symptoms and side‑effects\nDrospirenone‑containing combined oral contraceptives may reduce overall premenstrual symptoms a little, but the evidence is uncertain. They might also improve how premenstrual (sic) symptoms affect daily life—such as work, social activities and relationships—slightly, again with uncertain evidence. However, these pills appear to increase the chance that women stop taking them because of side‑effects. Roughly 6 to 16 out of 100 women might stop the drospirenone pill compared with about 3 out of 100 who would stop a placebo. Overall side‑effects may occur in about 40 to 54 out of 100 women on the drospirenone pill versus about 28 out of 100 on placebo. Women may feel the treatment works a little more often with the drospirenone pill (about 39 to 58 out of 100) than with placebo (about 36 out of 100), but this increase is modest and uncertain.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, and the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the section subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement for question‑style subheadings. In addition, the text contains several clarity and readability problems that would confuse a patient reader:\n\n1. **Subheadings not in question form** – \"Key messages\" should be something like \"What are the main findings?\"; \"Methods\" could be \"How did we find the evidence?\" etc.\n2. **Heavy use of passive voice** – example: \"All participants were female; the abstract did not give age ranges or other demographic details.\" Passive constructions obscure who did what and the metrics show 26 passive instances (well beyond the typical PLS range). Rewrite as active: \"All participants were women, and the abstract did not report their ages or other demographics.\"\n3. **Long, dense sentences** – example: \"The review included five randomised controlled trials involving a total of 858 women, most of whom were diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).\" This 27‑word sentence can be split for easier reading: \"We found five randomised trials that together included 858 women. Most of these women had premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).\"\n4. **Unexplained technical terms** – terms such as \"combined oral contraceptives (COCs)\", \"drospirenone\", and \"ethinylestradiol\" appear without simple definitions. Patients may not know that COCs are birth‑control pills containing two hormones. Add brief explanations: \"Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are birth‑control pills that contain two hormones – estrogen and a progestin such as drospirenone.\"\n5. **Noun‑heavy wording** – the draft has 195 nouns (well above the typical PLS range) and many complex words (171) and long words (243), making the text feel dense. Re‑write noun‑heavy phrases as actions, e.g., change \"Main results: Effect on premenstrual symptoms and side‑effects\" to \"What did we find about symptoms and side‑effects?\".\n\nBy addressing these five points—re‑phrasing subheadings as questions, converting passive sentences to active voice, breaking up long sentences, defining jargon, and reducing noun‑heavy language—the summary will meet the style guide and be much clearer for patients.\n\n**Metrics support**: The PLS evaluation shows 26 passive voice instances (BEYOND_P90), SMOG index 15.5 (BEYOND_P90), 325 Dale‑Chall complex words, 171 complex words, and 243 long words—all far above typical PLS ranges, confirming the need for the suggested simplifications.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "Word count is within the 850‑word limit (761 words). Overall conformity is moderate, but several metrics deviate strongly: passive voice (26 instances, beyond P90), SMOG index (15.5, beyond P90), complex words (171, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall complex words (325, beyond P90), and long words (243, beyond P90). These indicate the draft is overly complex and uses too many passive constructions, supporting the recommended edits."
