  "draft": "Does audit and feedback (measuring clinicians' performance and giving them the results) improve professional practice?\n\nKey messages\n- Audit and feedback (measuring clinicians' performance and giving them the results) can lead to modest improvements in professional practice, and no harmful effects were reported; the overall evidence is of moderate quality.\n- The impact of audit and feedback tends to be greater when the information is given to individual clinicians (rather than teams), includes a trusted local champion (a supportive colleague), uses interactive formats (both verbal and written), compares performance to top‑performing peers, and provides clear action plans; many studies also combined audit and feedback with other strategies such as education.\n- Further high‑quality research is needed to identify the most effective ways to design audit and feedback, especially in different healthcare settings and to assess longer‑term effects on practice.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhy is improving healthcare professionals’ practice important?\nDoctors, nurses and other clinicians make many everyday decisions – for example, which medicines to prescribe or which diagnostic tests to order. When these decisions do not follow the best evidence, patients may receive care that is less effective, more costly, or even harmful. Across hospitals and clinics, there is often wide variation in how clinicians practice, meaning that some patients get better care than others. One way to help clinicians see where they could improve is through audit and feedback. An audit is a systematic check of what clinicians actually do over a set period (e.g., how often a certain drug is prescribed). Feedback is the process of giving clinicians a clear report of those results, often comparing their performance to a target or to the performance of top‑performing peers. By showing clinicians where their practice differs from recommended standards, audit and feedback aim to prompt them to change their behaviour and provide higher‑quality care.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to know whether audit and feedback really helps clinicians improve their practice and, if so, how big the improvement is. They also set out to explore which features of audit and feedback programmes (for example, giving individual‑level data versus team‑level data, using a local champion, providing interactive feedback, or including an action plan) make the interventions work better. In short, the review assessed the overall effect of audit and feedback on professional practice and examined the factors that explain differences in its effectiveness.\n\nMethods\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that evaluated audit‑and‑feedback interventions on healthcare professional practice, combined their results in meta‑analyses (including meta‑regressions to explore influencing factors), and rated the certainty of the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 292 randomised trials that tested audit and feedback to change how health professionals work. These trials had 678 groups that received the intervention. Most of the trials (81%) focused on doctors; other health workers were less common. The main behaviours studied were prescribing medicines (47% of trials) and ordering tests (35%). Almost all studies were done in high‑income countries; only 26 (9%) were in low‑ or middle‑income countries. The interventions often combined audit and feedback with extra actions such as clinician education (56% of groups) and reminders (15%). The usual comparison was standard care or no feedback, though some used peer‑comparison feedback. Details such as the total number of participants, length of the intervention, follow‑up time, and funding sources were not reported in the abstract.\n\nMain results: Effect of audit and feedback on professional practice\nAudit and feedback probably leads to a small increase in the number of clinicians who improve their practice. About 6 out of every 100 clinicians are likely to change their behaviour when audit and feedback is used. The effect is probably bigger when feedback is given to individuals rather than teams, when performance is compared with top peers, when a local champion is involved, when the feedback is interactive, includes facilitation and clear action plans, and when baseline performance is low or the audit and feedback is combined with other co‑interventions.\n\nLimitations\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2020 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions – sections such as \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are written as statements, not questions. This breaches the Master Style Guide and must be corrected. In addition, the text contains several clarity problems that would confuse readers:\n1. **Long, dense sentence** – \"The effect is probably bigger when feedback is given to individuals rather than teams, when performance is compared with top peers, when a local champion is involved, when the feedback is interactive, includes facilitation and clear action plans, and when baseline performance is low or the audit and feedback is combined with other co‑interventions.\" This 45‑word sentence packs many ideas and uses several commas, making it hard to follow. Rewrite as a series of short sentences or bullet points.\n2. **Passive voice and nominalisation** – \"The effect is probably bigger when feedback is given to individuals rather than teams\" and \"The evidence is up to date to June 2020 of search.\" Passive constructions obscure who is doing the action and increase noun‑heavy phrasing. Convert to active voice (e.g., \"We found a larger effect when we gave feedback to individual clinicians…\").\n3. **Jargon without definition** – terms such as \"co‑interventions\", \"baseline performance\", \"meta‑regressions\" appear without plain‑language explanation, which may leave a patient reader puzzled. Provide brief lay definitions or replace with simpler words (e.g., \"additional support activities\" for co‑interventions).\n4. **Noun‑heavy paragraphs** – the draft contains 220 nouns and 23 nominalisations, far above typical plain‑language ranges. This makes sentences feel dense. Re‑write sentences to use more verbs and fewer abstract nouns (e.g., change \"the presence of a local champion\" to \"a trusted colleague helps\").\n5. **Missing question‑style subheadings** – each heading should be a question to guide the reader (e.g., change \"Methods\" to \"How did we find the evidence?\").\nThese issues, together with the metric deviations (nominalisation 23 → beyond P90, nouns 220 → beyond P90, complex words 153 → beyond P90, long words 238 → beyond P90, SMOG 14.4 → beyond P90), indicate the draft needs substantive editing before it can be approved.",

These indicate excessive noun‑heavy, complex language that reduces plain‑language clarity and should be reduced."
