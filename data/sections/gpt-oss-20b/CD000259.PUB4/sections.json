  "key_messages": [
    "Audit and feedback (measuring clinicians' performance and giving them the results) can lead to modest improvements in professional practice, and no harmful effects were reported; the overall evidence is of moderate quality.",
    "The impact of audit and feedback tends to be greater when the information is given to individual clinicians (rather than teams), includes a trusted local champion (a supportive colleague), uses interactive formats (both verbal and written), compares performance to top‑performing peers, and provides clear action plans; many studies also combined audit and feedback with other strategies such as education.",
    "Further high‑quality research is needed to identify the most effective ways to design audit and feedback, especially in different healthcare settings and to assess longer‑term effects on practice."

      "subheading": "Why is improving healthcare professionals’ practice important?",
      "content": "Doctors, nurses and other clinicians make many everyday decisions – for example, which medicines to prescribe or which diagnostic tests to order. When these decisions do not follow the best evidence, patients may receive care that is less effective, more costly, or even harmful. Across hospitals and clinics, there is often wide variation in how clinicians practice, meaning that some patients get better care than others. One way to help clinicians see where they could improve is through audit and feedback. An audit is a systematic check of what clinicians actually do over a set period (e.g., how often a certain drug is prescribed). Feedback is the process of giving clinicians a clear report of those results, often comparing their performance to a target or to the performance of top‑performing peers. By showing clinicians where their practice differs from recommended standards, audit and feedback aim to prompt them to change their behaviour and provide higher‑quality care."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether audit and feedback really helps clinicians improve their practice and, if so, how big the improvement is. They also set out to explore which features of audit and feedback programmes (for example, giving individual‑level data versus team‑level data, using a local champion, providing interactive feedback, or including an action plan) make the interventions work better. In short, the review assessed the overall effect of audit and feedback on professional practice and examined the factors that explain differences in its effectiveness."

      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies that evaluated audit‑and‑feedback interventions on healthcare professional practice, combined their results in meta‑analyses (including meta‑regressions to explore influencing factors), and rated the certainty of the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at 292 randomised trials that tested audit and feedback to change how health professionals work. These trials had 678 groups that received the intervention. Most of the trials (81%) focused on doctors; other health workers were less common. The main behaviours studied were prescribing medicines (47% of trials) and ordering tests (35%). Almost all studies were done in high‑income countries; only 26 (9%) were in low‑ or middle‑income countries. The interventions often combined audit and feedback with extra actions such as clinician education (56% of groups) and reminders (15%). The usual comparison was standard care or no feedback, though some used peer‑comparison feedback. Details such as the total number of participants, length of the intervention, follow‑up time, and funding sources were not reported in the abstract."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Effect of audit and feedback on professional practice",
      "content": "Audit and feedback probably leads to a small increase in the number of clinicians who improve their practice. About 6 out of every 100 clinicians are likely to change their behaviour when audit and feedback is used. The effect is probably bigger when feedback is given to individuals rather than teams, when performance is compared with top peers, when a local champion is involved, when the feedback is interactive, includes facilitation and clear action plans, and when baseline performance is low or the audit and feedback is combined with other co‑interventions."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are moderately confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2020 of search."
