  "draft": "Does audit and feedback (measuring clinicians' performance and giving them the results) improve professional practice?\n\nKey messages\n- Audit and feedback can produce modest improvements in how clinicians work, and no harmful effects were reported; the overall certainty of the evidence is moderate.\n- The effect is larger when we give feedback to individual clinicians, involve a trusted colleague (a local champion), use both spoken and written formats, compare performance with top‑performing peers, and provide clear action plans. Many studies also added education or reminders as extra support.\n- More high‑quality research is needed to fine‑tune the design of audit and feedback, especially in different health‑care settings and over longer periods.\n\nWhy is improving healthcare professionals’ practice important?\nClinicians make daily decisions about medicines they prescribe and tests they order. When these decisions do not follow the best evidence, patients may receive care that is less effective, more costly, or even harmful. Across hospitals and clinics, practice varies widely, so some patients get better care than others. Audit (a systematic check of what clinicians actually do over a set period) and feedback (a clear report of those results, often compared with a target or top peers) help clinicians see where they could improve and encourage higher‑quality care.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether audit and feedback really help clinicians improve their practice and, if so, how big the improvement is. We also examined which features of audit and feedback programmes—such as giving individual‑level data, involving a local champion, using interactive formats, or adding an action plan—make the interventions work better.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched databases for randomised trials that tested audit‑and‑feedback interventions on health‑professional practice. We combined the results in meta‑analyses and explored factors that might influence the effect (meta‑regressions). We also rated the certainty of the evidence using standard methods.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 292 trials (678 intervention groups). Most participants were doctors; the main behaviours targeted were prescribing medicines (47 % of trials) and ordering tests (35 %). The studies were mostly from high‑income countries; only 9 % were from low‑ or middle‑income settings. Many interventions combined audit and feedback with extra actions such as clinician education (56 % of groups) or reminders (15 %).\n\nMain results: Effect of audit and feedback on professional practice\nWe found that audit and feedback probably leads to a small increase in the number of clinicians who improve their practice. About 6 out of every 100 clinicians are likely to change their behaviour when audit and feedback is used.\n\nThe effect is larger when:\n- We give feedback to individual clinicians rather than to whole teams.\n- We compare performance with top‑performing peers or a benchmark.\n- A trusted colleague (local champion) supports the clinician.\n- The feedback uses both verbal and written formats and encourages interaction.\n- We include clear, specific action plans that tell clinicians how to improve.\n- Baseline performance is low (clinicians had room for improvement before the intervention).\n- The audit and feedback is combined with additional support activities such as education or reminders.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Some studies may have been aware of their group allocation, which can influence behaviour. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, and the interventions varied in who delivered them and how they were presented.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThis review updates our previous work and includes studies published up to June 2020.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because two subheadings are not phrased as questions, which the Master Style Guide requires. Additionally, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers: (1) the subheading \"Key messages\" should be a question; (2) the subheading \"Main results: Effect of audit and feedback on professional practice\" should be re‑worded as a question; (3) the term \"co‑interventions\" is used without explanation for a lay audience; (4) the draft contains a high number of nominalisations and noun‑heavy sentences (e.g., \"Main results: Effect of audit and feedback on professional practice\"), which makes the text less direct; (5) overall noun density and complex‑word counts are well above typical PLS ranges (nouns 173 vs median <116, complex_words 125 vs median <84, long_words 187 vs median <122, nominalisations 1 22 vs median <13). These issues reduce readability and do not meet the style guide. Suggested rewrites are provided below.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading \"Key messages\"** – Problem: not a question. Rewrite: \"What are the key messages?\"\n2. **Subheading \"Main results: Effect of audit and feedback on professional practice\"** – Problem: not a question and noun‑heavy. Rewrite: \"What were the main results on professional practice?\"\n3. **Term \"co‑interventions\"** – Problem: jargon without definition. Rewrite: \"additional support activities (called co‑interventions, such as education sessions or reminder systems)\"\n4. **Nominalisation in the results heading** – Problem: noun‑heavy phrasing. Rewrite the sentence \"We found that audit and feedback probably leads to a small increase…\" to \"We found that audit and feedback probably improves practice a little…\"\n5. **Overall noun and complex‑word density** – Problem: exceeds typical PLS patterns, making the text harder to read. Suggested edit: replace noun‑heavy phrases with active verbs, e.g., change \"The effect is larger when we give feedback to individual clinicians\" to \"Feedback works better when we give it to individual clinicians instead of whole teams.\"\n\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide, improve readability for patients, and align the linguistic metrics with typical PLS patterns.",

These indicate a noun‑heavy, complex‑word style that should be reduced to improve plain‑language clarity."
