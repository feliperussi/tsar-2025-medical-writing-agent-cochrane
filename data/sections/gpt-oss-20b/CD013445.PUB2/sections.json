  "plain_title": "Is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a skin‑through kidney stone removal surgery) better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a scope‑through‑the‑ureter procedure) for treating kidney stones in adults?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a skin‑through kidney stone removal surgery) may increase the likelihood of being stone‑free (having no remaining stones) and may lower the need for additional procedures, while serious side effects appear similar to retrograde intrarenal surgery (a scope‑through‑the‑ureter procedure); however, it may result in a longer stay in hospital. The overall evidence is limited, so confidence in these findings is modest.",
    "The review did not find information on unplanned medical visits after treatment or on patients’ quality of life, so the impact of the two procedures on these outcomes remains unknown.",
    "Future research should include well‑designed, larger studies that report patient‑reported outcomes, long‑term safety, and cost, to provide clearer guidance on the relative benefits and harms of these surgical options."

      "subheading": "What are kidney stones and how are they usually treated?",
      "content": "Kidney stones (also called renal stones) are hard deposits that form inside the kidneys. They can cause severe pain, block the flow of urine, and lead to infections. The way doctors treat kidney stones depends on the stone’s size, location, composition, and the patient’s overall health. Options include simply watching the stone, using shock‑wave lithotripsy (a machine that breaks stones into small pieces), or performing procedures that go inside the urinary tract. Two common minimally invasive procedures are:\n\n- **Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)** – a small incision is made in the back and a tube (called a nephroscope) is passed directly into the kidney to break and remove the stone.\n- **Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS)** – a thin tube (ureteroscope) is inserted through the urethra, bladder, and ureter up into the kidney, where a laser is used to fragment the stone.\n\nBoth aim to make the patient “stone‑free,” meaning no visible stone fragments remain, while trying to keep complications low."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out about PCNL and RIRS?",
      "content": "The review authors set out to compare PCNL and RIRS in adults with kidney stones. Specifically, they wanted to know which procedure:\n\n- Achieves a higher stone‑free rate (the proportion of patients with no remaining stone fragments).\n- Leads to fewer major complications (serious side‑effects that may require additional treatment or hospital care).\n- Reduces the need for secondary interventions (extra procedures needed after the first treatment).\n- Affects other outcomes such as length of hospital stay, ureteral injury, unplanned medical visits, and quality of life.\n\nIn short, the goal was to determine which method provides the best balance of effectiveness and safety for treating renal stones in adults."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 42 randomised controlled‑trial studies that together included 4,571 adults with kidney stones. The trials compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) – performed with standard (≥24 Fr), mini‑PCNL (15–23 Fr) or ultra‑mini/micro‑PCNL (<15 Fr) instruments – with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). Participants had stones ranging from about 10 mm to 39 mm. The abstracts did not give details on participants’ ages, gender, the countries where the studies were done, the length of follow‑up, or the source of funding and conflicts of interest. No studies reported on unplanned medical visits or quality‑of‑life outcomes."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Stone‑free rate and other outcomes",
      "content": "PCNL may increase the chance of becoming stone‑free compared with RIRS – roughly 10 more people per 100 treated become stone‑free. It probably makes little or no difference to the risk of major complications (about 1 fewer major complication per 100 people). PCNL may reduce the need for additional procedures, with about 15 fewer people per 100 requiring another procedure. It may lead to a longer hospital stay, on average about one day more than RIRS. PCNL probably makes little or no difference to the risk of ureteral strictures (about 1 in 1,000). No evidence was found for unplanned medical visits or quality‑of‑life outcomes."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and because the studies were very small.",
