  "draft": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (a brain‑stimulation treatment) as effective and safer than electroconvulsive therapy (electric shock treatment) for people with schizophrenia?\n\n**What are the key messages?**\n- Based on the only study, MST (magnetic seizure therapy, a brain‑stimulation treatment that uses magnetic fields to cause a brief seizure) does not clearly outperform or underperform ECT (electroconvulsive therapy, which uses electric currents to cause a seizure) for overall schizophrenia symptoms; however, MST may cause fewer delayed‑memory problems and may improve thinking abilities, though the evidence is very uncertain.\n- The review relies on a single small trial with several methodological problems, so confidence in the findings is very low.\n- Larger, well‑designed randomised trials are needed to determine whether MST offers any real advantage over ECT.\n\n**Why is schizophrenia a challenging health problem?**\nSchizophrenia is a common, serious mental illness that affects thoughts, feelings and behaviour. It can cause hearing voices, odd beliefs and loss of interest in daily activities. These symptoms often prevent work, study or relationships, leading to high disability. Antipsychotic medication is the main treatment, but about one in five people do not get enough relief and need other options.\n\n**What is magnetic seizure therapy and why might it help?**\nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer, non‑invasive brain‑stimulation technique. It delivers brief, strong magnetic pulses to cause a short seizure, similar to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) but without the electric currents that can cause more side‑effects. Researchers hope MST can improve schizophrenia symptoms while causing fewer memory and cognitive side‑effects than ECT.\n\n**What did the review aim to find out?**\nWe wanted to see whether MST is effective and safe for people with schizophrenia. Specifically we compared MST (alone or with standard care) to ECT or other treatments, looking at overall mental state, positive and negative symptoms, cognitive function, side‑effects and early discontinuation.\n\n**How did we search for studies?**\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s register (which includes CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Embase, ISRCTN, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed and WHO ICTRP) up to 6 March 2022 for randomised trials that compared MST with other treatments in schizophrenia.\n\n**How did we combine the results?**\nWe pooled data from eligible trials to estimate overall effects on each outcome.\n\n**How did we assess confidence?**\nWe rated confidence in the evidence using a standard framework (GRADE).\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found one four‑week randomised trial with 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The trial compared MST plus standard care with ECT plus standard care. The report gave no details about location, funding or participant demographics. The results were uncertain: we could not tell whether MST changed overall state, symptom scores, positive or negative symptoms, delayed‑memory problems, overall cognition, cognitive improvement or early dropout compared with ECT.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nWe are not confident because participants likely knew which treatment they received, the study was small and did not report all outcomes we wanted.\n\n**How current is the evidence?**\nThe evidence is up to date to the March 2022 search.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required structural and factual checks, but three key clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – terms such as \"randomised trial\", \"acute schizophrenia\", \"standard care\", \"delayed‑memory problems\" and \"cognitive function\" appear without plain‑language definitions. Example: \"We found one four‑week randomised trial with 79 adults with acute schizophrenia.\" Rewrite: \"We found one four‑week study that randomly assigned 79 adults who were experiencing a severe flare‑up of schizophrenia (called ‘acute schizophrenia’) to the two treatments.\"\n2. **Overly long sentence** – the sentence in the Results section bundles many outcomes together, making it hard to follow. Original: \"The results were uncertain: we could not tell whether MST changed overall state, symptom scores, positive or negative symptoms, delayed‑memory problems, overall cognition, cognitive improvement or early dropout compared with ECT.\" Rewrite: \"The results were uncertain. We could not tell whether MST improved overall condition, symptom scores, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, delayed‑memory problems, overall thinking ability, any cognitive improvement, or whether people left the study early, compared with ECT.\"\n3. **Noun‑heavy phrasing / lack of plain language** – phrases like \"the report gave no details about location, funding or participant demographics\" use abstract nouns that add distance. Rewrite: \"The study did not say where it was done, who funded it, or details about the participants (such as age or gender).\"\nThese changes address the most likely sources of confusion for patients. The PLS evaluation also flags high nominalisation (22 instances) and a high count of difficult words (224 complex Dale‑Chall words and 166 long words), supporting the need to simplify language and use more verbs instead of noun forms.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns overall (77.8% of features in best quartile). However, three metrics deviate: nominalisation (22, above typical median), complex Dale‑Chall words (224, above median), and long words (166, above median). These suggest the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words than usual, reinforcing the recommended simplifications."
