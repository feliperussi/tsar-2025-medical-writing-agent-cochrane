  "plain_title": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (a brain‑stimulation treatment) as effective and safer than electroconvulsive therapy (electric shock treatment) for people with schizophrenia?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Based on the only available study, magnetic seizure therapy (MST) (a brain‑stimulation treatment that uses magnetic fields to induce seizures) does not appear to be clearly better or worse than electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (a treatment that uses electric currents to induce seizures) for overall improvement of schizophrenia symptoms; however, MST may lead to fewer problems with delayed memory (trouble remembering things later) and may improve thinking abilities (cognitive function) compared with ECT, though the evidence is very uncertain.",
    "The review’s conclusions are limited because they rely on a single small trial that had several methodological problems, so the overall confidence in these findings is very low.",
    "More well‑designed, larger randomised trials are needed to determine whether MST truly offers any advantage over ECT in effectiveness or safety for people with schizophrenia."

      "subheading": "Why is schizophrenia a challenging health problem?",
      "content": "Schizophrenia is a common and serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It can cause symptoms such as hearing voices, having strange beliefs, and losing interest in everyday activities. These symptoms often make it hard for people to work, study, or maintain relationships, leading to a high level of disability. The main treatment for schizophrenia is medication called antipsychotics, but about one in five people do not get enough relief from these drugs and need other treatment options."

      "subheading": "What is magnetic seizure therapy and why might it help?",
      "content": "Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a newer, non‑invasive brain‑stimulation technique. It uses brief, strong magnetic pulses to create a short seizure in the brain, similar to the older method called electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), but without the electrical currents that can cause more side‑effects. Researchers are interested in MST because it might improve symptoms of schizophrenia while causing fewer memory problems and other cognitive side‑effects than ECT."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to determine whether MST is effective and safe for people with schizophrenia. Specifically, they set out to compare MST (alone or added to standard care) with ECT or other treatments, looking at how well it improves overall mental state, positive and negative symptoms, and cognitive function, as well as its side‑effects and how many people stop treatment early."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified a single randomised controlled trial that enrolled 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The four‑week study compared magnetic seizure therapy (MST) plus standard care with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care. No information was given about where the trial was conducted, who funded it, or details such as the participants’ ages, gender balance or severity beyond the label “acute” schizophrenia. The results were uncertain: it is unclear whether MST makes any difference to the overall state of people with schizophrenia, to overall symptom scores, to positive or negative symptoms, to the chance of delayed memory problems, to overall cognitive decline, to any cognitive improvement, or to the likelihood of participants leaving the study early for any reason, because of adverse effects, or because the treatment was ineffective, when compared with ECT."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and because studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search."
