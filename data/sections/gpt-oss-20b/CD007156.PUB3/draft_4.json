  "draft": "What treatments are effective for improving mouth opening and reducing burning in oral submucous fibrosis (a condition that tightens the mouth)?\n\nKey messages\n– Antioxidant tablets probably reduce the burning feeling and give a small increase in how far the mouth can open after a few months; side‑effects are usually mild, such as stomach upset.  \n– Pentoxifylline, a medicine that improves blood flow, probably adds a very small gain in mouth opening.  \n– For many other approaches – steroid injections into the mouth tissue, physiotherapy (guided exercises), or other blood‑vessel‑widening drugs – the current studies do not show clear benefits, and information on harms is limited.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease that makes the lining of the mouth stiff. It makes it hard to open the mouth, chew, speak and swallow. People with OSF often feel a painful burning sensation and have a lower quality of life. OSF also raises the risk of mouth cancer. The main cause is chewing areca nut (the seed of the betel‑quid plant). Treatment usually starts by stopping this habit and then tries many other options – medicines, surgery, physiotherapy, ultrasound or alternative therapies – but we do not know which are truly effective and safe.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe examined all randomised controlled trials that tested any intervention for OSF. We wanted to see whether the treatments help people eat, chew and speak normally, increase the distance between the upper and lower front teeth when the mouth is fully opened (mouth opening), lessen the burning sensation, improve overall wellbeing, and avoid harmful side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared a drug, surgical procedure or other therapy for OSF with a placebo or no active treatment. We combined the results and judged our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system, a standard method for rating certainty.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 30 trials that together involved 2,176 adults with oral submucous fibrosis confirmed by a tissue sample (a biopsy). The studies followed participants for less than three months, three to six months, or longer than six months. A wide range of interventions was tested, including oral antioxidants, pentoxifylline, other blood‑vessel‑widening drugs, steroid injections, hydrocortisone plus hyaluronidase, surgery, physiotherapy, ultrasound and various alternative therapies. Most trials compared an active treatment with placebo or no active treatment.\n\nMain results\n– Antioxidant tablets probably reduce the burning sensation. They may also make the mouth open a little more – on average less than 10 mm, which is below the amount most people notice as a real improvement.  \n– Pentoxifylline probably adds a small increase in mouth opening (about 2 mm on average).  \n– For other interventions such as steroid injections, other vasodilator drugs or physiotherapy, the evidence is very uncertain about any benefit for mouth opening or burning, and we have limited information on side‑effects.  \n– Reported side‑effects were generally mild, such as stomach upset, nausea or abdominal pain. One study of an abdominal fat graft reported serious harms in 3 of 30 participants, leading to a longer hospital stay; such serious events were rare overall.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the results because many participants likely knew which treatment they received, the studies were small, and not all outcomes were reported. The overall number of studies is insufficient to be certain about the benefits and harms.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nWe updated our previous review with searches completed up to September 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

By converting noun‑heavy phrases to active verbs and simplifying language, readability will improve and align better with typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but shows moderate conformity overall. Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease ≈ 50, FKGL ≈ 11). However, several linguistic features deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalizations (21, P90), noun count (169, P90), SMOG index (14.1, P90), and counts of complex/Dale‑Chall words are all higher than median, indicating noun‑heavy, complex language. Reducing nominalizations and simplifying vocabulary will bring the text closer to the typical PLS profile."
