  "draft": "What treatments are effective for improving mouth opening and reducing burning in oral submucous fibrosis (a condition that tightens the mouth)?\n\nKey messages\n- Antioxidant medicines taken by mouth probably give a small increase in how wide the mouth can open after a few months and probably lessen the burning feeling in the mouth; other drugs such as pentoxifylline (a medicine that improves blood flow) may give a very small improvement, but overall benefit is modest and side‑effects are usually mild.\n- For many other treatments that were tested – such as steroid injections placed directly into the mouth tissue (a medicine that reduces inflammation), physiotherapy (guided exercises), or other vasodilator drugs (medicines that widen blood vessels) – the current studies do not provide reliable evidence of benefit, and information on possible harms is very limited.\n- Most trials were small and had methodological problems, so we need larger, well‑designed studies that track mouth opening, burning sensation, quality of life and any side‑effects over longer periods.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease that stiffens the lining of the mouth, making it hard to open the mouth, chew, speak and swallow. It causes painful burning sensations and lowers quality of life. People with OSF also have a higher risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause is chewing areca nut (often found in betel‑quid). Current care includes stopping this habit and trying many other treatments – medicines, surgery, physiotherapy, ultrasound and alternative therapies – but it is unclear which are effective and safe.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe examined all randomised controlled trials that tested any intervention for OSF. We wanted to know whether these treatments improve the ability to eat, chew and speak normally, increase the distance between the upper and lower front teeth when the mouth is fully opened (mouth opening), reduce the burning sensation, and improve overall wellbeing, while also assessing any harmful side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared any drug, surgical or other therapy for OSF with placebo or no active treatment. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 30 trials with a total of 2,176 adult participants who had biopsy‑confirmed OSF. The studies varied in length, with follow‑up periods of less than three months, three to six months, and longer than six months. A wide range of interventions was tested, including systemic, locally delivered or topical drugs (such as antioxidants, pentoxifylline, vasodilators, steroid injections, hydrocortisone plus hyaluronidase), surgical procedures, physiotherapy, ultrasound and other alternative therapies. Most studies compared an active treatment with placebo or no active treatment.\n\nWhat did the main results show?\nAntioxidant medicines probably reduce the burning feeling in the mouth. They may also increase how wide the mouth can open, but only a little. Pentoxifylline probably leads to a small increase in mouth opening. For other interventions such as steroid injections, vasodilators or physiotherapy, the evidence is unclear about any benefit for mouth opening or burning sensation, and we also lack clear information on adverse effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many participants likely knew which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and not all outcomes were reported. The overall number of studies is insufficient to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nWe updated our previous review with searches completed up to September 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that all section subheadings must be phrased as questions – the \"Key messages\" heading is not a question. In addition, several clarity issues could confuse readers:\n1. The opening key‑messages bullet is a long, dense sentence with multiple ideas and jargon.\n2. Technical terms such as \"systemic\", \"locally delivered\", \"biopsy‑confirmed\" are not explained for a lay audience.\n3. Some sentences exceed 30 words, making them hard to follow (e.g., the sentence describing the review methods).\n4. The text is noun‑heavy (high nominalisation and long‑word counts) which reduces readability.\nThese issues, together with the subheading format problem, mean the PLS cannot be approved as‑is. Suggested improvements:\n- Change \"Key messages\" to a question heading (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\").\n- Split the long key‑messages bullet into two shorter bullets and replace jargon with plain language.\n- Add brief definitions for technical terms when first used.\n- Break long sentences into shorter ones (≤20 words) and use more active verbs.\n- Reduce nominalisations by converting noun phrases to verbs where possible.\nMetrics support these suggestions: nominalisation (23, P90) and long‑word count (192, P90) are well above typical PLS ranges, indicating excessive noun‑heavy language; words per sentence (21.4, P50) is acceptable but several individual sentences exceed 30 words, which can hinder comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability indices are around the median (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 43, FKGL 12.5). However, nominalisation, noun count, SMOG, complex‑word and long‑word metrics are all in the P90 range, showing the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical PLSs. Passive voice is within acceptable range, but the subheading format requirement is not met."
