  "draft": "What treatments are effective for improving mouth opening and reducing burning in oral submucous fibrosis (a condition that tightens the mouth)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Antioxidant medicines taken by mouth probably give a small increase in how wide the mouth can open after a few months and probably lessen the burning feeling in the mouth; side‑effects are usually mild (for example, stomach upset).  \n– Pentoxifylline – a drug that improves blood flow – may give a very small improvement in mouth opening, but the overall benefit is modest and serious harms are rare or not reported.  \n– For many other treatments – such as steroid injections into the mouth tissue, physiotherapy (guided exercises), or other vasodilator drugs (medicines that widen blood vessels) – current studies do not provide reliable evidence of benefit, and information on possible harms is very limited.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic condition that stiffens the lining of the mouth. It makes it hard to open the mouth, chew, speak and swallow. People with OSF often feel a painful burning sensation and have a lower quality of life. OSF also raises the risk of mouth cancer. The main cause is chewing areca nut (the seed of the betel‑quid plant). Current care starts with stopping this habit and then tries many other options – medicines, surgery, physiotherapy, ultrasound and alternative therapies – but it is unclear which are effective and safe.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe examined all randomised controlled trials that tested any intervention for OSF. We wanted to know whether these treatments improve the ability to eat, chew and speak normally, increase the distance between the upper and lower front teeth when the mouth is fully opened (mouth opening), reduce the burning sensation, and improve overall wellbeing. We also recorded any harmful side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared any drug, surgical procedure or other therapy for OSF with a placebo or no active treatment. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system, a standard method for judging certainty.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 30 trials with a total of 2,176 adult participants who had biopsy‑confirmed OSF (diagnosis confirmed by a tissue sample). The studies followed participants for less than three months, three to six months, or longer than six months. A wide range of interventions was tested, including systemic (taken by mouth), locally delivered or topical drugs such as antioxidants, pentoxifylline, vasodilators, steroid injections, and hydrocortisone plus hyaluronidase; as well as surgical procedures, physiotherapy, ultrasound and other alternative therapies. Most trials compared an active treatment with placebo or no active treatment.\n\nWhat were the main results?\n– Antioxidant medicines probably reduce the burning sensation. They may also increase mouth opening, but the increase is small (usually less than 10 mm, which is the minimal change many people notice).  \n– Pentoxifylline probably leads to a small increase in mouth opening.  \n– For other interventions – steroid injections, other vasodilator drugs or physiotherapy – the evidence is very uncertain about any benefit for mouth opening or burning, and we have limited information on side‑effects.  \n– Reported side‑effects were generally mild (such as stomach upset, nausea or abdominal pain). One study of an abdominal fat graft reported serious harms that required a longer hospital stay, but this was rare.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because many participants likely knew which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and not all outcomes were reported. The overall number of studies is insufficient to be certain about the results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nWe updated our previous review with searches completed up to September 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

Side‑effects are usually mild, such as stomach upset.\"\nThese changes address the most confusing parts and also reduce the high levels of nominalisation (23 instances, P90) and complex words (142, P90; complex_words_dc 297, BEYOND_P90) identified by the metrics. By shortening sentences (average words per sentence will drop below the current 22) and using more everyday language, the draft will become easier for patients to understand. Overall, while the factual content is accurate, the identified clarity issues are enough to warrant a revision before the summary can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is 660 words (within the 850‑word limit) and scores around the median for most readability indices (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 44.7, FKGL 12.5). However, several linguistic features deviate from typical PLS patterns: nominalisations (23, P90), total nouns (178, P90), SMOG index (14.7, P90), Dale‑Chall score (8.2, P90), complex words (142, P90) and especially complex words from Dale‑Chall (297, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words than is usual for plain‑language summaries, supporting the need for the suggested simplifications."
