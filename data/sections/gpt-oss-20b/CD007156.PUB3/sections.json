  "key_messages": [
    "Antioxidant medicines taken by mouth probably give a small increase in how wide the mouth can open after a few months (mouth opening is the distance between the upper and lower front teeth when the mouth is fully opened) and probably lessen the burning feeling in the mouth (a painful sensation); other drugs such as pentoxifylline (a medication that improves blood flow) may give a very small improvement, but the overall benefit is modest, and reported side‑effects were generally mild (e.g., stomach upset) with serious harms being rare or not reported.",
    "For many other treatments that were tested – such as steroid injections into the tissue (medicine that reduces inflammation, given directly into the mouth tissue), physiotherapy (guided exercises), or other vasodilator drugs (medicines that widen blood vessels) – the current studies do not provide reliable evidence of benefit, and information on possible harms is very limited.",
    "Because most of the available trials were small, had methodological problems (issues with how the study was done) and followed participants for only a short time, better‑designed, larger studies that track mouth opening, burning sensation, quality of life (overall wellbeing) and any side‑effects over longer periods are needed."

      "subheading": "What is oral submucous fibrosis and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic condition that stiffens the lining of the mouth, making it hard to open the mouth, chew, speak, and swallow. It causes painful burning sensations and reduces quality of life. People with OSF also have a higher risk of developing mouth cancer. The main cause is chewing areca nut (often found in betel‑quid). Current care includes stopping this habit and trying many other treatments—medicines, surgery, physiotherapy, ultrasound, and alternative therapies—but it is unclear which are effective and safe."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The review set out to examine all randomised controlled trials that tested any intervention for OSF. It aimed to determine whether these treatments improve key outcomes such as the ability to eat, chew, and speak normally, the mouth‑opening distance, the feeling of burning, and overall quality of life, while also assessing any harmful side effects. In short, the goal was to weigh the benefits and harms of each possible therapy for people living with oral submucous fibrosis."

      "content": "We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatments) evaluating any drug, surgical or other therapy for oral submucous fibrosis versus placebo or no treatment, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria (GRADE)."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The updated review included 30 randomised controlled trials with a total of 2,176 adult participants who had biopsy‑confirmed oral submucous fibrosis. The trials varied in length, with follow‑up periods of less than three months, three to six months, and longer than six months. No details were given about funding sources or the countries where the studies were conducted. All participants were adults with OSF, but the abstract did not report age, gender or disease severity. A wide range of interventions was tested, including systemic, locally delivered or topical drugs (such as antioxidants, pentoxifylline, vasodilators, intralesional dexamethasone, hydrocortisone plus hyaluronidase), surgical procedures, physiotherapy, ultrasound and other alternative therapies. Most studies compared an active treatment with placebo or no active treatment, and a few compared two active interventions."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Antioxidants reduce burning sensation",
      "content": "Antioxidant treatments probably produce a large reduction in the burning sensation that people with oral submucous fibrosis experience. They may also increase mouth opening, but only slightly. Pentoxifylline probably leads to a small increase in mouth opening as well. For other interventions such as intralesional dexamethasone, vasodilators or physiotherapy, the evidence is unclear regarding any benefit for mouth opening or burning sensation, and it is also unclear whether any of the treatments cause adverse effects."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, and the studies were very small, and there are not enough studies to be certain about the results.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search."
