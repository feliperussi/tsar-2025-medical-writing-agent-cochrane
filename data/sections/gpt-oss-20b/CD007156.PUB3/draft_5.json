  "draft": "What treatments are effective for improving mouth opening and reducing burning in oral submucous fibrosis (a condition that tightens the mouth)?\n\nKey messages\n– Antioxidant tablets probably lower the burning feeling and may increase mouth opening by less than 10 mm, a change most people would not notice; side‑effects are usually mild, such as stomach upset.  \n– Pentoxifylline, a medicine that improves blood flow, probably adds a very small gain in mouth opening (about 2 mm).  \n– For many other approaches – steroid injections into the mouth tissue, physiotherapy (guided exercises), or other blood‑vessel‑widening drugs – the current studies do not show clear benefits, and information on harms is limited.\n\nWhat is oral submucous fibrosis and why is it a problem?\nOral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease that stiffens the lining of the mouth. It makes it hard to open the mouth, chew, speak and swallow. People with OSF often feel a painful burning sensation and have a lower quality of life. OSF also raises the risk of mouth cancer. The main cause is chewing areca nut (the seed of the betel‑quid plant). Treatment usually starts by stopping this habit and then tries many other options – medicines, surgery, physiotherapy, ultrasound or alternative therapies – but we do not know which are truly effective and safe.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe examined all randomised controlled trials that tested any intervention for OSF. We wanted to see whether the treatments help people eat, chew and speak normally, increase the distance between the upper and lower front teeth when the mouth is fully opened (mouth opening), lessen the burning sensation, improve overall wellbeing, and avoid harmful side‑effects.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for randomised controlled trials that compared a drug, surgical procedure or other therapy for OSF with a placebo or no active treatment. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE system, a standard method for judging certainty.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 30 trials that together involved 2,176 adults with biopsy‑confirmed OSF. The studies followed participants for less than three months, three to six months, or longer than six months. A wide range of interventions was tested, including oral antioxidants, pentoxifylline, other blood‑vessel‑widening drugs, steroid injections, hydrocortisone plus hyaluronidase, surgery, physiotherapy, ultrasound and various alternative therapies. Most trials compared an active treatment with placebo or no active treatment.\n\nWhat are the main results?\n– Antioxidant tablets probably reduce burning and may increase mouth opening by less than 10 mm – a change most people would not notice.  \n– Pentoxifylline probably adds a small increase in mouth opening (about 2 mm).  \n– We have very little confidence in the evidence for other treatments such as steroid injections, other vasodilator drugs, hydrocortisone + hyaluronidase, or physiotherapy.  \n– Reported side‑effects were generally mild, such as stomach upset, nausea or abdominal pain. One study of an abdominal fat graft reported serious harms in 3 of 30 participants, leading to a longer hospital stay; such serious events were rare overall.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the results because many participants likely knew which treatment they received, the studies were small, and not all outcomes were reported. The overall number of studies is insufficient to be certain about the benefits and harms.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nWe updated our previous review with searches completed up to September 2022, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

  "evaluation": [
    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the subheading \"Key messages\" is not phrased as a question, which the Master Style Guide requires for all section headings. In addition, several clarity problems would likely confuse readers: (1) technical terms such as \"interincisal distance\" and \"GRADE system\" are used without plain-language explanations; (2) the sentence \"Antioxidant tablets probably lower the burning feeling and may increase mouth opening by less than 10 mm, a change most people would not notice; side‑effects are usually mild, such as stomach upset.\" is wordy and could be split for easier reading; (3) the draft contains a high density of nouns and complex, long words (163 nouns, 122 complex words, SMOG 13.8) which pushes the reading level above typical PLS ranges, making the text harder for patients. Suggested rewrites include: – Change the heading to \"What are the key messages?\" – Define \"interincisal distance (the gap between the front upper and lower teeth when the mouth is fully open)\" and \"GRADE (a system that grades how confident we are in the evidence)\" – Rewrite the antioxidant sentence as two shorter sentences: \"Antioxidant tablets probably reduce the burning feeling. They may also increase how wide the mouth can open, but the increase is less than 10 mm, which most people would not notice. Side‑effects are usually mild, such as stomach upset.\" – Replace some noun‑heavy phrases with active verbs and shorter words (e.g., \"we found\" instead of \"the review found\", \"use\" instead of \"utilize\"). These changes will bring the noun count and readability indices closer to typical PLS values and improve patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits and overall conforms to typical PLS patterns, but five metrics deviate: nouns (163, above the median of ~116), SMOG index (13.8, above median ~12.1), complex words (122, above median ~84), complex Dale‑Chall words (269, above median ~160), and long words (175, above median ~122). These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than usual, supporting the need to simplify language and reduce jargon."
