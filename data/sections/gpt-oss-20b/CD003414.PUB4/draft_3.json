  "draft": "Is a natural menstrual cycle, hormone medication, or ovulation‑inducing drugs the best way to prepare the uterus lining (endometrium) for a frozen embryo transfer?\n\nKey messages\n- Current research does not show a clear advantage of using a natural menstrual cycle, hormone tablets (estrogen and progesterone), or ovulation‑inducing medicines for preparing the uterus before a frozen‑thawed embryo transfer (FET); live‑birth rates and miscarriage rates are similar across methods and no specific safety concerns were identified.\n- Adding a drug that temporarily blocks the body’s own hormone signals (gonadotrophin‑releasing hormone agonist, GnRHa) to hormone tablets, or using a single injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to trigger ovulation, does not change live‑birth or miscarriage rates compared with standard approaches.\n- The existing studies are small and often poorly reported, so larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether any method offers better outcomes or fewer harms and to assess long‑term effects.\n\nWhat is frozen‑thawed embryo transfer and why do we need to prepare the uterus for it?\nWhen couples undergo in‑vitro fertilisation (IVF), embryos can be frozen and transferred later. This is called frozen‑thawed embryo transfer (FET). FET can increase the overall chance of pregnancy, lower treatment costs and is technically simpler than using fresh embryos. Before we place an embryo in the uterus, we must ensure that the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) is ready to receive it. Doctors can prepare the lining in three main ways:\n- Natural (spontaneous ovulatory) cycle – we let the woman’s own menstrual cycle run its course and transfer the embryo when the body naturally builds up the lining.\n- Hormone therapy (HT) cycle – we give estrogen and progesterone tablets to artificially build up the lining.\n- Ovulation‑induction cycle – we use medicines to trigger ovulation, creating a timing we can control.\nSometimes hormone therapy is combined with a gonadotrophin‑releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa), which temporarily suppresses the woman’s own hormone production for a more controlled environment.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the different ways of preparing the uterus for FET – natural cycles, hormone‑therapy cycles (with and without GnRHa), and ovulation‑induction cycles – to see which method is most effective and safest. We looked at live‑birth rates, miscarriage rates, ongoing‑pregnancy rates and multiple‑pregnancy rates.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared these preparation methods. We combined the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 32 trials involving 6,352 women undergoing FET. The trials compared natural cycles, HT cycles (with or without GnRHa), modified natural cycles that used an hCG trigger, and ovulation‑induction cycles. Direct comparisons included natural versus HT, natural versus HT + GnRHa, natural versus modified natural (hCG trigger), modified natural versus HT (with and without GnRHa), and HT versus HT + GnRHa.\n\nWhat were the main results for live‑birth outcomes?\nA natural cycle may slightly increase the chance of a live birth compared with a hormone‑therapy cycle, but the evidence is uncertain. When hormone‑therapy cycles include GnRHa suppression, a natural cycle probably makes little or no difference to live‑birth rates. Hormone‑therapy cycles probably make little or no difference to live‑birth rates whether or not GnRHa is added.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, many trials did not report all outcomes we wanted, and the studies were small or had few events.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates previous Cochrane reviews and includes evidence searched up to December 2022.",

(1) The first key‑message bullet packs several ideas into one long sentence with technical terms and an unexplained acronym (GnRHa), which will confuse patients. (2) Acronyms such as GnRHa and hCG are used before they are defined, leaving readers without a plain‑language explanation. (3) The text contains many complex and long words (e.g., “ovulation‑induction”, “modified natural cycle”, “gonadotrophin‑releasing hormone agonist”), contributing to a high Dale‑Chall score (8.55) and an excessive count of complex words (294) and long words (171). (4) Passive constructions are frequent (19 instances) and nominalisations are high (27), making sentences harder to follow. These issues reduce readability despite acceptable word count and factual accuracy. Suggested improvements: split long bullet sentences, introduce and define acronyms in plain language, replace complex terms with simpler alternatives, and convert passive phrasing to active voice.",

These indicate excessive jargon and sentence complexity that should be reduced for a patient‑focused summary."
