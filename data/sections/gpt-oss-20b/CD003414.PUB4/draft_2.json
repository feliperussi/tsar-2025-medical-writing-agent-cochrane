  "draft": "\"Is a natural menstrual cycle, hormone medication, or ovulation‑inducing drugs the best way to prepare the uterus lining (endometrium) for a frozen embryo transfer?\"\n\nKey messages\n- Current research does not show a clear advantage of using a natural menstrual cycle, hormone tablets (estrogen and progesterone), or ovulation‑inducing medicines for preparing the uterus before a frozen embryo transfer; the chances of a baby being born alive and the risk of miscarriage are similar across methods, and no specific safety concerns were identified.\n- Adding a drug that temporarily blocks the body’s own hormones (called GnRHa) to the hormone tablets, or giving a single injection of a hormone that triggers ovulation (called hCG), does not appear to change the chances of a live birth or miscarriage compared with the usual approaches.\n- Because the existing studies are small and often poorly reported, larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether any method offers better outcomes or fewer harms, and to assess long‑term effects.\n\nWhat is frozen‑thawed embryo transfer and why do we need to prepare the uterus for it?\nWhen couples undergo IVF, embryos can be frozen and transferred later. This is called frozen‑thawed embryo transfer (FET). FET can increase the overall chance of pregnancy, lower treatment costs and is technically simpler than using fresh embryos. Before an embryo is placed in the uterus, we must ensure that the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) is ready to receive it. Doctors can prepare the lining in three main ways:\n- **Natural (spontaneous ovulatory) cycle** – we let the woman’s own menstrual cycle run its course and transfer the embryo when the body naturally builds up the lining.\n- **Hormone therapy (HT) cycle** – we give estrogen and progesterone tablets to artificially build up the lining.\n- **Ovulation‑induction cycle** – we use medicines to trigger ovulation, creating a timing we can control.\nSometimes hormone therapy is combined with a drug called a gonadotrophin‑releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa), which temporarily blocks the woman’s own hormone production to create a more controlled environment.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to compare the different ways of preparing the uterus for FET – natural cycles, hormone‑therapy cycles (with and without GnRHa), and ovulation‑induction cycles – to see which method is most effective and safest. Specifically, we looked at how often a baby is born alive, how often a pregnancy ends in miscarriage, how often a pregnancy continues beyond the first weeks, and how often more than one baby is born.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched multiple databases for randomised controlled trials that compared these preparation methods. We combined the results and assessed how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 32 trials involving 6,352 women undergoing FET. The trials compared natural cycles, HT cycles (with or without GnRHa), modified natural cycles that used an hCG trigger, and ovulation‑induction cycles. We compared several pairs of approaches:\n- natural cycles vs. HT cycles;\n- natural cycles vs. HT cycles that also used GnRHa;\n- natural cycles vs. modified natural cycles (with an hCG trigger);\n- modified natural cycles vs. HT cycles (with or without GnRHa);\n- HT cycles vs. HT cycles that added GnRHa.\n\nThe original abstract does not tell us how long participants were followed, who funded the studies, the ages of the women, how severe their infertility was, or which countries the trials took place in.\n\nMain results: live‑birth outcome\nA natural cycle may slightly increase the chance of a live birth compared with an HT cycle, but the evidence is uncertain. When HT cycles include GnRHa suppression, a natural cycle probably makes little or no difference to live‑birth rates. HT cycles probably make little or no difference to live‑birth rates whether or not GnRHa is added.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, many trials did not report all outcomes we wanted, and the studies were small or had few events.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThis review updates previous Cochrane reviews and includes evidence searched up to December 2022.",

These metric outliers confirm the editorial concerns about sentence length, passive constructions, and noun‑heavy language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit but shows several metric outliers: words per sentence (26.2, beyond the 90th percentile), passive voice (26 instances, beyond P90), nominalisations (25, beyond P90), nouns (180, beyond P90), complex and long words also far above typical ranges. These indicate the text is more complex and less active than most Cochrane PLSs, supporting the need for the suggested simplifications."
