  "draft": "\"Is a natural menstrual cycle, hormone medication, or ovulation‑inducing drugs the best way to prepare the uterus lining (endometrium) for a frozen embryo transfer?\"\n\nKey messages\n- Current research does not show a clear advantage of using a natural menstrual cycle (the woman’s own cycle), hormone medication (estrogen and progesterone pills), or ovulation‑inducing drugs (medicines that trigger ovulation) for preparing the uterus lining before a frozen‑thawed embryo transfer (FET); live‑birth rates and miscarriage rates are similar and no specific safety concerns were identified.\n- Adding a GnRHa (a gonadotrophin‑releasing hormone agonist that temporarily suppresses the body’s own hormone signals) to hormone medication, or using an hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) trigger to time ovulation in a natural cycle, also does not change success rates compared with the standard approaches.\n- Because the existing studies are small and often poorly reported, larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether any method offers better outcomes or fewer harms, and to assess long‑term effects.\n\nWhat is frozen‑thawed embryo transfer and why do we need to prepare the uterus for it?  \nWhen couples undergo in‑vitro fertilisation (IVF), embryos can be frozen and transferred later. This process is called frozen‑thawed embryo transfer (FET). FET can increase the overall chance of pregnancy, lower treatment costs and is technically simpler than using fresh embryos. Before an embryo is placed in the uterus, we must make sure the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) is ready to receive it. Doctors can prepare the lining in three main ways:  \n– **Natural (spontaneous ovulatory) cycle** – we let the woman’s own menstrual cycle run its course and transfer the embryo when the body naturally builds up the lining.  \n– **Hormone therapy (HT) cycle** – we give estrogen and progesterone tablets to artificially build up the lining.  \n– **Ovulation‑induction cycle** – we use medicines to trigger ovulation, creating a timing we can control.  \n\nSometimes hormone therapy is combined with a GnRHa, which temporarily suppresses the woman’s own hormone production to give a more controlled environment.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare the different ways of preparing the uterus for FET – natural cycles, hormone‑therapy cycles (with and without GnRHa), and ovulation‑induction cycles – to see which method is most effective and safest. We looked at live‑birth rates, miscarriage rates, ongoing‑pregnancy rates and multiple‑pregnancy rates.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched several databases for randomised controlled trials that compared these preparation methods. We combined the results and assessed how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 32 trials involving 6,352 women undergoing FET. The trials compared natural cycles, HT cycles (with or without GnRHa), modified natural cycles that used an hCG trigger, and ovulation‑induction cycles. Direct comparisons included natural versus HT, natural versus HT + GnRHa, natural versus modified natural (hCG trigger), modified natural versus HT (with and without GnRHa), and HT versus HT + GnRHa.  \n\nFor live‑birth outcomes, a natural cycle may slightly increase the chance of a live birth compared with a hormone‑therapy cycle, but the evidence is uncertain. When hormone‑therapy cycles include GnRHa suppression, a natural cycle probably makes little or no difference to live‑birth rates. Hormone‑therapy cycles probably make little or no difference to live‑birth rates whether or not GnRHa is added.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, many trials did not report all outcomes we wanted, and the studies were small or had few events.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThis review updates previous Cochrane reviews and includes evidence searched up to December 2022.",

Many trials did not report all outcomes and were small, with few events.”\n\nThese changes address the most patient‑impacting clarity issues while also reducing the high passive‑voice count (20, P90), nominalizations (28, beyond P90), noun count (174, P90), and complex‑word metrics that the PLS evaluation flagged as out‑of‑range.",
