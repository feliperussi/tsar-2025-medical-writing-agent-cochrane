  "key_messages": [
    "Current research does not show a clear advantage of using a natural menstrual cycle (the woman's own cycle), hormone medication (estrogen and progesterone pills), or ovulation‑inducing drugs (medicines that trigger ovulation) for preparing the uterus lining before a frozen embryo transfer; rates of live birth (baby born alive) and miscarriage (loss of pregnancy) appear similar and no specific safety concerns were identified.",
    "Adding a GnRHa (a drug that temporarily suppresses the body's own hormone signals) to hormone medication, or using an hCG trigger (a hormone injection to time ovulation) in a natural cycle, also does not seem to change success rates compared with the standard approaches.",
    "Because the existing studies are limited and often poorly reported, larger, well‑designed trials are needed to determine whether any method offers better outcomes or fewer harms, and to assess long‑term effects."

      "subheading": "What is frozen‑thawed embryo transfer and why do we need to prepare the uterus for it?",
      "content": "When couples undergo IVF, embryos can be frozen and transferred later in a process called frozen‑thawed embryo transfer (FET). FET helps increase the overall chance of pregnancy, lowers the cost of treatment and is technically simpler than using fresh embryos. Before an embryo is placed in the uterus, doctors must make sure the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) is ready to receive it. This preparation can be done in several ways:\n\n* **Natural (spontaneous ovulatory) cycle** – the woman's own menstrual cycle is allowed to run its course and the embryo is transferred when the body naturally prepares the lining.\n* **Hormone therapy (HT) cycle** – doctors give estrogen and progesterone medicines to artificially build up the lining.\n* **Ovulation‑induction cycle** – medicines are used to trigger ovulation, creating a timing that can be controlled.\n\nSometimes hormone therapy is combined with a drug called a gonadotrophin‑releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa), which temporarily suppresses the woman's own hormone production to give a more controlled environment. Choosing the best way to prepare the uterus is important because it could affect the chances of a live birth, the risk of miscarriage, and the safety of the mother and baby."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to compare the different ways of preparing the uterus for FET – natural cycles, hormone‑therapy cycles (with and without GnRHa), and ovulation‑induction cycles – to see which method is most effective and safest. Specifically, they looked at how each approach influences the likelihood of a live birth, the chance of miscarriage, ongoing pregnancy, and multiple pregnancies, and they examined any differences between the sub‑types of these regimens."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "The review included 32 randomised controlled trials with a total of 6,352 women undergoing frozen‑embryo transfer. The trials compared different ways of preparing the endometrium: natural (spontaneous ovulatory) cycles, hormone‑therapy (HT) cycles with or without gonadotrophin‑releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) suppression, modified natural cycles using an hCG trigger, and ovulation‑induction cycles. Direct comparisons were made between natural cycles versus HT cycles, natural cycles versus HT plus GnRHa, natural cycles versus modified natural cycles, modified natural cycles versus HT (with and without GnRHa), and HT versus HT with GnRHa. The abstract did not provide details on follow‑up length, funding sources, participants’ age or infertility severity, or the countries where the studies were conducted."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Live‑birth outcome",
      "content": "A natural cycle may slightly increase the chance of a live birth compared with a hormone‑therapy cycle, but the evidence is uncertain. When hormone‑therapy cycles include GnRHa suppression, a natural cycle probably makes little or no difference to live‑birth rates. Hormone‑therapy cycles probably make little or no difference to live‑birth rates whether or not GnRHa suppression is added."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, and because the studies were very small or based on few events.",
