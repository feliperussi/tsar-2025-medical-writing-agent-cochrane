  "draft": "Does estrogen (hormone) therapy help reduce symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse (dropping of the uterus, bladder or rectum) in women after menopause?\n\nKey messages\n- We do not have reliable evidence that estrogen, taken as a pill that works throughout the body (systemic) or applied as a cream or tablet inside the vagina (local), a reliable evidence that estrogen, taken as a pill that works throughout the body (systemic) or applied as a cream or tablet inside the vagina (local), reduces POP symptoms in post‑menopausal women.\n- Adding local estrogen to a vaginal pessary (a soft support placed in the vagina) may lower unwanted vaginal side‑effects, and adding it to surgery may lower urinary infections after surgery, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Existing trials are few, small, and at high risk of bias. Larger, well‑designed studies that follow women for the medium and long term are needed.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse and why is it a problem for post‑menopausal women?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) happens when the uterus, bladder, or rectum slips down into the vagina. About half of women over 50 who have had at least one child experience POP. Age, multiple births, and excess weight increase the risk. POP can cause a feeling of heaviness, trouble with urination or bowel movements, and a lower quality of life. Common ways to manage POP include pelvic‑floor muscle exercises, vaginal pessaries (soft supports placed in the vagina), and surgery. Some doctors also consider estrogen therapy (a hormone that falls after menopause) either as a cream or a pill, hoping it might strengthen tissues and ease symptoms.\n\nWhat did the review set out to discover about estrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse?\nWe wanted to know whether estrogen treatment, applied locally (as a cream or tablet placed in the vagina) or taken systemically (as a pill that works throughout the body), helps or harms post‑menopausal women with POP. We looked at estrogen used alone or together with other treatments such as pessaries or surgery, and we also searched for any information on cost‑effectiveness.\n\nHow did we search for and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register up to 20 June 2022. This register includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, trial registers, and hand‑searched journals and conference proceedings. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. We planned to grade the certainty of the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 14 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1 002 post‑menopausal women with POP of any grade. No trial compared estrogen alone with no treatment, placebo, pelvic‑floor, pessaries, or surgery. Three trials compared estrogen plus a pessary with a pessary alone, and eleven trials compared estrogen plus surgery with surgery alone.\n\nWe do not know whether estrogen reduces or worsens POP symptoms. Adding topical estrogen to a pessary may reduce unwanted vaginal side‑effects, but the evidence is very uncertain. Adding topical estrogen to surgery may reduce urinary infections after surgery, but again the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the findings because many studies were at high risk of bias. In most trials participants knew which treatment they were receiving, which can affect the results. The trials were small, used different estrogen regimens, and did not report all outcomes we wanted. The evidence does not cover all women with POP or all important outcomes.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date with searches completed in June 2022.",

In addition, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Duplicated, wordy sentence in the first key‑message bullet** – the sentence repeats the same clause and is hard to follow.\n   - *Problem*: Redundant wording and long clause make the main point unclear.\n   - *Rewrite*: \"We do not have reliable evidence that estrogen, whether taken as a systemic pill or applied locally as a cream or tablet, reduces POP symptoms in post‑menopausal women.\"\n2. **Long, complex sentence in the \"What did we find?\" section** – \"We do not know whether estrogen reduces or worsens POP symptoms. Adding topical estrogen to a pessary may reduce unwanted vaginal side‑effects, but the evidence is very uncertain. Adding topical estrogen to surgery may reduce urinary infections after surgery, but again the evidence is very uncertain.\"\n   - *Problem*: Multiple ideas packed into one paragraph; readers may lose the main message.\n   - *Rewrite*: Break into two short sentences: \"We do not know whether estrogen helps or harms POP symptoms. Adding topical estrogen to a pessary may lower vaginal side‑effects, and adding it to surgery may lower urinary‑tract infections, but the evidence for both is very uncertain.\"\n3. **Jargon without simple definition** – terms like \"systemic\" and \"local\" appear before being clearly explained.\n   - *Problem*: Patients may not understand these technical words.\n   - *Rewrite*: Introduce them once, e.g., \"systemic (a pill that works throughout the body)\" and \"local (a cream or tablet placed inside the vagina)\" and then use the simpler words \"pill\" and \"cream/tablet\" thereafter.\n4. **High noun density and complex words** (metrics show nouns = 175 (P90), complex_words = 135 (P90), complex_words_dc = 252 (P90), long_words = 168 (P90)).\n   - *Problem*: Overly noun‑heavy sentences reduce readability.\n   - *Rewrite*: Convert noun‑heavy phrases to active verbs, e.g., change \"the evidence does not cover all women with POP or all important outcomes\" to \"the studies did not include all women with POP and did not look at every important outcome.\"\n5. **Missing question format for the Key messages heading** – to meet the style guide, rename it to a question.\n   - *Rewrite*: Change \"Key messages\" to \"What are the key messages?\" and keep the bullet list underneath.\nThese changes address the critical subheading requirement, simplify confusing sentences, reduce jargon, and lower noun/complex‑word density, aligning the draft with the Master Style Guide and improving patient‑readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms overall to typical PLS patterns (61% best‑quartile features).
