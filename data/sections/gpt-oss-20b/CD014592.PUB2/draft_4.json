  "draft": "Does estrogen (hormone) therapy help reduce symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse (dropping of the uterus, bladder or rectum) in women after menopause?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We do not have reliable evidence that estrogen, whether taken as a systemic pill (a pill that works throughout the body) or applied locally as a cream or tablet (placed inside the vagina), reduces POP symptoms in post‑menopausal women.  \n- Adding a local estrogen cream or tablet to a vaginal pessary may lower unwanted vaginal side‑effects, and adding it to surgery may lower urinary‑tract infections, but the evidence for both is very uncertain.  \n- Existing trials are few, small, and at high risk of bias; larger, well‑designed studies that follow women for the medium and long term are needed.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse and why is it a problem for post‑menopausal women?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) occurs when the uterus, bladder, or rectum slips down into the vagina. About half of women over 50 who have had at least one child experience POP, and the risk rises with age, multiple births, and excess weight. POP can cause a feeling of heaviness, difficulty urinating or having bowel movements, and a lower quality of life. Common management options include pelvic‑floor muscle exercises, vaginal pessaries (soft supports placed in the vagina), and surgery. Some clinicians also consider estrogen therapy—a hormone that falls after menopause—hoping it might strengthen tissues and ease symptoms.\n\nWhat did the review set out to discover about estrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse?\nWe wanted to know whether estrogen, given locally (as a cream or tablet placed in the vagina) or systemically (as a pill that works throughout the body), helps or harms post‑menopausal women with POP. We examined estrogen used alone or together with other treatments such as pessaries or surgery, and we looked for any cost‑effectiveness information.\n\nHow did we search for and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register up to 20 June 2022. The register includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, trial registers, and hand‑searched journals and conference proceedings. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. We planned to grade the certainty of the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 14 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1 002 post‑menopausal women with POP of any grade. No trial compared estrogen alone with no treatment, placebo, pelvic‑floor exercises, pessaries, or surgery. Three trials compared estrogen plus a pessary with a pessary alone, and eleven trials compared estrogen plus surgery with surgery alone. We do not know whether estrogen helps or harms POP symptoms. Adding topical estrogen to a pessary may lower vaginal side‑effects, and adding it to surgery may lower urinary‑tract infections, but the evidence for both is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nMany studies were at high risk of bias because participants often knew which treatment they received. The trials were small, used different estrogen regimens, and did not report all outcomes we wanted. The studies did not include all women with POP and did not examine every important outcome.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence reflects searches completed in June 2022.",
