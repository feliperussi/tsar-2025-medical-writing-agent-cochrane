  "draft": "Does estrogen (hormone) therapy help reduce symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse (dropping of the uterus, bladder or rectum) in women after menopause?\n\n- There is not enough reliable evidence to say whether estrogen therapy (either taken systemically (absorbed throughout the body) or applied locally (directly to the vagina)) reduces the symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in post‑menopausal women; the review found no studies that compared estrogen alone with no treatment, and the few studies that combined estrogen with other treatments gave mixed and uncertain results.\n- When estrogen was used together with a vaginal pessary (a device placed in the vagina to support the uterus, bladder or rectum) it was linked to fewer unwanted vaginal side‑effects, and when used together with surgery it was linked to fewer post‑operative urinary tract infections (infections that occur after surgery), but these findings come from studies with important design limitations.\n- Because the existing trials are few, small, and at high risk of bias, larger, well‑designed studies that follow women for the medium and long term are needed to determine whether estrogen (alone or with other treatments) is effective and safe for managing pelvic organ prolapse.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse and why is it a problem for postmenopausal women?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) happens when the uterus, bladder, or rectum slips down into the vagina. It is common – about half of women over 50 who have had at least one child experience it – and the risk increases with age, multiple births, and being overweight. POP can cause a feeling of heaviness, trouble with urination or bowel movements, and can lower quality of life. Typical ways to manage POP include pelvic‑floor muscle exercises, vaginal pessaries (soft supports placed in the vagina), and surgery to repair the organs. Some doctors also consider estrogen therapy – a hormone that drops after menopause – either as a cream or a pill, hoping it might improve tissue strength and reduce symptoms.\n\nWhat did the review set out to discover about estrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse?\nThe authors wanted to find out whether estrogen treatment, applied locally (as a cream or tablet placed in the vagina) or taken systemically (as a pill that works throughout the body), helps or harms postmenopausal women with POP. They examined estrogen used alone or together with other treatments such as pessaries or surgery, and also looked for any information on the cost‑effectiveness of these approaches.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies evaluating local or systemic estrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse in postmenopausal women, combined their findings, and rated our confidence in the evidence using risk‑of‑bias assessment and GRADE criteria.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe looked at 14 randomised controlled trials that together included 1,002 post‑menopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse of any grade. All participants were post‑menopausal women, but the exact ages and follow‑up periods were not reported. The trials compared estrogen therapy (either local or systemic), given together with other treatments, to those other treatments alone, no treatment, or placebo. No study examined estrogen alone versus any comparator. Three studies compared estrogen plus a vaginal pessary with a pessary alone, and eleven studies compared estrogen plus surgery with surgery alone.\n\nThe review found that we do not know whether estrogen therapy has any effect on prolapse symptoms. Adding topical estrogen to a pessary may reduce vaginal adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain. Adding topical estrogen to surgery may reduce postoperative urinary‑tract infections, but again the evidence is very uncertain.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all studies gave data about everything we wanted, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we are interested in, and the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be sure about the results.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions. Sections such as \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are headings, not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, several readability issues make the summary hard for patients to follow:\n1. **Subheadings not questions** – e.g., \"Methods\". Rewrite as a question, e.g., \"How did we search for and evaluate the studies?\".\n2. **Very long sentences** – e.g., \"Because the existing trials are few, small, and at high risk of bias, larger, well‑designed studies that follow women for the medium and long term are needed to determine whether estrogen (alone or with other treatments) is effective and safe for managing pelvic organ prolapse.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words and packs multiple ideas. Split into two shorter sentences: \"The existing trials are few, small, and at high risk of bias. We need larger, well‑designed studies that follow women for the medium and long term to find out whether estrogen, alone or with other treatments, is effective and safe for managing pelvic organ prolapse.\"\n3. **Passive voice** – e.g., \"The review found that we do not know whether estrogen therapy has any effect on prolapse symptoms.\" Use active voice: \"We do not know whether estrogen therapy affects prolapse symptoms.\"\n4. **High lexical complexity** – the draft contains many long and complex words (157 complex words, 203 long words, both beyond the P90 range). Replace terms where possible, e.g., change \"post‑menopausal\" to \"after menopause\", \"pelvic organ prolapse\" to \"POP (dropping of the uterus, bladder or rectum)\" after the first definition, and simplify phrases like \"high risk of bias\" to \"likely biased\".\n5. **Noun‑heavy sentences** – e.g., \"The review found that we do not know whether estrogen therapy has any effect on prolapse symptoms.\" Re‑write to use more verbs: \"We do not know if estrogen helps symptoms.\"\n\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability. Metrics support the editorial judgment: words per sentence = 25.7 (above typical 19‑28 range), passive voice = 22 (above typical 9‑23), complex words = 157 and long words = 203 (both beyond the P90 percentile), indicating the need to shorten sentences, use active voice, and simplify vocabulary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate overall conformity but highlights several deviations: words per sentence (25.7, P90), passive voice (22, P90), nouns (200, P90), SMOG index (14.7, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.18, P90), complex words (157, BEYOND_P90) and long words (203, BEYOND_P90). These metrics confirm the draft is overly complex, sentence‑heavy, and noun‑laden, supporting the recommended edits."
