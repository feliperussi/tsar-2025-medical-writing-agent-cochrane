  "draft": "Does estrogen (hormone) therapy help reduce symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse (dropping of the uterus, bladder or rectum) in women after menopause?\n\nKey messages\n- We do not have reliable evidence that estrogen, taken as a pill (systemic) or applied as a cream/tablet in the vagina (local), reduces POP symptoms in women after menopause.\n- Adding local estrogen to a vaginal pessary may lower unwanted vaginal side‑effects, and adding it to surgery may lower post‑operative urinary‑tract infections, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Existing trials are few, small, and likely biased; larger, well‑designed studies that follow women for the medium and long term are needed.\n\nWhat is pelvic organ prolapse and why is it a problem for women after menopause?\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) occurs when the uterus, bladder, or rectum slips down into the vagina. About half of women over 50 who have given birth experience POP. Age, multiple births, and excess weight increase the risk. POP can cause a feeling of heaviness, trouble with urination or bowel movements, and a lower quality of life. Common management options include pelvic‑floor muscle exercises, vaginal pessaries (soft supports placed in the vagina), and surgery. Some clinicians also consider estrogen therapy—a hormone that falls after menopause—as a cream or pill that might strengthen tissues and ease symptoms.\n\nWhat did the review set out to discover about estrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse?\nWe wanted to know whether estrogen, applied locally or taken systemically, helps or harms women after menopause with POP. We examined estrogen used alone or together with other treatments such as pessaries or surgery, and we looked for any information on cost‑effectiveness.\n\nHow did we search for and evaluate the studies?\nWe searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (up to 20 June 2022), which includes CENTRAL, MEDLINE, trial registers, and hand‑searched journals and conference proceedings. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. We planned to grade the certainty of evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 14 randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 1 002 women after menopause with POP of any grade. No trial compared estrogen alone with no treatment, placebo, pelvic‑floor training, pessaries, or surgery. Three trials compared estrogen plus a pessary with a pessary alone, and eleven trials compared estrogen plus surgery with surgery alone.\n\nWe do not know whether estrogen changes POP symptoms. Adding topical estrogen to a pessary may reduce vaginal adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain. Adding topical estrogen to surgery may reduce post‑operative urinary‑tract infections, but again the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the findings because many studies likely had bias (participants often knew which treatment they received). The trials were small, varied in how estrogen was given, and did not report all outcomes we wanted. The evidence does not cover all women with POP or all important outcomes.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date with searches completed in June 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the required structural checks, but three clear-language problems would likely confuse a patient reader. 1) Unexplained jargon – terms such as “systemic”, “local”, “adverse vaginal events” and “post‑operative urinary‑tract infections” appear without plain definitions. Suggested rewrite: replace with “taken as a pill that works throughout the body (systemic)”, “applied as a cream or tablet inside the vagina (local)”, “unwanted vaginal side‑effects”, and “urinary infections after surgery”. 2) Ambiguous wording – the sentence “We do not know whether estrogen changes POP symptoms.” uses the vague verb “changes”. Rewrite to: “We do not know whether estrogen reduces or worsens POP symptoms.” 3) Overly long, dense sentence in the limitations – “We are not confident in the findings because many studies likely had bias (participants often knew which treatment they received).” can be split for clarity: “We are not confident in the findings because many studies were at high risk of bias. In most trials participants knew which treatment they were receiving, which can affect the results.” These changes also address the metric alerts (high SMOG index and many complex words) by reducing technical vocabulary and sentence length, improving readability for a lay audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most readability metrics (e.g., Flesch‑Kincaid Grade 10, words per sentence 17.6). However, three metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: SMOG index (13.7, above the median), complex words (127) and complex Dale‑Chall words (222). These indicate the text contains more long and unfamiliar words than usual, supporting the need to simplify jargon and shorten sentences as recommended above."
