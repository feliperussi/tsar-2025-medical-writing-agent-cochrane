  "plain_title": "Does estrogen (hormone) therapy help reduce symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse (dropping of the uterus, bladder or rectum) in women after menopause?",
  "key_messages": [
    "There is not enough reliable evidence to say whether estrogen therapy (either taken systemically (absorbed throughout the body) or applied locally (directly to the vagina)) reduces the symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in post‑menopausal women; the review found no studies that compared estrogen alone with no treatment, and the few studies that combined estrogen with other treatments gave mixed and uncertain results.",
    "When estrogen was used together with a vaginal pessary (a device placed in the vagina to support the uterus, bladder or rectum) it was linked to fewer unwanted vaginal side‑effects, and when used together with surgery it was linked to fewer post‑operative urinary tract infections (infections that occur after surgery), but these findings come from studies with important design limitations.",
    "Because the existing trials are few, small, and at high risk of bias, larger, well‑designed studies that follow women for the medium and long term are needed to determine whether estrogen (alone or with other treatments) is effective and safe for managing pelvic organ prolapse."

      "subheading": "What is pelvic organ prolapse and why is it a problem for postmenopausal women?",
      "content": "Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) happens when the uterus, bladder, or rectum slips down into the vagina. It is common – about half of women over 50 who have had at least one child experience it – and the risk increases with age, multiple births, and being overweight. POP can cause a feeling of heaviness, trouble with urination or bowel movements, and can lower quality of life. Typical ways to manage POP include pelvic‑floor muscle exercises, vaginal pessaries (soft supports placed in the vagina), and surgery to repair the organs. Some doctors also consider estrogen therapy – a hormone that drops after menopause – either as a cream or a pill, hoping it might improve tissue strength and reduce symptoms."

      "subheading": "What did the review set out to discover about estrogen therapy for pelvic organ prolapse?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to find out whether estrogen treatment, applied locally (as a cream or tablet placed in the vagina) or taken systemically (as a pill that works throughout the body), helps or harms postmenopausal women with POP. They examined estrogen used alone or together with other treatments such as pessaries or surgery, and also looked for any information on the cost‑effectiveness of these approaches."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We looked at 14 randomised controlled trials that together included 1,002 post‑menopausal women with pelvic organ prolapse of any grade. All participants were post‑menopausal women, but the exact ages and follow‑up periods were not reported. The trials compared estrogen therapy (either local or systemic), given together with other treatments, to those other treatments alone, no treatment, or placebo. No study examined estrogen alone versus any comparator. Three studies compared estrogen plus a vaginal pessary with a pessary alone, and eleven studies compared estrogen plus surgery with surgery alone.\n\nThe review found that we do not know whether estrogen therapy has any effect on prolapse symptoms. Adding topical estrogen to a pessary may reduce vaginal adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain. Adding topical estrogen to surgery may reduce postoperative urinary‑tract infections, but again the evidence is very uncertain."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting and not all studies gave data about everything we wanted, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we are interested in, and the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be sure about the results.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search."
