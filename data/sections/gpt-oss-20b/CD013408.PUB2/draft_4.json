  "draft": "Does organised (team‑based or digital) care for adults with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) reduce death and hospital visits compared with usual care?\n\nKey messages\n– Organised care that brings together several health professionals (multidisciplinary care) or uses digital tools (mHealth) probably lowers the chance of dying from any cause; the evidence is of moderate certainty and we did not see a clear increase in serious bleeding.  \n– Organised care probably reduces hospital stays that are directly related to heart problems (cardiovascular hospitalisations) but makes little or no difference to overall hospital admissions, deaths from heart causes, stroke, or major bleeding.  \n– The studies were small, varied, and did not examine all possible harms, so we need larger, longer trials to compare different models, assess costs and quality of life, and confirm these findings.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why does it matter?  \nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart‑rhythm problem where the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly and often very fast. This can make the heart work less efficiently and raises the risk of stroke, heart failure, and early death. As people get older, more adults develop AF, so health services see a growing number of patients who need careful, ongoing care. Traditional care often involves a single doctor, but AF can affect many parts of the body. Experts therefore suggest a team‑based approach—called multidisciplinary care—where nurses, pharmacists, and other specialists work together. They also propose using digital tools (eHealth or mobile health, the called mHealth) that deliver health services through computers or smartphones.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?  \nWe wanted to compare organised, team‑based or technology‑supported models of care for adults with any type of AF against the usual way care is delivered (usual care). Specifically, we asked whether these organised services could reduce deaths, hospital admissions, and other important health events, and whether they might improve quality of life or lower costs.\n\nWhat did we do?  \nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared organised multidisciplinary or virtual AF services with usual care. We pooled the results and used the GRADE approach (a system for rating how confident we are in the evidence) to assess our certainty.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe included eight randomised controlled trials involving 8,205 adults with AF. Participants were on average 60–73 years old and the trials took place in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. Four trials tested a nurse‑led multidisciplinary model and two trials tested mHealth management; all compared the organised‑care approaches with usual care.\n\nOverall death  \nOrganised care probably leads to a large reduction in all‑cause mortality. Roughly three fewer people out of every 100 died over a six‑year period when they received the organised‑care interventions compared with usual care.\n\nHospital admissions  \nOrganised care probably makes little or no difference to the total number of hospital admissions, but it probably reduces cardiovascular hospitalisations (hospital stays directly related to heart problems).\n\nBleeding and stroke  \nWe did not see a clear increase in serious bleeding, and the programmes probably have little or no effect on stroke or major bleeding.\n\nWhat are the limitations?  \nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because many participants knew which treatment they received, not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, the trials were small, and the interventions varied. These factors make it harder to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to April 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the required subheading format: the \"Key messages\" heading is not phrased as a question, which breaches the Master Style Guide (5.3 Structure). This is a critical check and prevents approval. In addition, several clarity and style issues could confuse readers:\n1. **Key messages – bullet 1 is overly long and packs multiple ideas together, making it hard to follow.**\n   - Problematic sentence: \"Organised care programmes that bring together several health professionals (multidisciplinary) or any digital tools (mHealth) probably lower the chance of dying from any cause compared with usual care, while they make little or no difference to the overall number of hospital admissions; the evidence is of moderate reliability and no clear increase in serious bleeding was reported.\"\n   - Why it’s problematic: combines three separate points (mortality benefit, hospital admission effect, safety) in one sentence; uses the vague term “moderate reliability” instead of the standard “moderate certainty”.\n   - Suggested rewrite: \"Organised care programmes that involve several health professionals (multidisciplinary) or digital tools (mHealth) probably lower the chance of dying from any cause compared with usual care. They make little or no difference to the overall number of hospital admissions, and we did not see a clear increase in serious bleeding. The evidence is of moderate certainty.\"\n2. **Key messages – bullet 2 mixes benefits and uncertainties in a single sentence, which can be confusing.**\n   - Problematic sentence: \"These programmes also appear to reduce hospital stays that are directly related to heart problems (cardiovascular hospitalisations), although they do not clearly lower deaths specifically from heart causes or the risk of stroke and major bleeding.\"\n   - Why it’s problematic: the contrast between reduction in cardiovascular hospitalisations and lack of effect on cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and bleeding is dense.\n   - Suggested rewrite: \"These programmes also appear to reduce hospital stays that are directly related to heart problems (cardiovascular hospitalisations). However, they do not clearly lower deaths from heart causes, nor do they reduce the risk of stroke or major bleeding.\"\n3. **Passive voice prevalence** – the draft contains 23 passive constructions (P90), which can obscure who performed actions and reduce readability.\n   - Example: \"The evidence is up to date to April 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\"\n   - Suggested active rewrite: \"We searched the literature up to April 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.\"\n4. **High noun density** – 163 nouns (P90) and many complex words (127, P90) make sentences noun‑heavy.\n   - Example: \"Organised care probably makes little or no difference to the total number of hospital admissions, but it probably reduces cardiovascular hospitalisations (hospital stays directly related to heart problems).\"\n   - Suggested rewrite: \"Organised care probably does not change the total number of hospital admissions, but it does reduce cardiovascular hospitalisations (stays for heart problems).\"\n5. **Subheading format** – change \"Key messages\" to a question format, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\" and ensure a blank line before and after the heading.\n\nThese changes address the critical subheading issue and improve clarity, active voice usage, and sentence simplicity, aligning the draft with the Master Style Guide and typical PLS patterns.\n\n**Metrics support**: The evaluation shows high passive voice (23, P90), high noun count (163, P90), and elevated complex‑word counts (complex_words 127, P90; complex_words_dc 256, P90). Reducing these will lower the draft’s deviation from typical PLS patterns and enhance readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: passive_voice (23, P90), nouns (163, P90), smog_index (14.05, P90), complex_words_dc (256, P90), complex_words (127, P90), and long_words (172, P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy sentences, and high lexical complexity, which support the recommended style and clarity improvements."
