  "draft": "Does organized (team‑based or digital) care for adults with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) reduce death and hospital visits compared with usual care?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Organized care programmes that bring together several health professionals (multidisciplinary) or use digital tools (mHealth) probably lower the chance of dying from any cause compared with usual care; the evidence is of moderate certainty.  \n– These programmes probably reduce hospital stays that are directly related to heart problems (cardiovascular hospitalisations) but make little or no difference to overall hospital admissions, stroke, or major bleeding.  \n– The studies were small and varied, and they did not examine all possible harms. Larger, longer trials are needed to compare different models, assess costs and quality of life, and confirm these findings.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why does it matter?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart‑rhythm problem where the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly and often very fast. This can make the heart work less efficiently and raises the risk of stroke, heart failure, and early death. As people age, more adults develop AF, so health services see a growing number of patients who need careful, ongoing care. Traditional care often involves a single doctor, but because AF can affect many parts of the body, experts suggest a team‑based approach (multidisciplinary care) where nurses, pharmacists and other specialists work together, and the use of digital tools (eHealth or mHealth, which deliver health services through computers or smartphones).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare organised, team‑based or technology‑supported models of care for adults with any type of AF against the usual way care is delivered (usual care). Specifically, we asked whether these organised services could reduce deaths, hospital admissions, and other important health events, and whether they might improve quality of life or lower costs.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared organised multidisciplinary or virtual AF services with usual care. Three review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled the results and used the GRADE approach (a system for rating how confident we are in the evidence) to grade our confidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included eight randomised controlled trials that together involved 8,205 adults with AF. Participants were on average 60–73 years old and the trials took place in China, the Netherlands and Australia. Four trials tested a nurse‑led multidisciplinary model and two trials tested mHealth management; all compared the organised‑care approaches with usual care.\n\nWhat did we find about overall death?\nOrganised care probably leads to a large reduction in all‑cause mortality. About three fewer people per 100 died over a six‑year period when they received the organised‑care interventions compared with usual care.\n\nWhat did we find about hospital admissions?\nOrganised care probably makes little or no difference to the total number of hospital admissions, but it probably reduces cardiovascular (heart‑related) hospitalisations.\n\nWhat did we find about bleeding and stroke?\nWe did not see a clear increase or decrease in serious bleeding, and the programmes probably have little or no effect on stroke or major bleeding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate because many participants knew which treatment they received, not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, the trials were small, and the interventions varied. These factors make it harder to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nWe updated the evidence to include studies published up to April 2023.",

Reducing complex words (131) and long words (173) will also bring the readability indices (SMOG 14.2, complex_words_dc 254) closer to typical PLS ranges.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and most metric targets, but shows notable deviations: passive_voice (23, beyond typical PLS range), nouns (161, high), SMOG index (14.2, above median), complex_words_dc (254) and complex_words (131) are all higher than typical PLS values. These suggest the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many long/complex words, which aligns with the identified clarity issues."
