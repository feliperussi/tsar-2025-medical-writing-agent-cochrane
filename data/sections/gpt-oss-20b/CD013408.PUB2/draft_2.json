  "draft": "\"Does organized (team‑based or digital) care for adults with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) reduce death and hospital visits compared with usual care?\"\n\nKey messages\n- Organised care programmes that bring together several health professionals (multidisciplinary) or use digital tools (mHealth) probably lower the chance of dying from any cause compared with usual care. They make little or no difference to the total number of hospital admissions. The evidence is of moderate reliability and we did not see a clear increase in serious bleeding.\n- These programmes also appear to reduce hospital stays that are directly related to heart problems (cardiovascular hospitalisations). They do not clearly lower deaths specifically from heart causes, nor the risk of stroke or major bleeding.\n- The existing studies have some limitations and did not examine all possible harms. Longer‑term, larger and well‑designed trials are needed to compare different models of organised care, evaluate costs and quality of life, and confirm these findings.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why does it matter?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart‑rhythm problem where the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly and often very fast. This can make the heart work less efficiently and raises the risk of serious complications such as stroke, heart failure, and early death. As people get older, more adults develop AF, so health services see a growing number of patients who need careful, ongoing care. Traditional care often involves a single doctor, but because AF can affect many parts of the body, experts suggest that a team‑based approach—called multidisciplinary care—where nurses, pharmacists and other specialists work together, and the use of digital tools (eHealth or mHealth, health services delivered through computers or smartphones) might improve outcomes.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe aimed to compare organised, team‑based or technology‑supported models of care for adults with any type of AF against the usual way care is delivered (usual care, meaning the standard practice most patients receive). Specifically, we wanted to know whether these organised services could reduce deaths, hospital admissions and other important health events, and whether they might improve quality of life or lower costs.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched databases for randomised controlled trials that compared organised multidisciplinary or virtual AF services with usual care. We pooled the results and assessed our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included eight randomised controlled trials involving 8,205 adults with AF. Participants were on average 60–73 years old. The studies were conducted in China, the Netherlands and Australia. Four trials tested a nurse‑led multidisciplinary model and two trials tested mobile‑health (mHealth) management; all were compared with usual care. The abstract did not give details about study duration, funding, gender balance or exact AF severity.\n\nWhat did the evidence show about overall death?\nOrganised care probably leads to a large reduction in all‑cause mortality. Roughly three fewer people out of every 100 died over a six‑year period when they received the organised‑care interventions compared with usual care.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate. Some participants knew which treatment they received, which could bias the results. Not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, and many were small. The studies also involved different types of patients and used varied delivery methods, making it hard to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nWe searched up to April 2023, so the evidence is current to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several patient‑facing problems:\n1. **Unexplained jargon** – the key‑message bullet points use terms like “multidisciplinary” and “mHealth” without a simple definition, leaving readers unsure what these mean.\n2. **Excessive passive voice** – the text includes 24 passive constructions (e.g., “The evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search.”), far above the typical range (9‑23). Passive phrasing obscures who did what and makes the summary harder to follow.\n3. **Missing first‑person pronouns in the summary** – the style guide requires the review authors to use “we/our”. The key‑message bullets are written impersonally, which reduces engagement and violates the guide.\n4. **Wordy/unclear phrasing** – phrases such as “The evidence is of moderate reliability” are vague and do not match the source wording (“moderate certainty evidence”). This can confuse readers about the strength of the findings.\n5. **High lexical complexity** – the draft has 126 complex words, 250 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words and 173 long words, all well above the median for PLS texts, contributing to a higher reading grade (FKGL ≈ 11) than necessary.\nThese issues together would likely confuse or frustrate a lay audience, so the PLS cannot be approved in its current form.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits but deviates from typical PLS patterns on several metrics: passive_voice (24, BEYOND_P90), nouns (162, P90), smog_index (13.7, P90), complex_words_dc (250, P90), complex_words (126, P90) and long_words (173, P90). Readability scores are acceptable (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease ≈ 50, FKGL ≈ 11) but the high lexical and syntactic complexity indicate the text is harder than most PLSs, supporting the need for the suggested simplifications."
