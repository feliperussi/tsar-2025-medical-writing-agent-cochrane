  "draft": "Does organized (team‑based or digital) care for adults with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) reduce death and hospital visits compared with usual care?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Organised care programmes that involve several health professionals (multidisciplinary) or digital tools (mHealth) probably lower the chance of dying from any cause compared with usual care. They make little or no difference to the overall number of hospital admissions, and we did not see a clear increase in serious bleeding. The evidence is of moderate certainty.  \n– These programmes also appear to reduce hospital stays that are directly related to heart problems (cardiovascular hospitalisations). However, they do not clearly lower deaths from heart causes, nor do they reduce the risk of stroke or major bleeding.  \n– The studies were small, varied, and did not examine all possible harms, so we need larger, longer trials to compare different models, assess costs and quality of life, and confirm these findings.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why does it matter?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart‑rhythm problem where the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly and often very fast. This can make the heart work less efficiently and raises the risk of stroke, heart failure, and early death. As people age, more adults develop AF, so health services see a growing number of patients who need careful, the usual care often involves a single doctor. Because AF can affect many parts of the body, experts suggest a team‑based approach (multidisciplinary care) and the use of digital tools (eHealth or mHealth) that deliver health services through computers or smartphones.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare organised, team‑based or technology‑supported models of care for adults with any type of AF against the usual way care is delivered (usual care). Specifically, we asked whether these organised services could reduce deaths, hospital admissions, and other important health events, and whether they might improve quality of life or lower costs.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared organised multidisciplinary or virtual AF services with usual care. Three review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We pooled the results and used the GRADE approach to rate and rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included eight randomised controlled trials involving 8,205 adults with AF. Participants were on average 60–73 years old and the trials were conducted in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. Four trials tested a nurse‑led multidisciplinary model and two trials tested mHealth management; all compared the organised‑care approaches with usual care.\n\nOverall death  \nOrganised care probably leads to a large reduction in all‑cause mortality. About three fewer people per 100 died over a six‑year period when they received the organised‑care interventions compared with usual care.\n\nHospital admissions  \nOrganised care probably makes little or no difference to the total number of hospital admissions, but it probably reduces cardiovascular hospitalisations (stays for heart problems).\n\nBleeding and stroke  \nWe did not see a clear increase in serious bleeding, and the programmes probably have little or no effect on stroke or major bleeding.\n\nWhat are the limitations?\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because many participants knew which treatment they received, not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, the trials were small, and the interventions varied. These factors make it harder to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nWe searched the literature up to April 2023, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which the Master Style Guide requires. Specifically, the headings \"Overall death\", \"Hospital admissions\" and \"Bleeding and stroke\" are statements rather than questions. This can confuse readers and breaks the required structure. In addition, there is a clear typo in the Methods section – \"We pooled the results and used the GRADE approach to rate and rate our confidence in the evidence\" – which makes the sentence ambiguous. Finally, the draft contains a high number of passive constructions (22 instances, well above the typical PLS range) and several noun‑heavy sentences that reduce readability. Suggested improvements: 1. Change subheadings to questions, e.g., \"What did we find about overall death?\", \"What did we find about hospital admissions?\", \"What did we find about bleeding and stroke?\". 2. Fix the typo: rewrite as \"We pooled the results and used the GRADE approach to rate our confidence in the evidence.\". 3. Reduce passive voice and noun‑heavy phrasing, for example change \"The evidence is up to date to April 2023\" to \"We updated the evidence to include studies up to April 2023\" and rewrite long noun‑dense sentences into active, shorter forms. These changes will bring the PLS into full compliance with the style guide and improve clarity for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS meets word‑count limits and most readability metrics (e.g., Flesch‑Reading Ease 51.68, FKGL 10.57). However, six metrics deviate from typical PLS patterns: passive_voice (22, P90), nouns (165, P90), smog_index (13.8, P90), complex_words_dc (253, P90), complex_words (121, P90), and long_words (170, P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun density, and complex vocabulary, supporting the need to simplify language and increase active voice."
