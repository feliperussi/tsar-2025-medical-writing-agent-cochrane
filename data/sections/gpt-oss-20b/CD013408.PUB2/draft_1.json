  "draft": "Does organized (team‑based or digital) care for adults with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) reduce death and hospital visits compared with usual care?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Organised care programmes that bring together several health professionals (multidisciplinary) or any digital tools (mHealth) probably lower the chance of dying from any cause compared with usual care, while they make little or no difference to the overall number of hospital admissions; the evidence is of moderate reliability and no clear increase in serious bleeding was reported.\n- These programmes also appear to reduce hospital stays that are directly related to heart problems (cardiovascular hospitalisations), although they do not clearly lower deaths specifically from heart causes or the risk of stroke and major bleeding.\n- Because the existing studies have some limitations and did not examine all possible harms, longer‑term, larger and well‑designed trials are needed to compare different models of organised care, evaluate costs and quality of life, and confirm these findings.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why does it matter?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart‑rhythm problem where the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly and often very fast. This can make the heart work less efficiently and raises the risk of serious complications such as stroke, heart failure, and early death. As people get older, more adults develop AF, so health services see a growing number of patients who need careful, ongoing care. Traditional care often involves a single doctor, but because AF can affect many parts of the body, experts suggest that a team‑based approach—called multidisciplinary care—where nurses, pharmacists, and other specialists work together, and the use of digital tools (eHealth or mHealth, which are health services delivered through computers or smartphones) might improve outcomes.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review aimed to compare organised, team‑based or technology‑supported models of care for adults with any type of AF against the usual way care is delivered (usual care, meaning the standard practice most patients receive). Specifically, the authors wanted to know whether these organised services could reduce deaths, hospital admissions, and other important health events, and whether they might improve quality of life or lower costs compared with standard care. The evidence was gathered from randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to different treatment groups to reduce bias) and other controlled studies.\n\n**Methods**\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing organised multidisciplinary or virtual atrial fibrillation clinical services with usual care, pooled their results, and assessed confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe included eight randomised controlled trials that together involved 8,205 adults with atrial fibrillation. The participants were on average between 60 and 73 years old. The studies were carried out in three countries – China, the Netherlands and Australia. Four trials tested a nurse‑led, multidisciplinary care model and two trials tested mobile‑health (mHealth) based management; all of these organised‑care approaches were compared with usual care. The abstract did not give details about how long each study lasted, how they were funded, the gender balance of participants or the exact severity of atrial fibrillation.\n\nMain results: Overall death\nOrganised care probably leads to a large reduction in overall death. Roughly three fewer people out of every 100 died over a six‑year period when they received the organised‑care interventions compared with usual care.\n\n**Limitations**\nOur confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which the Master Style Guide requires. Specifically, the subheadings \"Main results: Overall death\", \"Limitations\", and \"Currency\" are statements rather than questions. This breaks the required structure and may confuse readers looking for the familiar question‑based layout. In addition, the draft contains a very long, complex sentence in the Limitations section that overloads the reader with multiple clauses, and the overall text uses a high amount of passive voice (32 instances, far above the typical range) and many noun‑heavy constructions, making it harder to follow. These issues together reduce clarity and readability for a patient audience.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. Subheading format – Change non‑question headings to questions. Example: replace \"Limitations\" with \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and \"Currency\" with \"How up to date is the evidence?\".\n2. Long sentence in Limitations – The sentence \"Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.\" is over‑long and confusing. Rewrite as several shorter sentences, e.g., \"Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate. Some participants knew which treatment they received, which could bias the results. Not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, and many were small. The studies also involved different types of patients and used varied delivery methods, making it hard to be certain about the findings.\"\n3. Passive voice – Example: \"The evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search.\" is passive and awkward. Rewrite actively: \"We searched up to April 2023, so the evidence is current to that date.\"\n4. Nominalizations / noun‑heavy phrasing – Example: \"Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about it is possible that people...\" can be simplified to active verbs: \"We are only moderately confident in the evidence because participants may have known their treatment, and some studies did not report all outcomes.\"\n5. Clarity of key messages – The first key message combines several ideas in one long sentence. Split it for readability: \"Organised care programmes that bring together several health professionals (multidisciplinary) or use digital tools (mHealth) probably lower the chance of dying from any cause compared with usual care. They make little or no difference to the overall number of hospital admissions. The evidence is of moderate reliability, and no clear increase in serious bleeding was reported.\"\n\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide, reduce passive constructions (currently 32, well beyond the typical 9‑23 range), lower noun density, and improve overall readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (664 words) but shows significant deviations in several metrics: passive_voice = 32 (BEYOND_P90), nominalization = 21 (P90), nouns = 177 (P90), smog_index = 14.27 (P90), complex_words_dc = 276 (P90), complex_words = 144 (P90), long_words = 199 (P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy language, and high lexical complexity, supporting the need for the suggested rewrites."
