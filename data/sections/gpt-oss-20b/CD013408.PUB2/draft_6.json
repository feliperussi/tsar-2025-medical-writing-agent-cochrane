  "draft": "Does organized (team‑based or digital) care for adults with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) reduce death and hospital visits compared with usual care?\n\nKey messages\n– Organised care programmes that bring together several health professionals (multidisciplinary) or use digital tools (mHealth) probably lower the chance of dying from any cause compared with usual care; the evidence is of moderate certainty.  \n– These programmes probably reduce hospital stays that are directly related to heart problems (cardiovascular hospitalisations) but make little or no difference for overall hospital admissions, stroke, or major bleeding.  \n– The studies were small and varied, and they did not examine all possible harms. Larger, longer trials are needed to compare different models, assess costs and quality of life, and confirm these findings.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why does it matter?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart‑rhythm problem where the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly and often very fast. This can make the heart work less efficiently and raises the risk of stroke, heart failure, and early death. As people age, more adults develop AF, so health services see a growing number of patients who need careful, ongoing care. Traditional care often involves a single doctor, but because AF can affect many parts of the body, experts suggest a team‑based approach (multidisciplinary care) and the use of digital tools (eHealth or mHealth, which deliver health services through computers or smartphones).\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare organised, team‑based or technology‑supported models of care for adults with any type of AF against the usual way care is delivered (usual care). Specifically, we asked whether these organised services could reduce deaths, hospital admissions, and other important health events, and whether they might improve quality of life or lower costs.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared organised multidisciplinary or virtual AF services with usual care. Three review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We pooled the results and used the GRADE approach to rate our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included eight randomised controlled trials that together involved 8,205 adults with AF. Participants were on average 60–73 years old and the trials took place in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. Four trials tested a nurse‑led multidisciplinary model and two trials tested mHealth management; all compared the organised‑care approaches with usual care.\n\nWhat did we find about overall death?\nOrganised care probably leads to a large reduction in all‑cause mortality. About three fewer people per 100 died over a six‑year period when they received the organised‑care interventions compared with usual care.\n\nWhat did we find about hospital admissions?\nOrganised care probably makes little or no difference to the total number of hospital admissions, but it probably reduces cardiovascular (heart‑related) hospitalisations.\n\nWhat did we find about bleeding and stroke?\nWe did not see a clear increase or decrease in serious bleeding, and the programmes probably have little or no effect on stroke or major bleeding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is moderate because many participants knew which treatment they received, not all studies reported every outcome we were interested in, the trials were small, and the interventions varied. These factors make it harder to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nWe updated the evidence to include studies published up to April 2023.",

In addition, several clarity‑related problems could confuse readers: (1) passive constructions such as \"The evidence is up to date to April 2023\" obscure who performed the action; (2) a long, dense sentence (\"We searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared organised multidisciplinary or virtual AF services with usual care.\") makes the method hard to follow; (3) the term \"GRADE approach\" appears without any lay explanation, leaving non‑expert readers uncertain; (4) the schema‑required subheading style is broken because the bullet list under Key messages is not introduced by a question‑style subheading; (5) occasional wordy phrases (e.g., \"organised‑care interventions\") could be simplified. These issues, together with the metric alerts (23 passive voice instances, SMOG 14, 127 complex words, 169 long words) indicate the draft needs revision before it can be approved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft generally follows typical PLS patterns, but five metrics deviate: passive_voice (23, beyond typical range), smog_index (14, above median), complex_words_dc (246), complex_words (127) and long_words (169) – all higher than the median for PLS texts. These suggest the text is more complex and passive than usual, supporting the recommended edits."
