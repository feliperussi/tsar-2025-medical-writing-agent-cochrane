  "draft": "Does organized (team‑based or digital) care for adults with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) reduce death and hospital visits compared with usual care?\n\nKey messages\n– Care programmes that bring together several health professionals – such as nurses, pharmacists and doctors – (multidisciplinary care) or use digital tools on phones or computers (mHealth) probably lower the chance of dying from any cause. The evidence is of moderate certainty.  \n– These programmes probably reduce hospital stays that are directly related to heart problems, but they make little or no difference to the total number of hospital admissions, stroke or major bleeding.  \n– The studies were small, varied in design, and did not examine all possible harms. Larger, longer trials are needed to compare different models, assess costs and quality of life, and confirm these findings.\n\nWhat is atrial fibrillation and why does it matter?\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart‑rhythm problem where the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly and often very fast. This makes the heart work less efficiently and raises the risk of stroke, heart failure and early death. As people get older, more adults develop AF, so health services see a growing number of patients who need careful, ongoing care. Traditional care often involves a single doctor, but because AF can affect many parts of the body, experts suggest a team‑based approach (multidisciplinary care) and the use of digital tools (eHealth or mHealth, which deliver health services through computers or smartphones).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to compare organised, team‑based or technology‑supported models of care for adults with any type of AF against the usual way care is delivered (usual care). Specifically, we asked whether these organised services could reduce deaths, hospital admissions and other important health events, and whether they might improve quality of life or lower costs.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe looked for studies where participants were randomly assigned to either an organised team‑based or digital (virtual) care programme or to the usual care they normally receive. These studies are called randomised controlled trials. Three of us independently chose the studies, pulled out the data and checked each study for bias. We combined the results and used the GRADE system to rate how confident we are in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included eight randomised controlled trials that together involved 8,205 adults with AF. Participants were on average 60–73 years old and the trials were conducted in China, the Netherlands and Australia. Four trials tested a nurse‑led multidisciplinary model and two trials tested mHealth management; all compared the organised‑care approaches with usual care.\n\nOverall death\nOrganised care probably leads to a large reduction in all‑cause mortality. About three fewer people per 100 died over a six‑year period when they received the organised‑care interventions compared with usual care.\n\nHospital admissions\nOrganised care probably does not change the overall number of hospital stays, but it does reduce stays for heart‑related problems (cardiovascular hospitalisations).\n\nBleeding and stroke\nWe did not see a clear increase or decrease in serious bleeding, and the programmes probably have little or no effect on stroke or major bleeding.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are moderately confident in the evidence. Many participants knew which treatment they received, some studies did not report all outcomes we wanted, the trials were small, and the ways the care was delivered differed. These factors make it harder to be certain about the findings.\n\nHow up to date is the evidence?\nWe updated the evidence to include studies published up to April 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the subheading format requirement: not all section headings are phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\" and result sub‑headings like \"Overall death\" are statements). This is a critical check. Additionally, the text contains several clarity and style issues that would confuse readers: (1) the heading \"Key messages\" is not a question; (2) result sub‑headings are not questions; (3) the GRADE system is mentioned without explanation; (4) a passive‑voice sentence \"The evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search\" is awkward; (5) the draft is noun‑heavy and uses many complex words, reflected in the metrics (25 passive constructions, 162 nouns, 252 Dale‑Chall complex words, 118 complex words) which exceed typical PLS ranges and reduce readability. The suggested improvements address these points.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Heading format** – Quote: \"Key messages\". Problem: not a question, violating style guide. Rewrite: \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. **Result sub‑headings** – Quote: \"Overall death\". Problem: not a question. Rewrite: \"What did we find about overall death?\" (similarly for \"Hospital admissions\" → \"What did we find about hospital admissions?\", \"Bleeding and stroke\" → \"What did we find about bleeding and stroke?\").\n3. **Unexplained jargon** – Quote: \"GRADE system\". Problem: readers may not know what this is. Rewrite: \"We used the GRADE system, which rates how confident we are in the evidence, to assess the certainty of our findings.\".\n4. **Passive voice / awkward phrasing** – Quote: \"The evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search.\" Problem: passive and unclear. Rewrite: \"We searched for studies up to April 2023, so the evidence is current to that date.\".\n5. **Noun‑heavy, complex wording** – The draft contains many long and technical words (e.g., \"organised‑care interventions\", \"multidisciplinary\", \"cardiovascular hospitalisations\"). Simplify by using shorter alternatives: e.g., replace \"organised‑care interventions\" with \"team‑based care\" and \"cardiovascular hospitalisations\" with \"heart‑related hospital stays\".\n\nMetrics support: The evaluation shows 25 passive voice instances (beyond P90), 162 nouns (beyond P90), 252 Dale‑Chall complex words (beyond P90) and 118 complex words (beyond P90). Reducing passive constructions and simplifying vocabulary will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and the overall pattern conforms to typical PLS pattern, but it deviates significantly in four areas: passive_voice (25, BEYOND_P90), nouns (162, P90), complex_words_dc (252, P90) and complex_words (118, P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy sentences, and many difficult words, which should be reduced for clearer patient‑focused language."
