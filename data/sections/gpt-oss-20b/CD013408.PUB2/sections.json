  "plain_title": "Does organized (team‑based or digital) care for adults with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) reduce death and hospital visits compared with usual care?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Organised care programmes that bring together several health professionals (multidisciplinary) or any digital tools (mHealth) probably lower the chance of dying from any cause compared with usual care, while they make little or no difference to the overall number of hospital admissions; the evidence is of moderate reliability and no clear increase in serious bleeding was reported.",
    "These programmes also appear to reduce hospital stays that are directly related to heart problems (cardiovascular hospitalisations), although they do not clearly lower deaths specifically from heart causes or the risk of stroke and major bleeding.",
    "Because the existing studies have some limitations and did not examine all possible harms, longer‑term, larger and well‑designed trials are needed to compare different models of organised care, evaluate costs and quality of life, and confirm these findings."

      "subheading": "What is atrial fibrillation and why does it matter?",
      "content": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart‑rhythm problem where the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly and often very fast. This can make the heart work less efficiently and raises the risk of serious complications such as stroke, heart failure, and early death. As people get older, more adults develop AF, so health services see a growing number of patients who need careful, ongoing care. Traditional care often involves a single doctor, but because AF can affect many parts of the body, experts suggest that a team‑based approach—called multidisciplinary care—where nurses, pharmacists, and other specialists work together, and the use of digital tools (eHealth or mHealth, which are health services delivered through computers or smartphones) might improve outcomes."

      "subheading": "What did the researchers want to find out?",
      "content": "The review aimed to compare organised, team‑based or technology‑supported models of care for adults with any type of AF against the usual way care is delivered (usual care, meaning the standard practice most patients receive). Specifically, the authors wanted to know whether these organised services could reduce deaths, hospital admissions, and other important health events, and whether they might improve quality of life or lower costs compared with standard care. The evidence was gathered from randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to different treatment groups to reduce bias) and other controlled studies."

      "subheading": "What did we do?",
      "content": "We searched for studies comparing organised multidisciplinary or virtual atrial fibrillation clinical services with usual care, pooled their results, and assessed confidence in the evidence."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We included eight randomised controlled trials that together involved 8,205 adults with atrial fibrillation. The participants were on average between 60 and 73 years old. The studies were carried out in three countries – China, the Netherlands and Australia. Four trials tested a nurse‑led, multidisciplinary care model and two trials tested mobile‑health (mHealth) based management; all of these organised‑care approaches were compared with usual care. The abstract did not give details about how long each study lasted, how they were funded, the gender balance of participants or the exact severity of atrial fibrillation."

      "subheading": "Main results: Overall death",
      "content": "Organised care probably leads to a large reduction in overall death. Roughly three fewer people out of every 100 died over a six‑year period when they received the organised‑care interventions compared with usual care."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "Our confidence in the evidence is only moderate because of concerns about it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results, and the studies were done in different types of people and used different ways of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search."
