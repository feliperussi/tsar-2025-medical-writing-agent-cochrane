  "draft": "\"How accurate are toe‑brachial index (toe‑to‑arm blood pressure ratio) and toe systolic blood pressure (pressure measured in a toe) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (blocked arteries in the legs)?\"\n\nKey messages  \n– The review could not determine how accurate the toe‑brachial index (a ratio of toe to arm blood pressure) or toe systolic blood pressure (the pressure measured directly in a toe) are for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease because only a few low‑quality studies are available.  \n– Although clinicians often use these tests, the current evidence does not show how well they identify PAD and provides no information about possible harms.  \n– Better‑designed studies that compare the tests with reliable imaging of the leg arteries are needed to establish their true accuracy and safety.\n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?  \nPAD occurs when fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) narrow or block the arteries that supply blood to the legs. Reduced blood flow can cause pain while walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, or even amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. About 236 million people worldwide have PAD. Risk factors include older age, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes and other heart diseases. Detecting PAD early helps doctors manage these risks and prevent serious complications.\n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?  \nBoth tests are simple, non‑invasive bedside measurements.  \n– **Toe‑brachial index (TBI)** compares the blood pressure measured at the toe with the blood pressure measured in the arm. A lower ratio suggests reduced foot blood flow, which may indicate PAD.  \n– **Toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP)** records the actual pressure in the toe artery. Low toe pressure can also point to PAD.  \nWe like these tests because they do not require surgery or expensive imaging and can be performed quickly in many clinical settings.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to see how well TBI and TSBP identify PAD in the lower legs. Specifically we aimed to (1) estimate the accuracy of each test at different cut‑off values for people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the accuracy of TBI versus TSBP. We also planned to explore whether patient groups, the type of equipment used, the positivity threshold, or the reference imaging method affected test performance.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched many medical databases up to 27 Feb 2024 to find relevant studies. We included studies that measured TBI or TSBP in adults at risk of PAD and compared the results with a vascular imaging reference. Two reviewers extracted data, built 2 × 2 tables (true/false positives/negatives) and assessed study quality.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 18 diagnostic‑accuracy studies. Thirteen evaluated TBI only, one evaluated TSBP only, and four evaluated both tests. In total, TBI was measured in 1 927 participants (2 550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 participants (701 limbs). The studies enrolled adults of all ages, both symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, and sub‑groups such as people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or kidney disease.  \n\nWe measured blood flow with simple tools, like a small light sensor, a handheld probe, or a regular blood‑pressure cuff. Most studies compared the test results with a special ultrasound scan that shows blood flow, while a few used CT scans. The reports left out important details, such as how long the studies lasted, where they were done, who funded them, and the participants’ gender and disease severity. Based on the available evidence, we cannot determine whether TBI or TSBP reliably detect PAD.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe found that most of the studies were of low quality. Many did not explain how participants were selected, did not keep test results hidden from investigators, and did not report when the index test and the reference imaging were performed. Some studies also omitted data needed for analysis. Because of these problems, we have low confidence in the current evidence.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to February 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the required sub‑heading format – the \"Key messages\" heading is not phrased as a question. In addition, the text contains a high amount of passive constructions (24 instances, well beyond the typical PLS range), many noun‑heavy sentences, and a large number of complex/long words (complex_words = 137, long_words = 200, complex_words_dc = 298) which push the SMOG index to 14.0 (above the typical PLS range). These issues reduce readability for patients.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1. **Sub‑heading format** – Change \"Key messages\" to a question, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. **Passive voice** – Rewrite passive sentences in active voice. Example: replace \"The index measurements were taken with a range of devices\" with \"We used a range of devices to take the index measurements\".\n3. **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – Convert noun‑heavy clauses to verb‑focused sentences. Example: change \"The reports left out important details, such as how long the studies lasted, where they were done, who funded them, and the participants’ gender and disease severity\" to \"The reports omitted important details, including study duration, location, funding source, and participants’ gender and disease severity\".\n4. **Complex/long words** – Substitute difficult terms with everyday language. Example: replace \"diagnostic‑accuracy\" with \"test accuracy\" and \"photoplethysmography\" (if used) with \"light‑sensor test\".\n5. **Sentence length** – Break any sentences that approach or exceed 30 words into shorter ones to keep the average below 20 words per sentence.\n\nThese changes will bring the draft into line with the Master Style Guide and improve patient‑friendly readability while also moving the metrics toward typical PLS ranges.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (720 words) and most readability metrics are in the lower‑quartile (e.g., Flesch‑Kincaid 8.99, Gunning Fog 14.6). However, it deviates markedly on passive voice (24, BEYOND_P90), noun count (209, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (14.0, P90), and complex/long word counts (complex_words 137, long_words 200, complex_words_dc 298 – all beyond typical ranges). These deviations indicate the text is more passive, noun‑heavy, and uses more complex vocabulary than usual for Cochrane PLSs."
