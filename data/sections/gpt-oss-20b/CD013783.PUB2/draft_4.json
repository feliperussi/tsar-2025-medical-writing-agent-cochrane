  "draft": "How accurate are toe‑brachial index (toe‑to‑arm blood pressure ratio) and toe systolic blood pressure (pressure measured in a toe) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (blocked arteries in the legs)?\n\nKey messages\n- We could not tell how accurate the toe‑brachial index (TBI) or toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (PAD) because only a few low‑quality studies are available.  \n- Although doctors often use these tests, the current evidence does not show how well they identify PAD and gives no information about possible harms.  \n- Better‑designed studies that compare TBI and TSBP with reliable imaging of the leg arteries are needed to determine their true accuracy and safety.  \n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?  \nPAD happens when fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) narrow or block the arteries that supply blood to the legs. Reduced blood flow can cause pain while the user is walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, or even amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. About 236 million people worldwide have PAD. Risk factors include older age, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes and other heart diseases. Detecting PAD early helps us manage these risks and prevent serious complications.  \n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?  \nBoth tests are simple, non‑invasive bedside measurements.  \n- **Toe‑brachial index (TBI)** compares the blood pressure measured at the toe with the blood pressure measured in the arm. A lower ratio suggests reduced foot blood flow, which may indicate PAD.  \n- **Toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP)** records the actual pressure in the toe artery. Low toe pressure can also point to PAD.  \nWe like these tests because they do not require surgery or expensive imaging and can be done quickly in many clinical settings.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to see how well TBI and TSBP identify PAD in the lower legs. Specifically we aimed to (1) estimate the accuracy of each test at different cut‑off values for people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the accuracy of TBI versus TSBP. We also planned to explore whether patient groups, the type of equipment used, the positivity threshold, or the reference imaging method affected test performance.  \n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, Zetoc, DARE and trial registers up to 27 February 2024. We included studies that measured TBI or TSBP in adults at risk of PAD and compared the results with a vascular imaging reference. We combined the accuracy data and assessed our confidence in the evidence.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 18 diagnostic‑accuracy studies. Thirteen evaluated TBI only, one evaluated TSBP only, and four evaluated both tests. In total, TBI was measured in 1 927 participants (2 550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 participants (701 limbs). The studies enrolled adults of all ages, both symptomatic and asym and sub‑groups such as people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or kidney disease.  \n\nResearchers used several simple machines to measure blood flow. These included a small light sensor, a laser‑based device, a sound‑wave device, a manual or aneroid blood‑pressure cuff, and automated digital equipment. They compared the test results with standard imaging of the leg arteries, most often a colour‑duplex ultrasound (an ultrasound scan that shows blood flow). Other reference tests were CT scans with contrast (CT angiography), advanced CT scans (multi‑detector CT) or conventional X‑ray angiography. The reports did not give details on study duration, country, funding source, gender distribution or disease severity. Based on the evidence we have, we cannot tell if TBI or TSBP can reliably spot PAD.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe studies were generally low quality. Many did not explain how participants were chosen, did not keep test results hidden from investigators, and did not report when the index test and the reference imaging were performed. Some studies also omitted data we needed for analysis. Because of these problems, we are not confident in the current evidence.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to February 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

The draft also contains several clarity and style issues that could confuse readers. Top improvements needed:\n1. Subheading format – Change \"Key messages\" to a question, e.g., \"What are the key messages?\".\n2. Unexplained abbreviation – Quote: \"...both symptomatic and asym and sub‑groups such as people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or kidney disease.\" Explanation: \"asym\" is unclear to patients. Rewrite: \"...both symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, including sub‑groups such as people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or kidney disease.\".\n3. Long, noun‑heavy sentence – Quote: \"Researchers used several simple machines to measure blood flow. These included a small light sensor, a laser‑based device, a sound‑wave device, a manual or aneroid blood‑pressure cuff, and automated digital equipment.\" Explanation: two sentences with many technical nouns can overwhelm readers. Rewrite: \"We used simple devices to measure blood flow, such as a small light sensor, a laser‑based device, a sound‑wave probe, and either a manual or aneroid blood‑pressure cuff, as well as automated digital equipment.\".\n4. Style – High passive voice and nominalisations – Quote: \"Based on the evidence we have, we cannot tell if TBI or TSBP can reliably spot PAD.\" Explanation: passive‑heavy phrasing reduces clarity. Rewrite in active voice: \"Our evidence shows that we cannot determine whether TBI or TSBP reliably detect PAD.\".\n5. Noun‑heavy paragraph – Quote: \"The reports did not give details on study duration, country, funding source, gender distribution or disease severity.\" Explanation: long list of nouns; can be broken for readability. Rewrite: \"The reports omitted details such as study duration, the countries where they were conducted, funding sources, gender distribution, and disease severity.\".\n\nMetrics support these suggestions: the draft has 21 passive constructions (P90), 22 nominalisations (P90), 216 nouns (beyond P90), 297 Dale‑Chall complex words (beyond P90), 141 complex words (P90) and 202 long words (P90). Reducing passive voice, nominalisations, and noun density will improve readability and align the text with typical patient‑friendly language patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (55 % of features in best quartile) but notable deviations: passive_voice (21, P90), nominalization (22, P90), nouns (216, beyond P90), smog_index (14.1, P90), complex_words_dc (297, beyond P90), complex_words (141, P90) and long_words (202, P90). These indicate the draft is overly noun‑heavy, uses many complex and long words, and contains excessive passive constructions, which can hinder patient‑friendly readability."
