  "draft": "How accurate are toe‑brachial index (toe‑to‑arm blood pressure ratio) and toe systolic blood pressure (pressure measured in a toe) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (blocked arteries in the legs)?\n\nKey messages\n- We could not determine how accurate the toe‑brachial index (TBI) or toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (PAD) because the available studies were few and of low quality.  \n- Although clinicians often use these tests, the current evidence does not show how well they identify PAD, and no data were found on possible side effects of the measurements.  \n- Better‑designed studies that compare TBI and TSBP with reliable imaging of the leg arteries are needed to establish their true accuracy and safety.  \n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?  \nPAD occurs when fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) narrow or block the arteries that supply blood to the legs. Reduced blood flow can cause pain while walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, or even amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. About 236 million people worldwide have PAD, and risk factors include older age, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes and other heart diseases. Detecting PAD early helps doctors manage these risks and prevent serious complications.  \n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?  \nBoth tests are simple, non‑invasive, bedside measurements. – **Toe‑brachial index (TBI)** compares the blood pressure measured at the toe with the blood pressure measured in the arm; a lower ratio suggests reduced foot blood flow, which may indicate PAD. – **Toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP)** records the actual pressure in the toe artery; low toe pressure can also point to PAD. Because they do not require surgery or expensive imaging, they can be performed quickly in many clinical settings.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to see how well TBI and TSBP identify PAD in the lower legs. Specifically, we aimed to (1) estimate the accuracy of each test at different cut‑off values for people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the accuracy of TBI versus TSBP. We also planned to explore whether patient groups, equipment type, positivity thresholds or reference imaging methods affect test performance.  \n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, Zetoc, DARE and trial registers up to 27 February 2024. We included studies that measured TBI or TSBP in adults at risk of PAD and compared the results with a vascular imaging reference. We combined the accuracy data and assessed our confidence in the evidence.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 18 diagnostic‑accuracy studies. Thirteen evaluated TBI only, one evaluated TSBP only, and four evaluated both tests. In total, TBI was measured in 1 927 participants (2 550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 participants (701 limbs). The studies enrolled adults of all ages, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, and sub‑groups such as people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or kidney disease. Researchers used several simple machines that measure blood flow, such as a small light probe (photoplethysmography), a laser‑based device (laser Doppler), a sound‑wave device (continuous‑wave Doppler), a manual or aneroid blood‑pressure cuff, and automated digital equipment. They compared the test results with standard imaging scans of the leg arteries, most often colour‑duplex ultrasound (an ultrasound that shows blood flow), but also CT angiography (CT scan with contrast), multi‑detector CT, conventional angiography, or combinations of these. The reports did not provide details on study duration, country, funding, gender distribution or disease severity. Based on the available evidence, we cannot say whether TBI or TSBP reliably identify PAD.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe studies were generally low quality. They often did not explain how participants were chosen, did not keep test results hidden from investigators, and did not report when the index test and the reference imaging were performed. Some studies also omitted data that we needed for our analysis. Because of these problems, we are not confident in the current evidence.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to February 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the required sections, title/sub‑heading format, factual accuracy and word‑count limits, but it contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse patients. 1) It uses technical jargon (e.g., \"photoplethysmography, laser Doppler, continuous‑wave Doppler, colour‑duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, multi‑detector CT, angiography\") without lay explanations. 2) Some sentences are overly long, making them hard to follow (e.g., the sentence describing the range of devices). 3) The draft relies on passive constructions (e.g., \"The reports did not provide details…\") which obscure who did what. 4) The text is noun‑heavy and includes many complex/long words, reducing readability. These issues are reflected in the metrics (passive_voice = 20 → P90, nouns = 212 → BEYOND_P90, complex_words = 144 → P90, long_words = 212 → P90, smog_index = 14.4 → P90). The draft therefore does not yet meet the clarity standards for a patient‑focused Plain Language Summary.\n\nTop improvements needed:\n1) **Technical jargon** – Quote: \"photoplethysmography, laser Doppler, continuous‑wave Doppler, colour‑duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, multi‑detector CT, angiography\". Why problematic: patients are unlikely to know these terms. Rewrite: \"different simple machines that measure blood flow, such as a small light sensor, a laser device, a sound‑wave device, a standard ultrasound scan, or a CT scan\".\n2) **Overly long sentence** – Quote: \"Researchers used several simple machines that measure blood flow, such as a small light probe (photoplethysmography), a laser‑based device (laser Doppler), a sound‑wave device (continuous‑wave Doppler), a manual or aneroid blood‑pressure cuff, and automated digital equipment.\" Why problematic: >30 words and many commas. Rewrite: \"Researchers used several simple machines to measure blood flow. These included a small light probe, a laser‑based device, a sound‑wave device, a manual or aneroid blood‑pressure cuff, and automated digital equipment.\"\n3) **Passive voice** – Quote: \"The reports did not provide details on study duration, country, funding, gender distribution or disease severity.\" Why problematic: hides who omitted the information. Rewrite: \"The studies did not report the duration, country, funding source, gender distribution or disease severity.\"\n4) **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – Quote: \"Based on the available evidence, we cannot say whether TBI or TSBP reliably identify PAD.\" Why problematic: many nouns make the sentence dense. Rewrite: \"From the evidence we have, we cannot tell if TBI or TSBP can reliably spot PAD.\"\n5) **Complex words** – Quote: \"diagnostic‑accuracy studies\". Why problematic: may be unfamiliar. Rewrite: \"studies that tested how accurate the tests are\".\n\nThese revisions will lower the number of passive constructions, reduce noun density, simplify vocabulary, and bring the readability indices (e.g., smog_index, complex_words, long_words) closer to typical PLS ranges.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on overall conformity (61% of features in best quartile) but shows notable deviations: passive_voice (20, P90), nouns (212, BEYOND_P90), smog_index (14.4, P90), complex_words (144, P90), complex_words_dc (302, BEYOND_P90), and long_words (212, BEYOND_P90).
