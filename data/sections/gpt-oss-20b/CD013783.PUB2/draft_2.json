  "draft": "How accurate are toe‑brachial index (toe‑to‑arm blood pressure ratio) and toe systolic blood pressure (pressure measured in a toe) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (blocked arteries in the legs)?\n\nWhat are the main messages?\n- We could not determine how accurate the toe‑brachial index (TBI) or toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The studies were few, of low quality, and did not provide reliable information about benefits or harms.\n- Although clinicians often use these tests, the current evidence does not show how well they identify PAD, and no data were found on possible side effects of the measurements.\n- Better‑designed studies that compare TBI and TSBP with a reliable reference (such as imaging of leg arteries) are needed to establish their true accuracy and safety.\n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?\nPAD is a condition where arteries that supply blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked by atherosclerosis (fatty deposits). This reduces blood flow and can cause pain when walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, or even amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. About 236 million people worldwide have PAD. Risk factors include older age, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes and other heart diseases. Detecting PAD early helps clinicians manage these risks and prevent serious complications.\n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?\n- TBI compares the blood pressure measured at the toe with the blood pressure measured in the arm. A lower ratio suggests reduced blood flow to the foot, which may indicate PAD.\n- TSBP measures the actual pressure in the toe artery. Low toe pressure can also point to PAD.\nThese tests are simple, non‑invasive, and can be performed at the bedside without surgery or expensive imaging.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to see how well TBI and TSBP identify PAD in the lower legs. Specifically, we aimed to (1) estimate the accuracy of each test at different cut‑off values for people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the accuracy of TBI versus TSBP. We also planned to explore whether patient groups, equipment type, positivity thresholds or reference standards affect test performance.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched multiple databases up to 27 February 2024 for studies that measured TBI or TSBP and compared the results with a vascular imaging reference in adults at risk of PAD. We combined the accuracy data and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 18 diagnostic‑accuracy studies. Thirteen evaluated TBI only, one evaluated TSBP only, and four evaluated both tests. In total, TBI was measured in 1,927 participants (2,550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 participants (701 limbs). The studies enrolled adults of all ages, including symptomatic and asymptomatic people, and sub‑groups such as those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or renal disease. Researchers used various devices—photoplethysmography, laser Doppler, continuous‑wave Doppler, manual or aneroid sphygmomanometers, and automated digital equipment—and compared the results with validated imaging standards, most often colour‑duplex ultrasound, but also CT angiography, multi‑detector CT, conventional angiography, or combinations of these. The reports did not provide details on study duration, country, funding, gender distribution or disease severity. Based on the available evidence, we cannot say whether TBI or TSBP reliably identify PAD.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe lack confidence in the evidence because many studies did not conceal test results from investigators, and several did not report all the data we needed. The overall methodological quality was low.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nThe evidence reflects searches completed up to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft contains several clarity problems that would likely confuse a patient audience. 1) **Unexplained technical jargon** – the sentence \"Researchers used various devices—photoplethysmography, laser Doppler, continuous‑wave Doppler, manual or aneroid sphygmomanometers, and automated digital equipment—and compared the results with validated imaging standards, most often colour‑duplex ultrasound, but also CT angiography, multi‑detector CT, conventional angiography, or combinations thereof.\" lists many specialised instruments without any lay explanation. Rewrite to say something like: \"Researchers used several types of simple machines that measure blood flow, such as a small probe that shines light on the skin (photoplethysmography) or a handheld cuff, and they compared the results with standard imaging scans of the leg arteries (ultrasound or CT scans).\" 2) **Overly long sentence** – the same sentence above exceeds 30 words and packs multiple ideas, making it hard to follow. Split it into two shorter sentences as suggested. 3) **Passive voice** – \"The evidence reflects searches completed up to February 2024.\" hides who did the work. Change to active: \"We searched the literature up to February 2024.\" 4) **Noun‑heavy description of study quality** – \"The overall methodological quality was low, with poor reporting of participant recruitment in regard to consecutive or random sampling, and poor reporting of blinding between index test and reference standard, as well as timing between index test and reference standard.\" This dense noun string can be simplified: \"The studies were generally low quality: they often did not explain how participants were chosen, did not keep the test results hidden from the investigators, and did not report when the tests were done.\" 5) **Passive phrasing in the limitations** – \"We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting...\" could be clearer: \"We are not confident in the evidence because participants and researchers often knew which test was being used, and some studies did not provide all the data we needed.\" These issues are reflected in the metric report (20 passive constructions, 22 nominalisations, 187 nouns, SMOG 14.1, many complex and long words), confirming the need for more active, concise, and plain‑language writing. Addressing the points above will bring the summary into line with the Master Style Guide and improve patient‑readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity (word count 641, readability scores in the best quartile), but several metrics deviate strongly: passive_voice (20, P90), nominalisation (22, P90), noun count (187, P90), SMOG index (14.1, P90), and high counts of complex and long words. These indicate the draft is overly noun‑heavy, uses many passive constructions, and contains many technical terms, which aligns with the clarity issues identified."
