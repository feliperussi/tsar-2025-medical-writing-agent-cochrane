  "draft": "How accurate are toe‑brachial index (toe‑to‑arm blood pressure ratio) and toe systolic blood pressure (pressure measured in a toe) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (blocked arteries in the legs)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– The review could not determine how accurate the toe‑brachial index (TBI) or toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (PAD) because only a few low‑quality studies exist.  \n– Although clinicians often use these tests, the current evidence does not show how well they identify PAD and provides no information about possible harms.  \n– Better‑designed studies that compare TBI and TSBP with reliable imaging of the leg arteries are needed to establish their true accuracy and safety.\n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?  \nPAD occurs when fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) narrow or block the arteries that supply blood to the legs. Reduced blood flow can cause pain while walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, or even amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. About 236 million people worldwide have PAD. Risk factors include older age, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes and other heart diseases. Detecting PAD early helps doctors manage these risks and prevent serious complications.\n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?  \nBoth tests are simple, non‑invasive bedside measurements.  \n– **Toe‑brachial index (TBI)** compares the blood pressure measured at the toe with the blood pressure measured in the arm. A lower ratio suggests reduced foot blood flow, which may indicate PAD.  \n– **Toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP)** records the actual pressure in the toe artery. Low toe pressure can also point to PAD.  \nWe like these tests because they do not require surgery or expensive imaging and can be performed quickly in many clinical settings.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to see how well TBI and TSBP identify PAD in the lower legs. Specifically we aimed to (1) estimate the accuracy of each test at different cut‑off values for people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the accuracy of TBI versus TSBP. We also planned to explore whether patient groups, the type of equipment used, the positivity threshold, or the reference imaging method affected test performance.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, Zetoc, DARE and trial registers up to 27 February 2024. We included studies that measured TBI or TSBP in adults at risk of PAD and compared the results with a vascular imaging reference. Two reviewers extracted data, built 2 × 2 tables (true/false positives/negatives) and assessed study quality.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 18 diagnostic‑accuracy studies. Thirteen evaluated TBI only, one evaluated TSBP only, and four evaluated both tests. In total, TBI was measured in 1 927 participants (2 550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 participants (701 limbs). The studies enrolled adults of all ages, both symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, and sub‑groups such as people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or kidney disease.\n\nWe used simple devices to measure blood flow, such as a small light sensor, a laser‑based device, a sound‑wave probe, a manual or aneroid blood‑pressure cuff, and automated digital equipment. Most studies compared the test results with colour‑duplex ultrasound, while some used CT angiography, multi‑detector CT or conventional angiography. The reports omitted details such as study duration, the countries where they were conducted, funding sources, gender distribution and disease severity. Based on the available evidence, we cannot determine whether TBI or TSBP reliably detect PAD.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nThe studies were generally low quality. Many did not explain how participants were selected, did not keep test results hidden from investigators, and did not report when the index test and the reference imaging were performed. Some studies also omitted data needed for analysis. Because of these problems, we have low confidence in the current evidence.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to February 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

The PLS evaluation also flags a high number of passive constructions (24, beyond typical), many nouns (208) and a high count of complex/long words, confirming the need for more active, concise language. To meet Cochrane plain‑language standards, the draft should be revised to address the points above.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft scores well on overall conformity (61% of features in best quartile) and meets the word‑count limit. However, several metrics deviate markedly: passive_voice (24, BEYOND_P90), nouns (208, BEYOND_P90), complex_words_dc (298, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (143, P90) and long_words (205, P90). These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun‑heavy sentences, and many difficult words, supporting the editorial recommendation to use more active voice, fewer nouns and simpler vocabulary."
