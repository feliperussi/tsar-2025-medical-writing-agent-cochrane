  "plain_title": "How accurate are toe‑brachial index (toe‑to‑arm blood pressure ratio) and toe systolic blood pressure (pressure measured in a toe) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (blocked arteries in the legs)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "The review could not determine how accurate the toe‑brachial index (a ratio of blood pressure measured at the toe compared with the arm) or toe systolic blood pressure (the pressure measured directly in a toe) are for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (blocked arteries in the legs). The available studies were few, of poor quality, and did not provide reliable information about benefits or any harmful effects of using these tests.",
    "Although these tests are commonly used in clinical practice to look for PAD, the current evidence does not clearly show how well they identify the condition, and no information was found about possible side effects of the measurements.",
    "More well‑designed studies are needed that compare the tests against a reliable reference (such as imaging of the leg arteries) and report results clearly, so that the true accuracy and any potential harms of toe‑brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure can be established."

      "subheading": "Why is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?",
      "content": "Peripheral arterial disease is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked by fatty deposits (atherosclerosis). This reduces blood flow, which can cause pain when walking (called claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, and may even lead to amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. Around 236 million people worldwide have PAD, and risk factors include older age, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other heart‑related diseases. Detecting PAD early is important so doctors can manage these risks and prevent serious complications."

      "subheading": "What are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?",
      "content": "Both TBI and TSBP are simple, non‑invasive tests that can be done at a bedside.\n- **Toe‑brachial index (TBI)** compares the blood pressure measured at the toe with the blood pressure measured in the arm. A lower ratio suggests reduced blood flow to the foot, which may indicate PAD.\n- **Toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP)** measures the actual pressure in the toe artery. Low toe pressure can also point to PAD.\nThese tests are useful because they do not require surgery or expensive imaging, and they can be performed quickly in many clinical settings."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to determine how well TBI and TSBP identify PAD in the lower legs. Specifically, they aimed to (1) estimate the accuracy of each test at different cut‑off values for people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the accuracy of TBI versus TSBP. They also planned to explore whether factors such as the type of patients (e.g., diabetes or kidney disease), the equipment used, the threshold for a positive test, or the reference imaging method affected the test performance."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 18 diagnostic accuracy studies that evaluated the toe‑brachial index (TBI) and/or toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) for detecting lower‑extremity peripheral arterial disease. In total, TBI was assessed in 1,927 adult participants (covering 2,550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 adults (701 limbs); some studies examined both tests. All studies enrolled people aged 18 years or older, including both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and sub‑groups such as patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, renal disease, or the general at‑risk population. The index measurements were taken with a range of devices—photoplethysmography, laser Doppler, continuous‑wave Doppler, manual or aneroid sphygmomanometers, and automated digital equipment—and were compared against validated vascular imaging reference standards, most commonly colour‑duplex ultrasound, but also CT angiography, multi‑detector row CT, conventional angiography, or combinations thereof. The abstracts did not report the duration of the individual studies, the countries where they were conducted, their sources of funding, gender distribution, or disease severity. Based on the available evidence, it remains unclear whether the toe‑brachial index or toe systolic blood pressure can reliably identify peripheral arterial disease."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search."
