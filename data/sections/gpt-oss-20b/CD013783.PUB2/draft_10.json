  "draft": "\"How accurate are toe‑brachial index (toe‑to‑arm blood pressure ratio) and toe systolic blood pressure (pressure measured in a toe) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (blocked arteries in the legs)?\n\nKey messages\n– We could not tell how well the toe‑brachial index (TBI) or toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) detect peripheral arterial disease because only a few low‑quality studies are available.  \n– Although clinicians often use these bedside tests, the current evidence does not show how reliably they identify PAD and gives no information about possible harms.  \n– Better‑designed studies that compare the tests with reliable imaging of leg arteries are needed to establish their true accuracy and safety.\n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?  \nPAD occurs when fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) narrow or block the arteries that supply blood to the legs. Reduced blood flow can cause pain while walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, or even amputation. PAD also raises the risk of heart attacks and strokes. About 236 million people worldwide have PAD. Risk factors include older age, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes and other heart diseases. Detecting PAD early helps doctors manage these risks and prevent serious complications.\n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?  \nBoth tests are simple, non‑invasive measurements that can be done at the bedside.  \n– **Toe‑brachial index (TBI)** compares the blood pressure measured at the toe with the pressure measured in the arm. A lower ratio suggests reduced foot blood flow, which may indicate PAD.  \n– **Toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP)** records the actual pressure in the toe artery. Low toe pressure can also point to PAD.  \nWe like these tests because they do not require surgery or expensive imaging and can be performed quickly in many clinical settings.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to see how well TBI and TSBP identify PAD in the lower legs. Specifically we aimed to (1) estimate the accuracy of each test at different cut‑off values for people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the accuracy of TBI versus TSBP. We also planned to explore whether patient groups, the type of equipment used, the positivity threshold, or the reference imaging method affected test performance.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major medical databases up to 27 Feb 2024 for studies that measured TBI or TSBP in adults at risk of PAD and compared the results with a vascular imaging reference. Two reviewers extracted data, built 2 × 2 tables (true/false positives/negatives) and assessed study quality.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 18 diagnostic‑accuracy studies. Thirteen evaluated TBI only, one evaluated TSBP only, and four evaluated both tests. In total, TBI was measured in 1 927 participants (2 550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 participants (701 limbs). The studies included people of all ages, both with and without symptoms, and sub‑groups such as diabetes or kidney disease.  \n\nWe took the index measurements with several devices. These included a light‑based sensor (photoplethysmography, a light sensor that detects blood flow), a laser sensor (laser Doppler, a laser that detects blood flow), an ultrasound probe (continuous‑wave Doppler, which uses sound waves to detect flow), standard hand‑held blood‑pressure cuffs (manual or aneroid sphygmomanometers), and automated digital cuffs.  \n\nMost studies used colour‑duplex ultrasound as the reference (an ultrasound scan that shows blood flow in leg arteries). A few used CT angiography (a CT scan that visualises arteries), multi‑detector row CT (an advanced CT scan that visualises arteries), conventional angiography (an X‑ray test that visualises arteries), or combinations of these methods.  \n\nThe reports omitted important details such as study duration, country, funding source, gender distribution and disease severity. Because of these gaps, we cannot say whether TBI or TSBP reliably detect PAD.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMost studies were of low quality. Many did not explain how participants were selected, did not keep test results hidden from investigators, and did not report when the index test and the reference imaging were performed. Some studies also omitted data needed for analysis. These problems give us low confidence in the current evidence.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to February 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that **all subheadings must be phrased as questions** – the section titled \"Key messages\" is not a question. This structural issue alone prevents approval. In addition, several clarity and style problems would likely confuse readers:\n1. **Long, jargon‑heavy sentence about measurement devices** – \"We took the index measurements with several devices. These included a light‑based sensor (photoplethysmography, a light sensor that detects blood flow), a laser sensor (laser Doppler, a laser that detects blood flow), an ultrasound probe (continuous‑wave Doppler, which uses sound waves to detect flow), standard hand‑held blood‑pressure cuffs (manual or aneroid sphygmomanometers), and automated digital cuffs.\" This sentence is over‑long and packs many technical terms, making it hard to follow.\n   *Rewrite:* \"The studies used several devices to measure toe‑brachial index or toe systolic pressure: a light‑based sensor (photoplethysmography), a laser Doppler sensor, a continuous‑wave Doppler probe, standard hand‑held blood‑pressure cuffs (manual or aneroid), and automated digital cuffs.\"\n2. **Informal phrasing that reduces authority** – \"We like these tests because they do not require surgery or expensive imaging…\" sounds conversational.\n   *Rewrite:* \"We consider these tests useful because they do not require surgery or expensive imaging and can be performed quickly in many clinical settings.\"\n3. **Passive‑voice overuse** – The draft contains 23 passive constructions (P90), which can obscure who performed actions and lower readability. Example: \"The evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search.\"\n   *Rewrite:* \"We searched the literature up to February 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.\"\n4. **Noun‑heavy style** – With 233 nouns (beyond P90) the text feels dense. Converting nominalisations to verbs improves flow. Example: \"The reports omitted important details…\" is acceptable, but elsewhere phrases like \"the index measurements\" could become \"the researchers measured the index\".\n   *Rewrite:* \"Researchers measured the index using several devices…\"\n5. **Subheading phrasing** – Change \"Key messages\" to a question to meet the style guide.\n   *Rewrite:* \"What are the key messages?\"\nThese issues, together with the structural subheading problem, mean the draft does not meet the required standards.\n\n**Metrics support**: The evaluation shows a high passive‑voice count (23, P90), an excessive noun count (233, beyond P90), and many complex/long words (complex_words = 150, long_words = 213, both beyond P90). These metrics confirm the editorial observations about dense, passive‑heavy language and justify the suggested simplifications.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft generally conforms to typical patterns (66.7% of features in best quartile), but six metrics deviate significantly: passive_voice (P90), nouns, smog_index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words (all beyond P90). These indicate the text is more passive, noun‑heavy, and uses many complex/long words than typical PLS, supporting the need for active‑voice, noun reduction, and simplification."
