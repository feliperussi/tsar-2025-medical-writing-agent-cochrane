  "draft": "How accurate are toe‑brachial index (toe‑to‑arm blood pressure ratio) and toe systolic blood pressure (pressure measured in a toe) for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (blocked arteries in the legs)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– We could not determine how well the toe‑brachial index (TBI) or toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) detect peripheral arterial disease because only a few low‑quality studies are available.  \n– Although clinicians often use these bedside tests, the current evidence does not show how reliably they identify PAD and provides no information about possible harms.  \n– Better‑designed studies that compare the tests with reliable imaging of leg arteries are needed to establish their true accuracy and safety.\n\nWhy is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a health problem?  \nPAD occurs when fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) narrow or block the arteries that supply blood to the legs. Reduced blood flow can cause pain while walking (claudication), pain at rest, slow‑healing wounds, gangrene, or even amputation. PAD also signals a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. About 236 million people worldwide have PAD. Risk factors include older age, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes and other heart diseases. Detecting PAD early helps doctors manage these risks and prevent serious complications.\n\nWhat are toe‑brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) and why might they help?  \nBoth tests are simple, non‑invasive bedside measurements.  \n– **Toe‑brachial index (TBI)** compares the blood pressure measured at the toe with the pressure measured in the arm. A lower ratio suggests reduced foot blood flow, which may indicate PAD.  \n– **Toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP)** records the actual pressure in the toe artery. Low toe pressure can also point to PAD.  \nWe like these tests because they do not require surgery or expensive imaging and can be performed quickly in many clinical settings.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to see how well TBI and TSBP identify PAD in the lower legs. Specifically we aimed to (1) estimate the accuracy of each test at different cut‑off values for people at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the accuracy of TBI versus TSBP. We also planned to explore whether patient groups, the type of equipment used, the positivity threshold, or the reference imaging method affected test performance.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched major medical databases up to 27 Feb 2024 for studies that measured TBI or TSBP in adults at risk of PAD and compared the results with a vascular imaging reference. Two reviewers extracted data, built 2 × 2 tables (true/false positives/negatives) and assessed study quality.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 18 studies. Thirteen evaluated TBI only, one evaluated TSBP only, and four evaluated both tests. In total, TBI was measured in 1 927 participants (2 550 limbs) and TSBP in 701 participants (701 limbs). The studies included people of all ages, both with and without symptoms, and sub‑groups such as diabetes or kidney disease. We used a range of devices – light‑sensor tests, laser Doppler, continuous‑wave Doppler, manual or aneroid blood‑pressure cuffs, and automated digital equipment – and compared the results mainly with colour‑duplex ultrasound, with a few using CT angiography or conventional angiography. The reports omitted important details, including study duration, location, funding source, and participants’ gender and disease severity. Because of these gaps, we cannot say whether TBI or TSBP reliably detect PAD.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nMost studies were of low quality. Many did not explain how participants were selected, did not keep test results hidden from investigators, and did not report when the index test and the reference imaging were performed. Some studies also omitted data needed for analysis. These problems give us low confidence in the current evidence.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched the literature up to February 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published before that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical clarity checks: (1) several technical terms (e.g., colour‑duplex ultrasound, photoplethysmography, laser Doppler, continuous‑wave Doppler, aneroid) are used without plain‑language explanations, which will confuse patients. (2) A number of sentences exceed 30 words and are hard to follow, e.g., “We searched major medical databases up to 27 Feb 2024 for studies that measured TBI or TSBP in adults at risk of PAD and compared the results with a vascular imaging reference.” (3) Excessive passive constructions and noun‑heavy phrasing obscure who did what, e.g., “The reports omitted important details…” and “The abstracts did not report the duration…”. These issues, combined with metric evidence (22 passive voice instances – P90, 201 nouns – P90, 289 Dale‑Chall complex words – BEYOND_P90), reduce readability for the intended audience. Suggested improvements: • Define technical terms in simple language (e.g., “colour‑duplex ultrasound, a type of scan that shows blood flow in the leg arteries”). • Split long sentences into shorter ones (e.g., “We searched major medical databases up to 27 Feb 2024. We looked for studies that measured TBI or TSBP in adults at risk of PAD and compared the results with a vascular imaging reference.”). • Convert passive to active voice (e.g., “We found that the reports omitted important details…”) and replace noun‑heavy phrases with active verbs. Implementing these changes will bring the PLS within typical readability ranges and meet the style guide.",

These indicate excessive passive constructions, noun density, and complex vocabulary, supporting the identified clarity issues."
