  "draft": "Does letting early‑born babies (preterm infants) smell and taste milk during tube feeding help them start normal feeding sooner?\n\nKey messages\n– Giving preterm babies (infants born before 37 weeks) the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding (feeding through a tube that bypasses the mouth) does not speed up the time they start feeding normally by sucking, and no harmful effects were reported.\n– The same approach also makes little or no difference to how long the babies need intravenous nutrition (nutrition given through a vein), how quickly they reach full tube feeding, or the risk of serious gut problems (necrotising enterocolitis) or later infections.\n– Because the studies were small and had methodological problems, we need larger, well‑designed trials to see whether this simple, low‑cost intervention might help any group of preterm infants.\n\nWhy is feeding a challenge for preterm infants?\nPreterm infants often cannot coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing well enough to feed from a bottle or breast. Therefore they receive nutrition through a tube that goes into the stomach (orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding). This method bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not smell or taste the milk. Without that sensory exposure, the development of normal feeding skills may be slower, tube feeding may last longer, and hospital stays can be extended.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether exposing preterm infants to the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the same time as their tube feeds helps them move more quickly to full oral (sucking) feeds. We also checked whether this low‑cost intervention caused any harm, such as increasing the risk of necrotising enterocolitis or infections.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched major medical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Epistemonikos) and trial registers up to 26 April 2023. We included randomised and quasi‑randomised studies that compared smell‑and‑taste exposure with no exposure during tube feeding. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined results using standard meta‑analysis methods and rated our confidence in the evidence with GRADE.\n\nWhat did we find?\nEight trials involving 1 277 preterm infants met our criteria. The evidence is very uncertain about any benefit for the time to reach full sucking feeds; the average difference was about one day shorter, but confidence was low. The intervention probably makes little or no difference to the duration of intravenous nutrition, the time to reach full tube feeding, or the risk of necrotising enterocolitis. Moderate‑confidence evidence suggests it probably does not change the risk of late infection. No clear safety concerns emerged.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the results because many studies were small, some participants and staff knew which group they were in, and not all studies reported every outcome we wanted. Methods of delivering the smell or taste also varied, which makes it hard to compare results.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?\nThe evidence we summarised was current to the end of April 2023. New studies published after that date may affect these conclusions.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical factual check: it refers to \"full tube feeding\" as an outcome, but the review measured time to reach full enteral feeds (or full oral/sucking feeds), not \"full tube feeding\". This misrepresents the evidence and could mislead readers. In addition, several clarity issues need fixing:\n1. **Long, dense key‑message bullet** – \"Giving preterm babies (infants born before 37 weeks) the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding (feeding through a tube that bypasses the mouth) does not speed up the time they start feeding normally by sucking, and no harmful effects were reported.\" This sentence is over‑long and hard to follow. *Rewrite*: \"Giving preterm babies (born before 37 weeks) the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding (a tube that bypasses the mouth) does not speed up the time they start sucking feeds, and no harmful effects were reported.\"\n2. **Second bullet also overly long** – \"The same approach also makes little or no difference to how long the babies need intravenous nutrition (nutrition given through a vein), how quickly they reach full tube feeding, or the risk of serious gut problems (necrotising enterocolitis) or later infections.\" *Rewrite*: \"The same approach also makes little or no difference to how long babies need intravenous nutrition (nutrition given through a vein), how quickly they reach full enteral feeds, or the risk of serious gut problems (necrotising enterocolitis) or later infections.\"\n3. **Inaccurate outcome wording** – The draft says \"full tube feeding\" which is not an outcome measured in the review. *Rewrite*: replace every instance of \"full tube feeding\" with \"full enteral feeds\" (or \"full oral/sucking feeds\" where appropriate).\n4. **Missing confidence‑level language** – Readers are not told how certain the evidence is. Adding the certainty level clarifies the findings. *Rewrite*: \"The evidence is very uncertain (very low‑certainty) that the intervention shortens the time to full sucking feeds (MD –1.07 days, 95% CI –2.63 to 0.50).\"\n5. **High nominalisation** – The draft contains many noun‑heavy phrases (e.g., \"assessment of risk\", \"evaluation of evidence\"). Re‑phrase to use verbs: change \"assessment of risk\" to \"we assessed the risk\" and \"evaluation of evidence\" to \"we evaluated the evidence\". This will reduce the nominalisation count (currently 22, well above the typical <13).\nThese changes address the factual inaccuracy, improve readability, and bring the text closer to the style guidelines. The PLS evaluation shows a high nominalisation score (22, beyond the typical range) and several long sentences, supporting the need for the suggested edits.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most PLS patterns (high overall conformity, 88.9% in best quartile). Readability metrics are strong (Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 58, grade level ~10). The only notable deviation is nominalisation (22, in the BEYOND_P90 range), indicating many noun‑heavy constructions that should be reduced for clearer, more active language."
