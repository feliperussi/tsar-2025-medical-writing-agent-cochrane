  "draft": "Does letting early‑born babies (preterm infants) smell and taste milk during tube feeding help them start normal feeding sooner?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Exposing preterm babies (infants born before 37 weeks) to the smell and taste of milk while they receive tube feeding (feeding through a tube that bypasses the mouth) does not appear to speed up the time it takes for them to start feeding normally by sucking, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- The same approach also showed little or no impact on how long the babies needed intravenous nutrition (nutrition given through a vein), how quickly they reached full tube feeding, or on the risk of serious gut problems (necrotising enterocolitis) or later infections.\n- Because the existing studies were small and had methodological limitations, we need larger, well‑designed trials to determine whether this simple, low‑cost intervention might have any real benefit or hidden risks for different groups of preterm infants.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhy is feeding a challenge for preterm infants?\nBabies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (called preterm infants) often cannot coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing well enough to feed from a bottle or breast. Because of this, they usually receive nutrition through a tube that goes into the stomach (orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding). While tube feeding provides the needed calories, it bypasses the mouth and nose, so the baby does not get to smell or taste the milk. This lack of sensory exposure may slow the development of normal feeding skills, keep the baby on tube feeds longer, increase the risk of feeding intolerance, and extend the hospital stay.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe review aimed to discover whether giving preterm infants the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula at the same time as their tube feeds helps them move more quickly to full oral (sucking) feeds. The researchers also wanted to know if this simple, low‑cost intervention caused any harm, such as increasing the risk of serious gut problems (necrotising enterocolitis) or infections.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared giving preterm infants the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds versus no exposure, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified eight randomised or quasi‑randomised trials that together included 1,277 preterm infants (all born before 37 weeks' gestation). In each study, babies received the smell and/or taste of breast‑milk or formula together with tube feeds, and this was compared with a control condition where no such exposure was given. The aim of the intervention was to speed up the transition to full sucking feeds. The abstract does not give details about how long the studies lasted, where they were carried out, who funded them, or the demographic breakdown of the participants.\n\nThe evidence is very uncertain about whether exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk changes the time it takes them to reach full sucking feeds. There is limited evidence that it may make little or no difference to the length of time infants need intravenous nutrition, the time to reach full enteral feeds, or the risk of necrotising enterocolitis. Moderate‑confidence evidence suggests that it probably makes little or no difference to the risk of late infection. Overall, the available data indicate that there is probably no clear difference in safety outcomes between infants who receive the smell and taste of milk and those who do not.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "Critical check failed: section subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., “Methods”, “Limitations”, “Currency”). This breaches the Master Style Guide requirement that all subheadings be question‑style. Additionally, several clarity issues were identified that would confuse readers:\n1. Long, dense bullet in Key messages – hard to follow.\n2. Jargon without definition (e.g., “parenteral nutrition”, “enteral feeds”).\n3. Excessive nominalisation and noun‑heavy sentences (e.g., “The evidence is very uncertain…”) making the text feel abstract.\n4. Passive constructions and wordy phrases reduce readability.\n5. Missing paragraph breaks and inconsistent bullet formatting.\nSuggested improvements:\n- Rewrite subheadings as questions (e.g., change “Methods” to “How did we find the evidence?”; “Limitations” to “What are the limitations of the evidence?”; “Currency” to “How up‑to‑date is this review?”).\n- Split the first key‑message bullet into two shorter sentences and use active voice.\n- Define technical terms in plain language (e.g., replace “parenteral nutrition” with “nutrition given through a vein”).\n- Convert nominalised phrases to verbs (e.g., “The evidence is very uncertain” → “We are very uncertain”).\n- Reduce passive voice and replace wordy phrases with concise alternatives.\nMetrics support these edits: nominalizations (27, P90) and nouns (178, P90) are far above typical ranges, indicating a noun‑heavy style; passive voice count (13, P50) suggests room for more active constructions; words per sentence (24.7, P75) approaches the upper limit, so shorter sentences are needed. These metric signals align with the identified clarity problems.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and shows good overall conformity (55.6% of features in best quartile). However, four metrics deviate markedly: nominalizations, total nouns, Dale‑Chall complex words, and long words are all in the P90 range, indicating excessive noun‑heavy and complex language. Active voice and pronoun use are strong (P75), but passive voice is moderate (P50). These deviations suggest the text is more noun‑focused and complex than typical PLS, supporting the recommended reductions in nominalisation and long/complex words."
