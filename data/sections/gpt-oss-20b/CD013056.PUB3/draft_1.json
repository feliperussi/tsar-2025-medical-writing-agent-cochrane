  "draft": "Is using antibiotics better than antiseptic ear drops for treating chronic ear infection (chronic suppurative otitis media)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Antibiotics applied directly to the ear (topical antibiotics) may clear ear discharge more often than the antiseptic ear drop containing boric acid within about two weeks, but for other antiseptics such as acetic acid (a vinegar‑like solution), povidone‑iodine, or aluminium acetate the evidence is uncertain; the studies did not provide clear information about side effects or ear damage (ototoxicity).\n- Overall, the review found limited information on how these treatments affect hearing, quality of life, or serious complications, and few studies reported any unwanted effects, so the current evidence does not allow firm conclusions about the best choice.\n- More well‑designed randomised trials are needed that follow patients for longer periods, include measures of hearing, quality of life and any harms, to determine whether antibiotics or antiseptic ear drops are more effective and safe for chronic ear infection.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is chronic suppurative otitis media and why does it matter?\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long‑lasting infection of the middle ear and the mastoid bone behind it. It usually occurs when the eardrum (the tympanic membrane) has a hole, allowing fluid to leak out of the ear – a problem called ear discharge or otorrhoea. People with CSOM often have persistent ear discharge and a gradual loss of hearing, which can affect communication, school or work performance, and overall quality of life. The infection is typically caused by several types of bacteria (polymicrobial), making it hard to clear. To treat CSOM doctors use medicines that kill or stop the growth of these microbes. These medicines fall into two main groups: antibiotics, which can be applied directly into the ear (topical) or taken by mouth or injection (systemic), and antiseptics, which are always applied directly to the ear as drops, powders, or rinses. Some antibiotics, such as quinolones (drugs that target bacterial DNA) and aminoglycosides (drugs that interfere with bacterial protein production), are commonly used. Antiseptics include substances like acetic acid, boric acid, aluminium acetate, and povidone‑iodine. A possible side effect of some ear medicines is ototoxicity – damage to the inner ear that can worsen hearing.\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to compare the benefits and harms of using antibiotics versus using antiseptic agents for treating people (both children and adults) with chronic suppurative otitis media. Specifically, they examined whether one type of treatment was better at stopping ear discharge, improving hearing, reducing ear pain or irritation, and whether any treatment caused serious problems or damage to the ear.\n\n**Methods**\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing antibiotics with topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media, combined their results, and assessed our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 15 randomised controlled trials that together included 2,371 people with chronic suppurative otitis media (persistent ear discharge for more than two weeks). All studies followed participants for at least one week and reported outcomes at short (1‑2 weeks), intermediate (2‑4 weeks) and longer (over 4 weeks) periods. The trials compared topical antibiotics – mainly quinolones and aminoglycosides – with various topical antiseptics such as acetic acid, boric acid, povidone‑iodine and aluminium acetate; some also compared with systemic antibiotics. The abstract did not give details about where the studies were done, who funded them, or participants’ age, gender or severity, and no data on quality‑of‑life or serious complications were reported.\nMain results: Stopping ear discharge\nAcetic acid may increase the chance that ear discharge stops within two weeks, but the evidence is of low certainty. Topical quinolones probably increase the chance that ear discharge stops within two weeks compared with boric acid, based on moderate‑certainty evidence. Quinolones may also cause less ear pain or irritation than boric acid (low certainty) and may improve hearing slightly (low certainty). It is unclear whether quinolones differ from povidone‑iodine in stopping ear discharge, and the evidence about aluminium acetate’s effect on ear discharge is very uncertain.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all of the people, object, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search.",

Several headings such as \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the draft contains a few clarity and style issues that could confuse readers:\n1. **Non‑question subheadings** – e.g., \"Key messages\". Readers expect the headings to signal a question they will have answered.\n   *Rewrite*: \"What are the key messages?\"\n2. **Long, dense sentence** – \"The trials compared topical antibiotics – mainly quinolones and aminoglycosides – with various topical antiseptics such as acetic acid, boric acid, povidone‑iodine and aluminium acetate; some also compared with systemic antibiotics.\"\n   *Problem*: Over 30 words, multiple clauses make it hard to follow.\n   *Rewrite*: \"The trials compared topical antibiotics (mainly quinolones and aminoglycosides) with several antiseptics – acetic acid, boric acid, povidone‑iodine and aluminium acetate. Some studies also compared these with systemic antibiotics.\"\n3. **Unexplained jargon** – terms like \"otorrhoea\" and \"polymicrobial\" appear without simple definitions.\n   *Problem*: Patients may not know these words.\n   *Rewrite*: \"...a hole that lets fluid (called ear discharge or otorrhoea) leak out.

These indicate the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than typical PLS, supporting the need to reduce nominalisations, simplify vocabulary, and use more active verbs."
