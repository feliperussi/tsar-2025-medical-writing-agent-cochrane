  "plain_title": "Is using antibiotics better than antiseptic ear drops for treating chronic ear infection (chronic suppurative otitis media)?",
  "key_messages": [
    "Antibiotics applied directly to the ear (topical antibiotics) may clear ear discharge more often than the antiseptic ear drop containing boric acid within about two weeks, but for other antiseptics such as acetic acid (a vinegar‑like solution), povidone‑iodine, or aluminium acetate the evidence is uncertain; the studies did not provide clear information about side effects or ear damage (ototoxicity).",
    "Overall, the review found limited information on how these treatments affect hearing, quality of life, or serious complications, and few studies reported any unwanted effects, so the current evidence does not allow firm conclusions about the best choice.",
    "More well‑designed randomised trials are needed that follow patients for longer periods, include measures of hearing, quality of life and any harms, to determine whether antibiotics or antiseptic ear drops are more effective and safe for chronic ear infection."

      "subheading": "What is chronic suppurative otitis media and why does it matter?",
      "content": "Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long‑lasting infection of the middle ear and the mastoid bone behind it. It usually occurs when the eardrum (the tympanic membrane) has a hole, allowing fluid to leak out of the ear – a problem called ear discharge or otorrhoea. People with CSOM often have persistent ear discharge and a gradual loss of hearing, which can affect communication, school or work performance, and overall quality of life. The infection is typically caused by several types of bacteria (polymicrobial), making it hard to clear. To treat CSOM doctors use medicines that kill or stop the growth of these microbes. These medicines fall into two main groups: antibiotics, which can be applied directly into the ear (topical) or taken by mouth or injection (systemic), and antiseptics, which are always applied directly to the ear as drops, powders, or rinses. Some antibiotics, such as quinolones (drugs that target bacterial DNA) and aminoglycosides (drugs that interfere with bacterial protein production), are commonly used. Antiseptics include substances like acetic acid, boric acid, aluminium acetate, and povidone‑iodine. A possible side effect of some ear medicines is ototoxicity – damage to the inner ear that can worsen hearing."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to compare the benefits and harms of using antibiotics versus using antiseptic agents for treating people (both children and adults) with chronic suppurative otitis media. Specifically, they examined whether one type of treatment was better at stopping ear discharge, improving hearing, reducing ear pain or irritation, and whether any treatment caused serious problems or damage to the ear."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified 15 randomised controlled trials that together included 2,371 people with chronic suppurative otitis media (persistent ear discharge for more than two weeks). All studies followed participants for at least one week and reported outcomes at short (1‑2 weeks), intermediate (2‑4 weeks) and longer (over 4 weeks) periods. The trials compared topical antibiotics – mainly quinolones and aminoglycosides – with various topical antiseptics such as acetic acid, boric acid, povidone‑iodine and aluminium acetate; some also compared with systemic antibiotics. The abstract did not give details about where the studies were done, who funded them, or participants’ age, gender or severity, and no data on quality‑of‑life or serious complications were reported."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Stopping ear discharge",
      "content": "Acetic acid may increase the chance that ear discharge stops within two weeks, but the evidence is of low certainty. Topical quinolones probably increase the chance that ear discharge stops within two weeks compared with boric acid, based on moderate‑certainty evidence. Quinolones may also cause less ear pain or irritation than boric acid (low certainty) and may improve hearing slightly (low certainty). It is unclear whether quinolones differ from povidone‑iodine in stopping ear discharge, and the evidence about aluminium acetate’s effect on ear discharge is very uncertain."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all of the people, object, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2022 of search."
