  "key_messages": [
    "Current research does not provide clear evidence that multimodal interventions (combined drug, nutrition and exercise programmes) improve outcomes for people with cachexia (severe weight and muscle loss), and information on possible unwanted side effects (adverse events) is limited.",
    "Most of the available studies focused on people with cancer and were short‑term, so the findings may not apply to other chronic illnesses or to longer periods of treatment.",
    "More large, well‑designed randomised trials (studies that randomly assign participants to groups) that follow participants for a longer time are needed to determine whether combined treatments can safely help manage cachexia."

  "background": [
    {
      "subheading": "What is cachexia and why does it matter?",
      "content": "Cachexia, also called disease‑related wasting, is a serious condition that often develops in people with long‑term illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It causes unintentional loss of body weight and muscle, persistent tiredness, loss of appetite, and a lower quality of life. Because the body’s metabolism is disturbed, simply eating more or exercising alone often does not stop the decline. Traditional care usually focuses on one type of treatment – for example, a drug, a special diet, or an exercise programme – but these single approaches have limited success in reversing the syndrome."

    {
      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know whether \"multimodal\" interventions – programmes that combine two or more treatments such as medication, nutrition support, and exercise – are more effective and safe for people with cachexia than usual care, a single treatment, or a different combination of treatments. Specifically, they looked at whether these combined approaches improve physical function (how well a person can move and perform daily tasks), muscle strength, body weight, quality of life, appetite, fatigue, and other health markers, while also monitoring any unwanted side effects."

  "methods": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we do?",
      "content": "We searched for studies of multimodal interventions for cachexia in adults, combined their results on outcomes such as physical function, weight and quality of life, and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria."

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified nine randomised controlled trials that together included 926 adults (average age about 63 years). The studies were carried out in Europe (six trials), Turkey, New Zealand and the United States, and involved people with cancer (six trials) as well as one trial each in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and HIV/AIDS. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 332 participants. All of the interventions were multimodal, meaning they combined two or more of medication, nutritional support and exercise, and were compared with usual care, a different version of the multimodal programme, or a single‑component approach. The follow‑up periods varied, with one cancer trial delivering a six‑week programme and the others assessing outcomes immediately after programmes that lasted three to seven months. \n\nThe evidence from these small number of trials is very uncertain. We do not know whether these multimodal programmes make any difference to how well people can move or exercise, their muscle or body size, their weight, appetite, feelings of fatigue, overall quality of life, or the chance of experiencing side effects, compared with usual care or other types of intervention."

  ],
  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the evidence does not cover all of the people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes we were interested in, and studies were very small.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to July 2024 of search."
