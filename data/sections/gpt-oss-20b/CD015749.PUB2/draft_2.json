  "draft": "\"Are combined treatments (drugs, nutrition, and exercise) effective for managing cachexia (severe weight and muscle loss) in people with chronic illnesses?\\n\\nKey messages\\n– Current research does not show clear benefits of combined drug, nutrition and exercise programmes for people with cachexia, and data on side‑effects are limited.  \\n– Most studies involved people with cancer, lasted only a few weeks to months, and may not apply to other long‑term illnesses.  \\n– Larger, well‑designed randomised trials that follow participants for longer periods are needed to determine whether combined treatments are safe and effective.\\n\\nWhat is cachexia and why does it matter?  \\nCachexia, also called disease‑related wasting, is a serious syndrome that often develops in people with long‑term illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It causes unintentional loss of body weight and muscle, persistent tiredness, loss of appetite, and a lower quality of life. Because the body’s metabolism is disturbed, simply eating more or exercising alone usually does not stop the decline. Traditional care often focuses on a single approach – for example, a drug, a special diet, or an exercise programme – but these single treatments have limited success.\\n\\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \\nWe wanted to know whether “multimodal” interventions – programmes that combine two or more treatments such as medication, nutrition support, and exercise – are more effective and safe for people with cachexia than usual care, a single treatment, or a different combination of treatments. Specifically, we looked at physical function (how well a person can move and perform daily tasks), muscle strength, body weight, quality of life, appetite, fatigue, and other health markers, while also monitoring any unwanted side effects.\\n\\nWhat did we do?  \\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registers for randomised controlled trials that tested multimodal interventions in adults with cachexia. We combined the results for outcomes such as physical function, weight and quality of life, and we rated our confidence in the evidence using standard criteria (GRADE).\\n\\nWhat did we find?  \\nWe identified nine trials that together included 926 adults (average age ≈ 63 years). Six trials were conducted in Europe, and one each in Turkey, New Zealand and the United States. The participants had cancer (six trials) or, in single trials, COPD, chronic kidney disease, or HIV/AIDS. All interventions combined at least two of medication, special diets and exercise, and they were compared with usual care, a different multimodal programme, or a single‑component approach. Follow‑up periods ranged from six weeks to seven months.\\n\\nThe evidence from these few small trials is very uncertain. We do not know whether the combined programmes improve movement, muscle size, weight, appetite, fatigue, quality of life, or the risk of side‑effects compared with usual care or other treatments.\\n\\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \\nWe are not confident in the findings because many studies were small and participants likely knew which treatment they received, which can bias results. Not all trials reported every outcome we were interested in, and the evidence does not cover all types of chronic illness, interventions or comparators.\\n\\nHow current is the evidence?  \\nThe search was up to date to July 2024.\\n\\nIn summary, the current evidence does not provide clear proof that combined drug, nutrition and exercise programmes help manage cachexia, and the data on safety are limited. More large, well‑designed randomised trials that follow participants for longer periods are needed to answer this important question.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical style requirement: the \"Key messages\" heading is not phrased as a question, which violates the Master Style Guide (5.3 Structure). Additionally, several clarity issues would hinder a patient’s understanding: (1) many sentences exceed 30 words, making them hard to follow (e.g., \"We identified nine trials that together included 926 adults (average age ≈ 63 years). Six trials were conducted in Europe, and one each in Turkey, New Zealand and the United States.\"); (2) passive constructions obscure who performed actions (e.g., \"The search was up to date to July 2024.\"); (3) the term \"GRADE\" is introduced without explanation, leaving readers unsure of its meaning. These issues, combined with the subheading problem, mean the PLS does not meet the required standards. Suggested revisions: rephrase the heading to a question, split long sentences, convert passive to active voice, and add a brief definition of GRADE. Metrics support these observations: words_per_sentence = 29.2 (BEYOND_P90), passive_voice = 15 (P75), active_voice = 47 (P75), and dale_chall_readability = 8.86 (BEYOND_P90), indicating high sentence complexity and jargon density.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is 584 words (within limit) but deviates from typical patterns on several metrics: words per sentence (29.2, beyond P90), nouns (167, P90), automated readability index (15.81, P90), gunning fog (21, P90), SMOG (13.68, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.86, beyond P90), and high counts of complex and long words. These suggest the text is more complex than usual PLSs, reinforcing the need to shorten sentences, reduce jargon, and increase active voice."
