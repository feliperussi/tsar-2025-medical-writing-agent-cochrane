  "draft": "How accurate are the head impulse, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) exam for detecting brain‑related causes of sudden severe dizziness (acute vestibular syndrome)?\n\nKey messages\n- When trained clinicians use the HINTS exam in the emergency department, they can reliably spot brain‑related (central) causes of acute vestibular syndrome and can also rule them out; no harms were reported but the evidence is limited.\n- Adding video goggles (video‑assisted HINTS) or the hearing test (HINTS Plus) changes accuracy, and current studies give only modest confidence in these versions.\n- More high‑quality research is needed, especially studies that compare different providers, settings, and video assistance, and that directly compare HINTS with MRI scanning.\n\nWhat is acute vestibular syndrome and why does it matter?\nAcute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is a sudden onset of severe dizziness that may include vertigo (the feeling that the room is spinning), nausea, vomiting, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and unsteadiness. AVS can arise from the inner ear (a peripheral cause) or from the brain (a central cause). Distinguishing peripheral from central causes matters because treatment and the risk of serious outcomes, such as stroke, differ. Clinicians usually consider risk factors, medical history, a physical exam, and sometimes advanced brain imaging like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to decide.\n\nWhat is the HINTS (and HINTS Plus) examination?\nThe HINTS exam is a quick bedside test that helps clinicians decide whether AVS comes from the inner ear or the brain. HINTS stands for:\n- Head Impulse: we turn the patient’s head rapidly while watching the eyes; a normal eye response suggests a peripheral problem.\n- Nystagmus: we observe the direction of involuntary eye‑movement; certain patterns point to a central cause.\n- Test of Skew: we check whether the eyes are aligned; a misalignment can indicate a central problem.\nHINTS Plus adds a simple hearing test to the three steps. Some clinicians record eye movements with video goggles (video‑assisted HINTS) to increase precision.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus exams identify central causes of AVS. We looked for studies that used these tests in real‑world settings such as emergency departments or urgent‑care clinics and compared the test results with a final diagnosis made by MRI or expert neurologists. We also examined whether video recording altered test accuracy.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched several databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, the International HTA database, and two trial registers) up to September 2022. We included diagnostic‑accuracy studies that evaluated HINTS or HINTS Plus, with or without video assistance, against a reference standard of MRI or neurologist diagnosis. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and judged certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe included 16 studies with 2,024 participants (average age ≈ 60 years). Thirteen studies were conducted in emergency departments and about half of the examinations were performed by neurologists. All studies compared the bedside HINTS tests with MRI or a neurologist’s final diagnosis.\n\nWhat did the accuracy results show?\nThe clinical HINTS exam correctly identified about 94 people out of 100 who truly had a central cause (low‑certainty evidence). The clinical HINTS Plus exam identified about 95 out of 100 central cases (low‑certainty). Evidence for video‑assisted HINTS was very uncertain, so we cannot tell if it improves identification. Video‑assisted HINTS Plus probably identifies 85–94 central cases per 100 patients (moderate certainty). Specificity (the ability to correctly rule out central causes) ranged from 73 % to 87 % for the clinical tests, but was lower and more uncertain for the video‑assisted versions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the findings because some studies may have been biased, many were small, and not all reported the outcomes we needed. The evidence does not cover all settings, all provider types, or all patient groups.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is the evidence?\nThe searches captured studies published up to September 2022, so the evidence reflects research available at that time.",

      "feedback": "The draft passes the mandatory completeness, format and factual checks, but several clarity‑related problems would likely confuse a lay reader. 1) **Unexplained certainty language** – phrases such as “low‑certainty evidence” and “moderate certainty” appear several times (e.g., “The clinical HINTS exam correctly identified … (low‑certainty evidence)”). Readers are unlikely to understand what these terms mean. Rewrite as plain statements of confidence, e.g., “We have limited confidence in this result”. 2) **Overly long, dense sentence** – the sentence “Specificity (the ability to 73 % to 87 % for the clinical tests, but was lower and more uncertain for the video‑assisted versions)” is >30 words and packs several ideas. Split and simplify: “For the clinical tests, the ability to correctly rule out a brain‑related cause (specificity) was between 73 % and 87 %. The video‑assisted versions were less specific and the evidence is less certain.” 3) **High passive voice and nominalisations** – the draft contains 20 passive constructions (P90) and 22 nominalisations (P90), e.g., “The evidence does not cover all settings”. Convert to active voice: “We did not study all settings”. 4) **Noun‑heavy phrasing** – sentences such as “The clinical HINTS exam correctly identified about 94 people out of 100 who truly had a central cause (low‑certainty evidence)” are noun‑dense. Use more verbs: “The test correctly identified about 94 % of people with a brain‑related cause.” 5) **Excessive complex/long words** – the text has 143 complex words (P90), 297 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (beyond P90 % ), and 217 long words (beyond P90). Replace words like “diagnostic‑accuracy” with “how well the test works” and avoid unnecessary jargon. Addressing these five points will bring the summary into line with Cochrane plain‑language standards and improve readability for patients.",
