  "key_messages": [
    "The HINTS exam (head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) performed by trained clinicians in the emergency department can reliably identify central causes (brain‑related causes) of acute vestibular syndrome (sudden severe dizziness with vertigo, nausea, and eye‑movement changes) and reasonably rule them out; no harmful effects of the test were reported, but the overall evidence is limited.",
    "Using video‑assisted HINTS (adding video goggles to record eye movements) or the HINTS Plus version (which also checks hearing) shows variable accuracy, and current studies provide only modest confidence in these approaches.",
    "More high‑quality research is needed, especially studies that compare different providers, settings, and the use of video assistance, and that directly compare the HINTS exam with imaging such as MRI, to clarify how the test can best be used in practice."

      "subheading": "What is acute vestibular syndrome and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Sudden, severe dizziness that comes on quickly is called acute vestibular syndrome (AVS). People with AVS may feel the room spin (vertigo), feel sick to their stomach, vomit, have involuntary eye movements (called nystagmus), or feel unsteady on their feet. AVS can be caused by a problem in the inner ear (a \"peripheral\" cause) or by a problem inside the brain (a \"central\" cause). Knowing whether the cause is peripheral or central matters a lot because the treatments and the risk of serious outcomes, such as stroke, are very different. Doctors usually try to decide the cause by looking at a patient’s risk factors, medical history, a physical exam, and sometimes by ordering advanced brain scans like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."

      "subheading": "What is the HINTS (and HINTS Plus) examination?",
      "content": "The HINTS exam is a quick bedside test that helps doctors tell if AVS is coming from the inner ear or the brain. HINTS stands for:\n- Head Impulse – the doctor gently turns the patient’s head while watching the eyes to see if they stay steady. A normal response suggests a peripheral problem.\n- Nystagmus – the doctor looks at the direction of the involuntary eye movements. Certain patterns point to a central cause.\n- Test of Skew – the doctor checks whether the eyes are perfectly aligned or slightly off‑center, which can also indicate a central problem.\nHINTS Plus adds a simple hearing test to the three steps above. Some clinicians use video goggles to record the eye movements (video‑assisted HINTS), which can make the assessment more precise."

      "subheading": "What did the review aim to find out?",
      "content": "The authors wanted to know how well the HINTS and HINTS Plus exams work at correctly identifying a central (brain‑related) cause of acute vestibular syndrome. They looked at studies that used the tests in real‑world settings – such as emergency departments or urgent‑care clinics – and compared the test results with the final diagnosis made by MRI scans or expert neurologists. They also examined whether using video recordings changed the accuracy of the tests."

      "subheading": "Methods",

  "results": [
    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We included 16 diagnostic accuracy studies that together involved 2,024 participants (981 women and 1,043 men) with an average age of about 60 years. All of the studies evaluated the HINTS or HINTS Plus bedside examinations—either performed directly by a clinician or with video assistance—against a reference standard such as advanced imaging (usually MRI) or a final neurologist diagnosis to determine whether an acute vestibular syndrome had a central cause. Thirteen of the studies were carried out in emergency‑department settings, and roughly half of the examinations were performed by neurologists. The abstract did not provide information about the countries where the studies were conducted or their funding sources, and no data on study duration were reported."

    {
      "subheading": "Main results: Diagnostic accuracy of HINTS examinations",
      "content": "The HINTS examination probably leads to a large increase in correctly identifying a central cause of acute vestibular syndrome (low certainty). For roughly every 100 people who actually have a central cause, the test will correctly identify about 94. The HINTS Plus examination probably also leads to a large increase in correct identification (low certainty), correctly identifying about 95 out of 100 people with a central cause. It is unclear whether the video‑assisted HINTS examination has an effect on correct identification (very low certainty). The video‑assisted HINTS Plus examination probably causes a moderate increase in correct identification (moderate certainty), correctly identifying about 85 to 94 out of 100 people with a central cause."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the evidence does not cover all of the people or situations we are interested in.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to September 2022 of search."
