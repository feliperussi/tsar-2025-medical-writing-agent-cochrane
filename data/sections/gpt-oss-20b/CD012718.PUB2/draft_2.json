  "draft": "Is silver diamine fluoride (a liquid that stops cavities) effective for preventing and treating tooth decay in children and adults?\n\nKey messages\n– Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) probably reduces new root cavities and may slow the worsening of cavities in baby teeth, compared with no treatment.  \n– When we compare SDF with fluoride varnish, we see little or no difference in preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and the evidence is very uncertain for other outcomes.  \n– Most studies had methodological problems and did not report important outcomes such as tooth staining, so we need better research to know the true benefits and harms.\n\nWhat is dental caries and why is it a problem?  \nDental caries, also called tooth decay, is the most common disease worldwide. Bacteria produce acids that break down the hard parts of a tooth, creating cavities. If left untreated, cavities cause pain, make eating difficult, lower confidence, and can lead to more serious health issues. Caries can affect baby teeth (primary dentition) and adult teeth (permanent dentition). They may appear on the visible crown of the tooth (coronal surface) or on the part of the tooth below the gum line (root caries – cavities that develop on the root).\n\nWhat is silver diamine fluoride and how might it help?  \nSDF is a liquid that contains two active ingredients: silver, which kills bacteria, and fluoride, which helps rebuild enamel. We can paint SDF directly onto a cavity or onto a tooth at risk of developing a cavity. Because it is easy to apply and does not need drilling, SDF is a low‑cost option to prevent new cavities or stop existing ones, especially for people with limited dental access.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether applying SDF works better, the same, or worse than doing nothing, using a placebo, or using other common treatments such as fluoride varnish, sealants, or minimally invasive restorations. We also examined whether SDF causes side effects, pain, or unwanted tooth staining.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?  \nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled of trials that compared SDF with placebo, no treatment, or other caries interventions. We combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe examined 29 randomised trials involving 13,036 participants, including about 12,000 children and just over 1,000 older adults. All trials applied SDF to the teeth and compared it with no treatment, placebo, fluoride varnish, sealants or resin infiltration, and atraumatic restorative treatment (ART).\n\nThe evidence shows SDF probably reduces new root cavities and may also slow the worsening of cavities in baby teeth, compared with no treatment. When we compare SDF with fluoride varnish, we see little or no difference in preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and the evidence is very uncertain for other outcomes. We do not know whether one way of applying SDF works better than another, and we are uncertain whether SDF is better than sealants for preventing cavities in permanent teeth or better than ART for stopping cavities in baby teeth.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, many studies did not report all outcomes we wanted, the trials were small, and they involved different types of people and delivery methods. Important outcomes such as tooth staining were reported in only a few studies.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence includes all studies identified up to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the required subheading format: not all section headings are phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\" and \"What did we find?\" are statements). Additionally, there is a typographical error in the methods description (\"randomised controlled of trials\"). These issues hinder compliance with the Master Style Guide and may confuse readers. Suggested improvements: 1) Re‑write all headings as questions (e.g., \"What are the key messages?\", \"What did we find?\"). 2) Correct the typo to \"randomised controlled trials\" and clarify the sentence. 3) Simplify the sentence about the evidence to reduce noun‑heavy phrasing. 4) Shorten any sentences exceeding 30 words for better readability. 5) Reduce noun density by replacing some noun‑heavy phrases with active verbs. The PLS evaluation shows high noun count (162, P90) and high complex‑word counts (complex_words_dc 250, long_words 172), supporting the need to streamline wording.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft conforms well to most readability metrics (e.g., Flesch‑Reading‑Ease 52.96, FKGL 10.9) and stays within the word limit. However, three metrics deviate: nouns (162, P90), complex words (DC 250, P90) and long words (172, P90), indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and uses many long/complex words than typical PLS. These deviations align with the identified clarity and style issues."
