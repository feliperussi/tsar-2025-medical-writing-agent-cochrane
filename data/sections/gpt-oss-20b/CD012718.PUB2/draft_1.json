  "draft": "Is silver diamine fluoride (a liquid that stops cavities) effective for preventing and treating tooth decay in children and adults?\n\n- Silver diamine fluoride may help stop (arrest) existing cavities and probably prevents new decay on the roots of teeth (root caries), but the evidence is uncertain for preventing new cavities in baby teeth (primary dentition) and adult teeth (permanent dentition), and the review found limited information on side effects such as tooth staining.\n- When compared with fluoride varnish (a protective fluoride coating applied to teeth), silver diamine fluoride shows little or no difference in preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and the evidence is very uncertain for other outcomes and for comparisons with sealants (protective coating on chewing surfaces) or other minimally invasive treatments.\n- Because most studies had methodological limitations and did not report important outcomes like staining or long‑term effects, further well‑designed research is needed to determine the true benefits, harms, and optimal ways to use silver diamine fluoride.\n\n**What is dental caries and why is it a problem?**\nDental caries, also called tooth decay, is the most common disease worldwide. When the hard parts of a tooth are broken down by acids from bacteria, cavities form. If these cavities are not treated they can cause pain, make it hard to eat, affect a person’s confidence and overall well‑being, and lead to more serious health problems. The disease can affect both baby teeth (called the primary dentition) and adult teeth (the permanent dentition), and it can occur on the visible crown of the tooth (the coronal surface) or on the root that is hidden below the gum line (root caries).\n\n**What is silver diamine fluoride and how might it help?**\nSilver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a liquid that contains two active ingredients: silver, which kills bacteria, and fluoride, which helps rebuild tooth enamel. It can be painted directly onto a cavity or onto a tooth at risk of developing a cavity. Because it is easy to apply and does not require drilling, SDF is being explored as a low‑cost, simple way to prevent new cavities or stop existing ones from getting worse, especially in people who have difficulty accessing regular dental care.\n\n**What did the review aim to find out?**\nThe authors wanted to know whether applying SDF works better, the same, or worse than doing nothing, using a placebo, or using other common treatments (such as fluoride varnish, sealants, or restorative procedures) for preventing new cavities and for stopping existing cavities from progressing in both baby and adult teeth. They also looked at whether SDF caused any side effects, pain, or unwanted tooth staining.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched for studies that compared silver diamine fluoride with placebo, no treatment, or other caries interventions; we combined their findings; and we rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe looked at 29 randomised trials that together included 13,036 people – most of them (about 12,000) were children and a little over 1,000 were older adults. All the trials tested a liquid called silver diamine fluoride (SDF) that was applied to the teeth. The studies compared SDF with doing nothing, with a placebo, with fluoride varnish, with sealants or resin infiltration, and with a minimally invasive treatment called atraumatic restorative treatment (ART).\n\nThe evidence suggests that SDF probably reduces the development of new root cavities compared with no treatment, and it may also reduce the worsening of existing cavities in baby teeth compared with no treatment. When compared with fluoride varnish, SDF probably makes little or no difference in preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and we are very uncertain whether it is better or worse than fluoride varnish for other cavity outcomes. We do not know whether one way of applying SDF works better than another, and we are uncertain whether SDF is better than sealants for preventing cavities in permanent teeth or better than ART for stopping cavities in baby teeth.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all studies provided all the data we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023 of search.",

Specifically, the headings \"Methods\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are statements rather than questions. This makes the structure non‑conforming and can confuse readers looking for the expected question‑style navigation.\n\nAdditional improvements are needed to address clarity and readability:\n1. Problematic sentence (passive, long): \"We looked at 29 randomised trials that together included 13,036 people – most of them (about 12,000) were children and a little over 1,000 were older adults.\" – The sentence is long (27 words) and uses a passive‑style construction.\n   Rewrite: \"We examined 29 randomised trials involving 13,036 participants, including about 12,000 children and just over 1,000 older adults.\"\n2. Unexplained jargon: The term \"root caries\" appears without definition.\n   Rewrite: \"root caries (cavities that develop on the part of the tooth below the gum line)\".\n3. Wordy phrase: \"Because it is easy to apply and does not require drilling, SDF is being explored as a low‑cost, simple way to prevent new cavities or stop existing ones from getting worse, especially in people who have difficulty accessing regular dental care.\" – This sentence exceeds 30 words and contains redundant wording.\n   Rewrite: \"Because it is easy to apply and does not need drilling, SDF is a low‑cost option to prevent new cavities or stop existing ones, especially for people with limited dental access.\"\n4. Noun‑heavy sentence: \"The evidence suggests that SDF probably reduces the development of new root cavities compared with no treatment, and it may also reduce the worsening of existing cavities in baby teeth compared with no treatment.\" – Heavy noun usage and long length reduce readability.\n   Rewrite: \"The evidence shows SDF probably reduces new root cavities and may also slow the worsening of cavities in baby teeth, compared with no treatment.\"\n5. Missing question‑style heading for Methods: Change \"Methods\" to a question such as \"How did we conduct the review?\" and similarly rename \"Limitations\" to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and \"Currency\" to \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide, lower the average sentence length, reduce passive voice and nominalisations, and improve overall readability for patients.",

These indicate the text is more dense and noun‑heavy than usual, supporting the need to shorten sentences, use active voice, and replace nominalisations with verbs."
