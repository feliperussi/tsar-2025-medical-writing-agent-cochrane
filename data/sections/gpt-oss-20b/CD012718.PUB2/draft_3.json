  "draft": "Is silver diamine fluoride (a liquid that stops cavities) effective for preventing and treating tooth decay in children and adults?\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) probably reduces new root cavities and may slow the worsening of cavities in baby teeth, compared with no treatment.  \n– When we compare SDF with fluoride varnish (a protective fluoride coating), we see little or no difference in preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and the evidence is very uncertain for other outcomes.  \n– Most studies had methodological problems and did not report important outcomes such as tooth staining, so better research is needed to know the true benefits and harms.\n\nWhat is dental caries and why is it a problem?  \nDental caries (tooth decay) is the most common disease worldwide. Bacteria produce acids that break down the hard parts of a tooth, creating cavities. If left untreated, cavities cause pain, make eating difficult, lower confidence, and can lead to more serious health problems. Caries can affect baby teeth (primary dentition) and adult teeth (permanent dentition). They may appear on the visible crown of the tooth (coronal surface) or on the root that lies below the gum line (root caries).\n\nWhat is silver diamine fluoride and how might it help?  \nSDF is a liquid that contains two active ingredients: silver (which kills bacteria) and fluoride (which helps rebuild enamel). We can paint SDF directly onto a cavity or onto a tooth at risk of developing a cavity. Because it is easy to apply and does not require drilling, SDF offers a low‑cost option to prevent new cavities or stop existing ones, especially for people with limited dental access.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether applying SDF works better, the same, or worse than doing nothing, using a placebo, or using other common treatments such as fluoride varnish, sealants (protective coatings on chewing surfaces), or minimally invasive restorations. We also examined whether SDF causes side effects, pain, or unwanted tooth staining.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?  \nWe searched major medical databases for randomised controlled trials that compared SDF with placebo, no treatment, or other caries interventions. We combined the findings and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe examined 29 randomised trials that together included 13,036 participants (about 12,000 children and 1,000 older adults). All trials applied SDF to the teeth and compared it with no treatment, placebo, fluoride varnish, sealants or resin infiltration, and atraumatic restorative treatment (ART, a minimally invasive restoration).  \n\nThe evidence suggests that SDF probably reduces new root cavities compared with no treatment, and it may also reduce the worsening of existing cavities in baby teeth. When we compare SDF with fluoride varnish, we see little or no difference in preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and the evidence is very uncertain for other outcomes. We do not know whether one way of applying SDF works better than another, and we are uncertain whether SDF is better than sealants for preventing cavities in permanent teeth or better than ART for stopping cavities in baby teeth.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants often knew which treatment they received, many studies did not report all outcomes we wanted, the trials were small, and they involved different types of people and delivery methods. Important outcomes such as tooth staining were reported in only a few studies.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence includes all studies identified up to June 2023.",

We also compared it with other common treatments such as fluoride varnish, sealants (protective coatings on chewing surfaces), or minimally invasive restorations.\"\n- Clarify uncertainty: \"We are very uncertain whether SDF is better or worse than fluoride varnish for other outcomes because the studies gave inconsistent results and were small.\"\n- Replace nominalisations with verbs: change \"methodological problems\" to \"studies had design flaws\"; change \"uncertainty\" to \"we are not sure\".\n- Convert passive to active where possible: \"The evidence is very uncertain\" → \"We are very uncertain about the evidence\".\nAddressing these points will bring the draft in line with the Master Style Guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets word‑count limits and contains all required sections with question‑style headings. However, metric analysis shows several deviations: nominalisations (21, >P90), nouns (165, >P90), complex words (116, >P90) and long words (184, >P90) are all higher than typical PLS ranges, indicating noun‑heavy, complex language. Passive voice (8) is at the P25 limit but could be reduced. These metric signals support the editorial recommendation to simplify wording, reduce nominalisations, and use more active voice."
