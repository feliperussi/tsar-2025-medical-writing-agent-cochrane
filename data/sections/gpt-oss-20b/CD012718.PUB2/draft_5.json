  "draft": "\"Is silver diamine fluoride (a liquid that stops cavities) effective for preventing and treating tooth decay in children and adults?\"\n\nWhat are the key messages?  \n– Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) probably reduces new cavities on tooth roots and may slow the worsening of cavities in baby teeth, compared with doing nothing.  \n– When we compare SDF with fluoride varnish (a protective fluoride coating), we see little or no difference in preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and the evidence is very uncertain for other outcomes.  \n– We are uncertain whether SDF is better than sealants (protective coatings on chewing surfaces) for preventing cavities in permanent teeth or better than atraumatic restorative treatment (a simple filling) for stopping cavities in baby teeth.  \n\nWhat is dental caries and why is it a problem?  \nDental caries, also called tooth decay, is the most common disease worldwide. Bacteria produce acids that wear away the hard parts of a tooth, creating a cavity. If a cavity is left untreated it can cause pain, make eating difficult, lower confidence, and lead to more serious health problems. Caries can affect baby teeth (primary dentition) and adult teeth (permanent dentition). They may appear on the visible crown of the tooth (coronal surface) or on the root that lies below the gum line (root caries).  \n\nWhat is silver diamine fluoride and how might it help?  \nSDF is a liquid that contains two active ingredients: silver, which kills bacteria, and fluoride, which helps rebuild enamel. We can paint SDF directly onto a cavity or onto a tooth that is at risk of developing a cavity. Because it is easy to apply and does not require drilling, SDF is a low‑cost, simple option for preventing new cavities or stopping existing ones, especially for people who have limited access to dental care.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether applying SDF works better, the same, or worse than doing nothing, using a placebo, or using other common treatments such as fluoride varnish, sealants, or simple fillings. We also looked at whether SDF caused side effects, pain, or unwanted tooth staining.  \n\nHow did we conduct the review?  \nWe searched major medical databases for randomised trials that compared SDF with placebo, no treatment, or other caries interventions. We combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence using standard Cochrane methods.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe examined 29 trials that together included 13,036 participants (about 12,000 children and 1,000 older adults). All trials applied SDF to teeth and compared it with doing nothing, a placebo, fluoride varnish, sealants, resin infiltration, or a simple filling called ART.  \n\nThe evidence suggests that SDF probably reduces new root cavities compared with no treatment, and it may also reduce the worsening of existing cavities in baby teeth. When we compare SDF with fluoride varnish, we see little or no difference in preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and we are very uncertain whether SDF is better or worse than fluoride varnish for other outcomes because the studies were small and gave mixed results. We do not know whether one way of applying SDF works better than another, and we are uncertain whether SDF is better than sealants for preventing cavities in permanent teeth or better than ART for stopping cavities in baby teeth.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because many participants knew which treatment they received, the trials were small, and they involved different types of people and delivery methods. Important outcomes such as tooth staining were reported in only a few studies.  \n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nThe evidence includes all studies identified up to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the clarity check because it contains several sentences that are too long or noun‑heavy for a lay audience and it uses the term “root cavities” without a clear explanation. These issues can confuse readers and reduce the usefulness of the summary. Specific problems and suggested rewrites:\n1. Problematic sentence (\"What did we find?\" paragraph): \"When compared with fluoride varnish, we see little or no difference in preventing new cavities in baby teeth, and we are very uncertain whether SDF is better or worse than fluoride varnish for other outcomes because the studies were small and gave mixed results.\" – This 38‑word sentence is hard to follow. Suggested rewrite: \"When we compared SDF with fluoride varnish, we found little or no difference in preventing new cavities in baby teeth. We are very uncertain about any other differences because the studies were small and gave mixed results.\"\n2. Unexplained jargon: the phrase “new root cavities” appears without definition. Readers may not know that this means cavities on the part of the tooth below the gum line. Suggested rewrite: \"new root cavities (cavities on the roots of teeth, below the gum line)\".\n3. Noun‑heavy, passive‑leaning sentence: \"The evidence suggests that SDF probably reduces new root cavities compared with no treatment, and it may also reduce the worsening of existing cavities in baby teeth.\" – This can be made more active and concise. Suggested rewrite: \"We found that SDF probably reduces new root cavities and may also stop existing cavities in baby teeth from getting worse.\"\n4. Long combined sentence about different comparisons: \"We do not know whether one way of applying SDF works better than another, and we are uncertain whether SDF is better than sealants for preventing cavities in permanent teeth or better than ART for stopping cavities in baby teeth.\" – Split for clarity: \"We do not know if one way of applying SDF works better than another. We are also uncertain whether SDF is better than sealants for preventing cavities in permanent teeth or better than ART (atraumatic restorative treatment) for stopping cavities in baby teeth.\"\nThese revisions address the three critical clarity issues identified and bring the text closer to the style and readability standards expected for a Cochrane Plain Language Summary.\n\nMetrics support these edits: the draft has 9 passive constructions (P25) and a high noun count (163, P90), indicating noun‑heavy phrasing; the readability scores are good, but the identified long sentences exceed the recommended 30‑word limit for optimal patient comprehension.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft conforms well to typical patterns (overall high conformity). Most metrics are within the best quartile (e.g., words per sentence 19.78, passive voice 9, readability scores). However, three features deviate: noun count (163, P90), complex words (Dale‑Chall) 265 (P90), and long words 180 (P90). These suggest the text is noun‑heavy and uses many complex/long words, which aligns with the identified clarity issues."
