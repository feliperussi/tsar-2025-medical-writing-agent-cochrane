  "draft": "Is regular exercise effective for people with chronic vein disease (poor vein circulation) that has not caused open skin sores (ulcers)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- The review could not determine whether regular exercise is effective for people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous disease (poor vein circulation), and no harmful effects of the exercise programmes were reported; the available studies were few, small, and had methodological problems, so the evidence is not robust.\n- Some individual studies suggested possible improvements in quality of life (overall wellbeing), muscle strength (how strong the leg muscles are), and walking ability, but these findings are very uncertain.\n- Future research should involve larger, well‑designed randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to exercise or no exercise) with clear exercise protocols and consistent outcome measures to clarify any real benefits or harms.\n\n**Introduction/Aims**\nWhat is chronic venous insufficiency and why is it a problem?\nChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition where the veins in the legs do not return blood to the heart efficiently. This can cause swelling, aching, skin changes and may eventually lead to a venous leg ulcer – a painful sore that forms because the skin does not receive enough oxygen‑rich blood. Even before an ulcer appears, people with CVI often feel uncomfortable, have trouble walking or standing for long periods, and experience a lower quality of life. Common treatments try to improve blood flow, such as compression stockings, medication, or surgery, but many patients still have persistent symptoms.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe review set out to discover whether structured physical‑exercise programmes can help people with non‑ulcerated CVI. It looked for evidence that exercise might reduce symptom severity, improve how well the calf muscles pump blood (measured as ejection fraction or venous refilling time), prevent ulcers, and enhance quality of life, strength, and mobility. The authors also examined whether any harms were reported from the exercise programmes.\n\n**Methods**\nWe searched databases for studies that compared physical‑exercise programmes with no exercise in people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency, described their findings, and rated our confidence in the evidence using GRADE.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified five randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 146 people with non‑ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency. All five studies compared a programme of physical exercise with a control group that received no structured exercise. The length of the exercise programmes varied, with follow‑up periods ranging from eight weeks to six months. The abstract does not provide details about the countries where the trials were carried out, the ages or genders of the participants, the severity grading of the condition, or the sources of funding for the studies.\n\nThe review found that the evidence is unclear whether exercise changes the severity of signs and symptoms of chronic venous disease, improves the heart’s pumping efficiency, shortens the time it takes blood to refill veins, enhances health‑related quality of life, increases overall exercise capacity, boosts muscle strength, or improves ankle joint mobility. In addition, no evidence was found to show that exercise prevents the development of leg ulcers in people with chronic venous disease.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were very small, and the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to March 2022 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails critical style requirements: subheadings are not phrased as questions (e.g., \"Key messages\", \"Introduction/Aims\", \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"), which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text is overly noun‑heavy and uses many nominalisations, making it harder for patients to follow. Specific improvements needed:\n1. **Subheading format** – Change each heading into a question. Example: replace \"Key messages\" with \"What are the main findings?\"; replace \"Introduction/Aims\" with \"Why does chronic venous insufficiency matter and what did the review aim to find?\"; replace \"Methods\" with \"How did we look for the evidence?\"; replace \"Results\" with \"What did we find?\"; replace \"Limitations\" with \"Why is the evidence uncertain?\"; replace \"Currency\" with \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n2. **Reduce nominalisations and noun density** – The draft contains 22 nominalisations and 186 nouns (both in the P90 range). Rewrite noun‑heavy sentences into active‑voice verb phrases. Example: change \"The review found that the evidence is unclear whether exercise changes the severity of signs and symptoms…\" to \"We are unsure whether exercise improves the severity of signs and symptoms.\"\n3. **Simplify complex and long words** – Metrics show 135 complex words, 279 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words, and 209 long words (beyond typical ranges). Replace words like “methodological problems” with “study problems”, “non‑ulcerated” with “without ulcers”, “vascular insufficiency” with “poor vein circulation”, etc.\n4. **Break long sentences** – Any sentence over 30 words should be split. Example: the sentence starting with \"The review set out to discover whether structured physical‑exercise programmes can help people with non‑ulcerated CVI…\" can be divided into two shorter sentences.\n5. **Increase active voice and pronoun use** – Although active voice is acceptable, adding first‑person plural pronouns (we) clarifies who performed actions, e.g., \"We searched databases…\" instead of passive constructions throughout.\nThese changes will bring the draft into compliance with the style guide and improve readability for patients.\n\n**Supporting metric evidence**: The evaluation shows high nominalisation (22, P90), excessive nouns (186, P90), many complex words (135, P90) and very high Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (279, BEYOND_P90) and long words (209, BEYOND_P90). Reducing these will lower the SMOG (13.86, P90) and Dale‑Chall scores, bringing the text closer to typical PLS ranges.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation indicates moderate overall conformity but highlights several out‑of‑range metrics: nominalisations (22, P90), noun count (186, P90), complex words (135, P90), Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words (279, BEYOND_P90), long words (209, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (13.86, P90) and Dale‑Chall readability (8.22, P90). These suggest the draft is overly noun‑heavy and uses many difficult words, which should be simplified to improve patient readability."
