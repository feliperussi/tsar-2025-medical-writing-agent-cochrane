  "draft": "Is adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (a light‑activated antibacterial treatment) to standard deep cleaning effective for gum disease and dental‑implant disease?\n\nKey messages\n– Adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) to standard deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation) does not show clear, important benefits for treating gum disease (periodontitis) or infections around dental implants, and the evidence is very uncertain.  \n– No serious side‑effects were reported, but the studies were small and of limited quality, so safety conclusions remain tentative.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials that follow patients for longer periods and include implant‑related infections are needed to determine whether aPDT provides any meaningful benefit or harm.  \n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri‑implant diseases and how are they usually treated?  \nPeriodontitis is a long‑lasting inflammation that damages the tissues that hold your teeth in place. If it is not treated, it can cause bone loss and eventually tooth loss. Peri‑implant diseases affect the gums and bone around dental implants (the artificial tooth roots that replace missing teeth). The early form, peri‑implant mucositis, causes gum inflammation; the more serious form, peri‑implantitis, also leads to bone loss.  \n\nThe main goal of treatment is to clean the deep pockets around teeth or implants. We also remove the harmful bacterial film (biofilm) that lives below the gum line and protect the surrounding soft tissue and bone. Standard non‑surgical care uses subgingival instrumentation (SI), also called scaling and root planing, where a dentist or hygienist scrapes away the biofilm with hand or powered tools. Good oral hygiene, quitting smoking, and sometimes surgery are also part of the plan.  \n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and why might it help?  \nIn aPDT we place a light‑absorbing chemical (the photosensitiser) into the gum pocket and then shine a specific wavelength of light on it. The light activates the photosensitiser, creating a short‑lived burst of energy that kills bacteria. Researchers have suggested that adding aPDT to the usual cleaning (SI) might improve outcomes, but we do not know how much extra benefit it provides.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether adding aPDT to SI improves gum health and the supporting bone around teeth or dental implants. We compared three approaches in adults with periodontitis or peri‑implant disease: (1) SI + aPDT, (2) SI alone, and (3) SI + placebo aPDT. We looked at changes over six months in probing pocket depth (how deep the gum pockets are), bleeding on probing (how much the gums bleed when examined), clinical attachment level (how much supporting tissue has been lost), gingival recession (how much the gums have pulled back), pocket closure, bone level around implants, side effects, and quality of life.  \n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched several databases, including the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, up to 14 February 2024. We included randomised controlled trials that compared SI + aPDT with SI alone or with placebo aPDT in adults diagnosed with periodontitis, peri‑implantitis or peri‑implant disease.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 50 trials with a total of 1,407 participants. Most trials (32) used a split‑mouth design, where each participant received both the test and control treatments in different parts of the mouth. Eighteen trials used a parallel‑group design, with different participants receiving different treatments. The studies enrolled between 10 and 88 participants, so they were small.  \n\nIn 39 trials aPDT was given in a single session; in 11 trials it was given in two to four sessions. No eligible studies on peri‑implantitis were found, and only one very small study on peri‑implant mucositis reported no six‑month data.  \n\nAdding aPDT to the usual cleaning during the active phase of periodontitis probably makes little or no difference to gum‑pocket depth, bleeding, attachment level, or gum recession after six months. We are very uncertain whether any real benefit exists. The same likely lack of benefit appeared when aPDT was added during the supportive (maintenance) phase, and it probably does not change the chance of side effects. No studies evaluated aPDT for peri‑implant disease.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence for several reasons. In many studies participants or clinicians may have known which treatment was given, some studies did not report all outcomes we wanted, the participants and treatment methods varied, and the studies were very small.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched up to February 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

The evaluation shows 23 passive instances, well above the typical range.\n   *Problematic sentence*: \"No eligible studies on peri‑implantitis were found.\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"We did not find any eligible studies on peri‑implantitis.\"\n   *Another example*: \"No studies evaluated aPDT for peri‑implant disease.\" → \"We found no studies that evaluated aPDT for peri‑implant disease.\"\n3. **Long, dense sentences** – Some sentences exceed 30 words and combine several ideas, making them hard to follow. The metric shows 20.2 words per sentence (acceptable) but the length of specific sentences still hampers clarity.\n   *Problematic sentence*: \"The same likely lack of benefit was seen when the therapy was added during the supportive (maintenance) phase of treatment, and it probably does not change the chance of side effects.\"\n   *Suggested rewrite*: \"We saw the same lack of benefit when the therapy was added during the maintenance phase.
