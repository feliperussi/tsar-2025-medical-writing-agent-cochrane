  "draft": "Is adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (a light‑activated antibacterial treatment) to standard deep cleaning effective for gum disease and dental‑implant disease?\n\nKey messages\n– Adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) – a light‑activated treatment that kills bacteria – to standard deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation) does not show clear, important benefits for periodontitis or infections around dental implants, and the evidence is very uncertain.  \n– No serious side‑effects were reported, but the studies were small and of limited quality, so safety conclusions remain tentative.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials that follow patients for longer periods and include implant‑related infections are needed to determine whether aPDT provides any meaningful benefit or harm.  \n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri‑implant diseases and how are we usually treated?  \nPeriodontitis is a long‑lasting inflammation that damages the tissues that hold your teeth in place, eventually causing bone loss and tooth loss, and the more serious peri‑implantitis also leads to bone loss around the implant. The early form, peri‑implant mucositis, causes gum inflammation; the more serious peri‑implantitis also leads to bone loss around the implant.\n\nThe main treatment goal is to clean the deep pockets that form around teeth or implants, remove the harmful bacterial film (biofilm) that lives below the gum line, and protect the surrounding soft tissue and bone. Standard non‑surgical care uses subgingival instrumentation (SI), also called scaling and root planing, where a dentist or hygienist scrapes away the biofilm with hand or powered tools. Good oral hygiene, quitting smoking, and sometimes surgery are also part of the plan.\n\nAntimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a newer add‑on treatment. In aPDT we apply a light‑absorbing chemical (the photosensitiser) into the gum pocket and then shine a specific wavelength of light on it. The light activates the chemical, producing a short‑lived burst of energy that kills bacteria. Researchers have suggested that using aPDT together with SI might improve outcomes, but the extra benefit is unclear.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether adding aPDT to SI improves gum health and the supporting bone around teeth or dental implants. We compared three approaches in adults with periodontitis or peri‑implant disease: (1) SI + aPDT, (2) SI alone, and (3) SI + placebo aPDT. We looked at changes over six months in probing pocket depth (how deep the gum pockets are), bleeding on probing (how much the gums bleed when examined), clinical attachment level (how much supporting tissue has been lost), gingival recession (how much the gums have pulled back), pocket closure, bone level around implants, side effects, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trial registers up to 14 February 2024. We included randomised controlled trials that compared SI + aPDT with SI alone or with placebo aPDT in adults diagnosed with periodontitis, peri‑implantitis or peri‑implant disease.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 50 trials involving 1 407 aPDT after subgingival or submucosal cleaning; 39 trials used a single aPDT session and 11 used two to four sessions. No eligible studies on peri‑implantitis were found, and only one very small study on peri‑implant mucositis reported no six‑month data.\n\nWhat were the main results of adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy?  \nDuring the active phase of treatment for periodontitis, adding aPDT probably makes little or no difference to probing pocket depth, bleeding on‑probing, clinical attachment level or gingival recession after six months. The same lack of benefit appears when aPDT is added during the supportive (maintenance) phase. Adding aPDT also probably does not change the chance of side effects. No studies evaluated aPDT for peri‑implant disease.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because many studies may have allowed participants or clinicians to know which treatment was given (performance bias), not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, the participants and treatment methods varied, and the trials were very small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the sub‑heading format rule – the \"Key messages\" heading is not phrased as a question, which the Master Style Guide requires for all section headings. In addition, several clarity and style problems would likely confuse readers: (1) a very long, noun‑heavy sentence describing the treatment goal; (2) frequent passive constructions (e.g., \"The evidence is up to date to February 2024.\") that obscure who is acting; (3) overly dense sentences that combine multiple ideas without breaks; (4) limited use of first‑person plural pronouns in some sections; and (5) excessive technical jargon without simple explanations. These issues are reflected in the metric report (20 passive voice instances, 22 nominalisations, 197 nouns, and very high counts of complex and long words), all well beyond typical PLS ranges, indicating the text is harder to read than necessary. The draft therefore does not meet the required clarity, style, and structural standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights several out‑of‑range metrics: passive_voice (20, P90), nominalisation (22, P90), nouns (197, P90), smog_index (14.1, P90), complex_words_dc (305, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (152, BEYOND_P90) and long_words (197, BEYOND_P90). These indicate the draft is overly noun‑heavy, uses many complex words, and contains many passive constructions, which reduces readability for a lay audience."
