  "draft": "Is adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (a light‑activated antibacterial treatment) to standard deep cleaning effective for gum disease and dental implant disease?\n\nKey messages\n- Adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) – a light‑activated treatment that kills bacteria – to standard deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation) does not show clear, important benefits for treating gum disease (periodontitis) or infections around dental implants, and the evidence is very uncertain.\n- No serious side‑effects were reported in the studies, but the number of participants was small and the overall quality of the evidence is limited, so safety conclusions remain tentative.\n- More large, well‑designed trials are needed, especially studies that follow patients for longer periods and include people with implant‑related infections, to determine whether aPDT provides any meaningful benefit or harm.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat are periodontitis and peri‑implant diseases and how are they usually treated?\nPeriodontitis is a long‑lasting inflammation that damages the tissues that hold your teeth in place, eventually leading to bone loss and tooth loss if it is not treated. Peri‑implant diseases affect the gums and bone around dental implants – the artificial tooth roots that replace missing teeth. The early form, peri‑implant mucositis, causes gum inflammation, while the more serious peri‑implantitis also leads to bone loss around the implant.\n\nThe main goal of treatment is to clean the deep pockets that form around teeth or implants, remove the harmful bacterial film (called biofilm) that lives below the gum line, and protect the surrounding soft tissue and bone. Standard non‑surgical care involves subgingival instrumentation (SI), also known as scaling and root planing, where a dentist or hygienist uses hand or powered tools to scrape away the biofilm from below the gums. Good oral hygiene, quitting smoking, and sometimes surgery are also part of the overall plan.\n\nA newer add‑on treatment is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). In aPDT, a special light‑absorbing chemical (the “photosensitiser”) is applied to the gum pocket, and then a specific wavelength of light is shone on it. The light activates the chemical, producing a short‑lived burst of energy that kills the bacteria. Researchers have suggested that using aPDT together with the usual cleaning (SI) might improve outcomes, but it is not clear how much extra benefit it provides.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to determine whether adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) to the standard cleaning procedure (subgingival instrumentation) improves the health of gums and the supporting bone around teeth and dental implants. Specifically, they compared three approaches in adults with periodontitis or peri‑implant disease: (1) SI plus aPDT, (2) SI alone, and (3) SI plus a placebo version of aPDT. They looked at changes over six months in measures such as probing pocket depth (how deep the gum pockets are), bleeding on probing (how much the gums bleed when examined), clinical attachment level (how much the supporting tissue has been lost), gingival recession (how much the gums have pulled back), pocket closure, bone level around implants, and any side effects or impact on quality of life.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies that compared subgingival instrumentation with adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy to instrumentation alone or placebo, combined their results to assess the overall effect, and rated our confidence in the evidence based on study quality and consistency.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 50 randomised controlled trials that together involved 1,407 people with periodontitis, peri‑implantitis or peri‑implant disease. Most of the trials used a split‑mouth design (where each participant received both the test and control treatment in different parts of the mouth); 18 trials used a parallel‑group design (different participants received different treatments). The studies were small, ranging from 10 to 88 participants. All trials compared antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) given after subgingival or submucosal cleaning with cleaning alone or cleaning plus a placebo aPDT. In 39 trials aPDT was applied in a single session, and in 11 trials it was applied in two to four sessions. The review only reported outcomes up to six months and did not provide details on participants’ age, gender, disease severity, funding sources or where the studies were conducted. No eligible studies on peri‑implantitis were found, and only one very small study on peri‑implant mucositis was available, which did not report six‑month data.\n\nMain results: Effect of adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy\nAdding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy to the usual cleaning during the active phase of treatment for periodontitis probably makes little or no difference to how deep the gum pockets are, bleeding on probing, attachment level of the teeth or gum recession after six months, and we are very uncertain about any real benefit. The same likely lack of benefit was seen when the therapy was added during the supportive (maintenance) phase of treatment, and it probably does not change the chance of side effects. No studies evaluated this therapy for peri‑implant disease.\n\nLimitations\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the studies were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024 of search.",
