  "draft": "\"Is adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (a light‑activated antibacterial treatment) to standard deep cleaning effective for gum disease and dental implant disease?\"\n\nKey messages\n- Adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) – a light‑activated treatment that kills bacteria – to standard deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation) does not show clear, important benefits for treating gum disease (periodontitis) or infections around dental implants, and the evidence is very uncertain.\n- No serious side‑effects were reported in the studies, but the trials were small and of limited quality, so safety conclusions remain tentative.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials that follow patients for longer periods and include people with implant‑related infections are needed to determine whether aPDT provides any meaningful benefit or harm.\n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri‑implant diseases and how are they usually treated?\nPeriodontitis is a long‑lasting inflammation that damages the tissues that hold your teeth in place. If it is not treated, it can be lost along with the supporting bone. Peri‑implant diseases affect the gums and bone around dental implants (the artificial tooth roots that replace missing teeth). The early form, peri‑implant mucositis, causes gum inflammation; the more serious form, peri‑implantitis, also leads to bone loss.\n\nThe main goal of treatment is to clean the deep pockets that form around teeth or implants, remove the harmful bacterial film (biofilm) that lives below the gum line, and protect the surrounding soft tissue and bone. Standard non‑surgical care uses subgingival instrumentation (SI), also called scaling and root planing, where a dentist or hygienist scrapes away the biofilm with hand or powered tools. Good oral hygiene, quitting smoking, and sometimes surgery are also part of the plan.\n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and why might it help?\nIn aPDT we first place a light‑absorbing chemical (the photosensitiser) into the gum pocket. We then shine a specific wavelength of light on it. The light activates the photosensitiser and creates a short‑lived burst of energy that kills bacteria. Researchers have suggested that adding aPDT to the usual cleaning (SI) might improve outcomes, but we do not know how much extra benefit it provides.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether adding aPDT to SI improves gum health and the supporting bone around teeth or dental implants. We compared three approaches in adults with periodontitis or peri‑implant disease: (1) SI + aPDT, (2) SI alone, and (3) SI + placebo aPDT. We looked at changes over six months in probing pocket depth (how deep the gum pockets are), bleeding on probing (how much the gums bleed when examined), clinical attachment level (how much supporting tissue has been lost), gingival recession (how much the gums have pulled back), pocket closure, bone level around implants, side effects, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and other sources up to 14 February 2024. We included randomised controlled trials that compared SI + aPDT with SI alone or with placebo aPDT in adults diagnosed with periodontitis, peri‑implantitis or peri‑implant disease.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 50 trials that included  1,407 participants. Most trials used a split‑mouth design (where each participant receives both the test and control treatment in different parts of the mouth); 18 trials used a parallel‑group design (different participants receive different treatments). The studies were small, enrolling between 10 and 88 people.\n\nIn 39 trials, clinicians applied aPDT once. In 11 trials, they applied it two to four times. No eligible studies on peri‑implantitis were found, and only one very small study on peri‑implant mucositis reported no six‑month data.\n\nAdding aPDT to the usual cleaning during the active treatment phase (when the disease is being treated) probably makes little or no difference to gum‑pocket depth, bleeding on probing, attachment level, or gum recession after six months. We are very uncertain whether any real benefit exists.\n\nWe saw the same likely lack of benefit when aPDT was added later, during the maintenance phase (when the disease is being kept under control). It also probably does not change the risk of side effects. No studies evaluated aPDT for peri‑implant disease.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants or clinicians may have known which treatment was given of aPDT, some trials did not report all outcomes we wanted, the participants and treatment methods varied, and the studies were very small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?\nWe searched up to February 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",
