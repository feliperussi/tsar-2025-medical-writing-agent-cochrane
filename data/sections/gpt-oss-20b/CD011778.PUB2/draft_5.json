  "draft": "Is adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (a light‑activated antibacterial treatment) to standard deep cleaning effective for gum disease and dental‑implant disease?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n– Adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) – a light‑activated treatment that kills bacteria – to standard deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation) does not show clear, important benefits for gum disease (periodontitis) or infections around dental implants, and the evidence is very uncertain.  \n– We found no serious side‑effects, but the studies were small and of limited quality, so safety conclusions remain tentative.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials that follow patients for longer periods and include implant‑related infections are needed to determine whether aPDT provides any meaningful benefit or harm.  \n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri‑implant diseases and how are they usually treated?  \nPeriodontitis is a long‑lasting inflammation that damages the tissues holding your teeth in place, eventually causing bone loss and tooth loss if untreated. Peri‑implant diseases affect the gums and bone around dental implants (artificial tooth roots). The early form, peri‑implant mucositis, causes gum inflammation; the more serious peri‑implantitis also leads to bone loss.  \n\nThe main treatment goal is to clean the deep pockets that form around teeth or implants, remove the harmful bacterial film (biofilm) that lives below the gum line, and protect the surrounding soft tissue and bone. Standard non‑surgical care uses subgingival instrumentation (SI) – also called scaling and root planing – where a dentist or hygienist scrapes away the biofilm with hand or powered tools. Good oral hygiene, quitting smoking, and sometimes surgery are also part of the plan.  \n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and why might it help?  \nIn aPDT we place a light‑absorbing chemical (the photosensitiser) into the gum pocket and then shine a specific wavelength of light on it. The light activates the chemical, creating a short‑lived burst of energy that kills bacteria. Researchers have suggested that adding aPDT to the usual cleaning (SI) might improve outcomes, but we do not know how much extra benefit it provides.  \n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether adding aPDT to SI improves gum health and the supporting bone around teeth or dental implants. We compared three approaches in adults with periodontitis or peri‑implant disease: (1) SI + aPDT, (2) SI alone, and (3) SI + placebo aPDT. We looked at changes over six months in probing pocket depth (how deep the gum pockets are), bleeding on probing (how much the gums bleed when examined), clinical attachment level (how much supporting tissue has been lost), gingival recession (how much the gums have pulled back), pocket closure, bone level around implants, side effects, and quality of life.  \n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trial registers up to 14 February 2024. We included randomised controlled trials that compare SI + aPDT with SI alone or with placebo aPDT in adults diagnosed with periodontitis, peri‑implantitis or peri‑implant disease.  \n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 50 trials involving 1 407 participants. Most trials used a split‑mouth design (each participant received both test and control treatments in different parts of the mouth); 18 trials used a parallel‑group design (different participants received different treatments). The studies were small, enrolling between 10 and 88 participants. In 39 trials aPDT was given in a single session, and in 11 trials it was given in two to four sessions. No eligible studies on peri‑implantitis were found, and only one very small study on peri‑implant mucositis reported no six‑month data.  \n\nAdding aPDT to the usual cleaning during the active phase of periodontitis probably makes little or no difference to gum‑pocket depth, bleeding, attachment level, or gum recession after six months. We are very uncertain whether any real benefit exists. The same likely lack of benefit appeared when aPDT was added during the supportive (maintenance) phase, and it probably does not change the chance of side effects. No studies evaluated aPDT for peri‑implant disease.  \n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because many studies may have let participants or clinicians know which treatment was given (performance bias), not all studies reported every outcome we wanted, the participants and treatment methods varied, and the trials were very small.  \n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched up to February 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft meets the mandatory structural and factual checks, but several clarity problems would likely confuse a lay reader. The most important issues are:\n1. **Overly long, noun‑heavy sentence** – \"The main treatment goal is to clean the deep pockets that form around teeth or implants, remove the harmful bacterial film (biofilm) that lives below the gum line, and protect the surrounding soft tissue and bone.\" This packs three actions into one long clause, making it hard to follow. *Rewrite:* \"The main goal of treatment is to clean the deep pockets around teeth or implants. We also remove the harmful bacterial film (biofilm) below the gum line and protect the surrounding soft tissue and bone.\"\n2. **Passive voice and vague wording** – \"The studies were small, enrolling between 10 and 88 participants.\" Passive construction adds distance. *Rewrite:* \"The studies enrolled between 10 and 88 participants and were small.\"\n3. **Very long, complex sentence with multiple reasons** – \"We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the treatment, and the studies were very small.\" This sentence exceeds 30 words and mixes several ideas, overwhelming the reader. *Rewrite:* \"We are not confident in the evidence for several reasons. In many studies participants or clinicians may have known which treatment was given, some studies did not report all outcomes we wanted, the participants and treatment methods varied, and the studies were very small.\"\n4. **Dense information in one sentence** – \"We identified 50 trials involving 1 407 participants. Most trials used a split‑mouth design (each participant received both test and control treatments in different parts of the mouth); 18 trials used a parallel‑group design (different participants received different treatments).\" Combining two facts makes it harder to digest. *Rewrite:* \"We identified 50 trials with a total of 1,407 participants. Most trials (32) used a split‑mouth design, where each participant received both the test and control treatments in different parts of the mouth. Eighteen trials used a parallel‑group design, with different participants receiving different treatments.\"\n5. **Unnecessary list of databases** – \"We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trial registers up to 14 February 2024.\" The list is long and adds little value for a lay audience. *Rewrite:* \"We searched several databases, including the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, up to 14 February 2024.\"\nThese changes address the high passive‑voice count (22 instances, well above the typical P90 range), the excessive noun count (213, beyond the P90 benchmark), and the elevated complexity metrics (SMOG 14.4, complex words 158, long words 209). Reducing sentence length, using active voice, and breaking up noun‑heavy constructions will bring the draft closer to typical PLS patterns and improve readability for patients. Overall, while the draft is factually accurate and structurally complete, the identified clarity issues are significant enough to warrant a NOT_APPROVED judgment until they are resolved.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the word limit (757 words) and has good active‑voice (74, P75) and pronoun use (36, P75). However, several metrics deviate strongly from typical PLS patterns: passive voice (22, beyond P90), noun count (213, beyond P90), SMOG index (14.45, beyond P90), complex words (158, beyond P90), Dale‑Chall complex words (329, beyond P90) and long words (209, beyond P90). These indicate the text is noun‑heavy, uses many complex and long words, and contains many passive constructions, which aligns with the clarity issues identified."
