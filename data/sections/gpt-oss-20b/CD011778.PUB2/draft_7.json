  "draft": "Is adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy summary\n\nKey messages\n– Adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) – a light‑activated treatment that kills bacteria – to standard deep cleaning (subgingival instrumentation) does not show clear, important benefits for gum disease (periodontitis) or infections around dental implants, and the evidence is very uncertain.  \n– No serious side‑effects were reported, but the studies were small and of limited quality, so safety conclusions remain tentative.  \n– Larger, well‑designed trials that follow patients for longer periods and include implant‑related infections are needed to determine whether aPDT provides any meaningful benefit or harm.\n\nWhat are periodontitis and peri‑implant diseases and how are they usually treated?  \nPeriodontitis is a long‑lasting inflammation that damages the tissues that hold your teeth in place. If it is not treated, it can cause bone loss and eventually tooth loss. Peri‑implant diseases affect the gums and bone around dental implants (the artificial tooth roots that replace missing teeth). The early form, peri‑implant mucositis, causes gum inflammation; the more serious form, peri‑implantitis, also leads to bone loss.\n\nThe main goal of treatment is to clean the deep pockets that form around teeth or implants, remove the usual bacterial film (biofilm) that lives below the gum line, and protect the surrounding soft tissue and bone. Standard non‑surgical care uses subgingival instrumentation (SI) – also called scaling and root planing – where a dentist or hygienist scrapes away the biofilm with hand or powered tools. Good oral hygiene, quitting smoking, and sometimes surgery are also part of the plan.\n\nWhat is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and why might it help?  \nIn aPDT we place a light‑absorbing chemical (the photosensitiser) into the gum pocket and then shine a specific wavelength of light on it. The light activates the photosensitiser, creating a short‑lived burst of energy that kills bacteria. Researchers have suggested that adding aPDT to the usual cleaning (SI) might improve outcomes, but we do not know how much extra benefit it provides.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?  \nWe wanted to know whether adding aPDT to SI improves gum health and the supporting bone around teeth or dental implants. We compared three approaches in adults with periodontitis or peri‑implant disease: (1) SI + aPDT, (2) SI alone, and (3) SI + placebo aPDT. We looked at changes over six months in probing pocket depth (how deep the gum pockets are), bleeding on probing (how much the gums bleed when examined), clinical attachment level (how much supporting tissue has been lost), gingival recession (how much the gums have pulled back), pocket closure, bone level around implants, side effects, and quality of life.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and other sources up to 14 February 2024. We included randomised controlled trials that compared SI + aPDT with SI alone or with placebo aPDT in adults diagnosed with periodontitis, peri‑implantitis or peri‑implant disease.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 50 trials involving 1,407 participants. Most trials (32) used a split‑mouth design, where each participant received both the test and control treatments in different parts of the mouth; 18 trials used a parallel‑group design, with different participants receiving different treatments. The studies enrolled between 10 and 88 participants, so they were small.\n\nIn 39 trials aPDT was given in a single session; in 11 trials it was given in two to four sessions. We did not find any eligible studies on peri‑implantitis, and only one very small study on peri‑implant mucositis reported no six‑month data.\n\nAdding aPDT to the usual cleaning during the first treatment period (the active phase, when the disease is being actively treated) probably makes little or no difference to gum‑pocket depth, bleeding on probing, attachment level, or gum recession after six months. We are very uncertain whether any real benefit exists.\n\nWe saw the same lack of benefit when the therapy was added later, during the maintenance period (the supportive phase, when the disease is being kept under control). It also probably does not change the risk of side effects. We found no studies that evaluated aPDT for peri‑implant disease.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe are not confident in the evidence because participants or clinicians may have known which treatment was given, some trials did not report all outcomes we wanted, the participants and treatment methods varied, and the studies were very small.\n\nHow current is the evidence?  \nWe searched up to February 2024, so the evidence reflects studies published up to that date.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails a critical check: the main title is missing, not phrased as a question, and does not match the required plain‑language title from the source. While the subheadings are correctly phrased as questions, the title should be a clear, question‑style statement such as “Is adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (a light‑activated antibacterial treatment) to standard deep cleaning effective for gum disease and dental implant disease?”. Additionally, the draft contains several clarity and style issues that would confuse readers:\n1. Excessive passive voice (25 instances, far above the typical range, contributing to vague statements). Example: “We identified 50 trials involving 1,407 participants.” → rewrite in active voice.\n2. Noun‑heavy sentences and long sentences (>30 words) that reduce readability. Example: “In 39 trials aPDT was given in a single session; in 11 trials it was given in two to four sessions.” → split and simplify.\n3. Bullet points are introduced with an en‑dash (–) instead of the required hyphen (-). Example: “Key messages – Adding antimicrobial…”. Replace with hyphen.\n4. Some jargon is not defined for lay readers (e.g., “split‑mouth design”, “subgingival instrumentation”). Provide brief plain‑language explanations.\n5. The title and key‑message heading lack a question format and proper punctuation.\nThese issues, together with the metric deviations (high passive voice, high noun count, high complex‑word counts, and long‑word count), mean the draft does not meet the required standards. Suggested concrete rewrites:\n- Title: Change to “Is adding antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (a light‑activated antibacterial treatment) to standard deep cleaning effective for gum disease and dental implant disease?”\n- Active voice: Replace “We identified 50 trials involving 1,407 participants.” with “We found 50 trials that included 1,407 participants.”\n- Split long sentence: Change “In 39 trials aPDT was given in a single session; in 11 trials it was given in two to four sessions.” to “In 39 trials, aPDT was applied once. In 11 trials, it was applied two to four times.”\n- Bullet format: Use “- Adding antimicrobial …” instead of “– Adding antimicrobial …”.\n- Define jargon: After “split‑mouth design” add “(where each person receives both treatments in different parts of the mouth)”.\nAddressing these will bring the draft into compliance with the Master Style Guide and improve readability for patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is within the 850‑word limit (778 words) but deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns: passive voice (25 instances, BEYOND_P90), noun count (209, BEYOND_P90), complex words (153, BEYOND_P90), Dale‑Chall complex words (331, BEYOND_P90), long words (205, BEYOND_P90), and SMOG index (14.2, P90).
