  "key_messages": [
    "Current studies do not provide clear evidence that hydroxyurea (a medicine that reduces sickle cell crises) or ACE inhibitors (blood‑pressure medicines) prevent or slow kidney disease (damage to the kidneys) in people with sickle cell disease (a blood disorder); there may be a small benefit for the kidneys' ability to concentrate urine (make urine more concentrated), but there was little or no difference in serious sickle‑cell‑related complications such as chest problems, painful episodes, or hospital stays, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "Evidence is also lacking for other potential treatments such as red blood cell transfusions (giving donated blood cells) and for older children and adults with sickle cell disease, because no suitable trials have been found for these groups.",
    "More well‑designed, larger studies that follow patients for longer periods are needed to determine whether these medicines can truly protect kidney function (how well the kidneys work) in sickle cell disease and to assess any possible side effects."

      "subheading": "Why are kidney problems a concern for people with sickle cell disease?",
      "content": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition where the blood’s oxygen‑carrying protein is abnormal, causing red blood cells to become stiff and shaped like a sickle. These misshapen cells can block tiny blood vessels, leading to painful attacks and damage to many organs. One organ that is often affected is the kidney. Over time, the repeated blockage and reduced blood flow can hurt the tiny filtering units in the kidney, a problem called sickle cell nephropathy. This can show up early as tiny amounts of protein in the urine (microalbuminuria) and may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the kidneys no longer work well enough for at least three months. CKD can eventually lead to end‑stage renal disease, meaning the kidneys fail completely and dialysis or a transplant is needed. Because kidney damage can start in childhood and worsen with age, finding ways to protect the kidneys is a major health priority for people with SCD."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The authors set out to discover whether any treatments can prevent or slow kidney damage in people with sickle cell disease. They looked at three types of interventions that are already used for other SCD problems: • Hydroxyurea – a medicine that reduces the number of sickle‑shaped cells. • Angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) – drugs that lower blood pressure in the tiny vessels of the kidney and are often used to protect kidneys in other diseases. • Red blood cell transfusions – giving healthy blood cells to replace the sickle cells. The review asked: do any of these treatments, alone or together, improve kidney function, reduce protein loss in the urine, or lower the risk of serious kidney‑related complications? By summarising the best available trial evidence, the review aimed to tell patients, clinicians, and policymakers which strategies, if any, are effective and safe for protecting the kidneys of people with SCD."

      "content": "We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies that randomly assign participants to treatments) comparing interventions such as hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors or transfusions with placebo or other care in people with sickle cell disease to prevent or reduce kidney complications; we pooled the results and assessed confidence in the evidence using standard criteria."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We identified three randomised controlled trials that together enrolled 385 people with sickle‑cell disease. One trial compared hydroxyurea with placebo in 193 children aged about 9 to 18 months. A second trial compared the ACE‑inhibitor captopril with placebo in 22 adults who had normal blood pressure but microalbuminuria. The third trial compared the ACE‑inhibitor lisinopril with vitamin C in 170 children aged 1 to 18 years, also with normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria. The abstract did not give details about how long participants were followed, the countries where the studies were done, or who funded them.\n\nThe evidence is uncertain. It is unclear whether hydroxyurea improves kidney filtration in very young children, although it may slightly help the kidneys concentrate urine. Hydroxyurea probably makes little or no difference to serious complications such as acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospitalisations. It is also unclear whether ACE‑inhibitors reduce protein loss in the urine of adults or children with sickle‑cell disease, and whether they affect overall kidney function in adults."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in, the evidence does not cover all of the people or outcomes we are interested in, and the studies were very small.",
