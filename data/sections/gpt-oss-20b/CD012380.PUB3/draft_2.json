  "draft": "Do treatments such as hydroxyurea (a medicine that reduces sickle‑cell crises) or ACE inhibitors (blood‑pressure medicines) help prevent or slow kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease (a blood disorder)?\n\nKey messages\n- Current studies do not show clear evidence that hydroxyurea or ACE inhibitors prevent or slow kidney disease in sickle‑cell disease; they may give a small benefit to the kidneys’ ability to concentrate urine, but they do not reduce serious complications such as chest problems, painful episodes, or hospital stays, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- No suitable trials were found for red‑blood‑cell transfusions or for older children and adults, so we lack evidence for these groups.\n- Larger, well‑designed trials that follow patients for longer periods are needed to determine whether any of these medicines truly protect kidney function and to assess possible side effects.\n\nWhy are kidney problems a concern for people with sickle cell disease?\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition that makes the oxygen‑carrying protein in red blood cells abnormal. The cells become stiff and sickle‑shaped, block tiny blood vessels, and cause painful attacks. When the tiny vessels in the kidneys are blocked, the filtering units are damaged. This early damage appears as microalbuminuria (tiny amounts of protein in the urine) and can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the kidneys work poorly for at least three months. CKD can later lead to end‑stage renal disease, requiring dialysis or a transplant. Because kidney damage can start in childhood and worsen with age, protecting the kidneys is a major health priority for people with SCD.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether any of the following treatments can prevent or slow kidney damage in SCD:\n- Hydroxyurea – a medicine that reduces the number of sickle‑shaped cells.\n- Angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) – drugs that lower blood pressure in the tiny vessels of the kidney and are used to protect kidneys in other diseases.\n- Red‑blood‑cell transfusions – giving healthy blood cells to replace sickle cells.\n\nWe asked whether these treatments, alone or together, improve kidney function, reduce protein loss in the urine, or lower the risk of serious kidney‑related complications.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched multiple trial registers and databases for randomised controlled trials that compared hydroxyurea, ACE inhibitors or transfusions with placebo or usual care in people with SCD. Two reviewers independently screened the records, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and judged the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified three trials that together enrolled 385 participants:\n- One trial compared hydroxyurea with placebo in 193 children aged 9 to 18 months.\n- One trial compared the ACE inhibitor captopril with placebo in 22 adults who had normal blood pressure but microalbuminuria.\n- One trial compared the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with vitamin C in 170 children aged 1 to 18 years who also had normal blood pressure and microalbuminuria.\n\nThe trials did not report follow‑up length, locations, or funding sources. The evidence is uncertain. Hydroxyurea may slightly improve the kidneys’ ability to concentrate urine, but we do not know whether it improves glomerular filtration rate (a measure of kidney filtering capacity). Hydroxyurea probably makes little or no difference to serious SCD complications such as acute chest syndrome, painful crises, or hospitalisations. For ACE inhibitors, we do not know whether they reduce protein loss in the urine of adults or children, and we lack data on overall kidney function.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the findings because the trials were small, and some participants may have known which treatment they received, introducing bias. Not all outcomes of interest were reported, and the evidence does not cover older children, adults, or all SCD genotypes.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this the review?\nThe published abstract did not state a specific date for the literature search, so we cannot confirm how current the evidence is. Ongoing trials are being conducted, but results are not yet available.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check because the \"Key messages\" subheading is not phrased as a question, which the Master Style Guide requires for all subheadings. In addition, the text contains several clarity and style problems that would hinder patient understanding:\n1. **Subheading not a question** – \"Key messages\" should be re‑worded as a question (e.g., \"What are the main findings?\").\n2. **Excessive passive voice** – The draft has 23 passive constructions (P90), making it harder for readers to see who did what. Example: \"The trials did not report follow‑up length…\" → rewrite to active: \"We could not find information on follow‑up length…\".\n3. **Long, dense sentences** – Sentences exceed 30 words and contain many complex/long words. Example: \"Hydroxyurea may slightly improve the kidneys’ ability to concentrate urine, but we do not know whether it improves glomerular filtration rate (a measure of kidney filtering capacity).\" → rewrite: \"Hydroxyurea may help the kidneys concentrate urine a little, but we do not know if it improves the kidneys’ filtering ability (glomerular filtration rate).\".\n4. **Noun‑heavy language** – The draft uses 217 nouns (beyond P90) and 287 Dale‑Chall unfamiliar words, creating noun‑heavy sentences. Example: \"The evidence is uncertain. It is unclear whether hydroxyurea improves kidney filtration in very young children, although it may slightly help the kidneys concentrate urine.\" → rewrite with more verbs: \"We are uncertain. Hydroxyurea might not improve kidney filtering in very young children, but it could help the kidneys concentrate urine a little.\".\n5. **Missing first‑person plural in key messages** – The key messages use impersonal phrasing (“Current studies do not provide clear evidence…”) instead of the required \"we\" language. Rewrite to: \"We found that current studies do not provide clear evidence…\".\nThese issues, together with the metric deviations (high passive voice, excessive nouns, many complex and long words), mean the draft does not meet the required clarity and style standards.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity but highlights five out‑of‑range features: passive_voice (23, P90), nouns (217, BEYOND_P90), complex_words_dc (287, BEYOND_P90), complex_words (129, P90) and long_words (203, P90). These indicate the draft is overly passive, noun‑heavy, and uses many complex/long words, which aligns with the editorial concerns noted above."
