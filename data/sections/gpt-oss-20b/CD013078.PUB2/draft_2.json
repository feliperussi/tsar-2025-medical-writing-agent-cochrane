  "draft": "Is doing strengthening exercises helpful for treating jumper’s knee (patellar tendinopathy)?\n\nKey messages\n– Strengthening exercises that make the knee‑supporting muscles stronger may lower pain and improve knee function in people with jumper’s knee, but the evidence is uncertain and no studies reported side‑effects.  \n– Compared with steroid injections (glucocorticoid injections) or surgery, strengthening exercises appear to give similar results for pain relief, function and return to sport, although the data are limited and uncertain.  \n– The existing studies are few, small and involve mainly young male athletes; we need larger, well‑designed trials in broader populations and longer follow‑up to confirm the true benefits and risks.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy and why does it matter?\nPatellar tendinopathy, often called “jumper’s knee”, causes pain at the front of the knee where the tendon attaches the kneecap to the thigh muscle. It mainly affects people who do a lot of jumping or running, such as athletes, and can make everyday activities like climbing stairs or squatting painful. Because the pain can persist for months, it can limit sports performance and daily life.\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nWe wanted to know whether strengthening exercises reduce pain and improve function in people with patellar tendinopathy? Actually we wanted to know whether strengthening exercises reduce pain and improve function in people with patellar tendinopathy, and whether these exercises cause any harms. We compared exercise programmes with no treatment, steroid injections, surgery, and other therapies such as stretching or ultrasound.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched several medical databases up to September 2023 for randomised controlled trials that compared strengthening exercise with any other intervention or with no treatment. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We rated our confidence in the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified seven trials involving 211 participants with chronic jumper’s knee. All participants were athletes; 88 % were male, the average age was 26 years and symptoms had lasted about 42 months. The trials compared strengthening exercise with: no treatment (3 trials, 93 participants), steroid injection (1 trial, 38 participants), surgery (1 trial, 40 participants), stretching exercise (1 trial, 15 participants) and pulsed ultrasound with transverse friction (1 trial, 30 participants). No study compared exercise with a placebo or sham intervention, and none reported adverse events.\n\nWhat were the main results for pain and function?\n– Compared with no treatment, we are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain. The evidence suggests a possible reduction, but confidence is low.  \n– Strengthening exercise may improve function slightly compared with no treatment, but the effect is small and uncertain.  \n– Compared with steroid injection, strengthening exercise makes little or no difference to pain or function.  \n– Compared with surgery, we are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain or improves function.  \n– Strengthening exercise may increase participants’ overall assessment of treatment success compared with surgery, but the evidence is low‑certainty.  \n– The proportion of athletes who return to sport is similar for strengthening exercise and surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the findings because the trials were small, participants and investigators knew which treatment was given, and most studies involved only young male athletes. No trial reported harms, so we cannot assess safety.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nYes. The searches covered studies published up to September 2023.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical check that *all* subheadings must be phrased as questions – the \"Key messages\" heading is not a question. In addition, several clarity problems would confuse a patient reader: (1) the aim statement repeats itself and mixes a question mark with a statement, making the purpose unclear; (2) the methods mention the \"GRADE approach\" without any lay explanation; (3) the text contains many noun‑heavy, nominalised constructions (e.g., \"The proportion of athletes who return to sport is similar…\") which reduce readability. Suggested rewrites: - Change \"Key messages\" to a question such as \"What are the key messages?\". - Replace the confusing aim paragraph with: \"We wanted to find out whether strengthening exercises reduce pain, improve function, and cause any harms in people with patellar tendinopathy. We compared exercise programmes with no treatment, steroid injections, surgery, and other therapies such as stretching or ultrasound.\" - Explain GRADE: \"We used the GRADE system – a method that grades how confident we are in the evidence – to assess the quality of the studies.\" - Convert nominalisations to active verbs: \"Similar numbers of athletes return to sport after strengthening exercise or surgery.\" These changes address the most important readability issues and bring the draft into line with the Master Style Guide. The PLS evaluation also shows high nominalisation (33 instances, beyond the 90th percentile), a very high noun count (181, beyond 90th percentile) and elevated complexity metrics (SMOG 14.9, complex words 136, long words 209), confirming that the draft is unusually noun‑heavy and complex. Reducing nominalisations and simplifying language will improve the readability scores and better serve patients.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft meets the word‑count limit (596 words) and has good active‑voice (78) and pronoun use (27). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in several areas: nominalisation (33, BEYOND_P90), noun count (181, P90), SMOG index (14.9, P90), Dale‑Chall readability (8.3, P90), complex words (136, P90) and long words (209, BEYOND_P90). These metrics indicate the text is unusually noun‑heavy and uses many complex, long words, which aligns with the identified clarity and style issues."
