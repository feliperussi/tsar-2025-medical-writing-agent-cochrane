  "draft": "Is doing strengthening exercises helpful for treating jumper's knee (patellar tendinopathy)?\n\n**Key messages**\n- Strengthening exercises (exercises that make the knee‑supporting muscles stronger) may reduce pain and improve knee function in people with jumper’s knee, but the evidence is uncertain and no studies reported any side effects.\n- When compared with steroid injections (glucocorticoid injections) or surgery, strengthening exercises seem to give similar results for pain relief, function and returning to sport, yet the available data are limited and uncertain.\n- Because the current studies are few, small, and mainly involve young male athletes, more well‑designed research in broader populations, with longer follow‑up and careful reporting of any harms, is needed to determine the true benefits and risks of strengthening exercises for jumper’s knee.\n\n**Introduction**\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy and why does it matter?\nPatellar tendinopathy, often called \"jumper's knee,\" is a common problem that causes pain at the front of the knee where the tendon that connects the kneecap to the thigh muscle attaches. It mainly affects people who do a lot of jumping or running, such as athletes, and can make everyday activities like climbing stairs or squatting painful. Because the pain can be long‑lasting, it can limit sports performance and even everyday life. The usual ways doctors try to treat it include different kinds of exercises to make the tendon stronger, surgery, and steroid shots (called glucocorticoid injections). Among the exercises, the most frequently used are \"strengthening\" exercises, especially those that involve the muscle lengthening while it contracts (known as eccentric loading).\n\nWhat did the review aim to find out?\nThe authors wanted to find out whether doing strengthening exercises helps reduce pain and improve function in people with patellar tendinopathy, and whether these exercises cause any harms. They compared exercise programmes with doing nothing, with steroid injections, with surgery, and with other treatments such as stretching or ultrasound, to see which approach works best and is safest.\n\n**Methods**\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies that compared strengthening exercise for patellar tendinopathy with no treatment, other therapies, or different exercise approaches, combined their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence (using GRADE) based on study methods and size.\n\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nThe review incorporated seven randomized controlled trials comprising a total of 211 participants with chronic patellar tendinopathy. All participants were athletes, predominantly male (88%) with a mean age of 26 years and an average symptom duration of about 41.6 months, indicating a chronic condition. The trials compared strengthening exercise programmes against a variety of comparators: no treatment (three trials, 93 participants), glucocorticoid injection (one trial, 38 participants), surgery (one trial, 40 participants), stretching exercise (one trial, 15 participants), and pulsed ultrasound with transverse friction (one trial, 30 participants). No studies evaluated strengthening exercise versus a placebo or sham intervention, and none reported adverse events. The abstract does not provide details on the length of the intervention periods, the countries where the studies were conducted, or the sources of funding, so these characteristics remain unspecified.\n\nMain results: Pain and function outcomes\nIt is unclear if strengthening exercise reduces pain compared with no treatment. Strengthening exercise may improve function slightly compared with no treatment. Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to pain compared with glucocorticoid injection. Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function compared with glucocorticoid injection. It is unclear if strengthening exercise reduces pain compared with surgery. It is unclear if strengthening exercise improves function compared with surgery. Strengthening exercise may increase treatment success compared with surgery. Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to the proportion of athletes who return to sport compared with surgery.\n\n**Limitations**\nWe are not confident in the evidence because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting, and because the studies were very small.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023 of search.",

Additionally, several clarity issues could confuse readers: (1) the term \"glucocorticoid injection\" is used without explanation; (2) a long, dense sentence about participant characteristics makes the information hard to follow; (3) passive constructions such as \"The abstract does not provide details…\" obscure who performed the action; (4) nominalised language like \"treatment success\" reduces readability. Suggested rewrites are provided below. These issues, together with the high counts of passive voice (19, P90), nominalisations (32, BEYOND_P90) and nouns (203, BEYOND_P90) in the metrics, indicate the draft needs revision before approval.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft meets word‑count limits and has good active‑voice (88, P75) and pronoun use (32, P75). However, it deviates markedly from typical PLS patterns in passive voice (19, P90), nominalisation (32, BEYOND_P90), noun count (203, BEYOND_P90), and readability indices (SMOG 15.8, Dale‑Chall 8.3, etc.), indicating the text is more noun‑heavy and complex than usual. Addressing these metric outliers by reducing passive constructions, nominalisations, and long words will improve readability."
