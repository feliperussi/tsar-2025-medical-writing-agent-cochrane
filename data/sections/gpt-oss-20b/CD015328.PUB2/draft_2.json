  "draft": "Do school‑based activity programmes, diet changes, or a combination help prevent obesity (excess weight) in children aged 5‑11?\n\nKey messages\n– School‑based programmes that increase physical activity, either alone or together with healthier eating, can produce a modest drop in body‑mass index (BMI, a number that relates weight to height) over the short‑ to medium‑term.  \n– Adding dietary changes to activity programmes may give a slightly larger benefit, but the advantage does not usually last into the long‑term.  \n– The evidence is of low quality; we need more well‑designed, longer‑term studies that include homes, communities, children with disabilities and groups that experience health inequalities.\n\nWhy is preventing obesity in children aged 5‑11 a public health priority?  \nObesity – having too much body fat – is becoming common among school‑age children worldwide. Too much weight can cause breathing problems, low self‑esteem and early signs of diabetes now, and increase the risk of heart disease, type‑2 diabetes and other serious conditions later. These health problems can limit a child’s growth, learning and overall well‑being, so governments and health organisations view early obesity prevention as a top priority. The most common approaches are programmes that encourage healthier eating (more fruit and vegetables, fewer sugary drinks) and more physical activity (play, sport, less sitting and good sleep). Researchers are still unsure which approach, or which mix, works best over different time periods.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?  \nWe compared three types of prevention programmes – diet‑focused, activity‑focused and a combination of both – with doing nothing or usual care. We measured changes in BMI and the age‑adjusted version called zBMI (BMI expressed as a standard score). We also looked for serious adverse events (serious unwanted health problems). We examined results at short‑term (up to 9 months), medium‑term (9‑15 months) and long‑term (15 months or more) follow‑up.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?  \nWe searched the Cochrane database and other sources for randomised controlled trials that enrolled children aged 5‑11 and compared diet, activity or combined interventions with no intervention or usual care. We included studies that reported BMI, zBMI or serious adverse events at least 12 weeks after the start. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using standard GRADE criteria. The latest search was run in February 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?  \nWe identified 172 trials involving 189 707 children. Most studies were done in high‑income countries and delivered the programmes in schools (111 trials). Fewer trials took place in community settings, homes, clinics or by telehealth. The interventions fell into three groups: dietary‑only, physical‑activity‑only and combined diet‑and‑activity. Each group was compared with usual care or no intervention.\n\nOverall, dietary‑only programmes probably do not change children’s body weight in the short, medium or long term. Physical‑activity programmes probably do not change weight in the short or long term, but they may produce a small reduction in the medium term. Combined diet‑and‑activity programmes may lead to a slight reduction in weight in the short term and probably produce a small reduction in the medium term; they show little or no effect in the long term. Serious adverse events were reported rarely, and the certainty of the evidence about harms is very low.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?  \nWe have little confidence in these findings because the studies varied in participants, settings and how the programmes were delivered. Many studies were small, and some outcomes were reported by only a few trials. The evidence does not cover all children, especially those with disabilities, nor does it represent many low‑income settings. Because of these gaps, the overall certainty of the evidence is low.\n\nHow up‑to‑date is this review?  \nWe searched for relevant studies up to February 2023, so the evidence reflects research published before that date.",
