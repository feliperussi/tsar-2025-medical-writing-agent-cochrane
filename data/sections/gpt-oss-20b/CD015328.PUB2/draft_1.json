  "draft": "Do school‑based activity programs (exercise and movement), diet changes, or a combination of both help prevent obesity (excess weight) in children aged 5 to 11?\n\nKey messages:\n- School‑based programmes that increase physical activity (exercise and movement), either alone or together with dietary changes (healthier eating), can lead to a modest reduction in children’s body‑weight measures (such as body‑mass index, a calculation using height and weight) over the short‑ to medium‑term, whereas programmes that focus only on diet show little or no effect; serious adverse events (serious unwanted health problems) were rarely reported.\n- Combining activity with dietary changes may produce slightly larger improvements than activity alone in the short‑ and medium‑term, but the benefit does not appear to last into the long‑term; the overall evidence is limited and of low quality (studies with methodological limitations).\n- More high‑quality research (well‑designed studies) is needed that follows children for longer periods, includes diverse settings such as homes and communities, and evaluates effects on children with disabilities and on health inequalities (differences in health outcomes between groups), as well as any potential harms.\n\nIntroduction/Aims\nWhy is preventing obesity in children aged 5 to 11 a public health priority?\nObesity – having excess body fat – is becoming common among school‑age children worldwide. When children carry too much weight, it can hurt their health now (for example, causing breathing problems, low self‑esteem, or early signs of diabetes) and later in life (increasing the risk of heart disease, type‑2 diabetes, and other serious conditions). Because these effects can limit a child’s growth, learning and overall well‑being, governments and health organisations consider stopping obesity early on a top priority. The most common ways to try to prevent it are programmes that encourage healthier eating (like more fruits and vegetables and fewer sugary drinks) and more physical activity (including play, sport, less sitting, and good sleep). Researchers are still unsure which of these approaches, or a mix of them, works best, especially over different time periods.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors set out to compare the impact of three types of prevention programmes – (1) diet‑focused, (2) activity‑focused, and (3) combined diet‑and‑activity – against doing nothing or usual care. They measured whether these programmes changed children’s body‑mass index (BMI, a simple number that relates weight to height) or the age‑adjusted version called zBMI, and whether any serious side effects occurred. By looking at short‑term (up to 9 months), medium‑term (9‑15 months) and long‑term (15 months or more) results, the review aimed to determine which strategies, if any, modestly reduce obesity in children and whether they are safe.\n\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing diet, activity, or combined interventions for preventing obesity in children aged 5‑11 with no intervention or usual care, pooled results on BMI, zBMI and serious adverse events, and assessed confidence using standard criteria.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe identified 172 randomised controlled trials that included a total of 189,707 children, typically aged 5 to 11 years. Most participants were generally healthy school‑age children, and the studies were mainly carried out in high‑income countries, with schools being the most common setting (111 studies). Other settings included community locations, homes, clinical environments and one telehealth study. Intervention periods ranged from a single visit to up to four years, and most trials were funded by non‑industry sources. The interventions fell into three groups – dietary‑only, physical‑activity‑only, and combined diet‑and‑activity programmes – each compared with a control condition such as usual care.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that dietary‑only programmes probably make little or no difference to children’s body weight in the long term, and may have little or no effect in the short and medium term. Physical‑activity programmes also probably make little or no difference to body weight in the short and long term, but may produce a small reduction in the medium term. Combined diet‑and‑activity programmes may lead to a slight reduction in body weight in the short term and probably produce a small reduction in the medium term, while having little or no effect in the long term. Serious adverse events were rarely reported, and the certainty of the evidence about harms is very low.\n\nLimitations\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the program, because the evidence does not cover all the children or settings we are interested in, and because the studies were very small or there were not enough studies to be certain about the results.\n\nCurrency\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2023 of search.",

      "feedback": "The draft fails the critical style check that all subheadings must be phrased as questions. Headings such as \"Methods\", \"Results\", \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are not questions, which breaches the Master Style Guide. In addition, the text contains several clarity problems that would confuse readers: (1) long, dense sentences (average 32.8 words per sentence, far above the typical 19‑28 range); (2) excessive passive constructions (22 instances, well above the typical 9‑23 range); (3) noun‑heavy phrasing that reduces readability; and (4) missing question‑format subheadings. These issues, together with the metric deviations (high Flesch‑Kincaid grade 15.4, SMOG 14.7, Gunning Fog 21.2, LIX 62.4, many complex and long words), mean the PLS is harder to understand for a lay audience. The following concrete improvements are needed:\n\n1. Subheading format – change non‑question headings to questions, e.g., \"Methods\" → \"How did we find the evidence?\"; \"Results\" → \"What did we find?\"; \"Limitations\" → \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"; \"Currency\" → \"How up‑to‑date is this review?\".\n2. Break long sentences – e.g., rewrite \"Physical‑activity programmes also probably make little or no difference to body weight in the short and long term, but may produce a small reduction in the medium term.\" into two shorter sentences: \"Physical‑activity programmes probably make little or no difference to body weight in the short and long term. They may produce a small reduction in the medium term.\".\n3. Reduce passive voice – e.g., change \"The evidence is up to date to February 2023 of search.\" to \"We searched for studies up to February 2023.\".\n4. Simplify noun‑heavy phrasing – e.g., rewrite \"Overall, the evidence suggests that dietary‑only programmes probably make little or no difference to children’s body weight in the long term, and may have little or no effect in the short and medium term.\" to \"Overall, dietary‑only programmes probably do not change children’s body weight, either in the short, medium, or long term.\".\n5. Use more active verbs and fewer abstract nouns – e.g., replace \"The interventions fell into three groups – dietary‑only, physical‑activity‑only, and combined diet‑and‑activity programmes – each compared with a control condition such as usual care.\" with \"We grouped the interventions into three types: dietary‑only, physical‑activity‑only, and combined diet‑and‑activity. Each type was compared with usual care or no intervention.\".\n\nThese revisions will bring the PLS into line with the style guide, lower the readability scores to typical ranges, and make the summary clearer for patients and the public.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS is 786 words (within the 850‑word limit) but deviates from typical patterns on many metrics: words per sentence (32.8, BEYOND P90), passive voice (22, P90), nominalizations (23, P90), nouns (234, BEYOND P90), and readability indices (FK grade 15.4, SMOG 14.7, Gunning Fog 21.2, LIX 62.4) all far above the usual ranges for Cochrane plain language summaries. These metric outliers confirm the editorial observations of overly long, passive, and noun‑heavy sentences."
