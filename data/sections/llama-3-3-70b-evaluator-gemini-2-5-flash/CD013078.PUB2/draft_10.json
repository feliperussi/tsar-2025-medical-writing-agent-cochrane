  "draft": "Is exercise better than other treatments, such as injections or surgery, for improving pain and function in people with patellar tendinopathy (knee pain due to a problem with the tendon that connects the kneecap to the shinbone)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise (a type of physical activity designed to improve muscle strength) reduces pain (discomfort) compared to no treatment or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy, and the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer.\n- Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function (the ability to perform daily activities) or pain compared to steroid injections, but we need more research to understand this better, especially since the current studies only included athletes and not the general public.\n- Future research should focus on comparing strengthening exercise to other treatments, including placebo or sham interventions, and should measure important outcomes like adverse events (unwanted harmful effects) and long-term effects, to help us better understand what works best for people with patellar tendinopathy.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy and why is it a problem?\nPatellar tendinopathy is a common condition that affects the tendon at the front of the knee, causing pain. It is a problem because it can affect people's ability to participate in sports and other activities, and it can be difficult to treat. Common treatments for patellar tendinopathy include different types of exercise, such as strengthening and stretching, as well as other treatments like surgery and steroid injections.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out whether exercise is an effective treatment for patellar tendinopathy, and what the benefits and harms of exercise are compared to other treatments. We also wanted to know which types of exercise are most effective, and whether exercise can help people return to their normal activities, including sports.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched major medical databases for studies on this topic. To ensure we were fair and did not miss any important research, two of us worked separately to select the studies for inclusion. We then collected the important information from each study and compared their results to get an overall picture of the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because: \n- the studies included very few people; \n- people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, which can influence the results; \n- the results were not always fully reported or were not very precise.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found seven studies that involved 211 people with chronic patellar tendinopathy. The studies were conducted on athletes, with a mean age of 26 years and a mean duration of symptoms of about 3.5 years. Most participants were male (88%). The studies compared strengthening exercises to: \n- no treatment; \n- steroid injections; \n- surgery; or \n- other therapies.\n\nWhat were the main findings?\n- Compared to no treatment or surgery, we are very uncertain if exercise improves pain or function.\n- Compared to steroid injections, exercise may make little or no difference to pain or function.\nWe did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. Overall, we are very uncertain about the effects of strengthening exercise.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start, and the summary is well-structured and generally easy to read. However, a few key improvements are needed to enhance clarity and ensure the findings are presented with complete accuracy. Here are the top 3 areas to focus on:\n\n1. **Clarify the Main Findings by Separating Comparisons:** The current summary lumps together findings for 'no treatment' and 'surgery', which can be misleading as the certainty of evidence differs.\n   - **Quote:** \"Compared to no treatment or surgery, we are very uncertain if exercise improves pain or function.\"\n   - **Problem:** This is not entirely accurate. For the 'no treatment' comparison, the evidence on *function* is of 'low certainty' (suggesting exercise *may* make little difference), while all other outcomes in this sentence are 'very low certainty' ('very uncertain'). Combining them weakens the distinction.\n   - **Suggestion:** Separate the findings for clarity:\n     - **Compared to no treatment:** We are very uncertain if exercise improves pain. Exercise may make little or no difference to function.\n     - **Compared to surgery:** We are very uncertain if exercise improves pain or function.\n\n2. **Shorten Long, Complex Sentences:** Some key sentences are over 45 words long, which can be difficult for readers to follow. Breaking them into shorter, more direct sentences will improve readability.\n   - **Quote:** \"Future research should focus on comparing strengthening exercise to other treatments, including placebo or sham interventions, and should measure important outcomes like adverse events (unwanted harmful effects) and long-term effects, to help us better understand what works best for people with patellar tendinopathy.\"\n   - **Problem:** This 49-word sentence contains multiple ideas and is hard to digest in one go.\n   - **Suggestion:** Consider this rewrite: \"Future studies should compare strengthening exercise to other treatments, including placebos (sham treatments). They should also measure important outcomes like harmful effects and long-term results. This will help us learn what works best for people with patellar tendinopathy.\"\n\n3. **Replace Noun-Heavy Phrases with Action Verbs:** The text sometimes uses formal, noun-based phrases where simpler verbs would be clearer and more direct. This is also known as 'nominalization'.\n   - **Quote:** \"...two of us worked separately to select the studies for inclusion.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase 'select the studies for inclusion' is wordy. Using a direct verb is more concise.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite as: \"...two of us worked separately to select the studies.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found high numbers of complex words, long words, and nominalizations. Addressing these points will make the summary even more accessible to a lay audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns, with 44% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, the analysis highlights significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—nominalization, SMOG index, Dale-Chall complex words, complex words (3+ syllables), and long words (7+ characters)—are in the P90 range, indicating the text uses more noun-heavy phrases and complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This supports the editorial recommendation to simplify sentence structure and word choice."
