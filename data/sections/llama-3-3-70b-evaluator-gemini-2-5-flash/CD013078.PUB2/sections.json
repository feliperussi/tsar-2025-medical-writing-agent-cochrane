  "key_messages": [
    "We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise (a type of physical activity designed to improve muscle strength) reduces pain (discomfort) compared to no treatment or other treatments like injections or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy (a condition causing knee pain due to a problem with the tendon connecting the kneecap to the shinbone), and the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer.",
    "Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function (the ability to perform daily activities) or pain compared to other treatments, but we need more research to understand this better, especially since the current studies only included athletes and not the general public.",
    "Future research should focus on comparing strengthening exercise to other treatments, including placebo or sham interventions, and should measure important outcomes like adverse events (unwanted harmful effects) and long-term effects, to help us better understand what works best for people with patellar tendinopathy."

      "subheading": "What is patellar tendinopathy and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Patellar tendinopathy is a common condition that affects the tendon at the front of the knee, causing pain. It is a problem because it can affect people's ability to participate in sports and other activities, and it can be difficult to treat. Common treatments for patellar tendinopathy include different types of exercise, such as strengthening and stretching, as well as other treatments like surgery and glucocorticoid injections."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out whether exercise is an effective treatment for patellar tendinopathy, and what the benefits and harms of exercise are compared to other treatments. They also wanted to know which types of exercise are most effective, and whether exercise can help people return to their normal activities, including sports."

      "content": "We performed a systematic search of databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that compared exercise interventions with alternative treatments for patellar tendinopathy. Search terms combined synonyms for “patellar tendinopathy”, “jumpers knee”, “exercise”, “physiotherapy”, and “alternative treatment”. No date or language restrictions were applied."

      "subheading": "Study Selection",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, then full texts, applying predefined inclusion criteria: (1) participants diagnosed with patellar tendinopathy, (2) comparison of an exercise program with another therapeutic modality, and (3) reporting of clinical outcomes. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer."

      "content": "Data on participant characteristics, intervention details, comparator treatments, follow‑up duration, and outcome measures (e.g., VISA‑P score, pain VAS) were extracted into a standardized form. Results were summarized qualitatively, and where possible, meta‑analysis was performed using a random‑effects model."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found seven studies that involved 211 people with chronic patellar tendinopathy. The studies were conducted on athletes, with a mean age of 26 years and a mean duration of symptoms of 41.6 months. Most participants were male (88%). The studies compared strengthening exercises with no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, surgery, stretching exercise, or pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction. We did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. The duration of the studies was not explicitly stated, and there was no information on the funding sources or the countries in which the studies took place. Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to pain and function compared to no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, or surgery. It is unclear if strengthening exercise has an effect on treatment success and return to sport. We do not know if strengthening exercise has an effect on quality of life and adverse events."
    }
  ],
  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by very small sample sizes, potential performance bias because participants were likely aware of their assigned treatment, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and overall imprecision. These issues lead to low confidence in the effect estimates for strengthening exercise versus no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, and surgery.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to September 2023."
