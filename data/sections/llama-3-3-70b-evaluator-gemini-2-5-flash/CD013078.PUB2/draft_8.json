  "draft": "Is exercise better than other treatments, such as steroid injections or surgery, for improving pain and function in people with patellar tendinopathy (knee pain due to a problem with the tendon that connects the kneecap to the shinbone)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We are very uncertain if strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to no treatment or other treatments like steroid injections or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy.\n- Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function or pain compared to other treatments.\n- Future research should compare strengthening exercise to other treatments, including dummy (placebo) treatments, and measure important results like unwanted side effects and long-term effects.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy and why is it a problem?\nPatellar tendinopathy is a common condition that affects the tendon at the front of the knee, causing pain. It is a problem because it can affect people's ability to participate in sports and other activities, and it can be difficult to treat. Common treatments for patellar tendinopathy include different types of exercise, such as strengthening and stretching, as well as other treatments like surgery and steroid injections.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if exercise effectively treats patellar tendinopathy, and what the benefits and harms of exercise are compared to other treatments. We also wanted to know which types of exercise are most effective, and whether exercise can help people return to their normal activities, including sports.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched major medical databases for studies on this topic. To ensure we were fair and did not miss any important research, two of us worked separately to select the studies for inclusion. We then collected the important information from each study and compared their results to get an overall picture of the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nWe have low confidence in the results for several reasons. The studies included only a small number of people. In most studies, the people involved knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Also, the studies did not always report all their findings, and their results did not always agree with each other.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found seven studies that involved 211 people with chronic patellar tendinopathy. The studies were conducted on athletes, with a mean age of 26 years and a mean duration of symptoms of about 3.5 years. Most participants were male (88%). The studies compared strengthening exercises with no treatment, steroid injections, surgery, stretching exercise, or other therapies like ultrasound (using soundwaves for treatment) and a type of deep massage called transverse friction. We did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. Overall, we are very uncertain about the effects of strengthening exercise. When compared to no treatment or surgery, we are very uncertain if it improves pain or function. When compared to steroid injections, the evidence suggests exercise may make little or no difference.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for completeness, accuracy, and formatting. The readability scores are excellent. To make it even clearer for readers, I recommend focusing on these three improvements:\n\n**1. Break up the main findings into a more scannable format.** The 'What did we find?' section currently presents all the results in one dense paragraph, which can be hard for readers to follow.\n\n*   **Problem:** 'We found seven studies that involved 211 people with chronic patellar tendinopathy. The studies were conducted on athletes, with a mean age of 26 years and a mean duration of symptoms of about 3.5 years. Most participants were male (88%). The studies compared strengthening exercises with no treatment, steroid injections, surgery, stretching exercise, or other therapies like ultrasound (using soundwaves for treatment) and a type of deep massage called transverse friction. We did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. Overall, we are very uncertain about the effects of strengthening exercise. When compared to no treatment or surgery, we are very uncertain if it improves pain or function. When compared to steroid injections, the evidence suggests exercise may make little or no difference.'\n*   **Suggestion:** Separate the study details from the results, and use bullet points for the key findings. For example:\n    'We found seven studies with 211 people... The studies compared strengthening exercises to:\n    - no treatment;\n    - steroid injections;\n    - surgery; or\n    - other therapies.\n\n    **Main findings**\n    - Compared to no treatment or surgery, we are very uncertain if exercise improves pain or function.\n    - Compared to steroid injections, exercise may make little or no difference.'\n\n**2. Simplify the first key message to be more direct.** The first message contains a lot of information in one sentence, which can reduce its immediate impact.\n\n*   **Problem:** 'We are very uncertain if strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to no treatment or other treatments like steroid injections or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy.'\n*   **Suggestion:** Try rephrasing to put the main point first. For example: 'For people with patellar tendinopathy, we are very uncertain if strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to having no treatment, steroid injections, or surgery.'\n\n**3. Make the 'Limitations' section more direct and less wordy.** Some phrases could be more concise to state the limitations clearly.\n\n*   **Problem:** 'In most studies, the people involved knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results.'\n*   **Suggestion:** Use more direct language. For example: 'People in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge can influence the results.'\n\nThese changes will help make the key takeaways easier for readers to grasp quickly. The linguistic analysis supports this, noting a slightly higher number of long words than is typical, and simplifying some of these phrases will help address that.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 14 of 18 metrics (77.8%) falling into the best quartile for readability and plain language. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (10.73) are excellent. The only notable deviation is a higher-than-typical count of long words (7+ characters), which is in the 90th percentile. This suggests that while sentence structure is good, vocabulary could be simplified in places."
