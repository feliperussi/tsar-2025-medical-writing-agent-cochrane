  "draft": "Is exercise better than other treatments, such as injections or surgery, for improving pain and function in people with patellar tendinopathy (knee pain due to a problem with the tendon that connects the kneecap to the shinbone)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We are very uncertain if strengthening exercise (a type of physical activity designed to improve muscle strength) reduces pain compared to no treatment or other treatments like injections or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy.\n- Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function (the ability to perform daily activities) or pain compared to other treatments, but we need more research to understand this better, especially since the current studies only included athletes and not the general public.\n- Future research should focus on comparing strengthening exercise to other treatments, including placebo or sham interventions, and should measure important outcomes like adverse events (unwanted harmful effects) and long-term effects, to help us better understand what works best for people with patellar tendinopathy.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy and why is it a problem?\nPatellar tendinopathy is a common condition that affects the tendon at the front of the knee, causing pain. It is a problem because it can affect people's ability to participate in sports and other activities, and it can be difficult to treat. Common treatments for patellar tendinopathy include different types of exercise, such as strengthening and stretching, as well as other treatments like surgery and glucocorticoid injections.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether exercise is an effective treatment for patellar tendinopathy, and what the benefits and harms of exercise are compared to other treatments. They also wanted to know which types of exercise are most effective, and whether exercise can help people return to their normal activities, including sports.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched major medical databases for all relevant studies on this topic. Two people worked separately to select the appropriate studies to ensure we did not miss any. We then collected the important information from each study and compared their results to get an overall picture of the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nWe have low confidence in the results for several reasons. The studies included only a small number of people. In most studies, participants knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Finally, the results were not always fully reported and were inconsistent across the studies.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found seven studies that involved 211 people with chronic patellar tendinopathy. The studies were conducted on athletes, with a mean age of 26 years and a mean duration of symptoms of 41.6 months. Most participants were male (88%). The studies compared strengthening exercises with other approaches, such as no treatment, steroid injections, surgery, or other therapies like stretching. We did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. Overall, the evidence suggests that strengthening exercise may make little or no difference for pain and function compared to no treatment, steroid injections, or surgery. There was not enough information to know if exercise affected treatment success, return to sport, quality of life, or caused any unwanted effects.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft, but it needs some revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are an oversimplification of the key findings in the results section, which loses important nuance about the certainty of the evidence, and the use of vocabulary that is more complex than typical for a Plain Language Summary. Addressing these points will make the summary much clearer and more accurate for readers.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Clarify the Certainty of the Evidence in the Results Section:** The summary of findings combines results of different certainty levels, which could be misleading.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Overall, the evidence suggests that strengthening exercise may make little or no difference for pain and function compared to no treatment, steroid injections, or surgery.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This statement loses the crucial distinction between evidence where we are \"very uncertain\" (e.g., vs. surgery) and evidence that \"may make little or no difference\" (e.g., vs. injections). This makes the evidence sound more uniform and certain than it is.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence for strengthening exercise was not clear. For some comparisons, such as exercise versus no treatment or surgery, we are **very uncertain** about its effect on pain and function. For other comparisons, like exercise versus steroid injections, the evidence suggests it **may make little or no difference**.\"\n\n2. **Simplify Complex Vocabulary:** The text uses many long and complex words that make it difficult to read, as confirmed by the linguistic analysis.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Future research should focus on comparing strengthening exercise to other treatments, including placebo or sham interventions, and should measure important outcomes like adverse events (unwanted harmful effects) and long-term effects, to help us better understand what works best for people with patellar tendinopathy.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Words like 'interventions', 'adverse events', and the repeated use of 'patellar tendinopathy' increase the reading difficulty. While definitions are provided, simpler phrasing would be better.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future studies should compare strengthening exercise to other treatments, including dummy (placebo) treatments. They should also measure important results like unwanted side effects and long-term effects. This will help us better understand what works best for people with this type of knee pain.\"\n\n3. **Make the Limitations Section Easier to Understand:** The language used to describe the study limitations is quite technical.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"In most studies, participants knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Finally, the results were not always fully reported and were inconsistent across the studies.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like 'influenced the results' and 'inconsistent across the studies' are abstract. More direct language would be clearer for patients.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"In most studies, the people involved knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Also, the studies did not always report all their findings, and their results did not always agree with each other.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns for sentence structure, with average sentence length (19.8 words) and use of active voice falling within the median range. However, the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics—nouns, SMOG index, Dale-Chall complex words, general complex words, and long words—are in the P90 range, indicating the vocabulary is much more complex and noun-heavy than is typical for a PLS. This supports the editorial feedback to simplify word choices throughout the text to improve readability."
