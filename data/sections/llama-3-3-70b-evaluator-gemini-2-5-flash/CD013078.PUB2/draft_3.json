  "draft": "Is exercise better than other treatments, such as injections or surgery, for improving pain and function in people with patellar tendinopathy (knee pain due to a problem with the tendon that connects the kneecap to the shinbone)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We are very uncertain if strengthening exercise (a type of physical activity designed to improve muscle strength) reduces pain compared to no treatment or other treatments like injections or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy. The quality of the evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer.\n- Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function (the ability to perform daily activities) or pain compared to other treatments, but we need more research to understand this better, especially since the current studies only included athletes and not the general public.\n- Future research should focus on comparing strengthening exercise to other treatments, including placebo or sham interventions, and should measure important outcomes like adverse events (unwanted harmful effects) and long-term effects, to help us better understand what works best for people with patellar tendinopathy.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy and why is it a problem?\nPatellar tendinopathy is a common condition that affects the tendon at the front of the knee, causing pain. It is a problem because it can affect people's ability to participate in sports and other activities, and it can be difficult to treat. Common treatments for patellar tendinopathy include different types of exercise, such as strengthening and stretching, as well as other treatments like surgery and glucocorticoid injections.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether exercise is an effective treatment for patellar tendinopathy, and what the benefits and harms of exercise are compared to other treatments. They also wanted to know which types of exercise are most effective, and whether exercise can help people return to their normal activities, including sports.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched major medical databases for all relevant studies on this topic. Two people worked separately to select the appropriate studies to ensure we did not miss any. We then collected the important information from each study and compared their results to get an overall picture of the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nWe have low confidence in the results for several reasons. The studies included only a small number of people. In most studies, participants knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Finally, the results were not always fully reported and were inconsistent across the studies.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found seven studies that involved 211 people with chronic patellar tendinopathy. The studies were conducted on athletes, with a mean age of 26 years and a mean duration of symptoms of 41.6 months. Most participants were male (88%). The studies compared strengthening exercises with no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, surgery, stretching exercise, or pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction. We did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to pain and function compared to no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, or surgery. It is unclear if strengthening exercise has an effect on treatment success and return to sport. We do not know if strengthening exercise has an effect on quality of life and adverse events.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It's factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. My feedback focuses on making the language simpler and more direct for a patient audience, which will improve clarity. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing that the summary uses more complex and technical words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1.  **Simplify the list of technical treatments.**\n    *   **Problem:** The results section lists several technical treatments in a single sentence, which can be overwhelming for readers.\n    *   **Original sentence:** \"The studies compared strengthening exercises with no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, surgery, stretching exercise, or pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Replace technical terms with simpler ones and group less common therapies. For example: \"The studies compared strengthening exercises with other approaches, such as no treatment, steroid injections, surgery, or other therapies like stretching.\"\n\n2.  **Make the summary of findings easier to read.**\n    *   **Problem:** The paragraph summarizing the results is dense and repetitive, using similar phrases like \"may make little or no difference,\" \"it is unclear,\" and \"we do not know\" in quick succession.\n    *   **Original sentences:** \"Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to pain and function compared to no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, or surgery. It is unclear if strengthening exercise has an effect on treatment success and return to sport. We do not know if strengthening exercise has an effect on quality of life and adverse events.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Combine these findings into a more concise summary. For example: \"Overall, the evidence suggests that strengthening exercise may make little or no difference for pain and function compared to no treatment, steroid injections, or surgery. There was not enough information to know if exercise affected treatment success, return to sport, quality of life, or caused any unwanted effects.\"\n\n3.  **Make the first key message more concise.**\n    *   **Problem:** The first key message is a bit wordy because the second sentence repeats the idea of uncertainty already stated in the first.\n    *   **Original sentences:** \"We are very uncertain if strengthening exercise... reduces pain compared to no treatment or other treatments like injections or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy. The quality of the evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer.\"\n    *   **Suggestion:** Remove the second sentence. The phrase \"We are very uncertain\" is the standard way to communicate very low-certainty evidence, so the explanation isn't needed. The message becomes more direct: \"We are very uncertain if strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to no treatment or other treatments like injections or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While readability scores and sentence length are good (many falling in the best quartile), there is a significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Six metrics, including `complex_words`, `long_words`, `nominalization`, and `smog_index`, are in the P90 range. This indicates the text uses more complex, technical, and noun-heavy language than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which supports the need for simplification."
