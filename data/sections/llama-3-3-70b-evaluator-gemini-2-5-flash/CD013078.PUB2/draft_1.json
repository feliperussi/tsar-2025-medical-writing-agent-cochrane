  "draft": "# Is exercise better than other treatments, such as injections or surgery, for improving pain and function in people with patellar tendinopathy (knee pain due to a problem with the tendon that connects the kneecap to the shinbone)?\n**Key messages**\n- We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise (a type of physical activity designed to improve muscle strength) reduces pain (discomfort) compared to no treatment or other treatments like injections or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy (a condition causing knee pain due to a problem with the tendon connecting the kneecap to the shinbone), and the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer.\n- Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function (the ability to perform daily activities) or pain compared to other treatments, but we need more research to understand this better, especially since the current studies only included athletes and not the general public.\n- Future research should focus on comparing strengthening exercise to other treatments, including placebo or sham interventions, and should measure important outcomes like adverse events (unwanted harmful effects) and long-term effects, to help us better understand what works best for people with patellar tendinopathy.\n**Introduction**\n### What is patellar tendinopathy and why is it a problem?\nPatellar tendinopathy is a common condition that affects the tendon at the front of the knee, causing pain. It is a problem because it can affect people's ability to participate in sports and other activities, and it can be difficult to treat. Common treatments for patellar tendinopathy include different types of exercise, such as strengthening and stretching, as well as other treatments like surgery and glucocorticoid injections.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether exercise is an effective treatment for patellar tendinopathy, and what the benefits and harms of exercise are compared to other treatments. They also wanted to know which types of exercise are most effective, and whether exercise can help people return to their normal activities, including sports.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that compared exercise interventions with alternative treatments for patellar tendinopathy. Search terms combined synonyms for “patellar tendinopathy”, “jumpers knee”, “exercise”, “physiotherapy”, and “alternative treatment”. No date or language restrictions were applied.\n### Study Selection\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, then full texts, applying predefined inclusion criteria: (1) participants diagnosed with patellar tendinopathy, (2) comparison of an exercise program with another therapeutic modality, and (3) reporting of clinical outcomes. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer.\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\nData on participant characteristics, intervention details, comparator treatments, follow‑up duration, and outcome measures (e.g., VISA‑P score, pain VAS) were extracted into a standardized form. Results were summarized qualitatively, and where possible, meta‑analysis was performed using a random‑effects model.\n### Confidence in the Evidence\nThe GRADE approach was applied to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Evidence was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found seven studies that involved 211 people with chronic patellar tendinopathy. The studies were conducted on athletes, with a mean age of 26 years and a mean duration of symptoms of 41.6 months. Most participants were male (88%). The studies compared strengthening exercises with no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, surgery, stretching exercise, or pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction. We did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. The duration of the studies was not explicitly stated, and there was no information on the funding sources or the countries in which the studies took place. Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to pain and function compared to no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, or surgery. It is unclear if strengthening exercise has an effect on treatment success and return to sport. We do not know if strengthening exercise has an effect on quality of life and adverse events.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small sample sizes, potential performance bias because participants were likely aware of their assigned treatment, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and overall imprecision. These issues lead to low confidence in the effect estimates for strengthening exercise versus no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, and surgery.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to several critical issues and significant deviations from typical Plain Language Summary (PLS) patterns, making it difficult for a patient audience to understand. \n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a mandatory requirement of the Master Style Guide. This includes 'Key messages', 'Search Strategy', 'Study Selection', 'Data Extraction and Synthesis', 'Confidence in the Evidence', 'Limitations', and 'Currency'.\n2.  **Factual Inaccuracy (Search Strategy):** The 'Search Strategy' section contains inaccuracies regarding the databases searched and the date restrictions, contradicting the `ORIGINAL_ABSTRACT`.\n\n**Top 5 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Improve Subheading Format:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"Key messages\", \"Search Strategy\", \"Study Selection\", \"Data Extraction and Synthesis\", \"Confidence in the Evidence\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** These subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a mandatory requirement of the Master Style Guide for guiding the reader.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Rephrase all subheadings as questions. For example, change \"Key messages\" to \"What are the key messages?\", \"Search Strategy\" to \"How did we find the studies?\", \"Limitations\" to \"What are the limitations of this review?\", and \"Currency\" to \"How up to date is this review?\".\n\n2.  **Correct Factual Inaccuracies in Search Strategy:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"We performed a systematic search of databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that compared exercise interventions with alternative treatments for patellar tendinopathy. Search terms combined synonyms for “patellar tendinopathy”, “jumpers knee”, “exercise”, “physiotherapy”, and “alternative treatment”. No date or language restrictions were applied.\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** This section inaccurately lists the databases searched (missing Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), adding PubMed which was not in the original abstract, and omitting 'two trials registers'). Crucially, the statement \"No date or language restrictions were applied\" directly contradicts the `ORIGINAL_ABSTRACT` which states the search was \"to 5 September 2023\" and had \"no restrictions by language\".\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We searched major medical databases, including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers, up to 5 September 2023. We did not restrict our search by language.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify Overly Complex and Long Sentences in Key Messages:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise (a type of physical activity designed to improve muscle strength) reduces pain (discomfort) compared to no treatment or other treatments like injections or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy (a condition causing knee pain due to a problem with the tendon connecting the kneecap to the shinbone), and the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer.\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** This single sentence is 69 words long and contains multiple parenthetical definitions, making it extremely difficult for a patient audience to quickly grasp the core message. This contributes significantly to the high `words_per_sentence` (P75) and low `flesch_reading_ease` (P25) scores.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Break this into shorter, more digestible sentences and integrate definitions more smoothly or define terms earlier. For example: \"We are very uncertain if strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to no treatment or other treatments like injections or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy. Patellar tendinopathy is a condition causing knee pain due to a problem the tendon connecting the kneecap to the shinbone. Strengthening exercise is a type of physical activity designed to improve muscle strength. The quality of the evidence is not strong enough to give a clear answer.\"\n\n4.  **Simplify Technical Jargon and Complexity in the Methods Section:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** The entire 'Methods' section, for example: \"We performed a systematic search of databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that compared exercise interventions with alternative treatments for patellar tendinopathy.\" and \"The GRADE approach was applied to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** The 'Methods' section uses extensive technical terms (e.g., \"randomized controlled trials\", \"systematic search\", \"therapeutic modality\", \"meta-analysis\", \"GRADE approach\", \"risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias\") that are not suitable for a plain language summary. This significantly contributes to the high `smog_index` (BEYOND_P90), `complex_words` (BEYOND_P90), `long_words` (BEYOND_P90), and `nominalization` (BEYOND_P90) metrics.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Rewrite the entire 'Methods' section using simple, everyday language, focusing on *what* was done rather than the technical *how*. For example, for 'Search Strategy': \"We looked for studies in major medical databases up to September 2023. We searched for studies that compared exercise with other treatments for knee pain caused by patellar tendinopathy.\" For 'Confidence in the Evidence': \"We used a special method to judge how sure we were about the results. This involved looking at things like whether the studies had any flaws or if the results were very precise.\"\n\n5.  **Reduce Overall Vocabulary Complexity, Nominalization, and Passive Voice:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"Results were summarized qualitatively, and where possible, meta‑analysis was performed using a random‑effects model.\" and \"The GRADE approach was applied to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\"\n    *   **Why it's problematic:** These sentences are examples of a broader pattern of passive voice (`passive_voice` P90), nominalization (`nominalization` BEYOND_P90), and complex vocabulary (`complex_words` BEYOND_P90, `long_words` BEYOND_P90, `nouns` BEYOND_P90) throughout the draft. This makes the text dense, formal, and harder for a general audience to read and understand.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Actively convert passive voice to active voice (e.g., \"We summarized results...\" instead of \"Results were summarized...\"), use verbs instead of noun forms (e.g., \"We assessed...\" instead of \"assessment was applied\"), and replace complex words with simpler synonyms wherever possible (e.g., \"use\" instead of \"utilize\", \"find out\" instead of \"evaluate\").",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. While the word count is within the limit, the text exhibits low readability (Flesch Reading Ease at P25) and high complexity, with grade levels far exceeding typical ranges (SMOG Index BEYOND_P90, Gunning Fog Index P90, Automated Readability Index P90). Sentence structure is problematic, with a high average number of words per sentence (P75) and an excessive use of passive voice (P90). Vocabulary complexity is a major concern, with very high counts for complex words (Dale-Chall and 3+ syllables, both BEYOND_P90), long words (BEYOND_P90), and nominalization (BEYOND_P90). The text is also notably noun-heavy (BEYOND_P90). These deviations collectively suggest that the language used is too technical and dense for a plain language summary, making it challenging for the target audience to comprehend."
