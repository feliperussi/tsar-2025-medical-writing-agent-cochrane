  "draft": "Is exercise better than other treatments, such as steroid injections or surgery, for improving pain and function in people with patellar tendinopathy (knee pain due to a problem with the tendon that connects the kneecap to the shinbone)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- For people with patellar tendinopathy, we are very uncertain if strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to having no treatment, steroid injections, or surgery.\n- Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function or pain compared to other treatments.\n- Future research should compare strengthening exercise to other treatments, including dummy (placebo) treatments, and measure important results like unwanted side effects and long-term effects.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy and why is it a problem?\nPatellar tendinopathy is a common condition that affects the tendon at the front of the knee, causing pain. It is a problem because it can affect people's ability to participate in sports and other activities, and it can be difficult to treat. Common treatments for patellar tendinopathy include different types of exercise, such as strengthening and stretching, as well as other treatments like surgery and steroid injections.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if exercise effectively treats patellar tendinopathy, and what the benefits and harms of exercise are compared to other treatments. We also wanted to know which types of exercise are most effective, and whether exercise can help people return to their normal activities, including sports.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched major medical databases for studies on this topic. To ensure we were fair and did not miss any important research, two of us worked separately to select the studies for inclusion. We then collected the important information from each study and compared their results to get an overall picture of the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nThe evidence is limited by very small sample sizes, potential performance bias because participants were likely aware of their assigned treatment, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and overall imprecision. People in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. This knowledge can influence the results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found seven studies that involved 211 people with chronic patellar tendinopathy. The studies were conducted on athletes, with a mean age of 26 years and a mean duration of symptoms of about 3.5 years. Most participants were male (88%). The studies compared strengthening exercises to:\n- no treatment;\n- steroid injections;\n- surgery; or\n- other therapies.\n\nMain findings\n- Compared to no treatment or surgery, we are very uncertain if exercise improves pain or function.\n- Compared to steroid injections, exercise may make little or no difference.\n\nWe did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. Overall, we are very uncertain about the effects of strengthening exercise.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revision due to a critical factual inaccuracy and a few style issues that affect clarity. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Correct the summary of findings to reflect different levels of certainty.** The draft incorrectly groups all findings under 'very uncertain'. This misrepresents the review's conclusions, as some evidence was 'low-certainty' ('may make little or no difference'), which implies a different level of confidence.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"- For people with patellar tendinopathy, we are very uncertain if strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to having no treatment, steroid injections, or surgery.\" and \"- Compared to no treatment or surgery, we are very uncertain if exercise improves pain or function. - Compared to steroid injections, exercise may make little or no difference.\"\n   - **Reason:** The abstract shows the evidence against steroid injections is 'low-certainty', while the evidence against 'no treatment' or 'surgery' is 'very low-certainty'. The key messages and results must distinguish between these.\n   - **Suggested rewrite for Key Messages:** \"- We are very uncertain if strengthening exercise reduces pain or improves function compared to no treatment or surgery. - Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to pain or function compared to steroid injections.\"\n\n2. **Change all subheadings to be questions.** The style guide requires all subheadings to be phrased as questions to guide the reader. One subheading does not follow this rule.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Main findings\"\n   - **Reason:** This is a statement, not a question.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"What were the main findings?\"\n\n3. **Simplify complex vocabulary, especially in the limitations section.** The draft uses several long, technical words where simpler ones would be clearer for a lay audience. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of long words.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The evidence is limited by very small sample sizes, potential performance bias because participants were likely aware of their assigned treatment, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and overall imprecision.\"\n   - **Reason:** While accurate, terms like 'performance bias' and 'imprecision' are jargon. The explanation that follows is good, but the initial sentence is dense.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited because: - the studies included very few people; - people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting, which can influence the results; - the results were not always fully reported or were not very precise.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling in the best quartile. Readability, sentence length, and active voice are all strong. The primary deviation is a high count of long words (7+ characters), which is in the 90th percentile, suggesting some complex vocabulary could be simplified."
