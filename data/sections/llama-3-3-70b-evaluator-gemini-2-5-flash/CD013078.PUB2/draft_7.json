  "draft": "Is exercise better than other treatments, such as steroid injections or surgery, for improving pain and function in people with patellar tendinopathy (knee pain due to a problem with the tendon that connects the kneecap to the shinbone)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We are very uncertain if strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to no treatment or other treatments like steroid injections or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy.\n- Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function or pain compared to other treatments, but we need more research to understand this better, especially since the current studies only included athletes and not the general public.\n- Future research should compare strengthening exercise to other treatments, including dummy (placebo) treatments, and measure important results like unwanted side effects and long-term effects.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy and why is it a problem?\nPatellar tendinopathy is a common condition that affects the tendon at the front of the knee, causing pain. It is a problem because it can affect people's ability to participate in sports and other activities, and it can be difficult to treat. Common treatments for patellar tendinopathy include different types of exercise, such as strengthening and stretching, as well as other treatments like surgery and steroid injections.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if exercise effectively treats patellar tendinopathy, and what the benefits and harms of exercise are compared to other treatments. We also wanted to know which types of exercise are most effective, and whether exercise can help people return to their normal activities, including sports.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched major medical databases for studies on this topic. To ensure we were fair and did not miss any important research, two of us worked separately to select the studies for inclusion. We then collected the important information from each study and compared their results to get an overall picture of the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nWe have low confidence in the results for several reasons. The studies included only a small number of people. In most studies, the people involved knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Also, the studies did not always report all their findings, and their results did not always agree with each other.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found seven studies that involved 211 people with chronic patellar tendinopathy. The studies were conducted on athletes, with a mean age of 26 years and a mean duration of symptoms of about 3.5 years. Most participants were male (88%). The studies compared strengthening exercises with no treatment, steroid injections, surgery, stretching exercise, or pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction. We did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. Overall, we are very uncertain about the effects of strengthening exercise. When compared to no treatment or surgery, we are very uncertain if it improves pain or function. When compared to steroid injections, the evidence suggests exercise may make little or no difference.\n\nWe hope this summary helps you understand the current state of research on exercise for patellar tendinopathy. If you have any further questions or would like more information, please do not hesitate to ask.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that meets all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and length. However, a few key improvements are needed to ensure it is as clear as possible for a lay audience before approval.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Explain or simplify technical terms.** The results section includes medical jargon without explanation, which will confuse readers.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"...or pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Most people will not know what 'pulsed ultrasound' or 'transverse friction' are. All technical terms in a Plain Language Summary must be defined.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...or other therapies like ultrasound (using soundwaves for treatment) and a type of deep massage called transverse friction.\"\n\n2. **Remove the conversational closing paragraph.** The final paragraph is not standard for a Cochrane PLS and should be removed.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"We hope this summary helps you understand the current state of research on exercise for patellar tendinopathy. If you have any further questions or would like more information, please do not hesitate to ask.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This conversational closing is not part of the required structure for a Cochrane PLS. The summary should end with the 'How up to date is this review?' section.\n   - **Suggested action:** Please remove this final paragraph entirely.\n\n3. **Simplify the key messages.** One of the key messages combines a finding with a call for future research, making it less direct and clear.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function or pain compared to other treatments, but we need more research to understand this better, especially since the current studies only included athletes and not the general public.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Key messages should state the main findings as directly as possible. The need for more research and the limitation about athletes are important points, but they are better placed in the 'limitations' or 'results' sections, not combined into a single, complex key message.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to a person's ability to perform daily activities (function) or to their pain levels when compared to other treatments.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:**\nYour draft is very well-written and conforms well to typical PLS patterns. The feedback above is supported by the metrics, which show a high number of 'long_words' and a high 'smog_index'. Simplifying the technical term 'pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction' will directly help improve these scores and make the text easier for your audience to read.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft HIGHLY CONFORMS to typical PLS patterns, with 72.2% of features falling within the best quartile. The text has excellent sentence structure, with short sentences (words_per_sentence in P25) and strong use of active voice (P75). However, the analysis identified minor deviations related to vocabulary complexity. Specifically, the 'smog_index' (P90) and 'long_words' count (P90) are higher than typical, suggesting that some complex or long words could be simplified to improve readability for a lay audience."
