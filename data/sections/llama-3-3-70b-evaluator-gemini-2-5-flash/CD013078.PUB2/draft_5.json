  "draft": "Is exercise better than other treatments, such as injections or surgery, for improving pain and function in people with patellar tendinopathy (knee pain due to a problem with the tendon that connects the kneecap to the shinbone)?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We are very uncertain if strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to no treatment or other treatments like injections or surgery for people with patellar tendinopathy.\n- Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function or pain compared to other treatments, but we need more research to understand this better, especially since the current studies only included athletes and not the general public.\n- Future research should compare strengthening exercise to other treatments, including dummy (placebo) treatments, and measure important results like unwanted side effects and long-term effects.\n\nWhat is patellar tendinopathy and why is it a problem?\nPatellar tendinopathy is a common condition that affects the tendon at the front of the knee, causing pain. It is a problem because it can affect people's ability to participate in sports and other activities, and it can be difficult to treat. Common treatments for patellar tendinopathy include different types of exercise, such as strengthening and stretching, as well as other treatments like surgery and glucocorticoid injections.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether exercise is an effective treatment for patellar tendinopathy, and what the benefits and harms of exercise are compared to other treatments. They also wanted to know which types of exercise are most effective, and whether exercise can help people return to their normal activities, including sports.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched major medical databases for all relevant studies on this topic. Two people worked separately to select the appropriate studies to ensure we did not miss any. We then collected the important information from each study and compared their results to get an overall picture of the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this review?\nWe have low confidence in the results for several reasons. The studies included only a small number of people. In most studies, the people involved knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Also, the studies did not always report all their findings, and their results did not always agree with each other.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found seven studies that involved 211 people with chronic patellar tendinopathy. The studies were conducted on athletes, with a mean age of 26 years and a mean duration of symptoms of 41.6 months. Most participants were male (88%). The studies compared strengthening exercises with no treatment, glucocorticoid injection, surgery, stretching exercise, or pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction. We did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. The evidence for strengthening exercise was not clear. For some comparisons, such as exercise versus no treatment or surgery, we are very uncertain about its effect on pain and function. For other comparisons, like exercise versus steroid injections, the evidence suggests it may make little or no difference.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and factual accuracy have passed. However, a few minor revisions are needed to fully align with the style guide and enhance readability for a lay audience.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use \"We\" Consistently to Refer to the Review Authors.**\nThe style guide requires using the first person (\"we\"). The draft switches between third person (\"the review authors\") and first person, which can be confusing.\n- **Problematic Text:** \"What did the review authors want to find out? The review authors wanted to find out...\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out...\"\n\n2. **Simplify Clinical Phrasing and Numbers.**\nSome phrases are overly technical or precise for a plain language summary. Translating them into more common terms makes the information easier to understand.\n- **Problematic Text:** \"...with a mean duration of symptoms of 41.6 months.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"Mean duration of symptoms\" is clinical jargon, and \"41.6 months\" is difficult for readers to interpret quickly.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...who had, on average, experienced symptoms for about 3.5 years.\"\n\n3. **Replace Noun-Heavy Phrases with Active Verbs.**\nThe draft sometimes uses noun forms of verbs, which can make sentences longer and less direct. This pattern is reflected in the linguistic analysis.\n- **Problematic Text:** \"The review authors wanted to find out whether exercise is an effective treatment for patellar tendinopathy...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"is an effective treatment for\" is a wordy, noun-based construction.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if exercise effectively treats patellar tendinopathy...\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nThe need for the last two suggestions is supported by the PLS evaluation results, which show that 'long_words' and 'nominalization' (the use of noun-forms of verbs) are higher than in a typical PLS, falling into the P90 percentile range. Addressing these specific sentences will help bring the summary more in line with common PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 77.8% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability, sentence length, and voice. However, two metrics deviate from the typical range: 'nominalization' (use of noun-forms of verbs) and 'long_words' are higher than usual (P90), suggesting some vocabulary and phrasing could be simplified."
