  "draft": "Is favipiravir (an antiviral drug) effective for treating COVID-19?\n\nKey Messages\n- We are unsure if favipiravir is effective in treating COVID-19 due to a lack of robust evidence, and it may lead to an increase in adverse events (unwanted or harmful effects).\n- The review found that favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital, progression to oxygen therapy, or time to clinical improvement.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the uncertainties surrounding the use of favipiravir for COVID-19 treatment, including its potential benefits and harms, and the need for high-quality evidence to inform decision-making.\n\nWhat is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has been challenging healthcare systems and societies worldwide since its outbreak. The disease can lead to severe respiratory problems, and its impact has been felt globally. Common treatments for COVID-19 have included supportive care, such as rest, hydration, and oxygen therapy, as well as experimental antiviral treatments.\n\nWhat is favipiravir and how is it used in treating COVID-19?\nFavipiravir is an antiviral drug that has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19. It has been evaluated in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess its effectiveness in treating people with COVID-19. The drug is typically administered at a high dose on the first day, followed by a lower dose for several days. However, it is still unclear whether favipiravir has a definite role in treating COVID-19.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of favipiravir compared to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatments in people with acute COVID-19. They wanted to determine whether favipiravir reduces the risk of death, the need for hospital admission, the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, and the time to clinical improvement. They also sought to evaluate the safety of favipiravir and its potential to cause adverse events.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing favipiravir to other treatments for COVID-19, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 25 studies that involved 5750 adults with COVID-19. Most participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%) and were under 60 years of age. The studies were conducted in 13 countries including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. The duration of treatment varied from five to 14 days. Most trials (24 of 25) initiated favipiravir at 1600 mg or 1800 mg twice daily for the first day, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice a day. Twenty-two of the 25 trials investigated the role of favipiravir compared to placebo or standard of care, whilst lopinavir/ritonavir was the comparator in two trials, and umifenovir in one trial.\n\nWhat are the main results of favipiravir for COVID-19?\nFavipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital, the progression to oxygen therapy, or the time to clinical improvement for people with COVID-19. However, it may lead to an overall increased incidence of adverse events. The evidence is uncertain, and it is unclear if favipiravir has an effect on all-cause mortality, the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, or serious adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It's factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. The following suggestions focus on making the language more direct and easier for a lay audience to read by addressing a few key patterns identified in the linguistic analysis.\n\n**1. Replace complex noun phrases with simpler verbs.**\nSome sentences are long and rely on abstract nouns, which can be hard to follow. Using more direct verbs makes the meaning clearer.\n- **Original sentence:** \"Future research should focus on addressing the uncertainties surrounding the use of favipiravir for COVID-19 treatment, including its potential benefits and harms, and the need for high-quality evidence to inform decision-making.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This 38-word sentence is dense with abstract concepts like 'uncertainties', 'use', 'treatment', and 'decision-making'.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future research should explore the benefits and harms of using favipiravir to treat COVID-19. We need high-quality evidence to help people make informed decisions.\"\n\n**2. Change passive voice to active voice.**\nThe draft often uses passive constructions like \"it was found\" instead of active ones like \"we found\". Active voice is more direct and easier to understand.\n- **Original sentences:** \"Favipiravir is an antiviral drug that has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19. It has been evaluated in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs)...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The passive voice obscures who is doing the action (who suggested? who evaluated?).\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Some experts have suggested the antiviral drug favipiravir as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Researchers have evaluated it in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs)...\"\n\n**3. Simplify technical details in the results.**\nThe results section includes specific details about study design that are not essential for a lay reader and increase the text's complexity.\n- **Original sentence:** \"Most trials (24 of 25) initiated favipiravir at 1600 mg or 1800 mg twice daily for the first day... whilst lopinavir/ritonavir was the comparator in two trials, and umifenovir in one trial.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Specific drug dosages and the names of comparator drugs are technical jargon that can overwhelm readers without adding to their understanding of the main findings.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Most studies compared favipiravir to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or the usual standard of care. A few studies compared it to other antiviral drugs. Treatment usually started with a high dose on the first day, followed by lower doses for one to two weeks.\"\n\nAddressing these points will help improve clarity by reducing the use of passive voice, complex words, and nominalizations, which were flagged as areas for improvement in the linguistic analysis.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While half of the metrics fall within the best quartile for readability, a significant portion (39%) deviate from typical patterns. These deviations, particularly the high use of passive voice, nominalizations (noun-form verbs), and complex/long words, indicate that the text is less direct and uses more complex vocabulary than a typical Plain Language Summary, which can create barriers for a lay audience."
