  "draft": "# Is favipiravir (an antiviral drug) effective for treating COVID-19?\n**Key Messages**\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether favipiravir is effective in treating COVID-19, and it may lead to an increase in adverse events (unwanted or harmful effects).\n- The review found that favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital, progression to oxygen therapy, or time to clinical improvement.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the uncertainties surrounding the use of favipiravir for COVID-19 treatment, including its potential benefits and harms, and the need for high-quality evidence to inform decision-making.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has been challenging healthcare systems and societies worldwide since its outbreak. The disease can lead to severe respiratory problems, and its impact has been felt globally. Common treatments for COVID-19 have included supportive care, such as rest, hydration, and oxygen therapy, as well as experimental antiviral treatments.\nWhat is favipiravir and how is it used in treating COVID-19?\nFavipiravir is an antiviral drug that has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19. It has been evaluated in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess its effectiveness in treating people with COVID-19. The drug is typically administered at a high dose on the first day, followed by a lower dose for several days. However, it is still unclear whether favipiravir has a definite role in treating COVID-19.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of favipiravir compared to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatments in people with acute COVID-19. They wanted to determine whether favipiravir reduces the risk of death, the need for hospital admission, the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, and the time to clinical improvement. They also sought to evaluate the safety of favipiravir and its potential to cause adverse events.\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing favipiravir to other treatments for COVID-19, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 25 studies that involved 5750 adults with COVID-19. Most participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%) and were under 60 years of age. The studies were conducted in 13 countries including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. The duration of treatment varied from five to 14 days. Most trials (24 of 25) initiated favipiravir at 1600 mg or 1800 mg twice daily for the first day, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice a day. Twenty-two of the 25 trials investigated the role of favipiravir compared to placebo or standard of care, whilst lopinavir/ritonavir was the comparator in two trials, and umifenovir in one trial.\nMain results: Favipiravir for COVID-19\nFavipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital, the progression to oxygen therapy, or the time to clinical improvement for people with COVID-19. However, it may lead to an overall increased incidence of adverse events. The evidence is uncertain, and it is unclear if favipiravir has an effect on all-cause mortality, the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, or serious adverse events.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023.",

The 'Methods' and 'Main results: Favipiravir for COVID-19' subheadings are not phrased as questions, which violates the Master Style Guide. Additionally, the text frequently uses passive voice and complex vocabulary, making it less accessible for a patient audience. Wordy phrases also detract from conciseness.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that while sentence length and overall Flesch Reading Ease are within typical ranges (P25/P75), several key metrics deviate significantly. Specifically, 'passive_voice' (22.0, P90) and 'nominalization' (24.0, P90) are beyond the 90th percentile, suggesting an overuse of passive constructions and noun forms of verbs. Vocabulary complexity is also a concern, with 'smog_index' (14.7, P90), 'complex_words_dc' (245.0, P90), 'complex_words' (127.0, P90), and 'long_words' (190.0, P90) all falling into the P90 range, indicating the presence of more technical and longer words than typically found in Plain Language Summaries. These deviations highlight areas where the text could be made clearer and simpler for the target audience."
