  "draft": "Is favipiravir (an antiviral drug) effective for treating COVID-19?\n\nKey Messages\n- We are unsure if favipiravir works for COVID-19 because we lack robust evidence, and it may cause more unwanted or harmful effects.\n- Researchers found that favipiravir may not make a difference in whether people need to go to the hospital, need oxygen therapy, or recover from COVID-19.\n- We need more research to understand the benefits and harms of using favipiravir to treat COVID-19 and to get high-quality evidence to inform decisions.\n\nWhat is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (a type of virus). It has been challenging healthcare systems and societies worldwide since its outbreak. COVID-19 can lead to severe respiratory problems, and its impact has been felt globally. Common treatments for COVID-19 include supportive care, such as rest, hydration, and oxygen therapy, as well as experimental antiviral treatments.\n\nWhat is favipiravir and how is it used in treating COVID-19?\nSome experts have suggested the antiviral drug favipiravir as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Researchers have evaluated it in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (a type of scientific study) to assess its effectiveness in treating people with COVID-19. The drug is typically administered at a high dose on the first day, followed by a lower dose for several days. However, it is still unclear whether favipiravir has a definite role in treating COVID-19.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of favipiravir compared to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatments in people with acute COVID-19. They wanted to determine whether favipiravir reduces the risk of death, the need for hospital admission, the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (a life-support treatment), and the time to clinical improvement. They also sought to evaluate the safety of favipiravir and its potential to cause adverse events (unwanted or harmful effects).\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing favipiravir to other treatments for COVID-19, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 25 studies that involved 5750 adults with COVID-19. Most participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%) and were under 60 years of age. The studies were conducted in 13 countries including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. Most studies compared favipiravir to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or the usual standard of care. A few studies compared it to other antiviral drugs. Treatment usually started with a high dose on the first day, followed by lower doses for one to two weeks.\n\nWhat are the main results of favipiravir for COVID-19?\nFavipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital, the progression to oxygen therapy, or the time to clinical improvement for people with COVID-19. However, it may lead to an overall increased incidence of adverse events. The evidence is uncertain, and it is unclear if favipiravir has an effect on all-cause mortality (death from any cause), the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, or serious adverse events.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023.\n\nFuture research should explore the benefits and harms of using favipiravir to treat COVID-19. We need high-quality evidence to help people make informed decisions.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that is well-structured and factually accurate. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and accuracy have passed. The main opportunity for improvement is to simplify the vocabulary and sentence structures to make the summary more accessible to a general audience, which is reflected in the linguistic analysis. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace formal words with simpler, everyday alternatives.** Some of the word choices are more clinical than necessary for a lay audience.\n   - **Quote:** \"The drug is typically administered at a high dose on the first day...\"\n   - **Problem:** \"Administered\" is a formal, clinical term. A simpler word would be more direct and easier to understand.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"People usually take a high dose on the first day...\"\n\n2. **Use verbs instead of complex noun phrases (nominalizations).** Sentences are often clearer when they use a direct verb instead of turning an action into a noun.\n   - **Quote:** \"However, it may lead to an overall increased incidence of adverse events.\"\n   - **Problem:** The phrase \"increased incidence of\" is wordy and abstract. Using a simple verb makes the meaning more immediate.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"However, it may cause more adverse events overall.\"\n\n3. **Clarify research-specific jargon.** Terms that are common in research may not be clear to patients and the public.\n   - **Quote:** \"We are unsure if favipiravir works for COVID-19 because we lack robust evidence...\"\n   - **Problem:** \"Robust evidence\" is a technical term. Readers may not understand what makes evidence 'robust'.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We are unsure if favipiravir works for COVID-19 because the evidence we have is not strong enough.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your draft is strong on many structural elements like sentence length. However, the suggestions above are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found that the text deviates from typical PLS patterns in 6 different metrics related to vocabulary complexity. For example, the number of complex words, long words, and nominalizations are all higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows a mixed profile. While the draft conforms well on structural metrics like sentence length (words_per_sentence: P25) and active voice usage (active_voice: P75), it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns on vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics fall into the P90 range, indicating higher-than-usual complexity. These include 'nominalization' (25.0), 'complex_words' (125.0), 'long_words' (191.0), and the 'smog_index' (14.49). This suggests the primary area for revision is simplifying word choice and reducing the use of noun-heavy phrases."
