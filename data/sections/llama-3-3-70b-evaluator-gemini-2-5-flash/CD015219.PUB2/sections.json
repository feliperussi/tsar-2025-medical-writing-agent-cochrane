  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether favipiravir is effective in treating COVID-19, and it may lead to an increase in adverse events (unwanted or harmful effects).",
    "The review found that favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital, progression to oxygen therapy, or time to clinical improvement.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the uncertainties surrounding the use of favipiravir for COVID-19 treatment, including its potential benefits and harms, and the need for high-quality evidence to inform decision-making."

      "content": "COVID-19 is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has been challenging healthcare systems and societies worldwide since its outbreak. The disease can lead to severe respiratory problems, and its impact has been felt globally. Common treatments for COVID-19 have included supportive care, such as rest, hydration, and oxygen therapy, as well as experimental antiviral treatments."

      "subheading": "What is favipiravir and how is it used in treating COVID-19?",
      "content": "Favipiravir is an antiviral drug that has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19. It has been evaluated in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess its effectiveness in treating people with COVID-19. The drug is typically administered at a high dose on the first day, followed by a lower dose for several days. However, it is still unclear whether favipiravir has a definite role in treating COVID-19."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to assess the effects of favipiravir compared to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatments in people with acute COVID-19. They wanted to determine whether favipiravir reduces the risk of death, the need for hospital admission, the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, and the time to clinical improvement. They also sought to evaluate the safety of favipiravir and its potential to cause adverse events."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 25 studies that involved 5750 adults with COVID-19. Most participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%) and were under 60 years of age. The studies were conducted in 13 countries including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. The duration of treatment varied from five to 14 days. Most trials (24 of 25) initiated favipiravir at 1600 mg or 1800 mg twice daily for the first day, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice a day. Twenty-two of the 25 trials investigated the role of favipiravir compared to placebo or standard of care, whilst lopinavir/ritonavir was the comparator in two trials, and umifenovir in one trial."

      "content": "Favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital, the progression to oxygen therapy, or the time to clinical improvement for people with COVID-19. However, it may lead to an overall increased incidence of adverse events. The evidence is uncertain, and it is unclear if favipiravir has an effect on all-cause mortality, the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, or serious adverse events."
