  "draft": "Is favipiravir (an antiviral drug) effective for treating COVID-19?\n\nKey Messages\n- We are uncertain if favipiravir is an effective treatment for COVID-19 because the evidence is not strong enough.\n- Favipiravir may cause more side effects than placebo or standard care.\n- We need more research to understand the benefits and harms of using favipiravir to treat COVID-19 and to get high-quality evidence to inform decisions.\n\nWhat is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?\nCOVID-19 is an illness caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2 (a type of coronavirus). It has been challenging healthcare systems and societies worldwide since its outbreak. COVID-19 can lead to severe respiratory problems, and its impact has been felt globally. Common treatments for COVID-19 include supportive care, such as rest, hydration, and oxygen therapy, as well as experimental antiviral treatments.\n\nWhat is favipiravir and how is it used in treating COVID-19?\nFavipiravir is an antiviral drug that researchers have tested to see if it is an effective treatment for people with COVID-19. People usually take a high dose on the first day, followed by a lower dose for several days.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to see how well favipiravir worked for people with COVID-19 compared to no treatment, standard care (the usual care given to people with COVID-19), or other antiviral drugs. We wanted to find out if favipiravir, compared to other treatments, could reduce the risk of death, prevent people from needing to go to the hospital, stop the illness from getting worse and requiring a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation), or help people get better faster.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing favipiravir to other treatments for COVID-19, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nResearchers conducted 25 studies that involved 5750 adults with COVID-19. Most participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate disease and were under 60 years of age. These studies were conducted in 13 countries, including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. The duration of treatment varied from five to 14 days.\n\nWhat are the main results of favipiravir for COVID-19?\nFavipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital, the progression to oxygen therapy, or how quickly people recover from COVID-19. However, it may cause more side effects. We are not sure if favipiravir reduces the risk of dying from any cause, needing a breathing machine, or having other serious side effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. These factors can make the results less reliable. Not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very clear and well-structured draft, but it needs a few revisions to be approved. The main issue is a subtle but important inaccuracy in how the results for serious side effects are described. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **More accurately state the findings for 'serious side effects'.** The evidence for this outcome was low-certainty, not very low-certainty. Your summary should reflect that distinction.\n    *   **Problem:** 'We are not sure if favipiravir reduces the risk of... having other serious side effects.' This phrasing implies very low-certainty evidence, which is the case for mortality, but not for serious side effects.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Revise the sentence to distinguish between the findings. For example: 'We are not sure if favipiravir reduces the risk of dying or needing a breathing machine, but it may make little to no difference in the number of serious side effects.'\n\n2. **Explain key terms when they first appear.** The term 'placebo' is used in the Key Messages but isn't defined, which could confuse readers who are unfamiliar with clinical trials.\n    *   **Problem:** 'Favipiravir may cause more side effects than placebo or standard care.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Briefly explain the term. For example: 'Favipiravir may cause more side effects than a placebo (a dummy treatment) or standard care.'\n\n3. **Use active voice more consistently.** The draft contains several passive constructions, which can make the text less direct. The style guide recommends using active voice.\n    *   **Problem:** 'These studies were conducted in 13 countries...'\n    *   **Suggestion:** Change to active voice. For example: 'The studies took place in 13 countries...' or 'Researchers ran the studies in 13 countries...'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the typical median or best quartile ranges for readability, sentence structure, and vocabulary. For example, the average words per sentence (16.9) and Flesch-Kincaid grade level (8.9) are in the best quartile (P25), indicating excellent readability. No metrics show significant deviation."
