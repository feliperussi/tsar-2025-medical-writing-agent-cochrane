  "draft": "Is favipiravir (an antiviral drug) effective for treating COVID-19?\n\nKey Messages\n- We are unsure if favipiravir works for COVID-19 because the evidence is not strong enough, and it may cause more side effects.\n- Researchers found that favipiravir may not make a difference in whether people need to go to the hospital, need oxygen therapy, or recover from COVID-19.\n- We need more research to understand the benefits and harms of using favipiravir to treat COVID-19 and to get high-quality evidence to inform decisions.\n\nWhat is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?\nCOVID-19 is an illness caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2 (a type of coronavirus). It has been challenging healthcare systems and societies worldwide since its outbreak. COVID-19 can lead to severe respiratory problems, and its impact has been felt globally. Common treatments for COVID-19 include supportive care, such as rest, hydration, and oxygen therapy, as well as experimental antiviral treatments.\n\nWhat is favipiravir and how is it used in treating COVID-19?\nFavipiravir is an antiviral drug that has been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Researchers have evaluated it in several randomized controlled trials (a type of scientific study where participants are randomly assigned to different groups) to assess its effectiveness in treating people with COVID-19. People usually take a high dose on the first day, followed by a lower dose for several days. However, it is still unclear whether favipiravir has a definite role in treating COVID-19.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to see how well favipiravir worked for people with COVID-19 compared to no treatment, standard care, or other antiviral drugs. We wanted to find out if favipiravir, compared to other treatments, could reduce the risk of death, prevent people from needing to go to the hospital, stop the illness from getting worse and requiring a breathing machine (mechanical ventilation), or help people get better faster.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing favipiravir to other treatments for COVID-19, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 25 studies that involved 5750 adults with COVID-19. Most participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate disease and were under 60 years of age. The studies were conducted in several countries. Most studies compared favipiravir to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or the usual standard of care. Treatment usually started with a high dose on the first day, followed by lower doses for one to two weeks.\n\nWhat are the main results of favipiravir for COVID-19?\nFavipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital, the progression to oxygen therapy, or the time to clinical improvement for people with COVID-19. However, it may cause more side effects overall. We are not sure if favipiravir reduces the risk of dying from any cause, needing a breathing machine, or having other serious harmful effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and in some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting. This can affect the results. Not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2023.\n\nFuture research should explore the benefits and harms of using favipiravir to treat COVID-19. We need high-quality evidence to help people make informed decisions.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, well-structured, and meets all critical requirements. It is very close to being approved. The main reason for this revision request is to simplify some of the vocabulary to make it more accessible to a wider audience. Addressing the 3 points below will make this an excellent Plain Language Summary.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Words and Phrases**\n\nSome of the wording is more formal than it needs to be. Using simpler, more direct language will make the summary easier to read.\n\n- **Quote:** \"Researchers have evaluated it in several randomized controlled trials... to assess its effectiveness in treating people with COVID-19.\"\n- **Problem:** The words \"evaluated\" and \"assess its effectiveness\" are quite formal.\n- **Suggestion:** \"Researchers studied it in several randomized controlled trials... to see how well it works for people with COVID-19.\"\n\n- **Quote:** \"...it is still unclear whether favipiravir has a definite role in treating COVID-19.\"\n- **Problem:** The phrase \"definite role\" is abstract and a bit vague for a lay reader.\n- **Suggestion:** \"...it is still unclear if favipiravir is a useful treatment for COVID-19.\"\n\n**2. Clarify and Standardize the Term for 'Side Effects'**\n\nThe draft uses both \"side effects\" and \"harmful effects,\" which could be confusing. It's best to define the term clearly once and then use it consistently.\n\n- **Quote:** \"...it may cause more side effects.\" (from Key Messages) and \"...having other serious harmful effects.\" (from Main Results).\n- **Problem:** Using different terms for the same concept can make readers wonder if they mean different things.\n- **Suggestion:** In the first Key Message, introduce the term clearly: \"...and it may cause more unwanted or harmful effects (side effects).\" Then, use the simpler term \"side effects\" consistently throughout the rest of the summary.\n\n**3. Briefly Explain the Term 'Standard of Care'**\n\nWhile common in medical writing, \"standard of care\" can be unclear to the public.\n\n- **Quote:** \"Most studies compared favipiravir to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or the usual standard of care.\"\n- **Problem:** Readers may not know what \"standard of care\" includes.\n- **Suggestion:** Add a brief, simple explanation. For example: \"...or the usual care given to people with COVID-19 (known as 'standard of care').\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence:\n\nYour draft is very readable overall, but the suggestions above are supported by the linguistic analysis. The evaluation found that the number of complex words ('complex_words_dc') and long words ('long_words') was higher than in 90% of typical summaries. Making the suggested changes will help bring these metrics in line and improve overall clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 88.9% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. However, two vocabulary-related metrics, 'complex_words_dc' (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words) and 'long_words', are in the P90 range. This indicates that the vocabulary is more complex and uses longer words than is typical for a PLS, suggesting that simplifying word choice is the most effective way to improve the summary."
