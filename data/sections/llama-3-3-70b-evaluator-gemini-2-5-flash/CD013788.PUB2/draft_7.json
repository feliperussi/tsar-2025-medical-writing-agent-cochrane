  "draft": "Is it better to remove the urinary catheter early or later to prevent infections after a kidney transplant?\n\nKey messages:\n- We are not sure if removing the catheter early or late after a kidney transplant makes a difference in preventing infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), because there is not enough good-quality evidence.\n- The studies we found had significant limitations, such as short follow-up periods and a high risk of bias (flaws in the study methods that could create misleading results), which means we cannot trust the findings completely.\n- Future high-quality studies should compare removing the catheter early versus removing it late and follow patients for longer to provide clearer guidance for doctors and patients.\n\nWhat is kidney transplantation and why is it important?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for end-stage kidney disease. During the operation, a catheter (a small tube) is inserted into the bladder to allow it to drain and promote healing. However, urinary catheters can cause infections in patients, which can lead to a urinary tract infection (UTI).\n\nWhat are the risks associated with urinary catheters after kidney transplantation?\nThe longer the catheter remains in place, the greater the risk of developing a UTI. We wanted to know if the timing of removing the catheter affects the risk of UTIs and other problems after surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to compare patients who had their catheter removed early (less than 5 days after transplant surgery) to those who had it removed late (5 days or more after the transplant). They wanted to see if the timing made a difference to several outcomes. These included UTIs with symptoms, bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), and serious urinary problems like leaks or blockages.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared early versus late removal of urinary catheters after kidney transplantation. We then summarized the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies involving 197 people who had a kidney transplant. The duration of the studies was short, with no patients followed beyond one month. Due to the limited number of studies and their poor quality, we cannot say for sure if early or late catheter removal makes a difference in preventing infections.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting. Not all studies provided data on everything we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is current up to April 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very clear and well-written summary that meets all critical requirements for accuracy, completeness, and formatting. The feedback below focuses on 3 minor refinements to enhance readability even further.\n\n1. **Simplify long sentences in key messages.** One of the key messages is a long, complex sentence that could be challenging for readers. Breaking it into two shorter sentences will improve clarity.\n    - **Quote:** \"The studies we found had significant limitations, such as short follow-up periods and a high risk of bias (flaws in the study methods that could create misleading results), which means we cannot trust the findings completely.\"\n    - **Why it's problematic:** At 36 words, this sentence combines the problem (limitations), examples (follow-up, bias), and the conclusion (cannot trust findings), which is a lot to process at once.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies we found had significant limitations, so we cannot trust the findings completely. For example, they followed patients for only a short time and had a high risk of bias (flaws in the study methods that could create misleading results).\"\n\n2. **Use a consistent first-person voice ('we').** The summary correctly uses \"we\" in most sections, but switches to the more formal \"the review authors\" in one place. Using \"we\" consistently makes the text more direct and personal.\n    - **Quote:** \"The review authors aimed to compare patients who had their catheter removed early...\"\n    - **Why it's problematic:** This switches from the personal tone (\"How did we find the evidence?\") to a more distant, third-person tone, which can feel inconsistent for the reader.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We aimed to compare patients who had their catheter removed early...\"\n\n3. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** The linguistic analysis shows a high number of 'nominalizations' (verbs turned into nouns). Changing these back into verbs makes sentences more active and easier to read.\n    - **Quote:** \"They wanted to see if the timing made a difference to several outcomes. These included UTIs with symptoms, bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), and serious urinary problems like leaks or blockages.\"\n    - **Why it's problematic:** The phrasing is slightly indirect. A more active construction can connect the action (comparing timing) to the outcomes more clearly.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to see if the timing of catheter removal affected outcomes like UTIs with symptoms, bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), and other serious urinary problems.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with an excellent 94.4% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. The sentence length and use of active voice are very good. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is higher than typical (P90), suggesting that some sentences could be more direct and verb-driven to improve flow."
