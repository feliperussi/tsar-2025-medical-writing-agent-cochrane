  "draft": "Is it better to remove the urinary catheter early or later to prevent infections after a kidney transplant?\n\nKey messages:\n- We are not sure if removing the catheter early or late after a kidney transplant makes a difference in preventing infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), because there is not enough good-quality evidence.\n- The studies we found had significant limitations, such as short follow-up periods and a high risk of bias, which means we cannot trust the results completely.\n- Future high-quality studies should compare removing the catheter early versus removing it late and follow patients for longer to provide clearer guidance for doctors and patients.\n\nWhat is kidney transplantation and why is it important?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for end-stage kidney disease. During the operation, a catheter (a small tube) is inserted into the bladder to allow it to drain and promote healing. However, urinary catheters can pose an infection risk to patients, potentially resulting in a urinary tract infection (UTI).\n\nWhat are the risks associated with urinary catheters after kidney transplantation?\nThe longer the catheter remains in place, the greater the risk of developing a UTI. We wanted to know if the timing of removing the catheter affects the risk of UTIs and other problems after surgery.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to compare patients who had their catheter removed early (less than 5 days after transplant surgery) to those who had it removed late (5 days or more after the transplant). They wanted to see if the timing made a difference to several outcomes. These included UTIs with symptoms, bacteria in the urine without symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria), and serious urinary problems like leaks or blockages.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared early versus late removal of urinary catheters after kidney transplantation. We then summarized the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies involving 197 people who had a kidney transplant. The duration of the studies was short, with no patients followed beyond one month. Due to the limited number of studies and their poor quality, we cannot say for sure if early or late catheter removal makes a difference in preventing infections.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and it is possible that the people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. Not all studies provided data on everything we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is current up to April 2023.",

The following 3 suggestions will help make it even more direct for readers.\n\n1. **Explain the term 'risk of bias' for better understanding.**\n   - **The issue:** The key messages mention a 'high risk of bias' without explaining what it means for the reader.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"- The studies we found had significant limitations, such as short follow-up periods and a high risk of bias, which means we cannot trust the results completely.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Add a simple, parenthetical definition so readers understand why the evidence is weak. For example: \"...a high risk of bias (flaws in the study methods that could create misleading results), which means we cannot trust the findings completely.\"\n\n2. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun-heavy phrases.**\n   - **The issue:** The text sometimes uses formal, noun-based phrases where simpler verbs would be clearer. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of 'nominalizations'.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"However, urinary catheters can pose an infection risk to patients, potentially resulting in a urinary tract infection (UTI).\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace the noun phrase with a direct verb. For example: \"However, urinary catheters can cause infections in patients, which can lead to a urinary tract infection (UTI).\"\n\n3. **Improve clarity in the 'Limitations' section.**\n   - **The issue:** The explanation for one of the limitations is a bit wordy and indirect.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"...it is possible that the people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase this more directly to be clearer. For example: \"...people in the studies may have known which treatment they were getting, which can influence the results.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns in most areas, with 94% of metrics falling in the best quartile. Key strengths include short sentences and good use of active voice. However, the text deviates significantly in its use of nominalizations (noun-heavy phrases), which is in the top 10th percentile for complexity and should be addressed to improve clarity."
