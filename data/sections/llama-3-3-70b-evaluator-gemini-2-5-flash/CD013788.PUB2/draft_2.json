  "draft": "Is it better to remove the urinary catheter early or later to prevent infections after a kidney transplant?\n\nKey messages:\n- We are not sure if removing the urinary catheter early or late after a kidney transplant makes a difference in preventing infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), because there is not enough good-quality evidence.\n- The studies we found had significant limitations, such as short follow-up periods and a high risk of bias, which means we cannot trust the results completely.\n- Future research should focus on conducting high-quality studies that compare early and late catheter removal after kidney transplantation, with longer follow-up periods, to provide clearer guidance for healthcare providers and patients.\n\nWhat is kidney transplantation and why is it important?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for end-stage kidney disease. During the operation, a catheter (a small tube) is inserted into the bladder to allow it to drain and promote healing. However, urinary catheters can pose an infection risk to patients, potentially resulting in a UTI.\n\nWhat are the risks associated with urinary catheters after kidney transplantation?\nThe longer the catheter remains in place, the greater the risk of developing a UTI. There is no consensus on how long a catheter should stay in place after a transplant, and different removal times may be associated with different rates of UTIs and postoperative complications.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to compare patients who had their catheter removed early (less than 5 days after transplant surgery) to those who had it removed late (5 days or more after the transplant). They wanted to know if there were any differences in the rates of symptomatic UTIs, asymptomatic bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine without symptoms), and major urological complications requiring treatment between the two groups.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared early versus late removal of urinary catheters after kidney transplantation. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies involving 197 people who underwent kidney transplantation. These studies compared early versus late removal of urinary catheters after the transplant. However, the studies were short, with no patients followed beyond one month. Due to the limited number of studies and their poor quality, we cannot say for sure if early or late catheter removal makes a difference in preventing infections.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and it is possible that the people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. Not all studies provided data on everything we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is current up to April 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. The feedback below focuses on 3 key areas to make the language more direct and easier for a lay audience to understand. Addressing these will significantly improve clarity.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Replace Noun Phrases with Active Verbs (Nominalizations)**\n\nSome sentences rely on abstract nouns instead of direct verbs, which can make them harder to follow. Using more action-oriented language will make the text clearer.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"...different timings of catheter removal are thought to be associated with different incidences of UTI and postoperative complications.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"timings of catheter removal\" is indirect. Using a verb like \"removing\" is more active and easier to understand.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"...removing the catheter at different times may be associated with different rates of UTIs and complications after the operation.\"\n\n**2. Simplify Technical and Vague Phrases**\n\nWhile the summary does a good job defining some terms, others could be simpler and more concrete for patients.\n\n- **Problematic phrase:** \"...and major urological complications requiring treatment...\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This is vague and potentially alarming. A patient won't know what a \"urological complication\" is. Providing a simple example makes it more concrete.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"...and serious urinary problems that need treatment (like leaks or blockages).\"\n\n**3. Shorten Sentences and Remove Wordy Phrases**\n\nSome sentences, particularly in the key messages, are long and contain phrases that could be more concise.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Future research should focus on conducting high-quality studies that compare early and late catheter removal after kidney transplantation, with longer follow-up periods, to provide clearer guidance for healthcare providers and patients.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** At 36 words, this sentence is long. Phrases like \"focus on conducting\" can be simplified to just \"conduct\" or \"run\".\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future high-quality studies should compare early and late catheter removal and follow patients for longer to provide clearer guidance for doctors and patients.\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:\n\nYour draft is strong in many areas, including its low use of passive voice. The suggestions above are supported by the linguistic analysis, which flagged a high number of **nominalizations** (22 instances, placing it in the 90th percentile). This metric specifically measures the use of noun-form verbs, confirming that making the language more action-oriented is the primary area for improvement.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with over half of its linguistic features falling in the best quartile. Readability scores and sentence length are within the typical median range. However, the analysis identified a significant deviation in the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which is in the 90th percentile, suggesting that sentences could be more direct and action-oriented."
