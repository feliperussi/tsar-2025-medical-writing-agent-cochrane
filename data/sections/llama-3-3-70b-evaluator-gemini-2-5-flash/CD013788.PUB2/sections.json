    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is uncertain whether removing the urinary catheter early or late after a kidney transplant makes any difference in preventing infections, including urinary ...",
    "We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine the benefits and potential harms of early versus late catheter removal, and the included studies had significant limitations, such as short follow-up periods and high risk of bias (a systematic error introduced into sampling or testing by selecting or encouraging one outcome or answer over others).",
    "Future research should focus on conducting high-quality, well-designed studies that compare early and late catheter removal after kidney transplantation, with longer follow-up periods and careful consideration of potential complications, to provide clearer guidance for healthcare providers and patients."

      "subheading": "What is kidney transplantation and why is it important?",
      "content": "Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease. During the operation, a catheter is introduced into the bladder to allow it to drain and promote healing. However, urinary catheters can pose an infection risk to patients, potentially resulting in a urinary tract infection (UTI)."
    },
    {
      "subheading": "What are the risks associated with urinary catheters after kidney transplantation?",
      "content": "The longer the catheter remains in place, the greater the risk of developing a UTI. There is no consensus approach to the time a catheter should remain in place post-transplant, and different timings of catheter removal are thought to be associated with different incidences of UTI and postoperative complications."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to compare patients who had their catheter removed early (less than 5 days post-transplant surgery) to those who had their catheter removed late (5 days or more following their kidney transplant). They wanted to find out if there were any differences in the incidence of symptomatic UTIs, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and major urological complications requiring intervention and treatment between the two groups."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 2 studies that involved 197 people who underwent kidney transplantation. The studies were conducted to compare early versus late removal of urinary catheters post-transplant. The duration of the studies was short, with no patients being followed beyond one month. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not specified in the abstract. The studies did not provide information on the funding sources or the countries in which they took place. The interventions compared were the removal of urinary catheters before five days and after five days post-transplantation. Due to the limited number of studies and their poor quality, there is insufficient evidence to suggest any difference between early and late catheter removal post-transplant. It is uncertain whether removing the urinary catheter early or late after kidney transplantation has an effect on the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria. We do not know if early or late removal of the urinary catheter has an effect on the incidence of urinary tract infections or major urological complications."

  "limitations": "We are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Not all of the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.",
