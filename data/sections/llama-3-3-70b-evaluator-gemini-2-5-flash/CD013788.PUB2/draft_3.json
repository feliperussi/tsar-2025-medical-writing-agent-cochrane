  "draft": "Is it better to remove the urinary catheter early or later to prevent infections after a kidney transplant?\n\nKey messages:\n- We are not sure if removing the urinary catheter early or late after a kidney transplant makes a difference in preventing infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), because there is not enough good-quality evidence.\n- The studies we found had significant limitations, such as short follow-up periods and a high risk of bias, which means we cannot trust the results completely.\n- Future high-quality studies should compare early and late catheter removal and follow patients for longer to provide clearer guidance for doctors and patients.\n\nWhat is kidney transplantation and why is it important?\nKidney transplantation is the best treatment for end-stage kidney disease. During the operation, a catheter (a small tube) is inserted into the bladder to allow it to drain and promote healing. However, urinary catheters can pose an infection risk to patients, potentially resulting in a UTI.\n\nWhat are the risks associated with urinary catheters after kidney transplantation?\nThe longer the catheter remains in place, the greater the risk of developing a UTI. Removing the catheter at different times may be associated with different rates of UTIs and complications after the operation.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to compare patients who had their catheter removed early (less than 5 days after transplant surgery) to those who had it removed late (5 days or more after the transplant). They wanted to know if there were any differences in the rates of symptomatic UTIs, asymptomatic bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine without symptoms), and serious urinary problems that need treatment (like leaks or blockages) between the two groups.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared early versus late removal of urinary catheters after kidney transplantation. We summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies involving 197 people who underwent kidney transplantation. These studies compared early versus late removal of urinary catheters after the transplant. However, the studies were short, with no patients followed beyond one month. Due to the limited number of studies and their poor quality, we cannot say for sure if early or late catheter removal makes a difference in preventing infections.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe are not confident in the evidence because the studies were very small, and it is possible that the people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. Not all studies provided data on everything we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is current up to April 2023.",
