  "draft": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic fields to induce seizures) as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT, a treatment that uses electricity to induce seizures) for people with schizophrenia?\n\nKey messages:\n- Magnetic seizure therapy may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia, but the evidence is very low-quality.\n- Magnetic seizure therapy may cause less delayed memory deficit and less cognitive deterioration compared to ECT.\n- Due to the lack of robust evidence, further research is needed to fully understand the effects of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat is schizophrenia and how is it treated?\nSchizophrenia is a common and disabling mental disorder. The main treatment is antipsychotic medication, but this does not work for about 20% of people. For this reason, researchers are looking for other effective treatments, such as Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how effective and safe MST is for people with schizophrenia, by comparing it to other interventions such as Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) and standard care.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing magnetic seizure therapy to other treatments for people with schizophrenia, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy (MST) plus standard care to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care.\n\nOur main findings were:\n- There may be no difference between MST and ECT for improving overall well-being or for reducing the main symptoms of schizophrenia. These symptoms include 'positive symptoms' (such as hearing voices) and 'negative symptoms' (such as a lack of motivation).\n- People receiving MST may be less likely to experience memory loss or a decline in thinking skills compared to those receiving ECT.\n- There may be no difference between the groups in how many people left the study early for any reason.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because we included only one study. This study had a high risk of bias due to issues like selective reporting, early termination, and baseline imbalance, and it was unclear if participants and personnel were blinded.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.\n\nWe need more research to fully understand the effects of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and all critical checks for completeness and accuracy have passed. However, it is not approved because of three key issues that make important sections difficult for a layperson to understand. Addressing these will significantly improve clarity.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the title and first key message.** The current title is very long because it includes full definitions. This makes the main question hard to grasp. The first key message then repeats these definitions, which is redundant.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Is magnetic seizure therapy (a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic fields to induce seizures) as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT, a treatment that uses electricity to induce seizures) for people with schizophrenia?\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:**\n     - **Title:** \"Magnetic seizure therapy compared to electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia\"\n     - **First Key Message:** \"- Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for schizophrenia, but the evidence is very low-quality.\"\n     - **Then, add the definitions to the main text, for example:** \"This review looked at two treatments for schizophrenia: magnetic seizure therapy (MST), which uses magnetic fields to induce a seizure, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which uses electricity.\"\n\n2. **Explain the limitations in plain language.** The limitations section uses technical terms without explanation, making it impossible for most readers to understand why the evidence is weak.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"This study had a high risk of bias due to issues like selective reporting, early termination, and baseline imbalance, and it was unclear if participants and personnel were blinded.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is low because of limitations in the only study we found. For example, there were concerns about how the study was conducted, such as the study ending earlier than planned and not all results being reported. It was also unclear if people in the study (or the staff) knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the description of positive and negative symptoms.** While it's excellent that you've defined these terms, the phrasing could be slightly clearer to avoid misinterpretation.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"These symptoms include 'positive symptoms' (such as hearing voices) and 'negative symptoms' (such as a lack of motivation).\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This includes 'positive symptoms' (experiences that are added, such as hearing voices) and 'negative symptoms' (things that are lost, such as motivation or emotional expression).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating good general readability, simple sentence structures, and appropriate vocabulary choices. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is 11.6 (P25) and passive voice is low (8 instances, P25). However, these overall positive metrics do not capture the critical clarity issues caused by the overly complex title and the use of unexplained technical jargon in the limitations section, which require manual editorial review to fix."
