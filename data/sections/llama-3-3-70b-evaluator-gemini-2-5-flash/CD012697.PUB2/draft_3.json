  "draft": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic fields to induce seizures) as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT, a treatment that uses electricity to induce seizures) for people with schizophrenia? We looked at the evidence to find out.\n\n- Magnetic seizure therapy may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for improving symptoms in people with schizophrenia, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Magnetic seizure therapy may cause fewer unwanted effects, such as memory problems and cognitive issues, compared to electroconvulsive therapy, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n- We need more well-designed studies to determine the effectiveness and safety of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat is schizophrenia and why is it a problem?\nSchizophrenia is a common mental disorder that affects about 1% of the population. It can cause hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.\n\nWhat are the current treatment options for schizophrenia?\nThe main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. However, for people who do not respond to antipsychotics, researchers are investigating other treatment options. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is sometimes used when medications don't work. Researchers wanted to know if a newer treatment, magnetic seizure therapy (MST), could be a safer or more effective alternative to ECT. Researchers are investigating other treatment options, such as magnetic seizure therapy, to help people with schizophrenia who do not respond to antipsychotics.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia, by comparing it to electroconvulsive therapy or other interventions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that compared magnetic seizure therapy to electroconvulsive therapy in 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and found that magnetic seizure therapy may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for improving symptoms, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the study had a small sample size and high risk of bias. We need more well-designed studies to confirm the findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is NOT_APPROVED. It has a good foundation but requires a few key revisions before it's ready for publication.\n\n**Critical Issue:**\nThe summary is missing a required 'Methods' section. This section should briefly explain how the review was conducted.\n- **Suggestion:** Please add a new section with a heading like 'How did we conduct this review?' and include a simple description of the methods, such as: 'We searched for studies that compared magnetic seizure therapy to other treatments for people with schizophrenia. We then summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.'\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1. **Explain technical terms in the 'Limitations' section.** The term 'risk of bias' is not clear to a lay audience and should be explained in simple terms.\n   - **Original sentence:** 'The evidence is limited because the study had a small sample size and high risk of bias.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Readers won't understand what 'risk of bias' means or why it weakens the evidence. The source material provides specific reasons for this risk which should be shared.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is low because the only study we found was small. There were also flaws in the study's design that could have influenced the results (this is known as 'risk of bias'). For example, it's possible the participants knew which treatment they were receiving.'\n\n2. **Remove redundancy in the background information.** The section on treatment options repeats the same point in two consecutive sentences.\n   - **Original sentences:** 'Researchers wanted to know if a newer treatment, magnetic seizure therapy (MST), could be a safer or more effective alternative to ECT. Researchers are investigating other treatment options, such as magnetic seizure therapy, to help people with schizophrenia who do not respond to antipsychotics.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The second sentence repeats information from the first, making the text less concise and harder to follow.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'For people who do not respond to antipsychotics, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is sometimes used. Researchers wanted to know if a newer treatment, magnetic seizure therapy (MST), could be a safer or more effective alternative to ECT.'\n\n3. **Clarify the main findings about symptoms.** The results are a bit vague and could be more specific, as in the original abstract.\n   - **Original sentence:** 'The study lasted for four weeks and found that magnetic seizure therapy may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for improving symptoms, but the evidence is very uncertain.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** It's not specific about what 'symptoms' means. The abstract mentions global state, positive, and negative symptoms.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** 'The four-week study found there may be no difference between magnetic seizure therapy and electroconvulsive therapy for improving the overall symptoms of schizophrenia (such as hallucinations or lack of motivation). However, because of the study's limitations, the evidence is very uncertain.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. A majority of features (66.7%) fall into the best quartile for readability and simplicity, including excellent sentence length (15.88 words/sentence) and low use of passive voice (7 instances). However, several vocabulary metrics, such as `complex_words` and `long_words`, are in the P75 range, indicating a vocabulary that is slightly more complex than the majority of PLS texts. This statistical finding supports the editorial recommendation to simplify technical terms like 'risk of bias' to ensure maximum clarity for a lay audience."
