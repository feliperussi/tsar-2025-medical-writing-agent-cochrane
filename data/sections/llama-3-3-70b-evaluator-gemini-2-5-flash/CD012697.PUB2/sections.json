    "Magnetic seizure therapy (a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic fields to induce seizures) may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT, a treatment that uses electricity to induce seizures) for people with schizophrenia, but the evidence is very low-quality.",
    "Magnetic seizure therapy may cause less delayed memory deficit and less cognitive deterioration compared to ECT.",
    "Due to the lack of robust evidence, further research is needed to fully understand the effects of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia."

      "content": "Schizophrenia is a common and disabling mental disorder that affects about 20% of people who do not respond to antipsychotics, which are the main treatment for schizophrenia. It is a problem because it can cause significant distress and impairment in daily life, and there is a need for alternative treatment options."

      "subheading": "What are the common treatments for schizophrenia?",
      "content": "The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotics, but some people may not respond to these medications and need to seek other treatment options. One of the novel non-invasive brain stimulation techniques being investigated is Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST)."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found one study that involved 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy (MST) plus standard care to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care. The study was conducted in an unspecified country and setting. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The study funding sources were also not mentioned. We did not find any other studies on this particular intervention or population of interest. Magnetic seizure therapy may cause a large reduction in delayed memory deficit and cognitive deterioration in people with schizophrenia. However, it is unclear if magnetic seizure therapy has an effect on the global state, positive symptoms, and negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia. We do not know if magnetic seizure therapy has an effect on leaving the study early due to any reason, adverse effects, or inefficacy."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because many studies may not have blinded participants, leading to potential bias; several studies did not report all outcomes of interest, resulting in incomplete data; and the sample sizes were generally very small, reducing statistical power and generalizability.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to March 2022."
