It can cause hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms such as lack of motivation or flat emotions.\n### What are the current treatment options for schizophrenia?\nThe main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. However, for people who do not respond to antipsychotics, other treatment options such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or novel non-invasive brain stimulation techniques like magnetic seizure therapy (MST) are being investigated.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of magnetic seizure therapy (MST) for people with schizophrenia, by comparing it to ECT or other interventions, and to determine if MST is a viable treatment option for people with schizophrenia who do not respond to antipsychotics.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing magnetic seizure therapy to other treatments for people with schizophrenia, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy (MST) plus standard care to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care. The study was conducted in an unspecified country and setting. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The study funding sources were also not mentioned. The intervention types were MST and ECT, and the comparison was between these two interventions. Magnetic seizure therapy may cause a large reduction in delayed memory deficit and cognitive deterioration in people with schizophrenia. However, it is unclear if magnetic seizure therapy has an effect on the global state, positive symptoms, and negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia. We do not know if magnetic seizure therapy has an effect on leaving the study early due to any reason, adverse effects, or inefficacy.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), not all studies reported all outcomes of interest, and the studies had very small sample sizes.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

These deviations suggest the text is too complex, uses overly long sentences, and is too noun-heavy for a plain language summary."
