It is a problem because it can cause significant distress and impairment in daily life, and there is a need for alternative treatment options.\n### What are the common treatments for schizophrenia?\nThe main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotics, but some people may not respond to these medications and need to seek other treatment options. One of the novel non-invasive brain stimulation techniques being investigated is Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST).\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of MST for people with schizophrenia, by comparing it to other interventions such as Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) and standard care.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing magnetic seizure therapy to other treatments for people with schizophrenia, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy (MST) plus standard care to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care. The study was conducted in an unspecified country and setting. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The study funding sources were also not mentioned. We did not find any other studies on this particular intervention or population of interest. Magnetic seizure therapy may cause a large reduction in delayed memory deficit and cognitive deterioration in people with schizophrenia. However, it is unclear if magnetic seizure therapy has an effect on the global state, positive symptoms, and negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia. We do not know if magnetic seizure therapy has an effect on leaving the study early due to any reason, adverse effects, or inefficacy.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because many studies may not have blinded participants, leading to potential bias; several studies did not report all outcomes of interest, resulting in incomplete data; and the sample sizes were generally very small, reducing statistical power and generalizability.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED primarily due to significant factual inaccuracies and misrepresentations of the review's findings, particularly in the 'Results' and 'Limitations' sections. Additionally, the title and first key message are overly complex, contributing to higher readability scores than ideal for a Plain Language Summary.\n\n**Top 5 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Factual Inaccuracy in Limitations Section:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"The evidence is limited because many studies may not have blinded participants, leading to potential bias; several studies did not report all outcomes of interest, resulting in incomplete data; and the sample sizes were generally very small, reducing statistical power and generalizability.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This statement is factually incorrect. The review included only *one* study, not 'many' or 'several'. The specific risks of bias identified in the original abstract were also different (selective reporting, early termination, baseline imbalance, unclear blinding).\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because we included only one study. This study had a high risk of bias due to issues like selective reporting, early termination, and baseline imbalance, and it was unclear if participants and personnel were blinded.\"\n\n2.  **Misrepresentation of 'No Difference' Findings in Results:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"However, it is unclear if magnetic seizure therapy has an effect on the global state, positive symptoms, and negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia. We do not know if magnetic seizure therapy has an effect on leaving the study early due to any reason, adverse effects, or inefficacy.\"\n    *   **Problem:** The original abstract states that MST and ECT 'may not differ' or 'there may be no difference' for these outcomes. Stating 'unclear' or 'we do not know' misrepresents these findings of no significant difference.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"However, magnetic seizure therapy and electroconvulsive therapy may not differ in improving global state, positive symptoms, or negative symptoms. There may also be no difference between the two groups in terms of people leaving the study early due to any reason, adverse effects, or inefficacy.\"\n\n3.  **Overly Complex Title and First Key Message:**\n    *   **Quote (Title):** \"Is magnetic seizure therapy (a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic fields to induce seizures) as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT, a treatment that uses electricity to induce seizures) for people with schizophrenia?\"\n    *   **Problem:** The lengthy parenthetical definitions make the title and the first key message very long and difficult to read, contributing to higher complexity metrics.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite (Title):** \"Is magnetic seizure therapy (MST) as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for people with schizophrenia?\" (Move the definitions of MST and ECT to the introduction after their first mention, e.g., \"Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic fields to induce seizures. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a treatment that uses electricity to induce seizures.\") Apply similar simplification to the first key message.\n\n4.  **Inaccurate Phrasing in Introduction (Schizophrenia Prevalence):**\n    *   **Quote:** \"Schizophrenia is a common and disabling mental disorder that affects about 20% of people who do not respond to antipsychotics, which are the main treatment for schizophrenia.\"\n    *   **Problem:** This phrasing incorrectly implies that schizophrenia *only* affects people who don't respond to antipsychotics. The original abstract clarifies that 'About 20% of people with schizophrenia do not respond to antipsychotics'.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Schizophrenia is a common and disabling mental disorder. About 20% of people with schizophrenia do not respond to antipsychotics, which are the main treatment.\"\n\n5.  **Missing Nuance on Cognitive Improvement in Results:**\n    *   **Quote:** \"Magnetic seizure therapy may cause a large reduction in delayed memory deficit and cognitive deterioration in people with schizophrenia.\"\n    *   **Problem:** While the original abstract states MST 'may cause less delayed memory deficit and less cognitive deterioration', it also explicitly states MST 'may improve more cognitive function'. The draft omits this positive finding and uses 'large reduction' which is not directly supported.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Magnetic seizure therapy compared to ECT may cause less delayed memory deficit and less cognitive deterioration, and may also improve cognitive function.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 44.4% of features in the best quartile and 27.8% in the median range. However, five features deviate significantly from typical patterns (P90 range):\n\n-   **nominalization (23.0):** Higher than typical, suggesting a need to use more verbs instead of noun forms.\n-   **smog_index (14.2):** Higher than typical, indicating more complex vocabulary and longer sentences.\n-   **complex_words_dc (218.0):** Higher than typical, suggesting the use of more unfamiliar words.\n-   **complex_words (117.0):** Higher than typical, indicating a higher count of words with 3+ syllables.\n-   **long_words (184.0):** Higher than typical, indicating a higher count of words with 7+ characters.\n\nThese deviations support the editorial feedback regarding the need to simplify vocabulary, reduce sentence complexity, and use more direct language, particularly by addressing the wordiness in the title and key messages, and by rephrasing nominalizations."
