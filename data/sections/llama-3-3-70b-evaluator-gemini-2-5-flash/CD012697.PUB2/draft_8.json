  "draft": "Is magnetic seizure therapy (a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic fields to induce seizures) as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT, a treatment that uses electricity to induce seizures) for people with schizophrenia?\n\nKey messages:\n- Magnetic seizure therapy may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia, but the evidence is very low-quality.\n- Magnetic seizure therapy may cause less delayed memory deficit and less cognitive deterioration compared to ECT.\n- Due to the lack of robust evidence, further research is needed to fully understand the effects of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat is schizophrenia and why is it a problem?\nSchizophrenia is a common and disabling mental disorder. About 20% of people with schizophrenia do not respond to antipsychotics, which are the main treatment. It is a problem because it can cause significant distress and impairment in daily life, and there is a need for alternative treatment options.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for schizophrenia?\nThe main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotics, but some people may not respond to these medications and need to seek other treatment options. One of the novel non-invasive brain stimulation techniques being investigated is Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST).\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of MST for people with schizophrenia, by comparing it to other interventions such as Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) and standard care.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing magnetic seizure therapy to other treatments for people with schizophrenia, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared magnetic seizure therapy (MST) plus standard care to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus standard care.\n\nOur main findings were:\n- There may be no difference between MST and ECT for improving overall well-being or for reducing the main symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices (known as 'positive symptoms') or showing a lack of motivation (known as 'negative symptoms').\n- People receiving MST may be less likely to experience memory loss or a decline in thinking skills compared to those receiving ECT.\n- There may be no difference between the groups in how many people left the study early for any reason.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because we included only one study. This study had a high risk of bias due to issues like selective reporting, early termination, and baseline imbalance, and it was unclear if participants and personnel were blinded.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and meets most of our guidelines. However, it is not approved because there are a few key areas where clarity and structure could be improved for the reader.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Combine redundant introductory sections to improve flow.** The first two sections repeat the same information about antipsychotics being the main treatment. Combining them would make the introduction more concise.\n   - **Problem:** The sections 'What is schizophrenia and why is it a problem?' and 'What are the common treatments for schizophrenia?' are short and repetitive.\n   - **Suggestion:** Combine them under a single, more comprehensive heading like 'What is schizophrenia and how is it treated?'. For example: 'Schizophrenia is a common and disabling mental disorder. The main treatment is antipsychotic medication, but this does not work for about 20% of people. For this reason, researchers are looking for other effective treatments, such as Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST).'\n\n2. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of abstract nouns.** Some sentences use noun forms of verbs, which can make the text feel more academic and less direct for a lay audience.\n   - **Problem:** The sentence \"The review authors wanted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of MST...\" uses the abstract nouns 'efficacy' and 'tolerability'.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this using more direct verbs. For example: 'The review authors wanted to find out how effective and safe MST is for people with schizophrenia...'\n\n3. **Clarify the link between technical terms and their plain language explanations.** The summary does a good job of explaining technical terms, but sometimes the explanation could be more clearly connected to the term itself.\n   - **Problem:** The results section mentions 'positive symptoms' and 'negative symptoms' and provides examples, but the connection could be stronger. The sentence reads: \"...reducing the main symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices (known as 'positive symptoms') or showing a lack of motivation (known as 'negative symptoms').\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase to define the terms more explicitly. For example: '...reducing the main symptoms of schizophrenia. These include 'positive symptoms' (such as hearing voices) and 'negative symptoms' (such as a lack of motivation).'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns. Most readability and sentence structure metrics fall within the median (P50) or best quartile (P75) ranges, indicating a generally readable text. However, the analysis flags a significant deviation in the use of nominalizations (noun forms of verbs), which is in the P90 range. This metric supports the editorial feedback to use more direct, action-oriented verbs to improve clarity for the reader."
