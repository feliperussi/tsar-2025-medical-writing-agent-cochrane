  "draft": "Is magnetic seizure therapy as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia?\nWe looked at the evidence to find out.\n\n- Magnetic seizure therapy may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for improving symptoms in people with schizophrenia, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n- Magnetic seizure therapy may cause fewer unwanted effects, such as memory problems and cognitive issues, compared to electroconvulsive therapy, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n- We need more well-designed studies to determine the effectiveness and safety of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat is schizophrenia and why is it a problem?\nSchizophrenia is a common mental disorder that affects about 1% of the population. It can cause hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.\n\nWhat are the current treatment options for schizophrenia?\nThe main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. However, for people who do not respond to antipsychotics, other treatment options such as electroconvulsive therapy or magnetic seizure therapy are being investigated.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia, by comparing it to electroconvulsive therapy or other interventions.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that compared magnetic seizure therapy to electroconvulsive therapy in 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and found that magnetic seizure therapy may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for improving symptoms, but the evidence is very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the study had a small sample size and high risk of bias. We need more well-designed studies to confirm the findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft with good structure and readability scores. However, it needs a few key improvements to ensure it's clear for patients and their families before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 areas to focus on:\n\n**1. Define Key Medical Terms**\n\nThe summary immediately introduces 'magnetic seizure therapy' and 'electroconvulsive therapy' but doesn't explain what they are. This can prevent a reader from understanding the entire summary.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** 'Is magnetic seizure therapy as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia?'\n- **Suggestion:** Add simple, parenthetical definitions, as were provided in the source material. For example: 'Is magnetic seizure therapy (a treatment that uses magnetic fields to cause a seizure) as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (a treatment that uses electricity to cause a seizure) for people with schizophrenia?'\n\n**2. Clarify the Relationship Between Treatments**\n\nThe text explains that these therapies are for people who don't respond to medication, but it doesn't explain why MST is being compared to ECT. Adding this context helps the reader understand the review's purpose.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** '...for people who do not respond to antipsychotics, other treatment options such as electroconvulsive therapy or magnetic seizure therapy are being investigated.'\n- **Suggestion:** Add a sentence to clarify the comparison. For example: 'Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is sometimes used when medications don't work. Researchers wanted to know if a newer treatment, magnetic seizure therapy (MST), could be a safer or more effective alternative to ECT.'\n\n**3. Use Active Voice for Clarity**\n\nThe style guide recommends using the active voice ('We did X') instead of the passive voice ('X was done'). This makes the writing more direct.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** '...other treatment options such as electroconvulsive therapy or magnetic seizure therapy are being investigated.'\n- **Suggestion:** Rewrite this in the active voice to show who is doing the action. For example: '...researchers are investigating other treatment options, such as electroconvulsive therapy or magnetic seizure therapy.'\n\nAddressing these specific points—especially defining the key terms—will make a significant difference in how well a non-specialist reader can understand this important research.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has good conformity with typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges. Notably, sentence length (17.33 words/sentence) and the low number of passive voice constructions (7) are in the best quartile, indicating strong structural readability. However, these metrics do not capture the main clarity issue: the use of undefined technical terms which hinders overall comprehension."
