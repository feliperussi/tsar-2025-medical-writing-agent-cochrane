  "draft": "Magnetic seizure therapy compared to electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia\n\nKey messages:\n- Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) may be as effective as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for schizophrenia, but the evidence is very low-quality.\n- MST may cause less delayed memory deficit and less cognitive deterioration compared to ECT.\n- Due to the lack of robust evidence, further research is needed to fully understand the effects of MST for people with schizophrenia.\n\nWhat is schizophrenia and how is it treated?\nSchizophrenia is a common and disabling mental disorder. The main treatment is antipsychotic medication, but this does not work for about 20% of people. For this reason, researchers are looking for other effective treatments, such as Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST). MST uses magnetic fields to induce a seizure, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) uses electricity.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out how effective and safe MST is for people with schizophrenia, by comparing it to other interventions such as ECT and standard care.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing MST to other treatments for people with schizophrenia, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 79 adults with acute schizophrenia. The study lasted for four weeks and compared MST plus standard care to ECT plus standard care.\n\nOur main findings were:\n- There may be no difference between MST and ECT for improving overall well-being or for reducing the main symptoms of schizophrenia. This includes 'positive symptoms' (experiences that are added, such as hearing voices) and 'negative symptoms' (things that are lost, such as motivation or emotional expression).\n- People receiving MST may be less likely to experience memory loss or a decline in thinking skills compared to those receiving ECT.\n- There may be no difference between the groups in how many people left the study early for any reason.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is low because of limitations in the only study we found. For example, there were concerns about how the study was conducted, such as the study ending earlier than planned and not all results being reported. It was also unclear if people in the study (or the staff) knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2022.\n\nWe need more research to fully understand the effects of MST for people with schizophrenia.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start but is not yet approved. It fails a critical check because the main title is not phrased as a question, which is required by the style guide. Additionally, several key terms and comparisons could be clarified to better help a lay audience.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase the title as a question.** The current title is a statement. A question is more engaging for readers and aligns with the style guide for headings.\n   - **Current Title:** 'Magnetic seizure therapy compared to electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Is magnetic seizure therapy as effective as electroconvulsive therapy for people with schizophrenia?'\n\n2. **Explain the term 'standard care'.** Readers may not know what this includes, which makes the comparison in the study confusing.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** 'The study lasted for four weeks and compared MST plus standard care to ECT plus standard care.'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'The study compared two groups of people who were also receiving their usual antipsychotic medication (standard care): one group received MST, and the other received ECT.'\n\n3. **Clarify the definitions of MST and ECT.** The current definitions are placed at the end of a paragraph, which makes them less prominent and harder to digest. Using a list would make them easier to compare.\n   - **Problematic Section:** '...'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'This review looks at two treatments that start a seizure to treat schizophrenia:\n     - **Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST):** uses magnetic fields.\n     - **Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT):** uses electricity.'\n\nWhile the draft's readability scores are good, addressing these specific points of clarity will significantly improve its usefulness for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating strong readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 10.82) and appropriate sentence length (20.36 words/sentence). The text does not have any statistical outliers that require attention."
