  "draft": "What are the best treatments for depression after a stroke, and how well do they work?\n\nKey Messages\n- Very low-certainty evidence suggests that pharmacological, psychological, and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression after a stroke, but may have unwanted effects such as adverse events related to the central nervous system (the part of the body that includes the brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal tract (the part of the body that includes the stomach and intestines).\n- Non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on the prevalence of depression, and more research is needed to understand its potential benefits and harms.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for more robust evidence, to provide clearer guidance on the best treatments for depression after a stroke.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke and why is it a problem?\nDepression is a common condition that can occur after someone has a stroke. It can impact a person's recovery and quality of life. Depression after stroke is often not detected or treated properly, which can make it harder for people to get better. Common treatments for depression include medications, psychological therapies, and non-invasive brain stimulation. However, it's not clear which of these treatments work best for people with depression after stroke.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to find out which treatments are most effective for depression after stroke. They looked at different types of treatments, including medications, psychological therapies, non-invasive brain stimulation, and combinations of these. They wanted to know which treatments reduce the symptoms of depression, improve quality of life, and have the fewest side effects. They also wanted to find out if some treatments work better than others for certain people.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies comparing treatments for depression after stroke, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 5831 people with depression after stroke. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, with a focus on comparing different interventions such as pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation, and psychological therapy. Most studies compared these interventions to placebo, sham stimulation, or usual care, with some also examining combination therapies. Unfortunately, no studies were found for certain comparisons of interest, including some combination therapies. The review found that pharmacological interventions, psychological therapy, and combination therapies may reduce the prevalence of depression, but non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect. Pharmacological interventions were associated with more adverse events related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and the studies involved different types of participants and used varied ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. The main issues are a long, dense paragraph in the results section and the use of technical language that could be simplified.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Break up the long results paragraph.** The 'What did we find?' section combines a description of the studies with the main findings into a single, six-sentence paragraph. This 'wall of text' makes it difficult for readers to quickly grasp the key takeaways.\n   - **Original Text:** \"We found 65 studies that involved 5831 people with depression after stroke. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, with a focus on comparing different interventions such as pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation, and psychological therapy. Most studies compared these interventions to placebo, sham stimulation, or usual care, with some also examining combination therapies. Unfortunately, no studies were found for certain comparisons of interest, including some combination therapies. The review found that pharmacological interventions, psychological therapy, and combination therapies may reduce the prevalence of depression, but non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect. Pharmacological interventions were associated with more adverse events related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Split this into two shorter paragraphs:\n     * (Paragraph 1 - About the studies): \"We found 65 studies that included 5831 people with depression after a stroke. The studies compared different treatments, including medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, and psychological 'talking' therapies. Most studies compared these treatments to a placebo (a dummy treatment) or usual care.\"\n     * (Paragraph 2 - The findings): \"We found that medications and psychological therapies may reduce depression. However, medications were linked to more unwanted effects in the nervous system and the stomach. Non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on depression.\"\n\n2. **Replace technical terms with simpler, everyday language.** The summary uses terms like 'prevalence of depression' and 'pharmacological interventions' multiple times. While some technical terms are defined, using simpler words from the start improves readability.\n   - **Original Text:** \"...pharmacological, psychological, and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression after a stroke...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...medications, 'talking' therapies, and combination treatments can reduce how many people have depression after a stroke...\"\n\n3. **Clarify the language around unwanted effects.** The phrase 'associated with' is scientifically accurate but can be weak and formal for a lay audience. Using more direct language is better.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Pharmacological interventions were associated with more adverse events...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Medications were linked to more unwanted effects...\" or \"People taking medications experienced more unwanted effects...\"\n\nMaking these changes will make the findings much clearer and easier for patients and their families to understand. The linguistic analysis supports these suggestions, showing higher-than-usual rates of complex words and nominalizations (noun-heavy phrases).",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns, with 77.7% of metrics falling within the median or best quartile ranges. However, four metrics deviate significantly from the typical pattern, all related to vocabulary complexity. The scores for 'nominalization' (P90), 'smog_index' (P90), 'complex_words_dc' (P90), and 'long_words' (P90) are higher than is typical for a PLS. This suggests the text relies on complex, multi-syllable words and noun-based phrases where simpler verbs and more common words could be used, supporting the need for the recommended edits."
