  "draft": "What are the best treatments for depression after a stroke, and how well do they work?\n- Very low-certainty evidence suggests that medications, psychological therapies, and combination therapies can reduce depression after a stroke. However, these treatments may have unwanted effects, such as adverse events related to the central nervous system (the system that includes the brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal tract (the digestive system). Non-invasive brain stimulation (a technique that uses magnetic or electrical currents to stimulate brain activity without surgery) had little to no effect on depression.\n- The current evidence does not allow for firm conclusions about the best treatment approach for depression after a stroke. More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of different treatments, including their effects on specific subgroups of the population.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations of current studies, such as the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for more robust evidence on the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for depression after a stroke.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke?\nDepression is a common and serious condition that can occur after a person has a stroke. It can impact a person's recovery and quality of life. Depression after stroke can be hard to detect and may not be treated properly. Common treatments for depression include medications (drugs used to treat depression), psychological therapies (talking therapies, such as counseling or psychotherapy), and non-invasive brain stimulation.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out which treatments are effective for depression after stroke. They looked at different types of treatments, including medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapies, and combinations of these. They aimed to determine the benefits and harms of these treatments and to identify which ones work best to reduce depression in people who have had a stroke.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 5831 people with depression after stroke. The studies were conducted in various countries and included people with depression after stroke. The types of interventions and comparisons included pharmacological interventions (medications), non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combinations of these. Most studies compared these interventions with placebo (a dummy treatment), sham stimulation (a fake treatment), or usual care.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nThe review found that medications, psychological therapy, and combination therapies may reduce depression, but non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect. Medications were associated with adverse events related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. It is unclear if these interventions have an effect on outcome.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (risk of bias), and the studies were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

Additionally, the text needs several improvements for clarity. It relies on technical terms like 'adverse events' and 'pharmacological interventions' instead of simpler alternatives like 'side effects' and 'medications'. Some sentences are long, noun-heavy, and contain vague statements that could confuse readers. For example, the sentence 'It is unclear if these interventions have an effect on outcome' is confusing and should be removed or clarified. To improve the summary, please add the missing Methods section, replace jargon with everyday language, and shorten complex sentences by using more direct verbs.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and use of active voice are good (P25 and P75 respectively), there are significant deviations in vocabulary complexity. Six metrics, including nominalization, noun count, complex words, and the SMOG index, are in the P90 range. This indicates the text uses more noun-based phrases, abstract concepts, and multi-syllable words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, supporting the need to simplify vocabulary and sentence structure."
