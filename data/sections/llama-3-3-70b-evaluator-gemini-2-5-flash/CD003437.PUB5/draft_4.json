  "draft": "What are the best treatments for depression after a stroke, and how well do they work?\n- Very low-certainty evidence suggests that medications, psychological therapies, and combination therapies can reduce depression after a stroke. However, these treatments may have unwanted effects, such as side effects related to the central nervous system (the system that includes the brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal tract (the digestive system). Non-invasive brain stimulation (a technique that uses magnetic or electrical currents to stimulate brain activity without surgery) had little to no effect on depression.\n- The current evidence does not allow for firm conclusions about the best treatment approach for depression after a stroke. More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of different treatments, including their effects on specific subgroups of the population.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations of current studies, such as the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for more robust evidence on the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for depression after a stroke.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke?\nDepression is a common and serious condition that can occur after a person has a stroke. It can impact a person's recovery and quality of life. Depression after stroke can be hard to detect and may not be treated properly. Common treatments for depression include medications (drugs used to treat depression), psychological therapies (talking therapies, such as counseling or psychotherapy), and non-invasive brain stimulation.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out which treatments are effective for depression after stroke. They looked at different types of treatments, including medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapies, and combinations of these. They aimed to determine the benefits and harms of these treatments and to identify which ones work best to reduce depression in people who have had a stroke.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 5831 people with depression after stroke. The studies were conducted in various countries and included people with depression after stroke. The types of interventions and comparisons included pharmacological interventions (medications), non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combinations of these. Most studies compared these interventions with placebo (a dummy treatment), sham stimulation (a fake treatment), or usual care.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nThe review found that medications, psychological therapy, and combination therapies may reduce depression, but non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect. Medications were associated with side effects related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nHow did we find this information?\nWe searched for studies comparing treatments for depression after stroke, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We used a systematic approach to identify and evaluate the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (risk of bias), and the studies were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nWe need to make the language easier to understand and reduce the use of technical terms. For example, instead of saying \"Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations of current studies,\" we can say \"Future studies should follow people for longer to see how they do over time. We also need stronger evidence to know how well different treatments work and if they are safe for people who have had a stroke.\" Additionally, we should remove repeated information to make the summary clearer and more concise. \n\nWhat is depression after stroke?\nDepression is a common condition that can happen after someone has a stroke. It affects how well they recover and their quality of life. Depression after stroke can be hard to find and may not be treated correctly. Treatments for depression include medications, talking therapies, and a technique called non-invasive brain stimulation.\n\nWhat did the researchers want to find out?\nThe researchers wanted to know which treatments work best for depression after stroke. They looked at different types of treatments, including medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, talking therapies, and combinations of these. They wanted to know the benefits and harms of these treatments and which ones reduce depression in people who have had a stroke.\n\nWhat did the researchers find?\nThe researchers found 65 studies with 5831 people who had depression after stroke. These studies were done in different countries and included people with depression after stroke. The studies compared different treatments, such as medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, talking therapies, and combinations of these, with dummy treatments or usual care.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nThe researchers found that medications, talking therapies, and combination treatments may reduce depression. However, non-invasive brain stimulation did not have much effect. Medications were associated with side effects related to the brain and digestive system.\n\nHow did the researchers find this information?\nThe researchers searched for studies comparing treatments for depression after stroke. They summarized the results and rated how confident they were in the evidence. They used a systematic approach to find and evaluate the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has limitations because the studies were small, and participants may have known which treatment they received. The studies also included a wide mix of people and used different methods to deliver the treatments.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current up to February 2022.\n\nFuture studies should follow people for longer to see how they do over time. We also need stronger evidence to know how well different treatments work and if they are safe for people who have had a stroke. The evidence is limited because the studies included a wide mix of people, and the treatments were given in different ways. This makes it hard to compare the results.",

Please delete the first version and refine the second. Additionally, the required 'Key Messages' section is missing, and the pronoun use is inconsistent with Cochrane style guidelines.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Remove the entire first draft and reinstate the 'Key Messages' section.** The current text includes two summaries. Please remove the first one. A Plain Language Summary must begin with a bulleted 'Key Messages' section to give readers the main findings immediately. You can create this by summarizing the main results from your second draft.\n\n2.  **Use 'we' instead of 'the researchers' consistently.** The Cochrane style guide requires using the first person ('we') to refer to the review authors. This makes the summary more direct and engaging for the reader.\n    *   **Instead of:** \"What did the researchers want to find out?\"\n    *   **Please use:** \"What did we want to find out?\"\n    *   **Action:** Please change \"the researchers\" to \"we\" throughout the summary.\n\n3.  **Use more direct, active language.** Some sentences are a bit formal or use the passive voice, which can make them harder to understand. Using stronger verbs will make the findings clearer.\n    *   **For example:** \"Medications were associated with side effects related to the brain and digestive system.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found that medications may cause side effects, such as problems with the brain or digestion.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are based on a word count of 1041, which is over the 850-word limit. This is because the analysis was run on a document containing two duplicated versions of the summary. This duplication has significantly skewed the metrics, causing 6 features (including `nouns`, `complex_words`, `long_words`, and `nominalization`) to be rated 'BEYOND_P90'. While the scores for vocabulary complexity are likely inflated, the high ratings for `passive_voice` (P90) and `nominalization` (BEYOND_P90) support the editorial feedback to use more active, verb-driven language for better clarity."
