  "draft": "What are the best treatments for depression after a stroke, and how well do they work?\n\n- Very low-certainty evidence suggests that medications and psychological therapies may reduce depression after a stroke, but non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect. Medications may have unwanted side effects, such as problems with the brain or digestion.\n- The current evidence does not allow for firm conclusions about the best treatment approach for depression after a stroke, and more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of different treatments.\n- Future studies should follow people for longer to see how they do over time, and we need stronger evidence to know how well different treatments work and if they are safe for people who have had a stroke.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke?\nDepression is a common condition that can happen after someone has a stroke. It affects how well they recover and their quality of life. Depression after stroke can be hard to find and may not be treated correctly. Common treatments for depression include medications, psychological therapy (also called 'talking therapy'), and non-invasive brain stimulation (using magnetic or electrical currents to stimulate the brain without surgery).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know which treatments work best for depression after stroke. We looked at different types of treatments, including medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combinations of these. We wanted to know the benefits and harms of these treatments and which ones reduce depression in people who have had a stroke.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 5831 people with depression after stroke. These studies were done in different countries and included people with depression after stroke. The studies compared different treatments, such as medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combinations of these, with dummy treatments or usual care.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nWe found that medications, psychological therapy, and combination treatments may reduce depression. However, non-invasive brain stimulation did not have much effect. We found that medications may cause side effects, such as problems with the brain or digestion.\n\nHow did we find this information?\nWe searched for all relevant studies, known as randomised controlled trials, on this topic. We found 65 studies, compared and summarized their results, and then rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has limitations because the studies were small, and participants may have known which treatment they received. The studies also included a wide mix of people and used different methods to deliver the treatments.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current up to February 2022.",
