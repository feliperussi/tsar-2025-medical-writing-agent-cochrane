  "draft": "What are the best treatments for depression after a stroke, and how well do they work?\n- Very low-certainty evidence suggests that medications, psychological therapies, and combination therapies can reduce depression after a stroke. However, these treatments may have unwanted effects, such as side effects related to the central nervous system (the system that includes the brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal tract (the digestive system). Non-invasive brain stimulation (a technique that uses magnetic or electrical currents to stimulate brain activity without surgery) had little to no effect on depression.\n- The current evidence does not allow for firm conclusions about the best treatment approach for depression after a stroke. More research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of different treatments, including their effects on specific subgroups of the population.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations of current studies, such as the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for more robust evidence on the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for depression after a stroke.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke?\nDepression is a common and serious condition that can occur after a person has a stroke. It can impact a person's recovery and quality of life. Depression after stroke can be hard to detect and may not be treated properly. Common treatments for depression include medications (drugs used to treat depression), psychological therapies (talking therapies, such as counseling or psychotherapy), and non-invasive brain stimulation.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out which treatments are effective for depression after stroke. They looked at different types of treatments, including medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapies, and combinations of these. They aimed to determine the benefits and harms of these treatments and to identify which ones work best to reduce depression in people who have had a stroke.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 5831 people with depression after stroke. The studies were conducted in various countries and included people with depression after stroke. The types of interventions and comparisons included pharmacological interventions (medications), non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combinations of these. Most studies compared these interventions with placebo (a dummy treatment), sham stimulation (a fake treatment), or usual care.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nThe review found that medications, psychological therapy, and combination therapies may reduce depression, but non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect. Medications were associated with side effects related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nHow did we find this information?\nWe searched for studies comparing treatments for depression after stroke, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence. We used a systematic approach to identify and evaluate the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (risk of bias), and the studies were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Very low-certainty evidence suggests that medications, psychological therapies, and combination therapies can reduce depression after a stroke, but may have unwanted effects.\n- The current evidence does not allow for firm conclusions about the best treatment approach for depression after a stroke.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations of current studies, such as the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for more robust evidence on the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for depression after a stroke.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It is factually accurate and covers all the required sections. However, it needs some revisions to make it easier for patients to read and understand, as the language is often too technical and dense. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns with active verbs.** Many sentences are heavy with abstract nouns instead of direct verbs, which makes them hard to follow. This is often called 'nominalization'.\n   - **Example:** \"Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations of current studies, such as the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for more robust evidence on the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for depression after a stroke.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is packed with abstract concepts ('addressing', 'limitations', 'lack', 'need', 'effectiveness'), making it dense and difficult to process.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future studies should follow people for longer to see how they do over time. We also need stronger evidence to know how well different treatments work and if they are safe for people who have had a stroke.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex and technical language.** The summary uses some technical terms that will be unfamiliar to a lay audience.\n   - **Example:** \"The evidence is limited because... the studies were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like 'heterogeneous populations' and 'delivery methods' are research jargon. Readers may not understand why these are limitations.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because... the studies included a wide mix of people, and the treatments were given in different ways. This makes it hard to compare the results.\"\n\n3. **Remove repeated information for a clearer structure.** The key messages are presented in full at the very beginning and then repeated verbatim at the end.\n   - **Example:** The entire three-bullet list from the top of the summary is repeated under the \"Key messages:\" heading at the bottom.\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Repeating the main findings makes the summary longer than necessary and can feel confusing to the reader. The standard format is to present these key messages once, at the beginning.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Please remove the final 'Key messages' section and its content. The summary already starts effectively with these points.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a very high number of nominalizations and complex words, resulting in a SMOG index of 15. This indicates the text requires a university-level reading ability, which is too high for a general audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While sentence length and active voice are within acceptable ranges, the summary deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence construction. Key metrics like the SMOG index (readability), nominalization (use of noun-forms of verbs), and counts of complex and long words are in the highest 10th percentile (P90 or beyond), indicating the text is likely too technical and dense for a lay audience."
