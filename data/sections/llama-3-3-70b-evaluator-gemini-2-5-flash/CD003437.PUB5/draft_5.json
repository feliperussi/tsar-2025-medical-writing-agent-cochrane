  "draft": "What are the best treatments for depression after a stroke, and how well do they work?\n\n- Very low-certainty evidence suggests that medications, psychological therapies, and combination therapies can reduce depression after a stroke, but may have unwanted effects such as side effects related to the central nervous system (the system that includes the brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal tract (the digestive system, which includes the stomach and intestines).\n- The current evidence does not allow for firm conclusions about the best treatment approach for depression after a stroke, and more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of different treatments.\n- Future studies should follow people for longer to see how they do over time, and we need stronger evidence to know how well different treatments work and if they are safe for people who have had a stroke.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke?\nDepression is a common condition that can happen after someone has a stroke. It affects how well they recover and their quality of life. Depression after stroke can be hard to find and may not be treated correctly. Treatments for depression include medications (drugs used to treat depression), talking therapies (such as counseling or psychotherapy), and a technique called non-invasive brain stimulation (a method that uses magnetic or electrical currents to stimulate brain activity without surgery).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know which treatments work best for depression after stroke. We looked at different types of treatments, including medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, talking therapies, and combinations of these. We wanted to know the benefits and harms of these treatments and which ones reduce depression in people who have had a stroke.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 5831 people with depression after stroke. These studies were done in different countries and included people with depression after stroke. The studies compared different treatments, such as medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, talking therapies, and combinations of these, with dummy treatments or usual care.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nWe found that medications, talking therapies, and combination treatments may reduce depression. However, non-invasive brain stimulation did not have much effect. We found that medications may cause side effects, such as problems with the brain or digestion.\n\nHow did we find this information?\nWe searched for studies comparing treatments for depression after stroke. We summarized the results and rated how confident we were in the evidence. We used a systematic approach to find and evaluate the studies.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has limitations because the studies were small, and participants may have known which treatment they received. The studies also included a wide mix of people and used different methods to deliver the treatments.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current up to February 2022.\n\nFuture studies should follow people for longer to see how they do over time. We also need stronger evidence to know how well different treatments work and if they are safe for people who have had a stroke. The evidence is limited because the studies included a wide mix of people, and the treatments were given in different ways. This makes it hard to compare the results.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start with excellent readability scores. However, it is not approved because of a few key issues that affect clarity and structure. Please address the following points to finalize the summary:\n\n1. **Remove the redundant final paragraph.** The last paragraph of the summary repeats information that is already provided in the key messages and under the 'What are the limitations of the evidence?' section. This makes the ending feel repetitive.\n   - **QUOTE:** \"Future studies should follow people for longer to see how they do over time. We also need stronger evidence to know how well different treatments work and if they are safe for people who have had a stroke. The evidence is limited because the studies included a wide mix of people, and the treatments were given in different ways. This makes it hard to compare the results.\"\n   - **SUGGESTION:** Delete this entire paragraph. The summary is stronger and more concise without it.\n\n2. **Use consistent terminology for therapies.** The summary switches between 'psychological therapies' and 'talking therapies', which could confuse readers about whether these are different treatments.\n   - **QUOTE:** The key message uses \"psychological therapies\", while the introduction uses \"talking therapies (such as counseling or psychotherapy)\".\n   - **SUGGESTION:** Choose one term, define it, and use it consistently throughout the text. For example, introduce it as 'psychological therapy (also called talking therapy)' and then use 'psychological therapy' for the rest of the summary.\n\n3. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with direct verbs.** The summary sometimes uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which can make sentences less direct and active. This was also flagged by the linguistic analysis.\n   - **QUOTE:** \"We used a systematic approach to find and evaluate the studies.\"\n   - **SUGGESTION:** Rewrite with a direct verb to be more concise and active. For example: \"We systematically searched for and evaluated studies.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. Sentence length and use of active voice are excellent. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: 'nominalization' (the use of noun-form verbs) is in the P90 range, with 21 instances where the typical median is under 13. This supports the editorial feedback to replace noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs to improve clarity."
