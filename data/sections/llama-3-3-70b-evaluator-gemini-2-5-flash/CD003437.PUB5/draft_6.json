  "draft": "What are the best treatments for depression after a stroke, and how well do they work?\n\n- Very low-certainty evidence suggests that medications, psychological therapy (also called talking therapy), and combination therapies can reduce depression after a stroke, but may have unwanted effects such as side effects related to the central nervous system (the system that includes the brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal tract (the digestive system, which includes the stomach and intestines).\n- The current evidence does not allow for firm conclusions about the best treatment approach for depression after a stroke, and more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of different treatments.\n- Future studies should follow people for longer to see how they do over time, and we need stronger evidence to know how well different treatments work and if they are safe for people who have had a stroke.\n\nWhat is depression after stroke?\nDepression is a common condition that can happen after someone has a stroke. It affects how well they recover and their quality of life. Depression after stroke can be hard to find and may not be treated correctly. Treatments for depression include medications (drugs used to treat depression), psychological therapy (also called talking therapy, such as counseling or psychotherapy), and a technique called non-invasive brain stimulation (a method that uses magnetic or electrical currents to stimulate brain activity without surgery).\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to know which treatments work best for depression after stroke. We looked at different types of treatments, including medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combinations of these. We wanted to know the benefits and harms of these treatments and which ones reduce depression in people who have had a stroke.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 5831 people with depression after stroke. These studies were done in different countries and included people with depression after stroke. The studies compared different treatments, such as medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combinations of these, with dummy treatments or usual care.\n\nWhat are the main results?\nWe found that medications, psychological therapy, and combination treatments may reduce depression. However, non-invasive brain stimulation did not have much effect. We found that medications may cause side effects, such as problems with the brain or digestion.\n\nHow did we find this information?\nWe systematically searched for and evaluated studies comparing treatments for depression after stroke. We summarized the results and rated how confident we were in the evidence.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has limitations because the studies were small, and participants may have known which treatment they received. The studies also included a wide mix of people and used different methods to deliver the treatments.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is current up to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is NOT APPROVED. While the writing is clear and readable, it fails a critical check for factual accuracy. A key message is incomplete, which misrepresents the review's findings. Please address the following issues, starting with the critical one:\n\n**1. CRITICAL: Complete the First Key Message**\nA main finding of the review is missing from the first key message, giving readers an incomplete summary.\n\n- **Original Text:** 'Very low-certainty evidence suggests that medications, psychological therapy (also called talking therapy), and combination therapies can reduce depression after a stroke, but may have unwanted effects...'\n- **The Problem:** This omits the finding that non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect. This is a crucial part of the review's conclusion and must be included for accuracy.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Very low-certainty evidence suggests that medications and psychological therapies may reduce depression after a stroke, but non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect. Medications may have unwanted side effects.'\n\n**2. Simplify Definitions and Reduce Wordiness**\nSome sentences contain redundant explanations that can be streamlined to improve flow and conciseness.\n\n- **Original Text:** 'Treatments for depression include medications (drugs used to treat depression), psychological therapy (also called talking therapy, such as counseling or psychotherapy), and a technique called non-invasive brain stimulation (a method that uses magnetic or electrical currents to stimulate brain activity without surgery).'\n- **The Problem:** The phrase 'medications (drugs used to treat depression)' is redundant. The sentence is also long and lists multiple definitions, which can be simplified.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Common treatments include medications, psychological therapy (also called 'talking therapy'), and non-invasive brain stimulation (using magnetic or electrical currents to stimulate the brain without surgery).'\n\n**3. Make the Methods Section More Informative**\nThe description of the methods is too generic and misses an opportunity to build reader trust by providing more context.\n\n- **Original Text:** 'We systematically searched for and evaluated studies comparing treatments for depression after stroke. We summarized the results and rated how confident we were in the evidence.'\n- **The Problem:** This doesn't tell the reader anything specific about the evidence base. Mentioning the number of studies adds important context that is already available in the results section.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We searched for all relevant studies, known as randomised controlled trials, on this topic. We found 65 studies, compared and summarized their results, and then rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n\nOnce the critical factual issue is corrected, this will be a very strong Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical PLS. An impressive 88.9% of the 18 metrics fall within the best quartile for readability and clarity (e.g., words_per_sentence at 18.56 is in the P25 range; Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 10.84 is also P25). This indicates excellent sentence structure and vocabulary choice. The editorial review identified a critical factual omission and opportunities for improved conciseness that are not captured by the metrics."
