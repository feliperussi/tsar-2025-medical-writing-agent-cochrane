  "draft": "# What are the best treatments for depression after a stroke, and how well do they work?\n**Key Messages**\n- Very low-certainty evidence suggests that pharmacological, psychological and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression after a stroke, but may have unwanted effects such as adverse events related to the central nervous system (the part of the body that includes the brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal tract (the part of the body that includes the stomach and intestines).\n- Non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on the prevalence of depression, and more research is needed to understand its potential benefits and harms.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for more robust evidence, to provide clearer guidance on the best treatments for depression after a stroke.\n**Introduction**\n### What is depression after stroke and why is it a problem?\nDepression is a common condition that can occur after someone has a stroke. It can impact a person's recovery and quality of life. Depression after stroke is often not detected or treated properly, which can make it harder for people to get better. Common treatments for depression include medications, psychological therapies, and non-invasive brain stimulation. However, it's not clear which of these treatments work best for people with depression after stroke.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe authors of this review wanted to find out which treatments are most effective for depression after stroke. They looked at different types of treatments, including medications, psychological therapies, non-invasive brain stimulation, and combinations of these. They wanted to know which treatments reduce the symptoms of depression, improve quality of life, and have the fewest side effects. They also wanted to find out if some treatments work better than others for certain people.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing treatments for depression after stroke, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 5831 people with depression after stroke. The studies were conducted in various countries and settings, with a focus on comparing different interventions such as pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation, and psychological therapy. The total duration of the studies is not specified, but they included a range of populations with varying severity of depression. Most studies compared these interventions to placebo, sham stimulation, or usual care, with some also examining combination therapies. Unfortunately, no studies were found for certain comparisons of interest, including some combination therapies. The review found that pharmacological interventions, psychological therapy, and combination therapies may reduce the prevalence of depression, but non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect. Pharmacological interventions were associated with more adverse events related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. It is unclear if these interventions have an effect on outcome.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and the studies involved different types of participants and used varied ways of delivering the intervention.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to critical issues in factual accuracy and adherence to style guidelines, as well as significant clarity and vocabulary complexity issues. The statement 'It is unclear if these interventions have an effect on outcome' in the Results section is misleading and contradicts other findings presented in the draft and the original abstract. Additionally, three subheadings ('Methods', 'Limitations', 'Currency') are not phrased as questions, violating the master style guide. The text also frequently uses technical jargon without sufficient explanation and contains long, complex sentences, making it difficult for a lay audience to understand. The linguistic metrics confirm a higher-than-typical use of complex words and nominalization, contributing to these clarity problems.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with PLS patterns, with 16.7% of features in the best quartile and 55.6% in the median range. However, 27.8% of features deviate from typical patterns (P90 range). Specifically, 'nominalization' (25.0), 'nouns' (166.0), 'smog_index' (13.95), 'complex_words_dc' (230.0), and 'long_words' (178.0) are all in the P90 range, indicating a higher-than-typical level of vocabulary complexity and noun-heavy phrasing. These deviations suggest that the text could benefit from simpler language, shorter words, and more active verb constructions to improve readability for the target audience."
