  "draft": "# What are the best treatments for depression after a stroke, and how well do they work?\n**Key Messages**\n- Very low-certainty evidence suggests that pharmacological, psychological and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression after a stroke, but may have unwanted effects such as adverse events related to the central nervous system (the system that includes the brain and spinal cord) and the gastrointestinal tract (the digestive system), while non-invasive brain stimulation (a technique that uses magnetic or electrical currents to stimulate brain activity without surgery) had little to no effect on the prevalence of depression.\n- The current evidence does not allow for firm conclusions about the best treatment approach for depression after a stroke, and more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and harms of different treatments, including their effects on specific subgroups of the population.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations of current studies, such as the lack of long-term follow-up and the need for more robust evidence on the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for depression after a stroke, in order to inform decision-making and improve patient outcomes.\n**Introduction**\n### What is depression after stroke?\nDepression is a common and serious condition that can occur after a person has a stroke. It can impact a person's recovery and quality of life. Depression after stroke can be hard to detect and may not be treated properly. Common treatments for depression include medications, psychological therapies, and non-invasive brain stimulation.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out which treatments are effective for depression after stroke. They looked at different types of treatments, including medications, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapies, and combinations of these. They aimed to determine the benefits and harms of these treatments and to identify which ones work best to reduce depression in people who have had a stroke.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing treatments for depression after stroke, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 65 studies that involved 5831 people with depression after stroke. The studies were conducted in various countries and included people with depression after stroke. The types of interventions and comparisons included pharmacological interventions, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, and combinations of these. Most studies compared these interventions with placebo, sham stimulation, or usual care. We found no trials for some combinations of interventions.\n### Main results: Treatment of depression after stroke\nThe review found that pharmacological interventions, psychological therapy, and combination therapies may reduce the prevalence of depression, but non-invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect. Pharmacological interventions were associated with adverse events related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. It is unclear if these interventions have an effect on outcome.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of which treatment they received (risk of bias), and the studies were conducted in heterogeneous populations using different delivery methods.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a direct violation of the style guide. The language is often too complex, with excessively long sentences and a high density of technical terms, nouns, and nominalizations, particularly in the Key Messages and Results sections. This makes the text challenging for a patient audience to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 10 features in the best quartile and 2 in the median range. However, 6 features deviate significantly from typical patterns (P90 range), indicating areas for improvement. Specifically, the text has a high `smog_index` (14.22), `complex_words_dc` (237.0), `complex_words` (126.0), and `long_words` (180.0), all in the P90 range, suggesting the vocabulary is more complex than typical PLS texts. Additionally, `nominalization` (24.0) and `nouns` (172.0) are also in the P90 range, indicating a noun-heavy writing style. These metrics support the need to simplify language, reduce sentence length, and use more active verbs to enhance readability."
