  "draft": "# Is using a special tool with a camera (videolaryngoscopy) better than traditional methods (direct laryngoscopy) for helping newborn babies breathe?\n**Key Messages**\n- Videolaryngoscopy (a special tool with a camera that helps doctors see the airway) may increase the success of helping newborn babies breathe on the first attempt and may result in fewer attempts, but it may not reduce the time required for successful intubation (putting a tube into the airway to help with breathing), and no harmful effects were reported in the studies.\n- Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a slight reduction in airway trauma (injury to the airway) during intubation attempts, which could be beneficial for newborn babies, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Future research should focus on well-designed studies to confirm the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation in newborn babies, including its potential benefits and harms, to provide more reliable evidence for healthcare decisions.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of establishing a secure airway in neonates?\nEstablishing a secure airway is a critical part of neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room and the neonatal intensive care unit. Neonates, or newborns, often require endotracheal intubation to help them breathe. However, this procedure can be challenging and may lead to adverse consequences if not performed successfully. Delays in airway stabilization can have serious effects on the neonate's health.\n### What are the common methods for tracheal intubation in neonates?\nThere are two common methods for tracheal intubation in neonates: direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy. Direct laryngoscopy involves using a laryngoscope to visualize the vocal cords and guide the endotracheal tube into the trachea. Videolaryngoscopy, on the other hand, uses a video camera to provide a view of the airway, which can enhance visualization of the glottis and increase the success rate of intubation.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy in decreasing the time and attempts required for endotracheal intubation and increasing the success rate on the first intubation attempt in neonates. They also aimed to investigate the potential benefits and harms of videolaryngoscopy in this population.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search for studies that compared videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy in neonates.\n### Data Synthesis\nThe results of the identified studies were summarized, and we assessed our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 759 intubation attempts in neonates. The studies were conducted in international hospitals and included neonates of either sex, undergoing endotracheal intubation. Different videolaryngoscopy devices, including C-MAC, Airtraq, and Glidescope, were used in the studies. The population characteristics included neonates aged 0 to 28 days. The studies compared videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation. No information was available on the study funding sources or the duration of the studies. Videolaryngoscopy may increase the success of intubation on the first attempt and may result in fewer intubation attempts, but may not reduce the time required for successful intubation. Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a reduced incidence of airway-related adverse effects.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were likely unblinded (participants may have known which treatment they received) and the sample sizes were very small.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022.",
