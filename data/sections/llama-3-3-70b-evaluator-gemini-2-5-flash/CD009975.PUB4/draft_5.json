  "draft": "Is using a special tool with a camera (videolaryngoscopy) better than traditional methods (direct laryngoscopy) for helping newborn babies breathe?\n\nKey Messages\n- We found that using a videolaryngoscope may help doctors succeed on the first try and lead to fewer attempts overall. However, it might not make the process faster. \n- Videolaryngoscopy likely causes slightly less injury to the baby's airway.\n- Future studies should confirm if videolaryngoscopy is effective and safe for intubating newborn babies. This will give doctors better evidence to make decisions.\n\nWhy do some newborn babies need help with breathing?\nNewborn babies often have trouble breathing on their own, and doctors need to help them. If it takes too long to get the breathing tube in place, it can cause serious health problems for the baby. We need to find the best way to help newborns breathe when they are having trouble.\n\nWhat are the common methods for tracheal intubation in newborn babies?\nThere are two common methods for tracheal intubation in newborn babies: direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy. Direct laryngoscopy involves using a tool to view the vocal cords and guide the breathing tube into the windpipe. Videolaryngoscopy uses a video camera to provide a view of the airway, which can help doctors see the airway better and increase the success rate of intubation.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a videolaryngoscope is safer and more effective than a direct laryngoscope for intubating newborn babies. We looked at whether it reduced the time and number of tries needed and improved success on the first attempt.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registries for studies that compared videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy in newborn babies.\n\nHow did we analyze the data?\nWe combined the results from the studies we found. We then rated how certain we were about the evidence for the benefits and harms of videolaryngoscopy.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 759 intubation attempts in newborn babies. The studies were conducted in international hospitals and included newborn babies of either sex, undergoing endotracheal intubation. Different videolaryngoscopy devices, including C-MAC, Airtraq, and Glidescope, were used in the studies. We found that using a videolaryngoscope may help doctors succeed on the first try and lead to fewer attempts overall. However, it might not make the process faster. It also seems to cause slightly less injury to the baby's airway.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were likely unblinded (participants may have known which treatment they received) and the sample sizes were very small. This means we cannot be very certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022. We will continue to update the review as new evidence becomes available.",

However, a few minor revisions are needed to remove technical jargon from headings and better contextualize the findings for a lay audience before it can be approved.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify a key subheading to remove medical jargon.** The term 'tracheal intubation' may be unfamiliar to readers and create a barrier to understanding.\n    - **Problematic Text:** \"What are the common methods for tracheal intubation in newborn babies?\"\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"How do doctors help newborn babies breathe using a breathing tube?\"\n\n2. **Make the first key message more direct and concise.** Key messages should be as scannable as possible. The current version is slightly long and combines three separate findings.\n    - **Problematic Text:** \"We found that using a videolaryngoscope may help doctors succeed on the first try and lead to fewer attempts overall. However, it might not make the process faster.\"\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Using a videolaryngoscope may help doctors place the breathing tube on the first try and with fewer attempts, but it may not be a faster method.\"\n\n3. **Briefly mention the evidence certainty in the main results.** The abstract specifies 'low-certainty' and 'moderate-certainty' evidence. Including this context helps readers understand how confident we are in the findings.\n    - **Problematic Text:** \"We found that using a videolaryngoscope may help doctors succeed on the first try and lead to fewer attempts overall.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are excellent, indicating the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 83.3% of metrics fall within the best quartile for readability and clarity (e.g., words_per_sentence is 15.45, and passive_voice is very low at 7 instances). All readability scores are strong, suggesting the text is easy to understand. The feedback provided focuses on minor content and phrasing improvements rather than addressing any significant linguistic issues."
