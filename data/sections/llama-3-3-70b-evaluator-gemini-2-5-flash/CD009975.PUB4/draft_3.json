  "draft": "Is using a special tool with a camera (videolaryngoscopy) better than traditional methods (direct laryngoscopy) for helping newborn babies breathe?\n\nKey Messages\n- Videolaryngoscopy (a special tool with a camera that helps doctors see the airway) may increase the success of helping newborn babies breathe on the first attempt and may result in fewer attempts, but it may not reduce the time required for successful intubation (putting a tube into the airway to help with breathing), and no harmful effects were reported in the studies.\n- Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a slight reduction in airway trauma (injury to the airway) during intubation attempts, which could be beneficial for newborn babies, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Future research should focus on well-designed studies to confirm the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation in newborn babies, including its potential benefits and harms, to provide more reliable evidence for healthcare decisions.\n\nWhat is the problem of establishing a secure airway in neonates?\nMaking sure a newborn baby can breathe properly is a critical first step for doctors. If it takes too long to get the breathing tube in place, it can cause serious health problems for the baby. We need to find the best way to help newborns breathe when they are having trouble.\n\nWhat are the common methods for tracheal intubation in neonates?\nThere are two common methods for tracheal intubation in neonates: direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy. Direct laryngoscopy involves using a laryngoscope (a tool to view the vocal cords) to guide the endotracheal tube into the trachea (windpipe). Videolaryngoscopy uses a video camera to provide a view of the airway, which can enhance visualization of the glottis (the space between the vocal cords) and increase the success rate of intubation.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a videolaryngoscope is safer and more effective than a direct laryngoscope for intubating newborns. We looked at whether it reduced the time and number of tries needed and improved success on the first attempt.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies that compared videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy in neonates. We searched several databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and BIOSIS, and also looked at abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies, clinical trials registries, and reference lists of relevant studies.\n\nHow did we analyze the data?\nWe summarized the results of the identified studies and assessed our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 759 intubation attempts in neonates. The studies were conducted in international hospitals and included neonates of either sex, undergoing endotracheal intubation. Different videolaryngoscopy devices, including C-MAC, Airtraq, and Glidescope, were used in the studies. Videolaryngoscopy may increase the success of intubation on the first attempt and may result in fewer intubation attempts, but may not reduce the time required for successful intubation. Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a reduced incidence of airway-related adverse effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were likely unblinded (participants may have known which treatment they received) and the sample sizes were very small. This means we cannot be very certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022. We will continue to update the review as new evidence becomes available.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved due to a critical factual inaccuracy in the key messages and several areas where clarity can be significantly improved for a lay audience. The summary is well-structured, but the language is often too technical and indirect.\n\n**Critical Issue: Factual Inaccuracy**\n\n*   **Problem:** The first key message makes a factually incorrect statement that contradicts the review's findings.\n*   **Quote:** \"...and no harmful effects were reported in the studies.\"\n*   **Explanation:** This is inaccurate. The review *did* report on harmful effects (airway trauma) and found that videolaryngoscopy *reduced* them. This point is correctly stated in the second key message, creating a confusing contradiction for the reader.\n*   **Suggestion:** Remove the inaccurate phrase. The key message is stronger and more accurate without it. Rewrite as: \"Videolaryngoscopy... may increase the success of helping newborn babies breathe on the first attempt and may result in fewer attempts, but it may not reduce the time required for successful intubation (putting a tube into the airway to help with breathing).\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed**\n\n1.  **Replace Technical Jargon with Simpler Language**\n\n*   **Problem:** The summary uses clinical terms that a patient or parent may not understand, even with definitions.\n*   **Quote:** \"What is the problem of establishing a secure airway in neonates?\"\n*   **Explanation:** \"Establishing a secure airway\" is jargon. The question can be phrased in a much more direct and accessible way.\n*   **Suggestion:** Rephrase the question to be more patient-centric. For example: \"Why do some newborn babies need help with breathing?\"\n\n2.  **Use More Direct Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases (Nominalizations)**\n\n*   **Problem:** The text frequently uses nouns to describe actions, which makes sentences more abstract and harder to follow. This is supported by the high nominalization and noun counts in the evaluation.\n*   **Quote:** \"Videolaryngoscopy uses a video camera to provide a view of the airway, which can enhance visualization of the glottis...\"\n*   **Explanation:** Phrases like \"enhance visualization\" are indirect. Using simple, active verbs makes the meaning clearer.\n*   **Suggestion:** Rewrite to focus on the action. For example: \"Videolaryngoscopy uses a video camera that helps doctors see the airway better...\"\n\n3.  **Simplify Overly Detailed Methods**\n\n*   **Problem:** The methods section includes a long list of database names and technical sources that are not meaningful to a lay reader and increase the text's complexity.\n*   **Quote:** \"We searched several databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and BIOSIS, and also looked at abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies, clinical trials registries, and reference lists of relevant studies.\"\n*   **Explanation:** This level of detail is unnecessary for a plain language summary. The key information is that a thorough search was done.\n*   **Suggestion:** Simplify this to its core message. For example: \"We searched major medical databases and trial registries for studies that compared videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy in newborns.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with half of the metrics falling in the best quartile. However, there are significant deviations in vocabulary and sentence structure that impact clarity. The draft has an unusually high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), total nouns, long words, and complex words (Dale-Chall unfamiliar). These metrics, all in the P90 range, support the editorial feedback to simplify technical jargon and rewrite noun-heavy sentences using more direct verbs to improve readability for a lay audience."
