  "draft": "Is using a special tool with a camera (videolaryngoscopy) better than traditional methods (direct laryngoscopy) for helping newborn babies breathe?\n\nKey Messages\n- Videolaryngoscopy (a special tool with a camera that helps doctors see the airway) may increase the success of helping newborn babies breathe on the first attempt and may result in fewer attempts, but it may not reduce the time required for successful intubation (putting a tube into the airway to help with breathing).\n- Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a slight reduction in airway trauma (injury to the airway) during intubation attempts, which could be beneficial for newborn babies, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Future research should focus on well-designed studies to confirm the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation in newborn babies, including its potential benefits and harms, to provide more reliable evidence for healthcare decisions.\n\nWhy do some newborn babies need help with breathing?\nNewborn babies often have trouble breathing on their own, and doctors need to help them. If it takes too long to get the breathing tube in place, it can cause serious health problems for the baby. We need to find the best way to help newborns breathe when they are having trouble.\n\nWhat are the common methods for tracheal intubation in newborn babies?\nThere are two common methods for tracheal intubation in newborn babies: direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy. Direct laryngoscopy involves using a tool to view the vocal cords and guide the breathing tube into the windpipe. Videolaryngoscopy uses a video camera to provide a view of the airway, which can help doctors see the airway better and increase the success rate of intubation.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if using a videolaryngoscope is safer and more effective than a direct laryngoscope for intubating newborn babies. We looked at whether it reduced the time and number of tries needed and improved success on the first attempt.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe searched major medical databases and trial registries for studies that compared videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy in newborn babies.\n\nHow did we analyze the data?\nWe summarized the results of the identified studies and assessed our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 759 intubation attempts in newborn babies. The studies were conducted in international hospitals and included newborn babies of either sex, undergoing endotracheal intubation. Different videolaryngoscopy devices, including C-MAC, Airtraq, and Glidescope, were used in the studies. Videolaryngoscopy may increase the success of intubation on the first attempt and may result in fewer intubation attempts, but may not reduce the time required for successful intubation. Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a reduced incidence of airway-related adverse effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were likely unblinded (participants may have known which treatment they received) and the sample sizes were very small. This means we cannot be very certain about the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is this evidence?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022. We will continue to update the review as new evidence becomes available.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it can be made much easier for readers to understand by focusing on three key areas. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing that while overall readability is good, the text uses more complex words, long words, and noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations) than a typical Plain Language Summary.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with active verbs.** This makes sentences more direct and easier to follow. The high 'nominalization' score reflects this issue.\n   - **Instead of:** \"Future research should focus on well-designed studies to confirm the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation in newborn babies, including its potential benefits and harms, to provide more reliable evidence for healthcare decisions.\"\n   - **Consider:** \"Future studies should confirm if videolaryngoscopy is effective and safe for intubating newborn babies. This will give doctors better evidence to make decisions.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex and formal language.** Some sentences use unnecessarily formal words where simpler ones would be clearer. This is reflected in the high scores for 'complex_words_dc' and 'long_words'.\n   - **Instead of:** \"We summarized the results of the identified studies and assessed our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy.\"\n   - **Consider:** \"We combined the results from the studies we found. We then rated how certain we were about the evidence for the benefits and harms of videolaryngoscopy.\"\n\n3. **Rephrase findings instead of repeating them.** The 'What did we find?' section repeats the key messages and abstract, wording very closely. Rephrasing this in simpler terms will help reinforce the message for the reader.\n   - **Instead of:** \"Videolaryngoscopy may increase the success of intubation on the first attempt and may result in fewer intubation attempts, but may not reduce the time required for successful intubation. Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a reduced incidence of airway-related adverse effects.\"\n   - **Consider:** \"We found that using a videolaryngoscope may help doctors succeed on the first try and lead to fewer attempts overall. However, it might not make the process faster. It also seems to cause slightly less injury to the baby's airway.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 55.6% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure (e.g., words_per_sentence, active_voice). However, the analysis highlights significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Three key metrics are in the P90 range (higher than 90% of typical PLS texts): nominalization (noun-form verbs), complex_words_dc (unfamiliar words), and long_words. This suggests the summary would benefit from using more direct verbs and simpler, short word choices to better align with plain language principles."
