  "draft": "Is using a special tool with a camera (videolaryngoscopy) better than traditional methods (direct laryngoscopy) for helping newborn babies breathe?\n\nKey Messages\n- Videolaryngoscopy (a special tool with a camera that helps doctors see the airway) might make it more likely for doctors to successfully intubate newborn babies (put a tube into the airway to help with breathing) on the first try, and it might lead to fewer attempts. However, it may not shorten the time needed for intubation, and studies reported no harmful effects.\n- Videolaryngoscopy likely results in a slight reduction in airway trauma (injury to the airway) during intubation attempts, which could be beneficial for newborn babies, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Future research should focus on well-designed studies to confirm the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation in newborn babies, including its potential benefits and harms, to provide more reliable evidence for healthcare decisions.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is the problem of establishing a secure airway in neonates?\nEstablishing a secure airway is a critical part of neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room and the neonatal intensive care unit. Neonates, or newborns, often require endotracheal intubation to help them breathe. However, this procedure can be challenging and may lead to adverse consequences if not performed successfully. Delays in airway stabilization can have serious effects on the neonate's health.\n\nWhat are the common methods for tracheal intubation in neonates?\nThere are two common methods for tracheal intubation in neonates: direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy. Direct laryngoscopy involves using a laryngoscope to visualize the vocal cords and guide the endotracheal tube into the trachea. Videolaryngoscopy, on the other hand, uses a video camera to provide a view of the airway, which can enhance visualization of the glottis and increase the success rate of intubation.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy in decreasing the time and attempts required for endotracheal intubation and increasing the success rate on the first intubation attempt in neonates. They also aimed to investigate the potential benefits and harms of videolaryngoscopy in this population.\n\nMethods\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe performed a systematic search for studies that compared videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy in neonates.\n\nHow did we analyze the data?\nWe summarized the results of the identified studies, and we assessed our confidence in the evidence to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 759 intubation attempts in neonates. The studies were conducted in international hospitals and included neonates of either sex, undergoing endotracheal intubation. Different videolaryngoscopy devices, including C-MAC, Airtraq, and Glidescope, were used in the studies. The population characteristics included neonates aged 0 to 28 days. The studies compared videolaryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation. Videolaryngoscopy might make it more likely to successfully intubate on the first try and could lead to fewer attempts. However, it may not shorten the time needed for intubation. It also seems to slightly reduce airway-related problems.\n\nLimitations\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were likely unblinded (participants may have known which treatment they received) and the sample sizes were very small.\n\nCurrency\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs significant revisions to improve clarity and meet key style guide requirements before it can be approved.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Rephrase subheadings as questions.** Two subheadings do not follow the required question format, which is essential for guiding the reader.\n   - **Problem:** The subheadings \"Limitations\" and \"Currency\" are not questions.\n   - **Suggestion:** Please change them to \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\" and \"How up-to-date is this evidence?\"\n\n2. **Replace technical terms and noun-heavy phrases with simpler, more direct language.** The text often uses formal, academic language that can be difficult for a lay audience to understand. This is supported by the high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) found in the text.\n   - **Problem:** \"Establishing a secure airway is a critical part of neonatal resuscitation... Delays in airway stabilization can have serious effects...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Try rephrasing this to be more direct and active. For example: \"Making sure a newborn baby can breathe properly is a critical first step for doctors. If it takes too long to get the breathing tube in place, it can cause serious health problems for the baby.\"\n\n3. **Simplify long, complex sentences.** Some sentences contain multiple clauses and a lot of information, making them hard to follow in a single reading.\n   - **Problem:** \"The review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of videolaryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy in decreasing the time and attempts required for endotracheal intubation and increasing the success rate on the first intubation attempt in neonates.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Break this into shorter, more focused sentences. For example: \"We wanted to find out if using a videolaryngoscope is safer and more effective than a direct laryngoscope for intubating newborns. We looked at whether it reduced the time and number of tries needed and improved success on the first attempt.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary much more accessible and easier for patients and their families to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with only 27.8% of features falling in the best quartile. There are significant deviations from typical patterns that indicate the text is too complex and difficult to read. Key metrics like the SMOG index (BEYOND_P90) and Flesch Reading Ease (P10) suggest a high reading difficulty. This is driven by an extremely high number of nominalizations (BEYOND_P90) and a high density of complex, long, and unfamiliar words (all in the P90 range), which makes the text feel overly academic."
