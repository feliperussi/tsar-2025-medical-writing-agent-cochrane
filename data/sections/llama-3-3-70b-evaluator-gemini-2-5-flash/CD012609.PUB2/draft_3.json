  "draft": "Is infliximab effective in preventing Crohn's disease relapse?\n- Infliximab probably reduces the risk of clinical relapse in patients with Crohn's disease compared to placebo.\n- Infliximab combined with purine analogues probably reduces the risk of clinical relapse compared to purine analogues alone.\n- There may be little to no difference in the risk of clinical relapse between infliximab and a biosimilar.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease and why is it a problem?\nCrohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and irritation in the digestive tract. It can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. Current treatments for Crohn's disease often involve medications that reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system, as well as surgery in some cases. However, these treatments do not always work and can have significant side effects.\n\nWhat is infliximab and how does it work?\nInfliximab is a type of biologic medication, specifically a monoclonal antibody, that targets and neutralizes a protein called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is a substance in the body that promotes inflammation and is often found in high levels in people with Crohn's disease. By blocking TNF-alpha, infliximab can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms of Crohn's disease.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to review all the current evidence for using infliximab to manage Crohn's disease. We compared infliximab to placebo, other biologic medications, and conventional therapies, and looked at outcomes such as clinical relapse, loss of clinical response, and adverse events.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing infliximab to other treatments for Crohn's disease, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that involved 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies were conducted between 1999 and 2022, with seven studies including patients who had never taken a 'biologic' medication like infliximab before (these patients are called 'biologically-naive'). The other two studies included a mix of patients who had or had not taken these types of drugs before. Three studies included patients in clinical remission, five included patients with a mix of activity scores, and one study included patients with active disease at baseline. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 69 years old. All but one single-centre study were multicentre studies. Four studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, two had a mix of commercial and public funding, and two had public funding. The studies compared infliximab to placebo, purine analogues, biosimilar, and adalimumab, with various outcomes including clinical relapse, loss of clinical response, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawal due to adverse events.\n\nWhat are the main results for infliximab in Crohn's disease?\nInfliximab probably reduces the risk of a relapse compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment). For every 100 people taking a placebo, studies showed about 75 had a relapse. In comparison, for every 100 people taking infliximab, about 56 had a relapse. Infliximab combined with purine analogues is probably more effective in preventing clinical relapse than purine analogues alone. For every 100 people treated with infliximab and purine analogues, 12 may have a clinical relapse, compared to 59 out of 100 people treated with purine analogues alone. There may be little to no difference in the risk of clinical relapse between infliximab and a biosimilar. Infliximab may lead to more loss of clinical response than a biosimilar.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons:\n- The studies included only a small number of people.\n- Participants may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\n- The studies did not always report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",
