  "draft": "Is infliximab effective in preventing Crohn's disease relapse?\n- Infliximab probably reduces the risk of symptoms coming back in people with Crohn's disease compared to a dummy treatment. \n- For every 100 people taking a dummy treatment, about 75 had a relapse. In comparison, for every 100 people taking infliximab, about 56 did not have a relapse.\n- Infliximab combined with another type of medicine for Crohn's disease (called purine analogues) is probably more effective in preventing symptoms from coming back than purine analogues alone. \n- For every 100 people treated with infliximab and purine analogues, 12 may not have a clinical relapse, compared to 59 out of 100 people treated with purine analogues alone.\n- There may be little to no difference in the risk of symptoms coming back between infliximab and a biosimilar (a medicine that is a near-identical copy of another biologic medicine).\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease and why is it a problem?\nCrohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and irritation in the digestive tract. It can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. Current treatments for Crohn's disease often involve medications that reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system, as well as surgery in some cases. However, these treatments do not always work and can have significant side effects.\n\nWhat is infliximab and how does it work?\nInfliximab is a type of biologic medication, specifically a monoclonal antibody, that targets and neutralizes a protein called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is a substance in the body that promotes inflammation and is often found in high levels in people with Crohn's disease. By blocking TNF-alpha, infliximab can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms of Crohn's disease.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of infliximab for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. We compared infliximab to a dummy treatment, other biologic medications, and conventional therapies, and looked at outcomes such as clinical relapse, loss of clinical response, and adverse events.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing infliximab to other treatments for Crohn's disease, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that involved 1257 people with Crohn's disease. Infliximab probably reduces the risk of clinical relapse in patients with Crohn's disease compared to a dummy treatment. Infliximab combined with purine analogues probably reduces the risk of clinical relapse compared to purine analogues alone. There may be little to no difference in the risk of clinical relapse between infliximab and a biosimilar. Infliximab may lead to more loss of clinical response than a biosimilar.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons: \n- The studies included only a small number of people.\n- In some studies, it wasn't clear if people knew which treatment they were getting. When participants or doctors know who is getting the real medicine, it can unintentionally influence how they report symptoms. This is a potential source of bias that can affect our confidence in the results.\n- The studies did not always report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to August 2021.",

Additionally, the text uses overly complex and academic language, which makes it difficult for a lay audience to understand, as confirmed by multiple vocabulary-related metrics deviating from typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has good sentence structure, with 67% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. However, it significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics, including `smog_index` (P90), `complex_words` (P90), `long_words` (P90), and `nominalization` (P90), are in the highest 10th percentile. This indicates the text uses more difficult, long, and noun-form words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, reducing its overall clarity for a general audience."
