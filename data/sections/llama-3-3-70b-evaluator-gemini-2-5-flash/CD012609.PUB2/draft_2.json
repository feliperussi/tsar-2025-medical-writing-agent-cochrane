  "draft": "Is infliximab (a medication that helps reduce inflammation) effective in preventing Crohn's disease (a condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract) relapse?\n- Infliximab probably reduces the risk of clinical relapse in patients with Crohn's disease compared to placebo.\n- Infliximab combined with purine analogues probably reduces the risk of clinical relapse compared to purine analogues alone.\n- There may be little to no difference in the risk of clinical relapse between infliximab and a biosimilar.\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease and why is it a problem?\nCrohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and irritation in the digestive tract. It can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. Current treatments for Crohn's disease often involve medications that reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system, as well as surgery in some cases. However, these treatments do not always work and can have significant side effects.\n\nWhat is infliximab and how does it work?\nInfliximab is a type of biologic medication, specifically a monoclonal antibody, that targets and neutralizes a protein called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is a substance in the body that promotes inflammation and is often found in high levels in people with Crohn's disease. By blocking TNF-alpha, infliximab can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms of Crohn's disease.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of infliximab for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. They compared infliximab to placebo, other biologic medications, and conventional therapies, and looked at outcomes such as clinical relapse, loss of clinical response, and adverse events. The authors aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence on the use of infliximab in Crohn's disease management.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing infliximab to other treatments for Crohn's disease, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that involved 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies were conducted between 1999 and 2022, with seven studies including biologically-naive patients and two including a mix of naive and non-naive patients. Three studies included patients in clinical remission, five included patients with a mix of activity scores, and one study included biologic responders with active disease at baseline. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 69 years old. All but one single-centre study were multicentre studies. Four studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, two had a mix of commercial and public funding, and two had public funding. The studies compared infliximab to placebo, purine analogues, biosimilar, and adalimumab, with various outcomes including clinical relapse, loss of clinical response, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawal due to adverse events.\n\nWhat are the main results for infliximab in Crohn's disease?\nInfliximab probably reduces the risk of clinical relapse in patients with Crohn's disease compared to placebo. For every 100 people treated with infliximab, 56 may not have a clinical relapse, compared to 75 out of 100 people treated with placebo. Infliximab combined with purine analogues probably reduces the risk of clinical relapse compared to purine analogues alone. For every 100 people treated with infliximab and purine analogues, 12 may not have a clinical relapse, compared to 59 out of 100 people treated with purine analogues alone. There may be little to no difference in the risk of clinical relapse between infliximab and a biosimilar. Infliximab may lead to more loss of clinical response than a biosimilar. However, for outcomes like loss of clinical response or withdrawals due to adverse events, we could not draw any conclusions because the evidence was very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, potentially unblinded (participants may have known their treatment), did not report all outcomes of interest, and varied in participant populations and intervention delivery methods. Consequently, the findings may not be generalizable to all relevant people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is not approved due to a critical factual error in the main results and several major clarity issues that make it difficult for a lay audience to understand.\n\n**Critical Issue: Factual Error in Main Results**\nThe summary incorrectly reports the main numerical findings, which could seriously mislead readers.\n- **Original Text:** 'For every 100 people treated with infliximab, 56 may not have a clinical relapse, compared to 75 out of 100 people treated with placebo.'\n- **Problem:** This inverts the meaning of the data. The abstract indicates a relapse rate of 56% for infliximab vs. 75% for placebo. Your sentence describes the number of people who *did not* relapse and misinterprets the placebo figure.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Infliximab probably reduces the risk of a relapse compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment). For every 100 people taking a placebo, studies showed about 75 had a relapse. In comparison, for every 100 people taking infliximab, about 56 had a relapse.'\n- **Action:** Please apply this correction to all numerical results presented in the summary.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1.  **Explain Technical Jargon:** The text uses technical terms without explanation, which will confuse readers.\n    - **Original Text:** '...seven studies including biologically-naive patients and two including a mix of naive and non-naive patients.'\n    - **Problem:** 'Biologically-naive' is unexplained jargon a patient is unlikely to understand.\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Seven studies included patients who had never taken a 'biologic' medication like infliximab before (these patients are called 'biologically-naive'). The other two studies included a mix of patients who had or had not taken these types of drugs before.'\n\n2.  **Simplify Complex Sentences:** Long sentences that list multiple points are hard to follow. Break them up or use bullet points for clarity.\n    - **Original Text:** 'The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, potentially unblinded (participants may have known their treatment), did not report all outcomes of interest, and varied in participant populations and intervention delivery methods.'\n    - **Problem:** This 33-word sentence lists four distinct limitations, making it dense and difficult to absorb.\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons:\n      - The studies included only a small number of people.\n      - Participants may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\n      - The studies did not always report on all the outcomes we were interested in.'\n\n3.  **Use More Direct, Active Language:** The writing is often noun-heavy and academic, making it less engaging and clear.\n    - **Original Text:** 'The authors aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence on the use of infliximab in Crohn's disease management.'\n    - **Problem:** This sentence uses several 'nominalizations' (nouns made from verbs like 'overview', 'use', 'management') which makes it sound passive and indirect.\n    - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We aimed to review all the current evidence for using infliximab to manage Crohn's disease.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour draft's clarity issues are reflected in the linguistic metrics. The text scores very high on complexity (`SMOG Index: BEYOND_P90`), use of complex and long words (`complex_words` and `long_words: BEYOND_P90`), and reliance on nouns and nominalizations (`nouns: BEYOND_P90`, `nominalization: P90`). Addressing the points above will help bring these metrics closer to the typical range for a Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 27.8% of features in the best quartile. However, there is significant deviation in key areas related to readability and complexity. Five metrics, including the SMOG index, complex words, and long words, are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the vocabulary is much more complex than a typical PLS. Additionally, the high number of nouns and nominalizations suggests an academic writing style that should be simplified for a lay audience."
