      "content": "Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and irritation in the digestive tract. It can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. Current treatments for Crohn's disease often involve medications that reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system, as well as surgery in some cases. However, these treatments do not always work and can have significant side effects."

      "subheading": "What is infliximab and how does it work?",
      "content": "Infliximab is a type of biologic medication, specifically a monoclonal antibody, that targets and neutralizes a protein called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is a substance in the body that promotes inflammation and is often found in high levels in people with Crohn's disease. By blocking TNF-alpha, infliximab can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms of Crohn's disease."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of infliximab for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. They compared infliximab to placebo, other biologic medications, and conventional therapies, and looked at outcomes such as clinical relapse, loss of clinical response, and adverse events. The authors aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence on the use of infliximab in Crohn's disease management."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 9 studies that involved 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies were conducted between 1999 and 2022, with seven studies including biologically-naive patients and two including a mix of naive and non-naive patients. Three studies included patients in clinical remission, five included patients with a mix of activity scores, and one study included biologic responders with active disease at baseline. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 69 years old. All but one single-centre study were multicentre studies. Four studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, two had a mix of commercial and public funding, and two had public funding. The studies compared infliximab to placebo, purine analogues, biosimilar, and adalimumab, with various outcomes including clinical relapse, loss of clinical response, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawal due to adverse events."

      "content": "Infliximab probably reduces the risk of clinical relapse in patients with Crohn's disease compared to placebo. For every 100 people treated with infliximab, 56 may not have a clinical relapse, compared to 75 out of 100 people treated with placebo. Infliximab combined with purine analogues probably reduces the risk of clinical relapse compared to purine analogues alone. For every 100 people treated with infliximab and purine analogues, 12 may not have a clinical relapse, compared to 59 out of 100 people treated with purine analogues alone. There may be little to no difference in the risk of clinical relapse between infliximab and a biosimilar. Infliximab may lead to more loss of clinical response than a biosimilar."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, potentially unblinded (participants may have known their treatment), did not report all outcomes of interest, and varied in participant populations and intervention delivery methods. Consequently, the findings may not be generalizable to all relevant people, interventions, comparators, or outcomes.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to August 2021."
