  "draft": "Is infliximab effective in preventing Crohn's disease relapse?\n- Infliximab probably reduces the risk of symptoms coming back in people with Crohn's disease compared to a dummy treatment. \n- For every 100 people taking a dummy treatment, about 75 had a relapse. In comparison, for every 100 people taking infliximab, about 56 had a relapse.\n- Infliximab combined with another type of medicine for Crohn's disease (called purine analogues) is probably more effective in preventing symptoms from coming back than purine analogues alone. \n- For every 100 people treated with infliximab and purine analogues, 12 had a relapse, compared to 59 out of 100 people treated with purine analogues alone.\n- There may be little to no difference in the risk of symptoms coming back between infliximab and a biosimilar (a medicine that is a near-identical copy of another biologic medicine).\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease and why is it a problem?\nCrohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and irritation in the digestive tract. It can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. Current treatments often use drugs to lower swelling and calm the immune system. Surgery is also an option. But these treatments don't always work and can have major side effects.\n\nWhat is infliximab and how does it work?\nInfliximab is a type of biologic medication, specifically a monoclonal antibody, that targets and neutralizes a protein called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is a substance in the body that promotes inflammation and is often found in high levels in people with Crohn's disease. By blocking TNF-alpha, infliximab can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms of Crohn's disease.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how well and how safely infliximab works to keep Crohn's disease in remission. We compared infliximab to a dummy treatment, other biologic medications, and conventional therapies, and looked at outcomes such as clinical relapse, loss of clinical response, and adverse events.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing infliximab to other treatments for Crohn's disease, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that involved 1257 people with Crohn's disease. Infliximab probably reduces the risk of clinical relapse in patients with Crohn's disease compared to a dummy treatment. Infliximab combined with purine analogues probably reduces the risk of clinical relapse compared to purine analogues alone. There may be little to no difference in the risk of clinical relapse between infliximab and a biosimilar. Infliximab may lead to more loss of clinical response than a biosimilar.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons: \n- The studies included only a small number of people.\n- Some studies may not have been 'blinded', meaning participants and doctors might have known who was getting the real medicine. This knowledge can influence how symptoms are reported and reduces our confidence in the results.\n- The studies did not always report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",
