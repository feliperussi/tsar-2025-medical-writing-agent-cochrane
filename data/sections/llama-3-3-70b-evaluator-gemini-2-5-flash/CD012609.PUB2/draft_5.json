  "draft": "Is infliximab effective in preventing Crohn's disease relapse?\n- Infliximab probably reduces the risk of clinical relapse in patients with Crohn's disease compared to placebo.\n- Infliximab combined with another type of medicine for Crohn's disease (called purine analogues) is probably more effective in preventing clinical relapse than purine analogues alone.\n- There may be little to no difference in the risk of clinical relapse between infliximab and a biosimilar (a medicine that is a near-identical copy of another biologic medicine).\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease and why is it a problem?\nCrohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and irritation in the digestive tract. It can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. Current treatments for Crohn's disease often involve medications that reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system, as well as surgery in some cases. However, these treatments do not always work and can have significant side effects.\n\nWhat is infliximab and how does it work?\nInfliximab is a type of biologic medication, specifically a monoclonal antibody, that targets and neutralizes a protein called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is a substance in the body that promotes inflammation and is often found in high levels in people with Crohn's disease. By blocking TNF-alpha, infliximab can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms of Crohn's disease.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to review all the current evidence for using infliximab to manage Crohn's disease. We compared infliximab to placebo, other biologic medications, and conventional therapies, and looked at outcomes such as clinical relapse, loss of clinical response, and adverse events.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing infliximab to other treatments for Crohn's disease, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that included 1257 people with Crohn's disease. The studies included adults with different levels of symptoms. For some people, this was the first time they had taken a 'biologic' medicine, while others had tried them before.\n\nWhat are the main results for infliximab in Crohn's disease?\nInfliximab probably reduces the risk of a relapse compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment). For every 100 people taking a placebo, studies showed about 75 had a relapse. In comparison, for every 100 people taking infliximab, about 56 had a relapse. Infliximab combined with purine analogues is probably more effective in preventing clinical relapse than purine analogues alone. For every 100 people treated with infliximab and purine analogues, 12 may have a clinical relapse, compared to 59 out of 100 people treated with purine analogues alone. There may be little to no difference in the risk of clinical relapse between infliximab and a biosimilar. Infliximab may lead to more loss of clinical response than a biosimilar.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons:\n- The studies included only a small number of people.\n- Participants may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.\n- The studies did not always report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

While the sentences are short, the vocabulary is significantly more complex than in a typical Plain Language Summary, which will make it difficult for patients to understand. The PLS evaluation supports this, showing high scores for complex and long words (SMOG index, complex_words, and long_words are all in the P90 range).\n\nHere are the 3 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the description of what infliximab is.** The current explanation contains unnecessary jargon that could confuse readers.\n    *   **Problem:** 'Infliximab is a type of biologic medication, specifically a monoclonal antibody, that targets and neutralizes a protein called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'Infliximab is a type of medicine called a 'biologic'. It works by blocking a substance in the body called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) that causes swelling.'\n\n2. **Replace clinical jargon with everyday language.** The section explaining the review's goals uses terms that will be unfamiliar to most readers.\n    *   **Problem:** '...we looked at outcomes such as clinical relapse, loss of clinical response, and adverse events.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** '...we looked at how many people's symptoms came back (a relapse) and if people had any unwanted side effects.'\n\n3. **Make the limitations easier to understand.** The explanation of study limitations is too abstract and doesn't clearly explain the impact on the evidence.\n    *   **Problem:** 'Participants may have known which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'In some studies, people may have known if they were getting the real medicine or a dummy treatment. This can affect the results, because knowing you are on a real treatment can sometimes make you feel better.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft has excellent sentence structure, with short sentences and good use of active voice. However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics, including the SMOG index, complex words, and long words, are in the P90 range, indicating the language is much more technical and difficult than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. The main priority for revision is to simplify word choices."
