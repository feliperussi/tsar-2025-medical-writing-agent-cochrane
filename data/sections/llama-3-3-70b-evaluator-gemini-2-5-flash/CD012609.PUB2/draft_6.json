  "draft": "Is infliximab effective in preventing Crohn's disease relapse?\n- Infliximab probably reduces the risk of symptoms coming back in people with Crohn's disease compared to a dummy treatment.\n- Infliximab combined with another type of medicine for Crohn's disease (called purine analogues) is probably more effective in preventing symptoms from coming back than purine analogues alone.\n- There may be little to no difference in the risk of symptoms coming back between infliximab and a biosimilar (a medicine that is a near-identical copy of another biologic medicine).\n\nWhat is Crohn's disease and why is it a problem?\nCrohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and irritation in the digestive tract. It can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. Current treatments for Crohn's disease often involve medications that reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system, as well as surgery in some cases. However, these treatments do not always work and can have significant side effects.\n\nWhat is infliximab and how does it work?\nInfliximab is a type of medicine called a 'biologic'. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes swelling. \n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of infliximab for maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. We compared infliximab to a dummy treatment, other biologic medications, and conventional therapies, and looked at how many people's symptoms came back and if people had any unwanted side effects.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing infliximab to other treatments for Crohn's disease, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 9 studies that involved 1257 people with Crohn's disease. For every 100 people taking a dummy treatment, about 75 had a relapse. In comparison, for every 100 people taking infliximab, about 56 had a relapse. Infliximab combined with purine analogues is probably more effective in preventing symptoms from coming back than purine analogues alone. For every 100 people treated with infliximab and purine analogues, 12 may have a clinical relapse, compared to 59 out of 100 people treated with purine analogues alone. There may be little to no difference in the risk of symptoms coming back between infliximab and a biosimilar. Infliximab may lead to more loss of clinical response than a biosimilar.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for several reasons: \n- The studies included only a small number of people.\n- In some studies, people may have known if they were getting the real medicine or a dummy treatment. This can affect the results, because knowing you are on a real treatment can sometimes make you feel better.\n- The studies did not always report on all the outcomes we were interested in.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a very readable draft, but it must be revised as it fails critical checks for factual accuracy. The search date and key numerical findings in the results section directly contradict the provided SOURCE_OF_TRUTH document. Once these critical issues are resolved, please also address the clarity points below to further improve the summary for readers.\n\n**Critical Issues (Must Be Fixed)**\n\n1.  **Factual Error in Currency Date:** The search date is incorrect.\n    *   **In Draft:** \"The evidence is up to date to June 2023.\"\n    *   **Source of Truth:** \"The evidence is up to date to August 2021.\"\n    *   **Action:** Please correct the date to match the source of truth.\n\n2.  **Factual Errors in Main Results:** The summary of the main findings is incorrect and misrepresents the data.\n    *   **In Draft:** \"...for every 100 people taking infliximab, about 56 had a relapse.\"\n    *   **Source of Truth:** \"For every 100 people treated with infliximab, 56 may not have a clinical relapse...\"\n    *   **Action:** This is a critical error that reverses the finding. Please revise all numerical results to accurately reflect the source of truth, which states that 56 out of 100 people did **not** have a relapse.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed for Clarity**\n\n1.  **Clarify the Definition of Infliximab:** The current explanation is too simple and misses the key mechanism.\n    *   **Current text:** \"Infliximab is a type of medicine called a 'biologic'. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes swelling.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is vague. Readers won't understand how it's different from a common anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen. The source text provides a better, yet still simple, explanation.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Infliximab is a type of medicine called a 'biologic'. It works by blocking a specific substance in the body (called TNF-alpha) that causes the inflammation seen in Crohn's disease.\"\n\n2.  **Make the Phrasing of Results Consistent:** The language used to present statistics changes, which can be confusing.\n    *   **Current text:** The first result says \"about 75 had a relapse,\" while the next says \"12 may have a clinical relapse.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** Switching between \"about\" and \"may have,\" and from \"relapse\" to \"clinical relapse,\" makes the results harder to compare. Using consistent phrasing helps reader comprehension.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** (After correcting the numbers) \"Out of 100 people taking a dummy treatment, about 75 had a relapse. In comparison, out of 100 people taking infliximab, about 44 had a relapse.\" Use this consistent \"Out of 100 people...\" structure for all numerical results.\n\n3.  **Explain the 'Blinding' Limitation More Clearly:** The explanation for this limitation is a bit too simplistic.\n    *   **Current text:** \"In some studies, people may have known if they were getting the real medicine or a dummy treatment. This can affect the results, because knowing you are on a real treatment can sometimes make you feel better.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** While true, this doesn't fully explain why it's a scientific problem (bias). A slightly more detailed explanation would build more trust with the reader.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"In some studies, it wasn't clear if people knew which treatment they were getting. When participants or doctors know who is getting the real medicine, it can unintentionally influence how they report symptoms. This is a potential source of bias that can affect our confidence in the results.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft HIGHLY CONFORMS TO TYPICAL PLS PATTERNS. An impressive 94.4% of the 18 metrics fall into the best quartile for readability and plain language, including excellent sentence length (18.2 words), active voice count (53), and Flesch-Kincaid grade level (10.07). This indicates the fundamental writing style is clear and effective. The required revisions are focused on critical content accuracy and consistency, not stylistic or structural problems."
