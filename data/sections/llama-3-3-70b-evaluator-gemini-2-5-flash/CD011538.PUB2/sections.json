  "key_messages": [
    "Education support services may help children and adolescents with long-term health conditions (such as diabetes or asthma, which are chronic health conditions that last a long time and cannot be cured completely) stay engaged in school, but due to a lack of robust evidence, we are uncertain about their effectiveness in improving academic performance.",
    "We found some evidence that education support services may slightly improve mental health (which refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being), measured as self-esteem (a person's overall sense of worth or value), in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, but the overall certainty of this evidence is limited.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the significant gaps in our understanding of how education support services can best support children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, including exploring the effectiveness of these services in improving academic achievement, school engagement, and mental health, as well as their potential unwanted effects."

      "content": "Chronic health conditions in children and adolescents are non-communicable illnesses that are prolonged in duration, do not resolve spontaneously, and are rarely cured completely. These conditions can have a significant impact on a child's education, well-being, and health. Due to the variations in definition and measurement, prevalence estimates vary, but it's reported that up to 44% of children and adolescents may have a chronic health condition. This can lead to limitations in daily activities, impacting their ability to attend school, which is essential for academic and social skill development, as well as overall well-being."

      "content": "The review authors aimed to describe the nature of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions and examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement. They also wanted to investigate the impact of education support services on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, transition to school, mental health, and adverse effects."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found four studies that involved 359 people with chronic health conditions. All studies were randomised controlled studies and were disease-specific, with three studies focusing on children with cancer and one study focusing on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The studies did not report on the duration of the interventions. There was no information available on the funding sources of the studies. The population characteristics included children and adolescents aged four to 18 years with chronic health conditions. The study settings were not specified in terms of countries, but all studies were conducted in an educational setting. The types of interventions included educational support services, and the comparisons were between the intervention and control groups. No studies were found that reported on the quality of life or adverse effects of the interventions. Education support services may improve mental health, but it is unclear if they have an effect on school engagement, academic achievement, or transition back to school. We are very uncertain about the results."
