  "draft": "# Can education support services help children and adolescents with long-term health conditions (such as diabetes or asthma) stay engaged in school and improve their academic performance?\n**Key Messages**\n- Education support services may help children and adolescents with long-term health conditions (such as diabetes or asthma, which are chronic health conditions that last a long time and cannot be cured completely) stay engaged in school, but due to a lack of robust evidence, we are uncertain about their effectiveness in improving academic performance.\n- We found some evidence that education support services may slightly improve mental health (which refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being), measured as self-esteem (a person's overall sense of worth or value), in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, but the overall certainty of this evidence is limited.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the significant gaps in our understanding of how education support services can best support children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, including exploring the effectiveness of these services in improving academic achievement, school engagement, and mental health, as well as their potential unwanted effects.\n**Introduction**\n### What are chronic health conditions in children and adolescents, and why are they a problem?\nChronic health conditions in children and adolescents are non-communicable illnesses that are prolonged in duration, do not resolve spontaneously, and are rarely cured completely. These conditions can have a significant impact on a child's education, well-being, and health. Due to the variations in definition and measurement, prevalence estimates vary, but it's reported that up to 44% of children and adolescents may have a chronic health condition. This can lead to limitations in daily activities, impacting their ability to attend school, which is essential for academic and social skill development, as well as overall well-being.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to describe the nature of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions and examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement. They also wanted to investigate the impact of education support services on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, transition to school, mental health, and adverse effects.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe searched for studies on education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions.\n### Data Summarization\nWe summarized their results to understand the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement.\n### Confidence Assessment\nWe evaluated our confidence in the evidence to assess the reliability of the findings.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 359 people with chronic health conditions. All studies were randomised controlled studies and were disease-specific, with three studies focusing on children with cancer and one study focusing on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The studies did not report on the duration of the interventions. There was no information available on the funding sources of the studies. The population characteristics included children and adolescents aged four to 18 years with chronic health conditions. The study settings were not specified in terms of countries, but all studies were conducted in an educational setting. The types of interventions included educational support services, and the comparisons were between the intervention and control groups. No studies were found that reported on the quality of life or adverse effects of the interventions. Education support services may improve mental health, but it is unclear if they have an effect on school engagement, academic achievement, or transition back to school. We are very uncertain about the results.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and likely lacked proper blinding, as participants may have known which treatment they received.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021.",

Additionally, the text contains excessively long and complex sentences, a high degree of nominalization, and uses overly complex vocabulary, all of which significantly reduce readability for a patient audience.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns. While the word count is within limits, several readability indices and vocabulary complexity metrics are in the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range, suggesting the text is more difficult than typical PLS documents. Specifically, 'words_per_sentence' (25.33, P90), 'automated_readability_index' (15.58, P90), 'lix' (60.57, P90), 'rix' (8.93, P90), 'smog_index' (15.96, BEYOND_P90, BEYOND_P90), 'complex_words_dc' (270.00, P90), 'complex_words' (155.00, BEYOND_P90), and 'long_words' (241.00, BEYOND_P90) are all higher than typical. Furthermore, 'nominalization' (43.00, BEYOND_P90) and 'nouns' (217.00, BEYOND_P90) are significantly elevated, indicating a noun‑heavy and less direct writing style. These metric deviations support the need to shorten sentences, simplify vocabulary, and reduce nominalization to improve clarity and readability.\n\n**Top 4 Improvements Needed:**\n\n1. **Subheading Format:**\n   * **Specific quote:** \"Search Strategy\", \"Data Summarization\", \"Confidence Assessment\"\n   * **Why problematic:** These subheadings are statements, not questions, which goes against the Master Style Guide requirement for subheadings to be phrased as questions where possible.\n   * **Suggested rewrite:** Change to questions, e.g., \"How did we search for studies?\", \"How did we summarize the data?\", \"How confident are we in the evidence?\"\n\n2. **Sentence P90 Length and Readability:**\n   * **Specific quote:** \"Education support services may help children and adolescents with long-term health conditions (such as diabetes or asthma, which are chronic health conditions that last a long time and cannot be cured completely) stay engaged in school, but due to a lack of robust evidence, we are uncertain about their effectiveness in improving academic performance.\"\n   * **Why problematic:** The sentence is overly long (49 words) and contains multiple clauses and parenthetical definitions, making it difficult for a patient audience.\n   * **Suggested rewrite:** \"Education support services might help children and adolescents with long‑term health conditions (like diabetes or asthma) stay engaged in school. However, we are uncertain if these services improve academic performance because there isn’t enough strong evidence.\"\n\n3. **Nominalization and Noun‑Heavy Language:**\n   * **Specific quote:** \"Due to the variations in definition and measurement, prevalence estimates vary, but it's reported that up to 44% of children and adolescents may have a chronic health condition.\"\n   * **Why problematic:** Uses nominalizations that make the text less direct.\n   * **Suggested rewrite:** \"How we define and measure these conditions varies, \"\n\n4. **Vocabulary Complexity:**\n   * **Specific quote:** \"Chronic health conditions in children and adolescents are non‑communicable illnesses that are prolonged in duration, do not resolve spontaneously, and are rarely cured completely.\"\n   * **Why problematic:** Contains complex words that can be simplified.\n   * **Suggested rewrite:** \"Chronic health conditions in children and adolescents are illnesses that last a long time, don’t go away on their own, and are rarely fully cured.\""
