  "draft": "Can education support services help children and adolescents with long-term illnesses stay engaged in school and improve their academic performance? \nWe found that education support services may help children with long-term illnesses stay engaged in school, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. \nThere is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self-esteem, in children with long-term illnesses. \nFuture research should focus on studying the effects of education support services on school engagement, academic achievement, and mental health in children with long-term illnesses.\n\nWhat are long-term illnesses in children and adolescents, and why are they a problem? \nLong-term illnesses in children and adolescents are illnesses that do not go away and can have a significant impact on a child’s education, well-being, and health. \nChildren with long-term illnesses often experience difficulties attending school, which can lead to disengagement from school and poorer academic achievement, social-emotional functioning, and career choices.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if education support services can help children with long-term illnesses stay engaged in school and do better academically.\n\nHow did we conduct the review? \nWe searched for studies that looked at education support for children with long-term illnesses. \nWe then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found four studies that involved 359 participants with long-term illnesses. \nEach study focused on a specific disease: three on children with cancer and one on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). \nEducation support services may improve school engagement and mental health, but the evidence is uncertain. \nIt is unclear if education support services have an effect on academic achievement or transition back to school.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies involved different types of participants and used varied delivery methods for the intervention.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is well-structured and factually accurate, but requires revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of abstract nouns.** The text has an unusually high number of 'nominalizations' (noun forms of verbs), which can make it harder to read.\n    *   **Example:** '...poorer academic achievement, social-emotional functioning, and career choices.'\n    *   **Problem:** This is abstract. Using active verbs makes the meaning clearer.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase as '...do less well in school, have problems with social and emotional skills, and have fewer career choices.'\n\n2. **Explain *why* the evidence has limitations.** A lay reader may not understand the impact of the study flaws you mention.\n    *   **Example:** '...participants may have known which treatment they received...'\n    *   **Problem:** This doesn't explain why this is a problem.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Add a brief explanation, like '...participants and the researchers may have known which treatment they received, which could have influenced their responses.'\n\n3. **Clearly signpost the key messages.** The first three paragraphs are the main takeaways, but they aren't introduced as such.\n    *   **Problem:** Readers might not immediately grasp that this is the most important information.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Add a subheading before the first paragraph, such as 'What are the key messages of this review?'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns. Most metrics, including all readability scores and sentence length, fall within the best quartile (61% of features). However, there is one significant deviation: the use of nominalizations (abstract nouns formed from verbs) is exceptionally high, falling in the 'BEYOND_P90' category. This suggests a pattern of noun-heavy phrasing that should be revised to use more direct verbs, which will improve clarity and readability."
