  "draft": "Can education support services help children and adolescents with long-term illnesses stay engaged in school and improve their academic performance? \nWe found that education support services may help children with long-term illnesses stay in school, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. \nThere is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self-esteem, in children with long-term illnesses. \nFuture research should focus on studying the effects of education support services on school engagement, academic achievement, and mental health in children with long-term illnesses.\n\nWhat are long-term illnesses in children and adolescents, and why are they a problem? \nLong-term illnesses in children and adolescents are illnesses that do not go away and can significantly impact a child's education, well-being, and health. \nChildren with long-term illnesses often experience difficulties attending school, which can lead to them doing less well in school, having problems with social and emotional skills, and having fewer career choices.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if education support services can help children with long-term illnesses stay engaged in school and do better academically.\n\nHow did we conduct the review? \nWe searched for studies that looked at education support for children with long-term illnesses. \nWe then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found four studies that involved 359 participants with long-term illnesses. \nEach study focused on a specific disease: three on children with cancer and one on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). \nEducation support services may improve school engagement and mental health, but the evidence is uncertain. \nIt is unclear if education support services have an effect on academic achievement or transition back to school.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and participants and the researchers may have known which treatment they received, which could have influenced their responses. \nThe studies also involved different types of participants and used varied delivery methods for the intervention.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence? \nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021.\n\nWe hope this information helps you understand the potential benefits and limitations of education support services for children and adolescents with long-term illnesses.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and meets all critical requirements. The feedback below focuses on 3 key areas to make an already good summary even more accessible and precise for readers.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Clarify the structure by adding a 'Key messages' heading.**\n\n*   **Issue:** The summary begins with three paragraphs that function as key messages, but they are not labeled. This can be confusing for readers who then encounter the main Q&A section, which repeats some of this information. A clear heading helps set expectations and improves scannability.\n*   **Suggestion:** Add a `Key messages` subheading above the first paragraph and format the three points as a bulleted list using dashes, as per the style guide.\n\n**2. Restore the nuance in the findings about mental health.**\n\n*   **Text quoted:** \"Education support services may improve school engagement and mental health, but the evidence is uncertain.\"\n*   **Issue:** This sentence groups two findings together, but the original review found a meaningful difference in the certainty of the evidence. The evidence for mental health, while still not strong, was rated 'low' certainty, whereas the evidence for other outcomes was 'very low'. This is an important distinction for readers.\n*   **Suggestion:** Separate these findings to reflect the difference. For example: \"We found some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health (measured as self-esteem). For other outcomes, like school engagement, the evidence was very uncertain.\"\n\n**3. Replace abstract nouns with active verbs to improve clarity.**\n\n*   **Text quoted:** \"The studies also involved different types of participants and used varied delivery methods for the intervention.\"\n*   **Issue:** This sentence uses abstract nouns like 'delivery methods' and 'intervention', which can be hard for a lay audience to understand. This is part of a broader pattern of high nominalization (30 instances) identified in the linguistic analysis, which can make the text feel less direct and more academic.\n*   **Suggestion:** Rewrite this using simpler, more direct language. For example: \"The studies also included different types of children, and the support was provided in different ways.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows this draft is very well-written and highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. Most metrics, including readability, sentence length, and active voice, are in the best quartile (83.3% of features). The one area for improvement is a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which at 30 instances is in the 'Beyond P90' category and deviates significantly from typical PLS texts. Focusing on this will make the summary more direct and easier for readers to understand."
