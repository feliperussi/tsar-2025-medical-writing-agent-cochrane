  "draft": "Can education support services help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions (long-term illnesses that do not go away) stay engaged in school and improve their academic performance?\n\nKey messages:\n- Education support services may help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions stay engaged in school, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- There is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self-esteem, in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions.\n- Future research should focus on studying the effects of education support services on school engagement, academic achievement, and mental health in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions.\n\nWhat are chronic health conditions in children and adolescents, and why are they a problem?\nChronic health conditions in children and adolescents are long-term illnesses that do not resolve spontaneously and are rarely cured completely. These conditions can have a significant impact on a child's education, well-being, and health. Children and adolescents with chronic health conditions often experience difficulties attending school, which can lead to disengagement from school and poorer academic achievement, social-emotional functioning, and career choices.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if education support services help children and teens with long-term illnesses stay engaged in school and do better academically.\n\nHow did we conduct the review?\nWe searched for studies on education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 359 participants with chronic health conditions. All included studies were randomized controlled studies and were disease-specific, with three studies focusing on children with cancer and one study focusing on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Education support services may improve school engagement and mental health, but the evidence is uncertain. It is unclear if education support services have an effect on academic achievement or transition back to school.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies involved different types of participants and used varied delivery methods for the intervention.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it needs a few revisions to make it easier for patients and their families to read and understand. The language is often too formal and academic. Here are the top 3 improvements I recommend:\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns with simple verbs.** The summary relies on formal, noun-heavy phrases instead of direct verbs, which can make it hard to follow. This is particularly noticeable in the 'How did we conduct the review?' section.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"We searched for studies on education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This long sentence is packed with abstract nouns like 'effectiveness' and 'interventions'. It reads more like a technical abstract than a plain language summary.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for studies that looked at education support for children with long-term illnesses. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n2. **Use simpler, more consistent terminology.** After defining a technical term, you should use the simpler, plain-language version for the rest of the summary.\n   - **Original phrasing:** The summary defines 'chronic health conditions' as 'long-term illnesses' but then continues to use the longer, more technical term throughout the text (e.g., in all three key messages).\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Repeating the long, technical phrase makes the text dense and less reader-friendly. The goal is to simplify, not just define.\n   - **Suggested change:** After the first section, consistently use \"children with long-term illnesses\" or \"these children\" instead of \"children and adolescents with chronic health conditions.\"\n\n3. **Break up long sentences.** Some sentences contain multiple distinct ideas, which can be confusing. Splitting them into shorter, single-idea sentences will improve clarity.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"All included studies were randomized controlled studies and were disease-specific, with three studies focusing on children with cancer and one study focusing on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence combines the study type, the fact they were disease-specific, and the list of diseases into one complex statement.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found four studies, which were all randomised controlled studies. Each study focused on a specific disease: three on children with cancer and one on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns, with over half the metrics in the best quartile. However, it flags two significant deviations: the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90), and the Coleman-Liau readability index is also high (P90), suggesting that average word length contributes to reading difficulty. These metrics support the editorial feedback to simplify formal, abstract language and shorten wordy phrases."
