  "draft": "Can education support services help children and adolescents with long-term health conditions stay engaged in school and improve their academic performance?\n\nKey Messages\n- Education support services might help children and adolescents with long-term health conditions stay engaged in school. However, we are uncertain if these services improve academic performance because there isn’t enough strong evidence.\n- We found some evidence that education support services may slightly improve mental health in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. Mental health refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. However, the overall certainty of this evidence is limited.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the significant gaps in our understanding of how education support services can best support children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. This includes exploring the effectiveness of these services in improving academic achievement, school engagement, and mental health, as well as their potential unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are chronic health conditions in children and adolescents, and why are they a problem?\nChronic health conditions in children and adolescents are illnesses that last a long time, don’t go away on their own, and are rarely fully cured. These conditions can have a significant impact on a child's education, well-being, and health. Up to 44% of children and adolescents may have a chronic health condition. This can lead to limitations in daily activities, impacting their ability to attend school, which is essential for academic and social skill development, as well as overall well-being.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to describe the nature of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. They also wanted to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement. Additionally, they investigated the impact of education support services on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, transition to school, mental health, and adverse effects.\n\nHow did we search for studies?\nWe searched for studies on education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. We looked at eight electronic databases between January 18 and 25, 2021. We also searched five grey literature trials registers and databases between February 8 and 12, 2021.\n\nHow did we summarize the data?\nWe summarized the results of the studies to understand the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement. Two people independently screened titles and abstracts, and full-text articles, to identify included studies.\n\nHow confident are we in the evidence?\nWe evaluated our confidence in the evidence to assess the reliability of the findings. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials to assess the risk of bias.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 359 people with chronic health conditions. All studies were randomized controlled studies and were disease-specific, with three studies focusing on children with cancer and one study focusing on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Education support services may improve mental health, but it is unclear if they have an effect on school engagement, academic achievement, or transition back to school. We are very uncertain about the results.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes and likely lacked proper blinding, as participants may have known which treatment they received.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and structure. However, the language is often too academic for a lay audience, making it difficult to read. The main issues are the frequent use of complex, noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations) and technical jargon instead of simpler, everyday words. \n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed to make the summary clearer for patients and the public:\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Sentences and Academic Phrasing**\nSome sentences are long and use formal language that can be hard to follow. Breaking them down and using simpler words will help readers understand your key messages more easily.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"Future research should focus on addressing the significant gaps in our understanding of how education support services can best support children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. This includes exploring the effectiveness of these services in improving academic achievement, school engagement, and mental health, as well as their potential unwanted effects.\"\n- **Reasoning:** Phrases like \"addressing the significant gaps in our understanding\" and \"exploring the effectiveness\" are jargon. The two sentences are dense with complex ideas.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"More research is needed to learn how these support services can best help children and adolescents with long-term health conditions. Future studies should look at how these services affect school grades, engagement, and mental health, and also check for any unwanted effects.\"\n\n**2. Replace Noun-Heavy Phrases with Active Verbs**\nThe text often uses nouns to describe actions (e.g., \"limitations\" instead of \"to limit\"). Using direct verbs makes sentences more active and easier to understand.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"This can lead to limitations in daily activities, impacting their ability to attend school, which is essential for academic and social skill development, as well as overall well-being.\"\n- **Reasoning:** This sentence is packed with abstract nouns like \"limitations,\" \"ability,\" \"development,\" and \"well-being,\" which makes it dense and less direct.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This can limit a child's daily activities and make it harder for them to attend school. Going to school is essential for developing academic and social skills and for a child's overall well-being.\"\n\n**3. Use Consistent, Plain Language Terminology**\nThe summary switches between \"long-term health conditions\" (in the title) and \"chronic health conditions\" (in the text). Sticking to the plainer language term is best for consistency.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"What are chronic health conditions in children and adolescents, and why are they a problem?\"\n- **Reasoning:** This introduces a more technical term after the title used a simpler one. Readers may wonder if they are different.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What are long-term health conditions in children and adolescents, and why are they a problem?\" (This change should be applied throughout the text for consistency).\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour own editorial instincts are confirmed by the linguistic analysis. The draft shows significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. The **SMOG index** is 'BEYOND_P90', suggesting the text requires a university-level reading ability. This is driven by a high number of **complex words** (P90) and a very high rate of **nominalization** ('BEYOND_P90'), which supports the feedback on simplifying sentences and using more active verbs.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns, with 55.6% of metrics in the best quartile. However, there is significant deviation in vocabulary and style. Six metrics are outside the typical range, most notably nominalization (BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (BEYOND_P90), and the counts for complex words, long words, and nouns (all P90). This indicates the text relies too heavily on complex, noun-based language, making it difficult for a lay audience to read."
