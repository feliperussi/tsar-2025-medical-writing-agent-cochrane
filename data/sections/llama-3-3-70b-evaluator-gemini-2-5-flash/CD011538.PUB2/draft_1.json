  "draft": "# Can education support services help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions (long-term illnesses that do not go away) stay engaged in school and improve their academic performance?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Education support services may help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions (long-term illnesses that do not go away) stay engaged in school, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and we did not find any information about harmful effects.\n- There is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self-esteem, in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n- Future research should focus on studying the effects of education support services on school engagement, academic achievement, and mental health in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, to provide clearer answers for families, educators, and healthcare providers.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What are chronic health conditions in children and adolescents, and why are they a problem?\nChronic health conditions in children and adolescents are long-term illnesses that do not resolve spontaneously and are rarely cured completely. These conditions can have a significant impact on a child's education, well-being, and health. Children and adolescents with chronic health conditions often experience difficulties attending school, which can lead to disengagement from school and poorer academic achievement, social-emotional functioning, and career choices.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to describe the nature of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions and to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement. They also wanted to investigate the impact of education support services on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, transition to school, mental health, and adverse effects.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 359 participants with chronic health conditions. All included studies were randomised controlled studies and were disease-specific, with three studies focusing on children with cancer and one study focusing on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The studies did not report on the duration of the interventions. There is no information available on the funding sources of the studies. The population characteristics included children and adolescents aged four to 18 years with chronic health conditions. The study settings were not specified in terms of countries. The types of interventions included educational support services, and the comparisons were not explicitly stated. No studies were found that reported on the quality of life or adverse effects of the interventions. Education support services may improve school engagement and mental health, but the evidence is uncertain. It is unclear if education support services have an effect on academic achievement or transition back to school.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and the studies involved different types of participants and used varied delivery methods for the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT_APPROVED primarily due to a critical failure in subheading formatting, as well as several significant clarity and style issues that hinder readability for a patient audience. The 'Methods', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' subheadings are not phrased as questions, which violates the Master Style Guide. Additionally, the text contains numerous long, noun-heavy, and formally phrased sentences that make it difficult to understand. For example, sentences like 'Children and adolescents with chronic health conditions often experience difficulties attending school, which can lead to disengagement from school and poorer academic achievement, social-emotional functioning, and career choices' are overly complex. Similarly, the 'Methods' and 'Results' sections use wordy and somewhat passive constructions that could be simplified for better clarity. These issues contribute to the text deviating significantly from typical Plain Language Summary patterns, as indicated by the linguistic metrics.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft text deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns. While some metrics like `active_voice` (45.00) and `pronouns` (23.00) are in the best quartile (P75), a substantial number of features (10 out of 18) fall into the P90 or BEYOND_P90 ranges, suggesting higher complexity. Specifically, `nominalization` (38.0) and `long_words` (223.0) are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating an excessive use of noun forms of verbs and words with 7+ characters. Other metrics like `nouns` (199.0), `automated_readability_index` (15.43), `coleman_liau_index` (14.45), `lix` (61.65), `rix` (8.92), `smog_index` (14.83), `complex_words_dc` (242.0), and `complex_words` (132.0) are all in the P90 range, pointing to a text that is generally harder to read, uses more complex vocabulary, and has a higher grade level than typical Plain Language Summaries. The `words_per_sentence` (23.20, P75) and `passive_voice` (15.00, P75) also suggest room for improvement in sentence structure and voice."
