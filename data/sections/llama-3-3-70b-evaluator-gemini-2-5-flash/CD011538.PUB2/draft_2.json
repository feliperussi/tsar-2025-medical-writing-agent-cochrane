  "draft": "Can education support services help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions (long-term illnesses that do not go away) stay engaged in school and improve their academic performance?\n\nKey Messages\n- Education support services may help children and adolescents with chronic health conditions stay engaged in school, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- There is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self-esteem, in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions.\n- Future research should focus on studying the effects of education support services on school engagement, academic achievement, and mental health in children and adolescents with chronic health conditions.\n\nWhat are chronic health conditions in children and adolescents, and why are they a problem?\nChronic health conditions in children and adolescents are long-term illnesses that do not resolve spontaneously and are rarely cured completely. These conditions can have a significant impact on a child's education, well-being, and health. We found that children and adolescents with chronic health conditions often experience difficulties attending school.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to describe the nature of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions and to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement. They also wanted to investigate the impact of education support services on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, transition to school, mental health, and adverse effects.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies on education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. We summarized their results and evaluated our confidence in the evidence to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found four studies that involved 359 participants with chronic health conditions. All included studies were randomized controlled studies and were disease-specific, with three studies focusing on children with cancer and one study focusing on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Education support services may improve school engagement and mental health, but the evidence is uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and the studies involved different types of participants and used varied delivery methods for the intervention.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2021.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It provides a good foundation, but it needs some revisions to meet our standards for clarity and completeness before it can be approved. Here are the main issues to address:\\n\\n**Critical Issues:**\\n*   **Factual Omissions:** The summary omits key findings. For example, the results section doesn't mention the findings for 'academic achievement' or 'transition back to school', which were important outcomes of the review. The key messages are also missing important context from the source material. Please review the `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH` to ensure all key findings and the qualifications are included.\\n*   **Missing Subheading:** The methods section (starting 'We searched for studies...') is missing a subheading. Please add a question-based subheading like 'How did we conduct the review?' to improve structure.\\n\\n**Top 3 Improvements for Clarity:**\\n\\n1.  **Simplify the 'Aims' section to be more direct and less academic.** The current wording is very dense and uses too many abstract nouns, making it hard for a lay reader to understand.\\n    *   **Quote:** 'The review authors aimed to describe the nature of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions and to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement.'\\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We wanted to find out if education support services help children and teens with long-term illnesses stay engaged in school and do better academically.'\\n\\n2.  **Provide a complete picture of the findings in the 'Results' section.** The current summary is incomplete and could mislead the reader about what the review found for one of its main goals.\\n    *   **Quote:** 'Education support services may improve school engagement and mental health, but the evidence is uncertain.'\\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We found that education support services may improve school engagement and mental health (self-esteem). However, the evidence was very uncertain. It was unclear if these services had any effect on academic achievement or on helping students return to school.'\\n\\n3.  **Strengthen the 'Introduction' by explaining why the problem matters.** The draft states that children miss school but omits the consequences, which weakens the rationale for the review.\\n    *   **Quote:** 'We found that children and adolescents with chronic health conditions often experience difficulties attending school.'\\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'Children and adolescents with chronic health conditions often miss school. This can lead to them becoming disengaged, which is linked to poorer grades, social problems, and fewer career choices later in life.'\\n\\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:**\\nYour own editorial instincts about the text's complexity are backed by the linguistic analysis. The draft has a very high number of 'nominalizations' (30, where under 13 is typical), which are noun-forms of verbs that make sentences more abstract and harder to read. Addressing the suggestions above, particularly by using more active verbs, will help resolve this and improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with over half of its features falling in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in its use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which is more than double the typical median value (30 vs. <13). This, along with high scores on the Coleman-Liau and LIX readability indices, points to overly complex sentence structures and vocabulary that should be simplified for a lay audience."
