  "draft": "# Is continuous infusion of loop diuretics (a type of medicine that helps remove fluid from the body) more effective than bolus injection (a single large dose of medicine) for treating acute heart failure?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Continuous infusion of loop diuretics (a type of medicine that helps remove fluid from the body) may result in slightly more weight loss compared to bolus injection (a single large dose of medicine) for treating acute heart failure (a condition where the heart suddenly cannot pump enough blood), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and there may be little to no difference in benefits or harmful effects between the two methods.\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in outcomes such as death, length of hospital stay, readmission to hospital, or kidney injury between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics, and more research is needed to understand the effects of these treatments.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics in people with acute heart failure, and consider factors such as the severity of heart failure, the presence of other health conditions, and the quality of care provided in different hospital settings.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What is acute heart failure and why is it a problem?\nAcute heart failure (AHF) is a condition where the heart suddenly stops working properly, leading to a buildup of fluid in the body. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. AHF is a serious condition that requires urgent medical attention. Treatment for AHF often involves the use of diuretics, which are medicines that help remove excess fluid from the body.\n### What are loop diuretics and how are they used to treat acute heart failure?\nLoop diuretics are a type of diuretic that are commonly used to treat AHF. They work by helping the kidneys remove excess fluid from the body. Loop diuretics can be given either as a continuous infusion or as a bolus injection. A continuous infusion involves giving the medicine slowly over a period of time, while a bolus injection involves giving the medicine all at once.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether giving loop diuretics as a continuous infusion or as a bolus injection is more effective for treating AHF. They looked at the effects of these two different methods on outcomes such as weight loss, mortality, length of hospital stay, and readmission to hospital.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics for acute heart failure, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 7 studies that involved 681 people with acute heart failure. The studies were conducted in 32 hospitals across 7 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. The duration of the studies ranged from 8 months to 6 years. The population characteristics included adults with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification III or IV and fluid overload. The studies compared intravenous continuous infusion of loop diuretics with intermittent bolus injection in acute heart failure. No information was available on the funding sources of the studies. Continuous infusion of loop diuretics may result in a bit more weight loss than bolus injection, but it is unclear if this treatment has an effect on outcome. There may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission to hospital, and occurrence of acute kidney injury between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes, participants may have been aware of their treatment (lack of blinding), and the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 44.4% of features in the best quartile and 22.2% in the median range. However, 22.2% of features are in the P90 range and 11.1% are beyond P90, indicating significant deviations. Specifically, `nominalization` (36.0) and `nouns` (232.0) are beyond the 90th percentile, suggesting the text is overly noun-heavy and uses too many noun forms of verbs. Metrics like `smog_index` (14.66), `complex_words_dc` (268.0), `complex_words` (141.0), and `long_words` (204.0) are in the P90 range, highlighting that the vocabulary is generally too complex and the text is difficult to read for the target audience. These deviations suggest a need to simplify vocabulary, reduce sentence length, and convert noun forms to verbs to improve readability."
