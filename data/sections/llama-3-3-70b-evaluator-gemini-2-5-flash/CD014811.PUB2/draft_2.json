  "draft": "Is continuous infusion of loop diuretics more effective than bolus injection for treating acute heart failure?\n\nKey Messages\n- Continuous infusion of loop diuretics might lead to slightly more weight loss than bolus injection for acute heart failure. However, the evidence is not strong, and there may be little to no difference in benefits or harms between the two methods.\n- The current evidence does not show a clear difference in outcomes such as death, length of hospital stay, readmission to hospital, or kidney injury between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics, and more research is needed to understand the effects of these treatments.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics in people with acute heart failure, and consider factors such as the severity of heart failure, the presence of other health conditions, and the quality of care provided in different hospital settings.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is acute heart failure and why is it a problem?\nAcute heart failure (AHF) is a condition where the heart suddenly stops working properly, leading to a buildup of fluid in the body. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. AHF is a serious condition that requires urgent medical attention. Treatment for AHF often involves the use of diuretics, which are medicines that help remove excess fluid from the body.\nWhat are loop diuretics and how are they used to treat acute heart failure?\nLoop diuretics are a type of diuretic that are commonly used to treat AHF. They work by helping the kidneys remove excess fluid from the body. Loop diuretics can be given either as a continuous infusion or as a bolus injection. A continuous infusion involves giving the medicine slowly over a period of time, while a bolus injection involves giving the medicine all at once.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out whether giving loop diuretics as a continuous infusion or as a bolus injection is more effective for treating AHF. They looked at the effects of these two different methods on outcomes such as weight loss, mortality, length of hospital stay, and readmission to hospital.\n\nMethods\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics for acute heart failure, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nResults\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 7 studies that involved 681 people with acute heart failure. The studies were conducted in 32 hospitals across 7 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. The duration of the studies ranged from 8 months to 6 years. The population characteristics included adults with severe acute heart failure (New York Heart Association classification III or IV) and fluid overload. The studies compared intravenous continuous infusion of loop diuretics with intermittent bolus injection in acute heart failure. No information was available on the funding sources of the studies. Continuous infusion of loop diuretics may result in slightly more weight loss than bolus injection, but the evidence is very uncertain about this effect. There may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission to hospital, and occurrence of acute kidney injury between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics.\n\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes, participants may have been aware of their treatment (lack of blinding), and the studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nCurrency\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft with a clear structure that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, the language is often too academic for a lay audience. To improve clarity for patients, focus on simplifying complex vocabulary and sentence structures.\n\nHere are the 3 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with direct verbs.** The text often uses complex noun phrases where a simple verb would be clearer and more direct. This makes sentences feel dense and academic.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** \"There may be little to no difference in the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse event between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The risk of kidney injury may be similar for both methods.\"\n\n2. **Remove unnecessary technical jargon.** Including technical details that are not explained can make the text intimidating and harder to understand for a non-medical audience.\n    - **Problematic phrase:** \"...adults with severe acute heart failure (New York Heart Association classification III or IV) and fluid overload.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** Simply stating \"...adults with severe acute heart failure and fluid overload\" is sufficient. The technical classification in parentheses does not add meaning for a lay audience.\n\n3. **Simplify wordy and academic language.** Some phrases use formal, multi-syllable words when simpler, everyday language would be more effective.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** \"The studies involved heterogeneous populations and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\"\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies included different types of people, and the treatments were given in different ways.\"\n\nMaking these changes will help address the high number of complex words, nouns, and nominalizations identified in the linguistic analysis, making the summary much more accessible to its intended audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The summary shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While it performs well on sentence length and active voice (with 6 metrics in the best quartile), it deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence construction. Six metrics are in the highest 10th percentile for complexity, including nominalization and noun count (both 'Beyond P90'), and several measures of complex and long words (all 'P90'). This indicates the text's vocabulary and phrasing are more academic and dense than a typical PLS."
