  "draft": "What are the best ways to use nicotine replacement therapy to help people quit smoking?\nWe looked at how different forms, doses, and schedules of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can help people stop smoking. NRT gives people nicotine without the tar and carbon monoxide found in cigarettes, which can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms.\n\n- Using a combination of NRT products, like gum and patches, probably increases the chances of quitting smoking compared to using just one type of NRT.\n- Fast-acting NRT products, such as gum or lozenges, likely work as well as nicotine patches to help people quit smoking.\n- Using NRT before quitting smoking may also improve the chances of quitting, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n\nWhat is nicotine replacement therapy and why is it important for smoking cessation?\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that helps people stop smoking by replacing the nicotine from cigarettes with a safer alternative. This can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, making it easier for people to quit smoking. NRT comes in various forms, such as patches, gum, lozenges, and nasal sprays, and can be used in different doses and durations. Smoking is a significant health problem that can lead to serious diseases like heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of developing these conditions, and NRT is one of the common treatments used to help people achieve this goal.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, doses, durations, and schedules of NRT for achieving long-term smoking cessation. They aimed to find out whether using combination NRT is more effective than single-form NRT, and whether higher doses of NRT are more effective than lower doses. They also investigated the effects of using NRT before quitting compared to using it from quit day onward, and whether different types of NRT have varying effects on quit rates and safety outcomes.\n\nHow did the review authors find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different forms, doses, and durations of nicotine replacement therapy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine its effectiveness for smoking cessation.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 43,327 participants. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. The studies compared different forms, deliveries, doses, durations, and schedules of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for achieving long-term smoking cessation. Using a combination of nicotine replacement therapies probably increases the chances of quitting smoking. Nicotine replacement therapies, such as gum or lozenges, probably work as well as nicotine patches to help people quit smoking. Using nicotine replacement therapy before quitting may also improve the chances of quitting.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the findings do not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start, but the summary needs to be clearer and more direct for a lay audience. While all the required information is present, the language is often too technical and repetitive. Here are the top 4 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with active verbs.** Some sentences are dense with abstract nouns, making them hard to follow. This is a common issue in scientific writing that can be simplified for a plain language audience.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, doses, durations, and schedules of NRT for achieving long-term smoking cessation.\"\n   - **Problem:** Phrases like \"determine the effectiveness\" and \"achieving long-term smoking cessation\" are clunky and abstract.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how well different ways of using NRT help people to stop smoking for good, and if they are safe.\"\n\n2. **Avoid repeating the key messages.** The findings in the bulleted list at the top are repeated almost word-for-word in the 'What did the review authors find?' section. The results section should expand on the key messages, not just restate them.\n   - **Original text:** The sentence \"Using a combination of nicotine replacement therapies probably increases the chances of quitting smoking\" appears in both the key messages and the results section.\n   - **Problem:** This redundancy makes the summary longer than necessary and less engaging for the reader.\n   - **Suggested rewrite for the results section:** \"Our review of 68 studies found strong evidence that using two forms of NRT (like a patch and gum) is more effective than using just one. We also found that fast-acting NRTs like gum or lozenges work just as well as patches.\"\n\n3. **Break up long, complex sentences.** The methods section contains a long sentence that combines too many ideas.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"We searched for studies comparing different forms, doses, and durations of nicotine replacement therapy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine its effectiveness for smoking cessation.\"\n   - **Problem:** This 29-word sentence is hard to process in one go, especially the final technical phrase.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for studies that compared different ways of using NRT. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n4. **Use a consistent voice in subheadings.** The subheadings refer to \"the review authors,\" but the text correctly uses \"we\" as per the style guide. This should be consistent.\n   - **Original subheading:** \"What did the review authors want to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\"\n   - **Problem:** This creates a disconnect between the headings and the text that follows.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"What did we want to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a high number of complex words, long words, and noun-based phrases, making it more difficult to read than a typical Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While it performs well on active voice and pronoun use (in the best quartile), it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics, including `nominalization` (26.0), `complex_words` (116.0), and `long_words` (186.0), are in the P90 range. This indicates the text uses more noun-heavy phrasing and complex vocabulary than is typical for a PLS, which impacts overall readability and supports the need for the suggested edits."
