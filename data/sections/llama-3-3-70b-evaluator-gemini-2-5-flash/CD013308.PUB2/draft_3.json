  "draft": "What are the most effective ways to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to quit smoking?\n\nKey messages:\n- Using combination NRT - a fast-acting form like gum or lozenge plus a patch - is more effective than using a single form of NRT for quitting smoking.\n- Using NRT before quitting smoking may improve quit rates compared to using it from the quit date only.\n- Future research should better report on side effects and the long-term effects of different NRT strategies to provide clearer guidance for people trying to quit smoking.\n\nWhat is nicotine replacement therapy and why is it important for smoking cessation?\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that helps people stop smoking by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It works by replacing the nicotine from cigarettes with a safer alternative. NRT is important because smoking is a major health problem that can lead to serious diseases like heart disease, lung disease, and cancer. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of these diseases, but it can be difficult due to nicotine addiction.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations, and schedules of NRT for quitting smoking for the long term. They also wanted to know if using NRT before quitting smoking is more effective than using it from the quit date onwards.\n\nHow did the review authors find the information?\nWe searched for studies comparing different forms, doses, and durations of nicotine replacement therapy. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine its effectiveness for smoking cessation.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 43,327 participants. Most studies recruited adults from the community or healthcare clinics. The studies compared different forms, deliveries, doses, durations, and schedules of NRT for quitting smoking for the long term. We found that combination NRT is more effective than single-form NRT for quitting smoking.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding, very small study sizes, and limited coverage of the relevant populations and outcomes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean for people trying to quit smoking?\nUsing combination NRT and starting NRT before quitting smoking may improve quit rates. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the effects of different types of NRT on certain groups of people.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft with excellent readability scores. The text is clear, concise, and meets all critical requirements for format and accuracy. To make it even more helpful for readers, I recommend focusing on the following three areas to improve the flow of information and provide more value.\n\n1. **Make the 'What did we find?' section more informative.** The current version is correct but misses the opportunity to share more of the review's key findings beyond what's in the key messages.\n   - **Original Text:** \"We found 68 studies that involved 43,327 participants... We found that combination NRT is more effective than single-form NRT for quitting smoking.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This section repeats the first key message but doesn't add any other important results from the review, such as the findings on starting NRT before the quit date.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our review included 68 studies with a total of 43,327 people. Our main finding is that using two forms of NRT together (a patch plus a fast-acting form like gum or a lozenge) helps more people quit than using just one form. We also found moderate-certainty evidence that starting to use NRT *before* your quit day may increase your chances of success.\"\n\n2. **Strengthen the concluding 'What does this mean...' section.** This section currently repeats information from the key messages instead of providing a final, practical takeaway for the reader.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Using combination NRT and starting NRT before quitting smoking may improve quit rates. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is nearly identical to the key messages. The conclusion should offer a clear, forward‑looking summary for someone considering quitting.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"If you are thinking about quitting, this review shows that using a nicotine patch combined with another NRT product like gum gives you a better chance of success than using only one product. You might also consider starting NRT before your planned quit day. It's always best to talk with a healthcare professional to find the right strategy for you.\"\n\n3. **Ensure consistent use of 'we' for the review team.** The text switches between referring to the authors in the third person and the first person, which can be confusing for the reader.\n   - **Original Text:** \"What did the review authors want to find out...\" and later \"How did the review authors find the information? We searched for studies...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The style guide requires using the first‑person plural ('we', 'our') consistently when referring to the review authors. Switching between 'the review authors' and 'we' is inconsistent.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Change all instances of \"the review authors\" to \"we\". For example: \"What did we want to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 89% of metrics fall within the best quartile for readability and plain language, including excellent scores for sentence length (words_per_sentence: 16.96), passive voice (3 instances), and Flesch-Kincaid grade level (9.81). While the metrics are outstanding and indicate the text is easy to read, the feedback focuses on higher-level editorial issues such as information structure, repetition, and consistency, which are not fully captured by the quantitative analysis."
