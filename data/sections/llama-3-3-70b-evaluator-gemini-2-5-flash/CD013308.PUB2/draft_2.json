  "draft": "Effective Ways to Use Nicotine Replacement Therapy to Quit Smoking\n\nKey Messages\n- Using combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) - a fast-acting form like gum or lozenge plus a patch - is more effective than using a single form of NRT for quitting smoking.\n- Using NRT before quitting smoking may improve quit rates compared to using it from the quit date only.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies to provide more comprehensive guidance for people trying to quit smoking.\n\nWhat is Nicotine Replacement Therapy and Why is it Important for Smoking Cessation?\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that helps people stop smoking by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It works by replacing the nicotine from cigarettes with a safer alternative. NRT is important because smoking is a major health problem that can lead to serious diseases like heart disease, lung disease, and cancer. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of these diseases, but it can be difficult due to nicotine addiction.\n\nWhat Did the Review Authors Want to Find Out About Nicotine Replacement Therapy?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations, and schedules of NRT for achieving long-term smoking cessation. They also wanted to know if using NRT before quitting smoking is more effective than using it from the quit date onwards.\n\nHow Did the Review Authors Find the Information?\nWe searched for studies comparing different forms, doses, and durations of nicotine replacement therapy. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine its effectiveness for smoking cessation.\n\nWhat Did We Find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 43,327 participants. Most studies recruited adults from the community or healthcare clinics. The studies compared different forms, deliveries, doses, durations, and schedules of NRT for achieving long-term smoking cessation. We found that combination NRT is more effective than single-form NRT for quitting smoking.\n\nWhat Are the Limitations of the Evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding, very small study sizes, and limited coverage of the relevant populations and outcomes.\n\nIs the Evidence Up to Date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for People Trying to Quit Smoking?\nUsing combination NRT and starting NRT before quitting smoking may improve quit rates. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the effects of different types of NRT on certain groups of people.",

      "feedback": "This draft is very clear and well-written, but it cannot be approved because it fails a critical formatting requirement from the style guide. Here are the 3 most important changes needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Rephrase the main title as a question.** The style guide requires the main title to be phrased as a question to engage the reader directly.\n   - **Current Title:** 'Effective Ways to Use Nicotine Replacement Therapy to Quit Smoking'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'What are the most effective ways to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to quit smoking?'\n\n2. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with active verbs.** The draft often uses noun forms instead of direct verbs (e.g., \"achieving cessation\" instead of \"quitting\"), which can make sentences less direct. The linguistic analysis confirms this, showing a high number of 'nominalizations'.\n   - **Example:** \"...for achieving long-term smoking cessation.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...to quit smoking for the long term.\"\n\n3. **Make the third key message more specific.** The current message is too general. Use the details from the original source to tell the reader what kind of research is needed.\n   - **Current Message:** 'Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies to provide more comprehensive guidance for people trying to quit smoking.'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'Future research should better report on side effects and the long-term effects of different NRT strategies to provide clearer guidance for people trying to quit smoking.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 11 of 18 metrics (61%) falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (11.07) and words per sentence (18.78) are excellent. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: 'nominalization' (the use of noun-forms of verbs) is in the 90th percentile, suggesting the text could be made more direct by using more active verbs."
