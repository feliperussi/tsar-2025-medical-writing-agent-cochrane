  "draft": "What are the most effective ways to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to quit smoking?\n\nKey messages:\n- Using combination NRT - a fast-acting form like gum or lozenge plus a patch - is more effective than using a single form of NRT for quitting smoking.\n- Using NRT before quitting smoking may improve quit rates compared to using it from the quit date only.\n- Future research should better report on side effects and the long-term effects of different NRT strategies to provide clearer guidance for people trying to quit smoking.\n\nWhat is nicotine replacement therapy and why is it important for smoking cessation?\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that helps people stop smoking by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It works by replacing the nicotine from cigarettes with a safer alternative. NRT is important because smoking is a major health problem that can lead to serious diseases like heart disease, lung disease, and cancer. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of these diseases, but it can be difficult due to nicotine addiction.\n\nWhat did we want to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\nWe wanted to find out which ways of using NRT (such as different types, doses, or timings) are best for helping people to quit smoking for good. We also looked at the safety of these different methods.\n\nHow did we find the information?\nWe searched for studies that compared different ways of using nicotine replacement therapy. We then collected and analyzed their results and rated how certain we were about the evidence to judge its reliability.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur review included 68 studies with a total of 43,327 people. Our main finding is that using two forms of NRT together (a patch plus a fast-acting form like gum or a lozenge) helps more people quit than using just one form. We also found moderate-certainty evidence that starting to use NRT before your quit day may increase your chances of success.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the results is limited for a few reasons. In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have influenced the results. Also, some studies were very small, and they didn't always include a wide range of people or measure all the side effects we were interested in.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean for people trying to quit smoking?\nIf you are thinking about quitting, this review shows that using a nicotine patch combined with another NRT product like gum gives you a better chance of success than using only one product. You might also consider starting NRT before your planned quit day. It's always best to talk with a healthcare professional to find the right strategy for you.",
