  "draft": "# Effective Ways to Use Nicotine Replacement Therapy to Quit Smoking\n**Key Messages**\n- There is evidence that using combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) (a treatment that helps people stop smoking by replacing the nicotine from cigarettes), which includes a fast-acting form like gum or lozenge plus a patch, is more effective than using a single form of NRT for quitting smoking, with no clear evidence of serious harmful effects.\n- Using NRT before quitting smoking may also improve quit rates compared to using it from the quit date only, but more research is needed to confirm this finding and to understand the effects of different types of NRT on certain groups of people.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as reporting adverse events and studying the long-term effects of different NRT strategies, to provide more comprehensive guidance for people trying to quit smoking.\n**Introduction**\n### What is nicotine replacement therapy and why is it important for smoking cessation?\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that helps people stop smoking by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It works by replacing the nicotine from cigarettes with a safer alternative, making it easier for people to transition from smoking to not smoking. NRT is important because smoking is a major health problem that can lead to serious diseases like heart disease, lung disease, and cancer. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of these diseases, but it can be difficult due to nicotine addiction. NRT has been shown to be effective in helping people quit smoking, but there are different forms, doses, and ways of using it, and it's unclear which ones work best.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations, and schedules of NRT for achieving long-term smoking cessation. They also wanted to know if using NRT before quitting smoking (preloading) is more effective than using it from the quit date onwards, and if there are any differences in the effectiveness of different types of NRT, such as patches, gum, or lozenges. Additionally, they wanted to find out if there are any differences in the safety and tolerability of different types of NRT, including the risk of cardiac adverse events, serious adverse events, and study withdrawals due to treatment.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing different forms, doses, and durations of nicotine replacement therapy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine its effectiveness for smoking cessation.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 43,327 participants. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. The studies compared different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for achieving long-term smoking cessation. The types of interventions and comparisons included combination NRT, single-form NRT, fast-acting forms, and different doses of nicotine patches and gum. We did not ... (truncated) ... However, it is unclear if different doses or durations of nicotine replacement therapy have an effect on quitting smoking.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sizes, and limited coverage of the relevant populations and outcomes.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

Only 27.8% of features fall within the best quartile, while 50.0% are in the P90 range and 16.7% are beyond P90. Key metrics showing significant deviation include 'words_per_sentence' (28.43, BEYOND_P90), 'nominalization' (28.00, BEYOND_P90), and 'rix' (9.52, BEYOND_P90). Additionally, 'nouns' (178.00, P90), 'flesch_kincaid_grade' (14.85, P90), 'automated_readability_index' (16.06, P90), 'gunning_fog_index' (19.68, P90), 'lix' (61.93, P90), 'smog_index' (14.18, P90), 'complex_words_dc' (241.00, P90), 'complex_words' (124.00, P90), and 'long_words' (200.00, P90) all indicate higher complexity and lower readability than typical PLS texts. These deviations suggest the text is harder to understand for the target audience due to long sentences, complex vocabulary, and a high density of nouns and nominalizations."
