  "draft": "# What are the best ways to use nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT, is a type of treatment that helps people stop smoking by giving them nicotine without the tar and carbon monoxide found in cigarettes) to help people quit smoking?\n**Key Messages**\n- There is evidence that using combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT, a type of treatment that helps people stop smoking by giving them nicotine without the tar and carbon monoxide found in cigarettes) results in higher long-term quit rates than single-form NRT, and that using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, may be as effective as nicotine patches in helping people quit smoking, although the quality of this evidence varies and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n- Using NRT before quitting smoking may also improve quit rates compared to using it from quit day only, but this finding needs further research to ensure its robustness, and it is also important to consider the potential unwanted effects of NRT, such as cardiac adverse events, although these were not clearly reported in the studies.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, including the need for more robust evidence on the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use, and the importance of reporting adverse events, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to treatment, in order to provide clearer guidance for people trying to quit smoking.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is nicotine replacement therapy and why is it important for smoking cessation?\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that helps people stop smoking by replacing the nicotine from cigarettes with a safer alternative. This can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, making it easier for people to quit smoking. NRT comes in various forms, such as patches, gum, lozenges, and nasal sprays, and can be used in different doses and durations. Smoking is a significant health problem that can lead to serious diseases like heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of developing these conditions, and NRT is one of the common treatments used to help people achieve this goal.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?\nThe review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, doses, durations, and schedules of NRT for achieving long-term smoking cessation. They aimed to find out whether using combination NRT (e.g., fast-acting form plus patch) is more effective than single-form NRT, and whether higher doses of NRT are more effective than lower doses. They also investigated the effects of using NRT before quitting (preloading) compared to using it from quit day onward, and whether different types of NRT have varying effects on quit rates and safety outcomes like cardiac adverse events and study withdrawals due to treatment.\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies comparing different forms, doses, and durations of nicotine replacement therapy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to determine its effectiveness for smoking cessation.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 68 studies that involved 43,327 participants. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. The studies were conducted in various countries, although the specific countries are not mentioned. The duration of the studies is not explicitly stated, but they all had a follow-up of at least six months. The studies compared different forms, deliveries, doses, durations, and schedules of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for achieving long-term smoking cessation. The types of interventions and comparisons included combination NRT, single-form NRT, and different doses and types of NRT products, such as patches and gum. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, are not explicitly stated, but the studies included adults motivated to quit smoking. Using a combination of nicotine replacement therapies probably increases the chances of quitting smoking. Nicotine replacement therapies, such as gum or lozenges, probably work as well as nicotine patches to help people quit smoking. Using nicotine replacement therapy before quitting may also improve the chances of quitting. However, it is unclear if different doses or durations of nicotine replacement therapy have an effect on quitting smoking.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), the studies were very small (low statistical power), and the findings do not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest (limited generalizability).\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2022.",

The title includes an overly long parenthetical definition, and the key messages contain sentences that are too long and complex for a plain language summary. The text also suffers from noun-heavy and nominalized language, and a generally high vocabulary complexity, making it difficult for the target audience to understand. These issues are strongly supported by the linguistic evaluation metrics.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 55.6% of features in the best quartile. However, a significant portion (33.3%) of features deviate beyond the 90th percentile, and 11.1% are in the P90 range. Specifically, metrics for nominalization (38.0, BEYOND_P90), nouns (250.0, BEYOND_P90), SMOG index (15.7, BEYOND_P90), Dale-Chall complex words (343.0, BEYOND_P90), complex words (171.0, BEYOND_P90), and long words (269.0, BEYOND_P90) are all significantly higher than typical PLS patterns. Additionally, LIX (58.8, P90) and RIX (8.4, P90) are also on the higher side, indicating longer sentences and more complex vocabulary. These deviations suggest the text is more difficult to read and understand than typical plain language summaries."
