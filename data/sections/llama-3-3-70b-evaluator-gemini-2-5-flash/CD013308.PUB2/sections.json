  "key_messages": [
    "There is evidence that using combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT, a type of treatment that helps people stop smoking by giving them nicotine without the tar and carbon monoxide found in cigarettes) results in higher long-term quit rates than single-form NRT, and that using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, may be as effective as nicotine patches in helping people quit smoking, although the quality of this evidence varies and more research is needed to confirm these findings.",
    "Using NRT before quitting smoking may also improve quit rates compared to using it from quit day only, but this finding needs further research to ensure its robustness, and it is also important to consider the potential unwanted effects of NRT, such as cardiac adverse events, although these were not clearly reported in the studies.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, including the need for more robust evidence on the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use, and the importance of reporting adverse events, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to treatment, in order to provide clearer guidance for people trying to quit smoking."

      "subheading": "What is nicotine replacement therapy and why is it important for smoking cessation?",
      "content": "Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a treatment that helps people stop smoking by replacing the nicotine from cigarettes with a safer alternative. This can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, making it easier for people to quit smoking. NRT comes in various forms, such as patches, gum, lozenges, and nasal sprays, and can be used in different doses and durations. Smoking is a significant health problem that can lead to serious diseases like heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of developing these conditions, and NRT is one of the common treatments used to help people achieve this goal."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out about nicotine replacement therapy?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, doses, durations, and schedules of NRT for achieving long-term smoking cessation. They aimed to find out whether using combination NRT (e.g., fast-acting form plus patch) is more effective than single-form NRT, and whether higher doses of NRT are more effective than lower doses. They also investigated the effects of using NRT before quitting (preloading) compared to using it from quit day onward, and whether different types of NRT have varying effects on quit rates and safety outcomes like cardiac adverse events and study withdrawals due to treatment."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 68 studies that involved 43,327 participants. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. The studies were conducted in various countries, although the specific countries are not mentioned. The duration of the studies is not explicitly stated, but they all had a follow-up of at least six months. The studies compared different forms, deliveries, doses, durations, and schedules of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for achieving long-term smoking cessation. The types of interventions and comparisons included combination NRT, single-form NRT, and different doses and types of NRT products, such as patches and gum. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, are not explicitly stated, but the studies included adults motivated to quit smoking. Using a combination of nicotine replacement therapies probably increases the chances of quitting smoking. Nicotine replacement therapies, such as gum or lozenges, probably work as well as nicotine patches to help people quit smoking. Using nicotine replacement therapy before quitting may also improve the chances of quitting. However, it is unclear if different doses or durations of nicotine replacement therapy have an effect on quitting smoking."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), the studies were very small (low statistical power), and the findings do not cover all relevant populations or outcomes of interest (limited generalizability).",
