  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings?\n\nFor older people in care homes, changing the home's overall policy is probably the best way to reduce the use of physical restraints (like bedrails or belts). This approach involves training staff and having dedicated 'champions' to lead the new policy, and it did not appear to increase falls.\n\nWhat is the problem of physical restraints in long-term care settings?\nPhysical restraints, such as bedrails and belts in chairs or beds, are commonly used for older people receiving long-term care. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are not effective and can be harmful. This can lead to serious harm, like injuries or even death, and can also worsen an older person's quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to evaluate the effects of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who require long-term care. We aimed to find out which approaches work best to reduce the use of physical restraints. We also wanted to know if these approaches improve quality of life and reduce the risk of harm for older people in long-term care.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies on ways to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies involving 19,003 people, with an average age of 85. All studies took place in long-term care homes and included people with dementia. The studies tested three types of approaches: \n- Changing a care home's overall policies to focus on using fewer restraints \n- Providing educational programs for staff about the risks of restraints and alternatives to using them\n- Giving staff information about residents' risk of falling\n\nWe found that changing a care home's policies to use fewer restraints probably works. These changes likely reduce the use of all restraints, and especially belts. We are uncertain if simple educational programs for staff reduce restraint use, and giving staff information on fall risk may make little to no difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because in some studies, staff and residents knew which approach was being tested. This knowledge might have caused them to change their behaviour simply because they were part of a study, which could have influenced the results. Also, some of the studies were very small and they tested the approaches in slightly different ways, which makes it harder to compare their results confidently.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.\n\nMore research is needed to understand the long-term effects of these approaches and to find out what works in people's own homes. Future studies should focus on the needs of older people and their families to ensure care is tailored to the individual needs and preferences of older people and their families.",

      "feedback": "This is an excellent draft that meets all critical requirements and is highly readable. I'm approving it, but I have three minor suggestions to make it even stronger for your readers. 1. Consider adding examples to the main title to immediately clarify what 'physical restraints' are, like in the source text: '...(such as bedrails or belts)...'. 2. The key message summary is clear, but presenting it as a short, bulleted list at the top could make it easier for readers to scan and absorb the main takeaways. 3. The final paragraph combines two distinct ideas (future research topics and the approach for that research). Consider splitting this into two sentences or rephrasing for better flow, for example: 'More research is needed to understand the long-term effects and what works for people in their own homes. Future studies should be designed around the needs and preferences of older people and their families.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis indicates this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 78% of metrics fall within the best quartile for Cochrane Plain Language Summaries. Key readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (9.45) and Flesch Reading Ease (63.57) are excellent, suggesting the text is accessible. The structure is also strong, with a good average sentence length (20 words) and low use of passive voice. No metrics deviate significantly from the expected patterns."
