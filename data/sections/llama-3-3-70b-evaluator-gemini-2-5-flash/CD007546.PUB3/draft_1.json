  "draft": "# What are the best ways to reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bedrails or belts) for older people in long-term care settings?\n**Key Messages**\n- In long-term care settings, organisational interventions (changes in the way care is organised and delivered) aimed at implementing a least-restraint policy (a policy that aims to minimize the use of physical restraints) probably reduce the use of physical restraints, such as bedrails or belts, for older people, without causing harm, although no adverse events were reported in the studies.\n- Simple educational interventions (educating staff about the risks of physical restraints) may have little or no effect on reducing the use of physical restraints, and it is uncertain whether providing information about residents' fall risk to nursing staff makes a difference in the use of physical restraints.\n- Future research should focus on studying the long-term effects of these interventions, as well as their impact in community settings, and should prioritize the needs and concerns of older people, their families, and caregivers, to ensure that care is person-centred and respectful.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of physical restraints in long-term care settings?\nPhysical restraints, such as bedrails and belts in chairs or beds, are commonly used for older people receiving long-term care. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are not effective and can be harmful. Despite this, they are still widely used in care homes and other long-term care settings. This can lead to serious adverse events, such as death or serious injuries, and can also have a negative impact on the quality of life of older people.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effects of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who require long-term care. They aimed to find out which types of interventions are most effective in reducing the use of physical restraints, and whether these interventions can also improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of adverse events for older people in long-term care settings.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on interventions to prevent and reduce physical restraint use in older people in long-term care settings, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 19,003 people with a mean age of approximately 85 years. All studies were conducted in long-term residential care facilities, and none were from community settings. The studies included people with dementia and investigated various interventions, including organisational interventions aiming to implement a least-restraint policy, simple educational interventions, and an intervention providing staff with information about residents' fall risk. The control groups received usual care only in most studies, although in two studies, additional information materials about physical restraint reduction were provided. We did not find any studies on the use of physical restraints in community settings or other populations of interest. Organisational interventions probably reduce the number of residents with physical restraints and probably largely reduce the number of residents with belts. We are uncertain whether simple educational interventions reduce the use of physical restraints, and interventions providing information about residents' fall risk may result in little to no difference in the use of physical restraints.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants knew which treatment they received), the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

The text contains many excessively long and complex sentences, particularly in the Key Messages and Results sections, making the information difficult to process. Additionally, the Key Messages are not formatted as bullet points, and the Results section is presented as a single, dense paragraph, both of which deviate from the style guide and reduce scannability. The text is also notably noun-heavy, contributing to its overall complexity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns, with 11 out of 18 features falling into the P90 or Beyond P90 percentile ranges. Key deviations include an average sentence length (words_per_sentence) of 29.41, which is 'BEYOND_P90' (target <22.1), and a high noun count (nouns) of 204.00, also 'BEYOND_P90' (target <116.0). All readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid Grade, Automated Readability Index, LIX, RIX, SMOG Index, Dale-Chall Readability Score) are in the P90 range, indicating the text is considerably more difficult to read than typical PLS documents. Vocabulary complexity metrics (complex_words_dc, complex ... ) are also in the P90 range, confirming the use of more challenging language. These metrics strongly support the editorial observations regarding sentence length, vocabulary, and overall text complexity."
