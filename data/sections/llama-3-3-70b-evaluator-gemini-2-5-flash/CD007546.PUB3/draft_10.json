  "draft": "# What are the best ways to reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bedrails or belts) for older people in long-term care settings?\n**Key Messages**\n- Organisational interventions (programs that aim to change the way care is provided in institutions) probably reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bedrails or belts) for older people in long-term care settings, with little to no harmful effects reported, although the quality of the evidence is not strong.\n- Simple educational interventions (teaching staff about the proper use of restraints) may have little to no effect on reducing physical restraint use, and we are uncertain about their benefits and harms due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- Future research should focus on studying the long-term effects of these interventions, as well as their impact in community settings, to provide more comprehensive guidance for caregivers and policymakers on how to best reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in all long-term care settings.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of physical restraints in long-term care settings?\nPhysical restraints, such as bedrails and belts in chairs or beds, are commonly used for older people receiving long-term care. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are not effective and can be harmful. Despite this, they are still widely used in care homes and other long-term care settings. This can lead to serious adverse events, such as death or serious injuries, and can also have a negative impact on the quality of life of older people.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effects of interventions aimed at preventing and reducing the use of the physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings. They looked at different types of interventions, including organisational interventions, simple educational interventions, and interventions that provide information about residents' fall risk. The authors wanted to find out which interventions are most effective in reducing the use of physical restraints and improving the care of older people in long-term care settings.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies on preventing and reducing physical restraint use in long-term care, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 19,003 participants. All studies were conducted in long-term residential care facilities, and the mean age of the participants was approximately 85 years. The studies investigated various interventions, including organisational interventions aiming to implement a least-restraint policy, simple educational interventions, and an intervention that provided staff with information about residents' fall risk. The control groups received usual care only in most studies, although in two studies, additional information materials about physical restraint reduction were provided. We did not find any studies conducted in community settings. Organisational interventions probably reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings. These interventions may lead to a large reduction in the number of residents with at least one physical restraint. Simple educational interventions may have little to no effect on the number of residents with physical restraints, and interventions providing information about residents' fall risk may also have little to no effect.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), the studies were very small, and the studies involved different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, leading to heterogeneity.\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

Firstly, three subheadings ('Methods', 'Limitations', and 'Currency') are not phrased as questions, which deviates from the Master Style Guide. Secondly, the 'Results' section is a single, long paragraph, making it difficult to read. Thirdly, several sentences are overly long and dense, using complex vocabulary that would challenge a lay audience. The linguistic analysis supports these observations, showing deviations in metrics related to vocabulary complexity and sentence structure.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation indicates good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns (38.9% in the best quartile, 33.3% in the median range). However, five features deviate significantly from typical patterns (P90 range): 'nouns' (198.0, target <116.0), 'smog_index' (14.0, target <12.1), 'complex_words_dc' (257.0, target <160.0), 'complex_words' (121.0, target <84.0), and 'long_words' (192.0, target <122.0). These deviations suggest the text is denser and uses more complex and longer words than is typical for a plain language summary, impacting readability. The 'words_per_sentence' (23.41) is also on the higher side (P75), indicating longer sentences."
