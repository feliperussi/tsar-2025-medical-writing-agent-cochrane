  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bedrails or belts) for older people in long-term care settings?\n\nKey Messages\n- Organisational interventions (programs that aim to change the way care is provided in institutions) probably reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bedrails or belts) for older people in long-term care settings, with little to no harmful effects reported.\n- Simple educational interventions (teaching staff about the proper use of restraints) may have little to no effect on reducing physical restraint use, and we are uncertain about their benefits and harms due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- Future research should focus on studying the long-term effects of these interventions, as well as their impact in community settings, to provide more comprehensive guidance for caregivers and policymakers on how to best reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in all long-term care settings.\n\nWhat is the problem of physical restraints in long-term care settings?\nPhysical restraints, such as bedrails and belts in chairs or beds, are commonly used for older people receiving long-term care. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are not effective and can be harmful. Despite this, they are still widely used in care homes and other long-term care settings. This can lead to serious adverse events, such as death or serious injuries, and can also have a negative impact on the quality of life of older people.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effects of interventions aimed at preventing and reducing the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings. They looked at different types of interventions, including organisational interventions, simple educational interventions, and interventions that provide information about residents' fall risk. The authors wanted to find out which interventions are most effective in reducing the use of physical restraints and improving the care of older people in long-term care settings.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies on preventing and reducing physical restraint use in long-term care, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 19,003 participants. All studies were conducted in long-term residential care facilities, and the mean age of the participants was approximately 85 years. The studies investigated various interventions, including organisational interventions aiming to implement a least-restraint policy, simple educational interventions, and an intervention that provided staff with information about residents' fall risk. Organisational interventions probably reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings. These interventions may lead to a large reduction in the number of residents with at least one physical restraint. Simple educational interventions may have little to no effect on the number of residents with physical restraints, and interventions providing information about residents' fall risk may also have little to no effect.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because participants may have known which treatment they received, the studies were very small, and the studies involved different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention, leading to heterogeneity.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

There is a key factual error in the results, and some technical language and sentence structures will be difficult for a lay audience to understand.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Correct a Factual Inaccuracy in the Results:** The draft overstates one of the main findings. The original review found a *large* reduction for belts specifically, not for all physical restraints in general.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"These interventions may lead to a large reduction in the number of residents with at least one physical restraint.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"These interventions probably reduce the number of residents using any type of physical restraint. They seem to be especially effective for reducing the use of belts.\"\n\n2. **Simplify the First Key Message:** The first key message is 36 words long and packed with information, which can be overwhelming.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Organisational interventions (programs that aim to change the way care is provided in institutions) probably reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bedrails or belts) for older people in long-term care settings, with little to no harmful effects reported.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Programs that change how care is provided in institutions ('organisational interventions') probably reduce the use of restraints like bedrails or belts. Few or no harmful effects of these programs were reported.\"\n\n3. **Replace Technical Jargon in the Limitations:** The term 'heterogeneity' is not plain language and will confuse most readers.\n   - **Problematic phrase:** \"...leading to heterogeneity.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...meaning the studies were very different from each other, which makes it hard to compare their results.\"\n\n4. **Add Missing Context to the Results:** The results section omits the important finding that no studies were found in community settings (e.g., people's own homes). This is a key limitation of the evidence.\n   - **Missing information:** The review found no studies conducted outside of residential care facilities.\n   - **Suggested addition:** Add this sentence to the 'What did we find?' section: \"All the studies took place in long-term care homes; we did not find any studies that looked at people receiving care in their own homes.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with most readability and structure metrics falling within the median or best quartile ranges. However, the analysis identified significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. The draft has a high number of nouns (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), and long words (P90). This supports the editorial feedback that some sentences are dense and use technical terms (like 'heterogeneity' and 'organisational interventions'), which could be simplified to improve clarity for a lay audience."
