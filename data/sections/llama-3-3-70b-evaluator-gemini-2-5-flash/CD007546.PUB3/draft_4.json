  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings?\n\n- Changes to how care homes are organised to use as few restraints as possible probably reduce the use of physical restraints like bedrails or belts. The studies found this approach did not cause harm.\n- Simple educational programs for staff may have little or no effect on reducing the use of physical restraints. Giving staff information about residents' risk of falling may also make little to no difference in the use of physical restraints.\n- Future research should focus on studying the long-term effects of these interventions and their impact in community settings. It should prioritize the needs and concerns of older people, their families, and caregivers to ensure care is person-centred and respectful.\n\nWhat is the problem of physical restraints in long-term care settings?\nPhysical restraints, such as bedrails and belts in chairs or beds, are commonly used for older people receiving long-term care. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are not effective and can be harmful. Despite this, they are still widely used in care homes and other long-term care settings. This can lead to serious adverse events, such as death or serious injuries, and can also have a negative impact on the quality of life of older people.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effects of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who require long-term care. They aimed to find out which types of interventions are most effective in reducing the use of physical restraints and whether these interventions can also improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of adverse events for older people in long-term care settings.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested ways to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies involving 19,003 people, with an average age of 85. All studies took place in long-term care homes and included people with dementia.\n\nThe studies tested three types of approaches:\n- Changes to the care home's policies and organisation.\n- Simple education for staff.\n- Giving staff information about residents' risk of falling.\n\nWe found that changing a care home's policies to use fewer restraints probably works. These changes likely reduce the use of all restraints, and especially belts. We are uncertain if simple educational programs for staff reduce restraint use, and giving staff information on fall risk may make little to no difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded, the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear and well-structured. However, it cannot be approved because of a critical factual inaccuracy in how the evidence is presented. Here are the top 3 improvements needed to ensure the summary is accurate and easy for readers to understand:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Correct the finding on educational interventions.** The draft misrepresents the certainty of the evidence, which could mislead readers.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Simple educational programs for staff may have little or no effect on reducing the use of physical restraints.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing suggests there is low-certainty evidence of no effect. However, the source material states \"we are uncertain\" about the effects, which means the evidence is of very low certainty and no conclusion can be drawn. This is a crucial difference.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are uncertain if simple educational programs for staff reduce the use of physical restraints.\"\n\n2. **Simplify the description of the methods.** The current wording is slightly repetitive and could be more direct.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We searched for studies that tested ways to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Breaking this into two sentences makes it longer than necessary. It can be combined for better flow.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for studies on ways to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n3. **Make the final key message more active and direct.** The last bullet point is a bit noun-heavy, which can make it feel abstract.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Future research should focus on studying the long-term effects of these interventions and their impact in community settings.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence relies on several nouns ('research', 'effects', 'interventions', 'impact'). Using more active verbs makes the recommendation clearer and more engaging for the reader.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future studies should look at the long-term effects of these approaches and see how well they work for people receiving care at home.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling in the best quartile. Readability scores (like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 8.7) are excellent, and the use of active voice is strong. The only significant deviation is a high noun count (165), which is in the 90th percentile. This suggests that some sentences could be revised to use more active verbs instead of noun forms, as highlighted in the feedback."
