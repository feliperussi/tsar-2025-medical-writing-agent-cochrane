  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce the use of physical restraints (such as bedrails or belts) for older people in long-term care settings?\n\n- In long-term care settings, organisational interventions (changes in the way care is organised and delivered) aimed at implementing a least-restraint policy (a policy that aims to minimize the use of physical restraints) probably reduce the use of physical restraints, such as bedrails or belts, for older people, without causing harm, although no adverse events were reported in the studies.\n- Simple educational interventions (educating staff about the risks of physical restraints) may have little or no effect on reducing the use of physical restraints, and it is uncertain whether providing information about residents' fall risk to nursing staff makes a difference in the use of physical restraints.\n- Future research should focus on studying the long-term effects of these interventions, as well as their impact in community settings, and should prioritize the needs and concerns of older people, their families, and caregivers, to ensure that care is person-centred and respectful.\n\nWhat is the problem of physical restraints in long-term care settings?\nPhysical restraints, such as bedrails and belts in chairs or beds, are commonly used for older people receiving long-term care. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are not effective and can be harmful. Despite this, they are still widely used in care homes and other long-term care settings. This can lead to serious adverse events, such as death or serious injuries, and can also have a negative impact on the quality of life of older people.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effects of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who require long-term care. They aimed to find out which types of interventions are most effective in reducing the use of physical restraints, and whether these interventions can also improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of adverse events for older people in long-term care settings.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tested ways to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 19,003 people with a mean age of approximately 85 years. All studies were conducted in long-term residential care facilities, and none were from community settings. The studies included people with dementia and investigated various interventions, including organisational interventions aiming to implement a least-restraint policy, simple educational interventions, and an intervention providing staff with information about residents' fall risk. The control groups received usual care only in most studies, although in two studies, additional information materials about physical restraint reduction were provided. We did not find any studies on the use of physical restraints in community settings or other populations of interest. Organisational interventions probably reduce the number of residents with physical restraints and probably largely reduce the number of residents with belts. We are uncertain whether simple educational interventions reduce the use of physical restraints, and interventions providing information about residents' fall risk may result in little to no difference in the use of physical restraints.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants knew which treatment they received), the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that is factually accurate and complete. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are very long sentences and the use of complex, technical phrasing that makes the key findings difficult to understand. By breaking up long sentences and simplifying the language, the summary can be much more accessible.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Shorten Long, Complex Sentences**\n\nMany sentences, especially in the key messages, are too long and contain multiple ideas, making them hard to follow.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"In long-term care settings, organisational interventions (changes in the way care is organised and delivered) aimed at implementing a least-restraint policy (a policy that aims to minimize the use of physical restraints) probably reduce the use of physical restraints, such as bedrails or belts, for older people, without causing harm, although no adverse events were reported in the studies.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** At 58 words, this sentence is very difficult for a reader to process. It includes two definitions in parentheses and covers the intervention, the outcome, and the lack of harm all at once.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Changes in how care homes are organised to use as few restraints as possible probably reduce the use of physical restraints like bedrails or belts. The studies found this approach did not cause harm.\"\n\n**2. Simplify Complex and Technical Language**\n\nThe summary uses technical terms like 'organisational interventions' and 'implementing a least-restraint policy'. While you define them, it's better to use the simpler explanation from the start.\n\n- **Problematic Phrase:** \"...organisational interventions aiming to implement a least-restraint policy...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is jargon. A reader has to stop, read the definition, and then re-read the sentence to understand it. This slows down comprehension.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** Instead of using the technical term and defining it, just use the plain language. For example, instead of \"organisational interventions,\" say \"changes to how care is organised.\"\n\n**3. Break Up Long Paragraphs**\n\nThe 'What did we find?' section is a single, dense paragraph containing many different pieces of information (participant numbers, settings, intervention types, and results for all three).\n\n- **Problematic Paragraph:** \"We found 11 studies that involved 19,003 people... [to] ...may result in little to no difference in the use of physical restraints.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This 'wall of text' is intimidating and makes it hard for readers to pull out the key findings. Each topic should be in its own short paragraph.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:**\n\"We found 11 studies involving 19,003 people, with an average age of 85. All studies took place in long-term care homes and included people with dementia.\n\nThe studies tested three types of approaches:\n- Changes to the care home's policies and organisation.\n- Simple education for staff.\n- Giving staff information about residents' risk of falling.\n\nWe found that changing a care home's policies to use fewer restraints probably works. These changes likely reduce the use of all restraints, and especially belts. We are uncertain if simple educational programs for staff reduce restraint use, and giving staff information on fall risk may make little to no difference.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows MODERATE CONFORMITY with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics are good (e.g., active voice), several key indicators deviate significantly, supporting the need for revision. The average sentence length ('words_per_sentence' at 25.0) is in the highest 10% of the corpus, confirming that sentences are too long. The vocabulary is also too complex, with the number of Dale-Chall unfamiliar words ('complex_words_dc' at 278) falling beyond the 90th percentile, indicating it is much higher than is typical for a PLS. Other metrics for complex and long words also fall into the P90 range, highlighting the need to simplify language."
