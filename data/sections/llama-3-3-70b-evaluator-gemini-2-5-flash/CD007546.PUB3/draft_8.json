  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings?\n\nWe looked at studies that tested different approaches to reduce the use of physical restraints, such as bedrails or belts, in care homes. We found that changing a care home's overall policy to reduce restraints - for example, by training staff and having dedicated 'champions' for the new policy - probably reduces the use of physical restraints. The studies that measured safety found this approach did not increase the number of falls or fall-related injuries.\n\nWe are uncertain if simple educational programs for staff reduce the use of physical restraints. Giving staff information about residents' risk of falling may also make little to no difference in the use of physical restraints.\n\nWhat is the problem of physical restraints in long-term care settings?\nPhysical restraints, such as bedrails and belts in chairs or beds, are commonly used for older people receiving long-term care. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are not effective and can be harmful. This can lead to serious harm, like injuries or even death, and can also worsen an older person's quality of life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to evaluate the effects of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who require long-term care. We aimed to find out which approaches work best to reduce the use of physical restraints. We also wanted to know if these approaches improve quality of life and reduce the risk of harm for older people in long-term care.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies on ways to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies involving 19,003 people, with an average age of 85. All studies took place in long-term care homes and included people with dementia. The studies tested three types of approaches: \n- Changing a care home's overall policies to focus on using fewer restraints \n- Providing educational programs for staff about the risks of restraints and alternatives to using them\n- Giving staff information about residents' risk of falling\n\nWe found that changing a care home's policies to use fewer restraints probably works. These changes likely reduce the use of all restraints, and especially belts. We are uncertain if simple educational programs for staff reduce restraint use, and giving staff information on fall risk may make little to no difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because in some studies the staff and residents knew which approach was being used, which could have influenced the results. Also, some of the studies were very small and they tested the approaches in slightly different ways, which makes it harder to compare their results confidently.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.\n\nMore research is needed to understand the long-term effects of these approaches and to find out what works in people's own homes. Future studies should focus on the needs of older people and their families to ensure care is person-centred.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, well-structured, and factually accurate. The readability scores are excellent. I'm marking it as 'NOT_APPROVED' to incorporate a few key improvements that will make the main findings even more accessible to readers.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements I suggest:\n\n1. **Make the opening message more direct.** The first paragraph is a bit long and repetitive. Readers will benefit from getting the main takeaway immediately.\n   - **Original Text:** \"We looked at studies that tested different approaches to reduce the use of physical restraints, such as bedrails or belts, in care homes. We found that changing a care home's overall policy to reduce restraints - for example, by training staff and having dedicated 'champions' for the new policy - probably reduces the use of physical restraints.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"For older people in care homes, changing the home's overall policy is probably the best way to reduce the use of physical restraints (like bedrails or belts). This approach involves training staff and having dedicated 'champions' to lead the new policy, and it did not appear to increase falls.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the meaning of the limitations.** The explanation for why knowing the treatment could influence results is a bit vague.\n   - **Original Text:** \"...in some studies the staff and residents knew which approach was being used, which could have influenced the results.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...in some studies, staff and residents knew which approach was being tested. This knowledge might have caused them to change their behaviour simply because they were part of a study, which could have influenced the results.\"\n\n3. **Replace jargon with simpler, everyday language.** The summary concludes with a term that may be unfamiliar to many readers.\n   - **Original Text:** \"...to ensure care is person-centred.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...to ensure care is tailored to the individual needs and preferences of older people and their families.\"\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft uses more nouns and complex vocabulary than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. Focusing on more direct, common language will help address this.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72.2% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. The word count is well within the limit. However, two metrics deviate from the typical range: the count of nouns (P90) and the count of complex words from the Dale-Chall list (P90). This suggests that while readable, the text could be improved by using more direct verbs instead of nouns and replacing some less common words with simpler alternatives to enhance clarity for a lay audience."
