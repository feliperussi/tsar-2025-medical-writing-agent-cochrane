  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings?\n\n- We found that organisational interventions - changes in the way care is organised and delivered - probably reduce the use of physical restraints, such as bedrails or belts, for older people in long-term care settings.\n- Simple educational interventions - educating staff about the risks of physical restraints - may have little or no effect on reducing the use of physical restraints.\n- Future research should focus on studying the long-term effects of these interventions and their impact in community settings, prioritising the needs and concerns of older people, their families, and caregivers.\n\nWhat is the problem of physical restraints in long-term care settings?\nPhysical restraints, such as bedrails and belts in chairs or beds, are commonly used for older people receiving long-term care. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are not effective and can be harmful. Despite this, they are still widely used in care homes and other long-term care settings. This can lead to serious adverse events, such as death or serious injuries, and can also have a negative impact on the quality of life of older people.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effects of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who require long-term care. They aimed to find out which types of interventions are most effective in reducing the use of physical restraints and whether these interventions can also improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of adverse events for older people in long-term care settings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 19,003 people with a mean age of approximately 85 years. All studies were conducted in long-term residential care facilities, and none were from community settings. The studies included people with dementia and investigated various interventions, including organisational interventions aiming to implement a least-restraint policy, simple educational interventions, and an intervention providing staff with information about residents' fall risk.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded - participants knew which treatment they received - the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

Specifically, the 'Methods' section is missing entirely, and key findings from the review have been omitted from the 'Key Messages' and 'Results' sections, which could mislead the reader. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add the missing 'Methods' section.** The summary jumps from the aims to the results, leaving readers to wonder how the review was conducted. A simple methods section is required for clarity and completeness.\n   - **Suggested addition:** Add a new subheading 'How did we conduct this review?' with the text: \"We searched for studies that tested ways to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care. We then compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n\n2. **Include all key findings in the 'Key Messages'.** The current key messages are incomplete. They omit the finding about the third type of intervention (providing fall risk information) and the important detail that reducing restraints did not appear to cause harm.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"- Simple educational interventions - educating staff about the risks of physical restraints - may have little or no effect on reducing the use of physical restraints.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"- Simply educating staff about the risks of restraints may have little or no effect. We are also uncertain if providing staff with information about residents' fall risk makes a difference in the use of restraints.\"\n\n3. **State the main results clearly in the 'What did we find?' section.** This section describes the studies but fails to report the actual findings, which is its primary purpose. The key outcomes for each intervention type should be summarized here.\n   - **Problematic text:** The section ends without stating the results: \"...investigated various interventions, including organisational interventions aiming to implement a least-restraint policy, simple educational interventions, and an intervention providing staff with information about residents' fall risk.\"\n   - **Suggested addition:** Add the following to the end of that paragraph: \"We found that organisational interventions probably reduce the use of physical restraints, especially belts. We are uncertain about the effect of simple educational interventions. Providing staff with information about residents' fall risk may make little to no difference.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has good conformity with typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid grade level (11.68) and low use of passive voice (9 instances) are in the best quartile (P25), indicating strong readability and an active style. However, these positive metrics mask critical content and structural issues. The summary is missing a required 'Methods' section and omits key findings, which are issues the metrics cannot detect."
