  "draft": "What are the best ways to reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care settings?\n\n- Approaches that change a care home's overall policy to reduce restraints—for example, by training staff and having dedicated 'champions' for the new policy—probably reduce the use of physical restraints like bedrails or belts. The studies found this approach did not cause harm.\n- We are uncertain if simple educational programs for staff reduce the use of physical restraints. Giving staff information about residents' risk of falling may also make little to no difference in the use of physical restraints.\n- Future studies should look at the long-term effects of these approaches and see how well they work for people receiving care at home.\n\nWhat is the problem of physical restraints in long-term care settings?\nPhysical restraints, such as bedrails and belts in chairs or beds, are commonly used for older people receiving long-term care. However, there is clear evidence that physical restraints are not effective and can be harmful. Despite this, they are still widely used in care homes and other long-term care settings. This can lead to serious adverse events, such as death or serious injuries, and can also have a negative impact on the quality of life of older people.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to evaluate the effects of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who require long-term care. They aimed to find out which types of interventions are most effective in reducing the use of physical restraints and whether these interventions can also improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of adverse events for older people in long-term care settings.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies on ways to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people in long-term care, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies involving 19,003 people, with an average age of 85. All studies took place in long-term care homes and included people with dementia.\n\nThe studies tested three types of approaches:\n- Changing a care home's overall policies to focus on using fewer restraints (this included staff education and support from managers).\n- Providing educational programs for staff about the risks of restraints and alternatives to using them.\n- Giving staff information about residents' risk of falling.\n\nWe found that changing a care home's policies to use fewer restraints probably works. These changes likely reduce the use of all restraints, and especially belts. We are uncertain if simple educational programs for staff reduce restraint use, and giving staff information on fall risk may make little to no difference.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been 'blinded' (meaning the staff and residents knew which approach was being used), which could have influenced the results. The sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to August 2022.",

However, a few targeted revisions will make the summary even more accessible to a lay audience. Here are the top 3 suggested improvements:\n\n1. **Use simpler, more direct language instead of technical terms.**\n   - **Original sentence:** \"This can lead to serious adverse events, such as death or serious injuries, and can also have a negative impact on the quality of life of older people.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Adverse events\" is clinical jargon, and \"have a negative impact on\" is a wordy, indirect phrase.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This can lead to serious harm, like injuries or even death, and can also worsen an older person's quality of life.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the finding about harm.**\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The studies found this approach did not cause harm.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is slightly imprecise. The source material states that \"No adverse events occurred in the one study which reported this outcome.\" Your phrasing implies all studies actively looked for and found no harm, which isn't the case. Being more specific about what was measured builds more trust.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies that measured safety found this approach did not increase the number of falls or fall-related injuries.\"\n\n3. **Make the limitations section less abstract.**\n   - **Original sentence:** \"...the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This explains *what* the limitation is, but not *why* it matters to the reader. Connecting it to the impact on the results is more helpful.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Also, the studies tested the approaches in slightly different ways, which makes it harder to compare their results confidently.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with over 72% of features falling in the best quartile for readability. The text has excellent sentence length (19.6 words/sentence) and a very low use of passive voice. However, the analysis identified a higher-than-typical number of nouns and Dale-Chall complex words (both in the P90 range), which supports the recommendation to replace some technical or abstract terms with simpler, more direct vocabulary."
