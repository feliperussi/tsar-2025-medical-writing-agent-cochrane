  "key_messages": [
    "Cognitive rehabilitation (a personalized approach to help people manage everyday activities) is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage the everyday activities targeted in the intervention, with benefits seen in goal attainment and satisfaction with performance, and no reported harmful effects.",
    "Future research should focus on identifying avenues to maximize the effects of cognitive rehabilitation and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing, including process evaluation studies to understand how to best implement this intervention.",
    "More high-quality studies are needed to strengthen confidence in these findings and to explore the long-term effects of cognitive rehabilitation, as well as its effects on different subgroups of people with dementia."

      "content": "Dementia is a condition that affects a person's memory, thinking, and behaviour, making everyday activities challenging. It can be caused by various factors, including Alzheimer's disease. People with dementia often experience cognitive impairments, which can impact their functional ability and independence. Currently, there are treatments available, but researchers are ... new approaches to manage the condition."

      "subheading": "What is cognitive rehabilitation and how does it relate to dementia?",
      "content": "Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalised, solution-focused approach that aims to help people with dementia manage everyday activities and maintain independence. It is not a cure but rather a way to enable individuals to adapt to their condition. CR has been studied as a potential intervention to improve the lives of people with dementia."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to evaluate the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia. They also sought to identify factors associated with the efficacy of CR and explore its impact on care partners. The authors wanted to determine whether CR can be a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming everyday challenges."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found six studies that involved 1702 people with mild to moderate dementia. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80 and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants had a diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The studies were published in English between 2010 and 2022. The primary outcome of everyday functioning was operationalised as goal attainment in relation to activities targeted in the intervention. We compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care. We did not find information on the duration of the studies or the funding sources. Cognitive rehabilitation is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage everyday activities. It probably causes a large improvement in goal attainment and may cause a small improvement in self-efficacy and immediate recall. However, it may have little to no effect on anxiety, quality of life, and general functional ability."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by small study sizes, heterogeneity in populations and delivery methods, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), and incomplete coverage of the full range of people, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of interest, reducing confidence and generalizability.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to October 2022."
