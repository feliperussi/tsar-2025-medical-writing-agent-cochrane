  "draft": "Can cognitive rehabilitation help people with mild to moderate dementia manage everyday activities by improving their ability to perform specific tasks, with benefits seen in goal attainment and satisfaction with performance, and no reported harmful effects?\n\nKey messages:\n- Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalized approach that helps people with mild or moderate dementia manage everyday activities. It helps them improve their ability to do specific tasks they work on, and they report feeling more satisfied with their performance. No harmful effects were reported.\n- We need more research to find ways to make this therapy more effective and to improve daily life and well-being more broadly.\n- More high-quality studies are needed to strengthen confidence in these findings and to explore the long-term effects of cognitive rehabilitation, as well as its effects on different subgroups of people with dementia.\n\nWhat is dementia and why is it a problem?\nDementia is a condition that affects a person's memory, thinking, and behavior, making everyday activities challenging. It can be caused by various factors, including Alzheimer's disease. People with dementia often have problems with thinking and memory, which can make it harder for them to do everyday tasks and live independently. Currently, there are treatments available, but researchers are looking for new approaches to manage the condition.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation and how does it relate to dementia?\nCognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalized, solution-focused approach that aims to help people with dementia manage everyday activities and maintain independence. It is not a cure but rather a way to enable individuals to adapt to their condition. Researchers have studied CR as a possible way to improve the lives of people with dementia.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how cognitive rehabilitation affects the ability of people with mild to moderate dementia to manage everyday tasks. We also wanted to find out what makes cognitive rehabilitation work well and how it impacts care partners. The authors wanted to determine whether CR can be a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming everyday challenges.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing cognitive rehabilitation with control conditions. We then summarized the results and rated how certain we are about the evidence. This helps us assess the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 1702 people with mild to moderate dementia. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80, and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. We measured the main effect on everyday tasks by looking at whether people achieved the specific goals they set during the therapy. We compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care. Cognitive rehabilitation is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage everyday activities. It probably helps people greatly improve at reaching their goals. People who received cognitive rehabilitation were much more likely to achieve the personal goals they set as part of the therapy, such as learning to use a new phone or remembering to take their medication. It may also slightly improve their confidence and their ability to remember things right away. However, it may have little to no effect on anxiety, quality of life, and general functional ability.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe main limitation is that our findings are based on only a few studies, and one large, high-quality study had the biggest impact on the results. This means we are less certain if the results apply to everyone. Also, in these types of studies, people knew they were getting the therapy, which could affect the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start, but the summary needs to be revised to use simpler, more direct language before it can be approved. While the sentence length is good, the vocabulary is too complex for a lay audience, which will make it difficult for many readers to understand. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\\n\\n1. **Replace abstract nouns with active verbs.** Many sentences use noun forms of verbs (a style called 'nominalization'), which makes them less direct and harder to read. The high `nominalization` score (30, where a typical PLS has fewer than 13) confirms this pattern.\\n    - **Original:** 'It helps them improve their **ability** to do specific tasks they ...', and they report feeling more satisfied with their **performance**.'\\n    - **Suggestion:** 'It helps them get better at specific tasks. They also report feeling more satisfied with what they can do.'\\n\\n2. **Simplify complex and long words.** The summary uses many words with three or more syllables, making it hard to read. This is reflected in the high `smog_index` (15.2, indicating a university reading level) and `complex_words` count (144, where a typical PLS has fewer than 84).\\n    - **Original:** 'The authors wanted to **determine** whether CR can be a **valuable** part of a clinical toolkit to **assist** people with dementia in **overcoming** everyday **challenges**.'\\n    - **Suggestion:** 'We wanted to know if this therapy could be a useful tool to help people with dementia with their daily problems.'\\n\\n3. **Explain research jargon.** Terms that are common in research can be confusing for patients and the public. Always aim to define or simplify these terms.\\n    - **Original:** 'We searched for studies comparing cognitive rehabilitation with **control conditions**.'\\n    - **Suggestion:** 'We searched for studies that compared cognitive rehabilitation with other approaches, such as usual care or no extra therapy.'\\n\\nRevising the draft to address these vocabulary issues will make it much clearer and more accessible for your readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence-level metrics like average length (17.9 words) and passive voice (7 instances) are excellent, vocabulary metrics indicate the text is too complex. Six key metrics deviate significantly from the typical range, including `nominalization` (BEYOND_P90), `smog_index` (BEYOND_P90), `long_words` (BEYOND_P90), `complex_words` (P90), `complex_words_dc` (P90), and `nouns` (P90). This suggests the primary area for improvement is simplifying word choice and using more direct verbs."
