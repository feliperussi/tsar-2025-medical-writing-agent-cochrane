  "draft": "Can cognitive rehabilitation help people with mild to moderate dementia manage everyday activities by improving their ability to perform specific tasks, with benefits seen in goal attainment and satisfaction with performance, and no reported harmful effects?\n\nKey messages:\n- Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalized approach that helps people with mild or moderate dementia manage everyday activities. It helps them improve their ability to do specific tasks they work on, and they report feeling more satisfied with their performance. No harmful effects were reported.\n- We need more research to find ways to make this therapy more effective and to improve daily life and well-being more broadly.\n- More high-quality studies are needed to strengthen confidence in these findings and to explore the long-term effects of cognitive rehabilitation, as well as its effects on different subgroups of people with dementia.\n\nWhat is dementia and why is it a problem?\nDementia is a condition that affects a person's memory, thinking, and behavior, making everyday activities challenging. It can be caused by various factors, including Alzheimer's disease. People with dementia often experience cognitive impairments, which can impact their functional ability and independence. Currently, there are treatments available, but researchers are looking for new approaches to manage the condition.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation and how does it relate to dementia?\nCognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalized, solution-focused approach that aims to help people with dementia manage everyday activities and maintain independence. It is not a cure but rather a way to enable individuals to adapt to their condition. CR has been studied as a potential intervention to improve the lives of people with dementia.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to evaluate the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia. They also sought to identify factors associated with the efficacy of CR and explore its impact on care partners. The authors wanted to determine whether CR can be a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming everyday challenges.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing cognitive rehabilitation with control conditions, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found six studies that involved 1702 people with mild to moderate dementia. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80 and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. The studies were published in English between 2010 and 2022. We measured the main effect on everyday tasks by looking at whether people achieved the specific goals they set during the therapy. We compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care. Cognitive rehabilitation is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage everyday activities. It probably helps people greatly improve at reaching their goals. It may also slightly improve their confidence and their ability to remember things right away. However, it may have little to no effect on anxiety, quality of life, and general functional ability.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence has some limitations. The studies were small, and they varied in the types of people included and how the rehabilitation was delivered. It was also hard to blind participants, meaning they might have known if they were receiving the treatment. These factors reduce our confidence in the findings and how widely they can be applied.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for structure and factual accuracy. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of complex vocabulary and abstract language, which make some sections difficult to understand, as confirmed by the linguistic analysis.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace technical terms and abstract nouns with simpler, everyday language.** Many sentences use words that are too complex for a plain language summary. This makes the text feel dense and academic.\n    - **Example 1:** \"People with dementia often experience cognitive impairments, which can impact their functional ability and independence.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** 'Cognitive impairments' and 'functional ability' are clinical terms that may not be understood by all readers.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"People with dementia often have problems with thinking and memory, which can make it harder for them to do everyday tasks and live independently.\"\n    - **Example 2:** \"They also sought to identify factors associated with the efficacy of CR...\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** 'Efficacy' is a technical term for how well something works.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"They also wanted to find out what makes cognitive rehabilitation work well...\"\n\n2. **Use active verbs instead of noun phrases (nominalizations).** The text often uses nouns to describe actions, which makes sentences longer and less direct. The linguistic analysis shows this is a significant issue.\n    - **Example:** \"The review authors aimed to evaluate the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on everyday functioning...\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** \"evaluate the effects of\" is a wordy noun phrase. Using a direct verb is clearer.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how cognitive rehabilitation affects the ability of people with mild to moderate dementia to manage everyday tasks.\"\n\n3. **Use the active voice to make it clear who is doing the action.** Some sentences use the passive voice, which can be confusing or feel impersonal. The style guide recommends using the active voice.\n    - **Example:** \"CR has been studied as a potential intervention to improve the lives of people with dementia.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** It's unclear who did the studying. Using the active voice (\"Researchers have studied...\") is more direct.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Researchers have studied CR as a possible way to improve the lives of people with dementia.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity in sentence length and structure, with most readability scores in the best quartile. However, the analysis reveals significant issues with vocabulary complexity. Four key metrics—`nominalization` (use of noun-form verbs), `smog_index` (readability based on multi-syllable words), `complex_words`, and `long_words`—are in the 'Beyond P90' category, deviating significantly from typical PLS patterns. This indicates the text relies too heavily on technical, abstract, and long words, which is the primary area needing improvement."
