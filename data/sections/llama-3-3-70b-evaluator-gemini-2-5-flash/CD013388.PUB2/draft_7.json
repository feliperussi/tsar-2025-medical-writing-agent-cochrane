  "draft": "Can cognitive rehabilitation help people with mild to moderate dementia manage everyday activities by improving their ability to perform specific tasks, with benefits seen in goal attainment and satisfaction with performance, and no reported harmful effects?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that cognitive rehabilitation is helpful for people with mild or moderate dementia. It improves their ability to do specific tasks they work on, and they report feeling more satisfied with what they can do. No harmful effects were reported.\n- We need more research to find ways to make this therapy more effective and to improve daily life and well-being more broadly.\n- More high-quality studies are needed to strengthen confidence in these findings and to explore the long-term effects of cognitive rehabilitation, as well as its effects on different subgroups of people with dementia.\n\nWhat is dementia and why is it a problem?\nDementia is a condition that affects a person's memory, thinking, and behavior, making everyday activities challenging. It can be caused by various factors, including Alzheimer's disease (a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking, and behavior). People with dementia often have problems with thinking and memory, which can make it harder for them to do everyday tasks and live independently. Currently, there are treatments available, but researchers are looking for new approaches to manage the condition.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation and how does it relate to dementia?\nCognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalized approach that helps people with dementia manage everyday activities and maintain independence. It is not a cure but rather a way to enable individuals to adapt to their condition. Researchers have studied CR as a possible way to improve the lives of people with dementia.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out how cognitive rehabilitation affects the ability of people with mild to moderate dementia to manage everyday tasks. We also wanted to find out what makes cognitive rehabilitation work well and how it impacts care partners. We wanted to learn if CR is a useful tool for helping people with dementia.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared cognitive rehabilitation with other approaches, such as usual care or no extra therapy. We then summarized the results and rated how certain we are about the evidence. This helps us understand the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on everyday abilities and other outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies that involved 1702 people with mild to moderate dementia. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80, and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. We measured the main effect on everyday tasks by looking at whether people achieved the specific goals they set during the therapy. We compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care. Cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild or moderate dementia improve their ability to manage everyday activities. It probably helps people greatly improve at reaching their goals. People who received cognitive rehabilitation were much more likely to achieve the personal goals they set as part of the therapy, such as learning to use a new phone or remembering to take their medication. It may also slightly improve their confidence and their ability to remember things right away. However, it may have little to no effect on anxiety, quality of life, and general functional ability.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe main limitation is that our findings are based on only a few studies, and one large, high-quality study had the biggest impact on the results. This means we are less certain if the results apply to everyone. Also, in these types of studies, people knew they were getting the therapy, which could affect the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start. The summary is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured with question-based headings. However, it needs revision to be more accessible for a general audience. The main issues are the use of complex vocabulary and abstract nouns, which make the text difficult to read, as confirmed by the linguistic analysis. Focusing on simpler word choices and more direct, active phrasing will significantly improve clarity for readers.\n\nHere are the top 4 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex words and abstract nouns.** The text often uses academic phrasing instead of everyday language. This makes key concepts harder to grasp.\n    - **Original sentence:** \"We wanted to find out how cognitive rehabilitation affects the ability of people with mild to moderate dementia to manage everyday tasks.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"affects the ability of people... to manage\" is indirect and uses an abstract noun (\"ability\"). It's wordy and less clear than using a simple verb.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia manage their everyday and everyday tasks.\"\n\n2. **Remove repetitive information.** Some sentences repeat definitions or ideas that have just been stated, which can make the text feel dense and confusing.\n    - **Original sentence:** \"It can be caused by various factors, including Alzheimer's disease (a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking, and behavior).\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** The previous sentence already defined dementia as a condition affecting \"memory, thinking, and behavior.\" Repeating this definition in parentheses is unnecessary.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"It can be caused by different conditions, including Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\n3. **Make abstract concepts more concrete with examples.** The summary explains the main finding in abstract terms before giving a clear, helpful example. Leading with the example would improve understanding.\n    - **Original text:** \"It probably helps people greatly improve at reaching their goals. People who received cognitive rehabilitation were much more likely to achieve the personal goals they set as part of the therapy, such as learning to use a new phone or remembering to take their medication.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** The term \"reaching their goals\" is vague until the reader gets to the excellent example at the end.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"It probably helps people achieve the personal goals they set during therapy. For example, people were much more likely to succeed at tasks like learning to use a new phone or remembering to take their medication.\"\n\n4. **Combine repetitive sentences to improve flow.** The section explaining the review's aims uses a very repetitive structure, which makes it monotonous to read.\n    - **Original text:** \"We wanted to find out how cognitive rehabilitation affects the ability of people with mild to moderate dementia to manage everyday tasks. We also wanted to find out what makes cognitive rehabilitation work well and how it impacts care partners. We wanted to learn if CR is a useful tool for helping people with dementia.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** Starting three sentences in a row with \"We wanted to find out/learn\" is clunky.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia manage everyday tasks, what makes it work well, and how it affects care partners. Overall, we wanted to learn if it is a useful tool for helping people with dementia.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your draft has many strengths, including good sentence length and use of active, active voice. However, the linguistic analysis shows that vocabulary is a key issue. The SMOG index of 15.0 is very high, suggesting the text requires a university-level education to read easily. This is driven by a high number of complex words, long words, and nominalizations (abstract nouns), all of which fall into the P90/BEYOND_P90 categories, deviating significantly from typical PLS patterns.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows a mixed profile. While many structural metrics like sentence length (words_per_sentence: P25) and active voice (active_voice: P75) are excellent and fall within the best quartile, the summary deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics are in the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range, indicating a need for revision. The most critical deviations are the SMOG index (15.0), which is well above the typical range and suggests a high reading grade level, and the high count of nominalizations (28.0), complex words (139.0), and long words (205.0). These scores point to a text that uses overly academic vocabulary and abstract phrasing, which hinders readability for a lay audience. The summary also notes strengths such as good sentence length and active voice usage."
