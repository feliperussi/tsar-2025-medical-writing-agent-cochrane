  "draft": "Can cognitive rehabilitation help people with mild to moderate dementia manage everyday activities by improving their ability to perform specific tasks, with benefits seen in goal attainment and satisfaction with performance, and no reported harmful effects?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that cognitive rehabilitation is helpful for people with mild or moderate dementia. It improves their ability to do specific tasks they work on, and they report feeling more satisfied with what they can do. No harmful effects were reported.\n- We need more research to find ways to make this therapy more effective and to improve daily life and well-being more broadly.\n- More high-quality studies are needed to strengthen confidence in these findings and to explore the long-term effects of cognitive rehabilitation, as well as its effects on different subgroups of people with dementia.\n\nWhat is dementia and why is it a problem?\nDementia is a condition that affects a person's memory, thinking, and behavior, making everyday activities challenging. It can be caused by different conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. People with dementia often have problems with thinking and memory, which can make it harder for them to do everyday tasks and live independently. Currently, there are treatments available, but researchers are looking for new approaches to manage the condition.\n\nWhat is cognitive rehabilitation and how does it relate to dementia?\nCognitive rehabilitation is a personalized approach that helps people with dementia manage everyday activities and maintain independence. It is not a cure but rather a way to enable individuals to adapt to their condition. Researchers have studied cognitive rehabilitation as a possible way to improve the lives of people with dementia.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild to moderate dementia manage their everyday tasks, what makes it work well, and how it affects care partners. Overall, we wanted to learn if it is a useful tool for helping people with dementia.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies that compared cognitive rehabilitation with other approaches, such as usual care or no extra therapy. We then summarized the results and rated how certain we are about the evidence. This helps us understand the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on everyday abilities and other outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 6 studies that involved 1702 people with mild to moderate dementia. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80, and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. We measured the main effect on everyday tasks by looking at whether people achieved the specific goals they set during the therapy. We compared cognitive rehabilitation with usual care. Cognitive rehabilitation helps people with mild or moderate dementia improve their ability to manage everyday activities. It probably helps people achieve the personal goals they set during therapy. For example, people were much more likely to succeed at tasks like learning to use a new phone or remembering to take their medication. It may also slightly improve their confidence and their ability to remember things right away. However, it may have little to no effect on anxiety, overall quality of life, or a person's general ability to manage daily life beyond the specific goals they worked on.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe main weakness is that we found only a few studies, and one large, high-quality study drove most of the results. This means we are less certain if the results apply to everyone. Also, in these types of studies, people knew they were getting the therapy, which could affect the results.\n\nHow up-to-date is the evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to October 2022.\n\nWe need more high-quality studies to be more certain about these results. Future research should also look at the long-term effects and see if the therapy works differently for various groups of people with dementia.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong and factually accurate draft, but it can be made significantly easier for readers to understand by focusing on word choice. The sentence structure is good, but the vocabulary is more complex than it needs to be. Here are the top 3 improvements:\n\n1. **Simplify complex words and academic phrasing.** Some sentences use language that could be challenging for a lay audience. Replacing these with more common words will improve readability.\n   - **Instead of:** 'Cognitive rehabilitation is a personalized approach that helps people with dementia manage everyday activities and maintain independence.'\n   - **Consider:** 'Cognitive rehabilitation is a type of therapy tailored to each person. It helps people with dementia find new ways to handle daily tasks and stay as independent as possible.'\n\n2. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** The draft often uses noun forms of verbs (e.g., 'goal attainment' instead of 'reaching goals'), which makes the text feel more formal and less direct.\n   - **Instead of:** 'We measured the main effect on everyday tasks by looking at whether people achieved the specific goals they set during the therapy.'\n   - **Consider:** 'To see if the therapy worked, we checked if people could meet the specific goals they set for themselves.'\n\n3. **Make the main finding more direct.** The evidence for the primary outcome is high-certainty, so the language can be more confident and clear.\n   - **Instead of:** 'It probably helps people achieve the personal goals they set during therapy.'\n   - **Consider:** 'The therapy clearly helps people reach the personal goals they set. For example, they were much more likely to succeed at tasks like learning to use a new phone or remembering to take their medication.'\n\nMaking these changes will help address the high number of complex words and noun phrases identified in the linguistic analysis, making the summary more accessible to a wider audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft conforms well to many typical PLS patterns, particularly with its short sentences (words_per_sentence in P25) and high use of active voice (active_voice in P75). However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics, including the SMOG index (BEYOND_P90), complex words (P90), long words (P90), and nominalizations (P90), are much higher than is typical for a PLS. This indicates that while the sentence structure is simple, the word choice is too academic and complex for a lay audience, making the text harder to read than necessary."
