  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether re-feeding gastric residuals is better than discarding it for improving growth in premature babies.",
    "Re-feeding gastric residuals may have little or no effect on important clinical outcomes such as necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies), all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds (feeding through the gut), number of total parenteral nutrition days (receiving nutrients through a vein), and in-hospital weight gain.",
    "Future research in this area should focus on assessing the efficacy and safety of re-feeding gastric residuals in preterm infants with adequate certainty of evidence to inform policy and practice."

      "subheading": "What is the problem of gastric residuals in preterm infants?",
      "content": "Preterm infants often have trouble digesting food, and as a result, they may have leftover food in their stomachs, known as gastric residuals. This can be a problem because it may cause vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (a serious infection of the intestine), or sepsis (a life-threatening infection). To manage this issue, healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in preterm \"preterm infants\" who are being fed through a tube. However, there is no clear consensus on whether to re-feed these gastric residuals to the infant or discard them."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to determine whether re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants is more effective and safer than discarding them. They wanted to find out if re-feeding gastric residuals can improve growth and reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, and death. They also sought to understand the potential benefits and harms of re-feeding gastric residuals in preterm infants."

      "subheading": "Search Strategy",
      "content": "We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for randomized and quasi‑randomized trials that compared re‑feeding versus discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. No language restrictions were applied, and reference lists of relevant reviews were screened for additional studies."

      "subheading": "Eligibility Criteria",
      "content": "Included studies enrolled preterm infants (<37 weeks gestation) receiving enteral nutrition and reported at least one clinical outcome related to efficacy (e.g., time to full feeds) or safety (e.g., necrotising enterocolitis, vomiting). Trials that used mixed feeding protocols without a clear re‑feeding versus discard comparison were excluded."

      "subheading": "Data Extraction and Synthesis",
      "content": "Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, participant demographics, interventions, and outcomes. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. A random‑effects meta‑analysis was conducted using the DerSimonian‑Laird method."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found one study that included 72 preterm infants. The study was conducted in an unspecified country and setting. The population characteristics included preterm infants, but the age and gender of the participants were not specified. The study compared re-feeding versus discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. The study funding sources were not mentioned. We did not find any information on the duration of the study. Re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants may make little to no difference to several important clinical outcomes, including the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds, and in-hospital weight gain. However, we are uncertain about the effects of this intervention due to the limited data available."
