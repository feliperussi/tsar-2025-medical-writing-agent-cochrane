  "draft": "Is re-feeding gastric residuals (leftover food in the stomach) better than discarding them for improving growth in premature babies?\n\n- Giving leftover food (gastric residuals) back to premature babies may have little or no effect on their health. We found it may not affect their weight gain, their risk of a serious bowel condition (necrotising enterocolitis), or their risk of dying before leaving the hospital.\n- Because there is not enough good evidence, we are uncertain about the benefits and risks of re-feeding gastric residuals in premature babies. \n- We need larger and better-designed studies to be sure about the benefits and harms of re-feeding gastric residuals. This research would give clearer guidance to doctors and could improve care for these vulnerable babies.\n\nWhat is the problem of gastric residuals in premature babies?\nPremature babies often have trouble digesting food, and as a result, they may have leftover food in their stomachs, known as gastric residuals. This can be a problem because it may cause vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (a serious infection of the intestine), or sepsis (a life-threatening infection). To manage this issue, healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in premature babies who are being fed through a tube. However, there is no clear consensus on whether to re-feed these gastric residuals to the baby or discard them.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine whether re-feeding gastric residuals to premature babies is more effective and safer than discarding them. They wanted to find out if re-feeding gastric residuals can improve growth and reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, and death. They also wanted to know if re-feeding gastric residuals helps premature babies:\n- regain their birth weight faster\n- establish full tube feeding sooner\n- reduce the need for intravenous feeding (also called total parenteral nutrition)\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing re-feeding and discarding gastric residuals in premature babies, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 72 premature babies. Re-feeding gastric residuals to premature babies may make little to no difference to:\n- the risk of a serious bowel condition (necrotising enterocolitis)\n- the risk of death before leaving the hospital\n- the time needed for full tube feeding\n- weight gain in the hospital\nHowever, it is unclear if re-feeding gastric residuals has an effect on the number of episodes of feed interruption lasting for 12 hours or more.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the study was very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

All critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting have passed. The analysis indicates strong performance, with 11 of 18 metrics (61%) falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. Notably, the use of passive voice is low and active voice is high, which is excellent. The average words per sentence (24.48) is in the P75 range; while acceptable, this suggests some sentences are on the longer side for a PLS and could be slightly shortened to further improve readability."
