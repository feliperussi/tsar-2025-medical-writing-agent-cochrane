This can be a problem because it may cause vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (a serious infection of the intestine), or sepsis (a life-threatening infection). To manage this issue, healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in preterm infants who are being fed through a tube. However, there is no clear consensus on whether to re-feed these gastric residuals to the infant or discard them.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine whether re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants is more effective and safer than discarding them. They wanted to find out if re-feeding gastric residuals can improve growth and reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, and death. They also wanted to know if re-feeding gastric residuals can help preterm infants regain their birth weight faster, establish full tube feeding sooner, and reduce the need for total parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding).\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing re-feeding and discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 72 preterm infants. The study was conducted in an unspecified country and lasted for an unspecified duration. There is no information on the funding sources of the study. The population characteristics include preterm infants, but no information is available on the age, gender, or severity of condition. The study setting is a neonatal intensive care unit. The type of intervention is re-feeding versus discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants may make little to no difference to several important clinical outcomes, including the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds, and in‑hospital weight gain. However, it is unclear if re-feeding gastric residuals has an effect on the number of episodes of feed interruption lasting for µ 12 hours.\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the study was very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is within the word count limit (611 words). The metric evaluation shows moderate conformity with PLS patterns, with 50% of features falling into the best quartile or median range. However, six features deviate significantly from typical PLS patterns (P90 range): nominalization, nouns, rix, complex_words_dc, complex_words, and long_words.
