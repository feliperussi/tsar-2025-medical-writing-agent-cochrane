  "draft": "# Is re-feeding gastric residuals (the food that is left in the stomach) better than discarding it for improving growth in premature babies?\n**Key Messages**\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether re-feeding gastric residuals is better than discarding it for improving growth in premature babies.\n- Re-feeding gastric residuals may have little or no effect on important clinical outcomes such as necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies), all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds (feeding through the gut), number of total parenteral nutrition days (receiving nutrients through a vein), and in-hospital weight gain.\n- Future research in this area should focus on assessing the efficacy and safety of re-feeding gastric residuals in preterm infants with adequate certainty of evidence to inform policy and practice.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is the problem of gastric residuals in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants often have trouble digesting food, and as a result, they may have leftover food in their stomachs, known as gastric residuals. This can be a problem because it may cause vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (a serious infection of the intestine), or sepsis (a life-threatening infection). To manage this issue, healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in preterm \"preterm infants\" who are being fed through a tube. However, there is no clear consensus on whether to re-feed these gastric residuals to the infant or discard them.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine whether re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants is more effective and safer than discarding them. They wanted to find out if re-feeding gastric residuals can improve growth and reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, and death. They also sought to understand the potential benefits and harms of re-feeding gastric residuals in preterm infants.\n**Methods**\nSearch Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for randomized and quasi‑randomized trials that compared re‑feeding versus discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. No language restrictions were applied, and reference lists of relevant reviews were screened for additional studies.\nEligibility Criteria\nIncluded studies enrolled preterm infants (<37 weeks gestation) receiving enteral nutrition and reported at least one clinical outcome related to efficacy (e.g., time to full feeds) or safety (e.g., necrotising enterocolitis, vomiting). Trials that used mixed feeding protocols without a clear re‑feeding versus discard comparison were excluded.\nData Extraction and Synthesis\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, participant demographics, interventions, and outcomes. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. A random‑effects meta‑analysis was conducted using the DerSimonian‑Laird method.\nAssessment of Evidence Confidence\nThe GRADE framework was applied to rate the certainty of the evidence for each outcome, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Summary of findings tables were generated to present the magnitude of effect and confidence levels.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that included 72 preterm infants. The study was conducted in an unspecified country and setting. The population characteristics included preterm infants, but the age and gender of the participants were not specified. The study compared re-feeding versus discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. The study funding sources were not mentioned. We did not find any information on the duration of the study. Re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants may make little to no difference to several important clinical outcomes, including the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds, and in-hospital weight gain. However, we are uncertain about the effects of this intervention due to the limited data available.\n**Limitations**\nThe study had a very small sample size, and participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to several critical issues impacting clarity and adherence to style guidelines. Many subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a direct violation of the Master Style Guide. The 'Methods' section contains extensive technical jargon and complex statistical terms that are inappropriate for a plain language summary, making it largely incomprehensible for a lay audience. Additionally, the text frequently uses long, complex sentences, excessive passive voice, and noun-heavy constructions, which significantly reduce readability. These issues are supported by the linguistic analysis.\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, violating the Master Style Guide (e.g., 'Key Messages', 'Search Strategy', 'Eligibility Criteria', 'Data Extraction and Synthesis', 'Assessment of Evidence Confidence', 'Limitations', 'Currency').\n2.  **Technical Jargon in Methods:** The entire 'Methods' section is written in highly technical language, including terms like 'randomized and quasi‑randomized trials', 'Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)', 'mean differences (MD) with 95% CI', 'random‑effects meta‑analysis', 'DerSimonian‑Laird method', and 'GRADE framework', without adequate explanation or simplification.\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Revise Subheading Format to Questions:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"Key Messages\", \"Search Strategy\", \"Eligibility Criteria\", \"Data Extraction and Synthesis\", \"Assessment of Evidence Confidence\", \"Limitations\", \"Currency\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** The Master Style Guide requires subheadings to be phrased as questions to improve reader engagement and clarity.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:**\n        *   \"Key Messages\" → \"What are the key messages?\"\n        *   \"Search Strategy\" → \"How did we find the studies?\"\n        *   \"Eligibility Criteria\" → \"What studies did we include?\"\n        *   \"Data Extraction and Synthesis\" → \"How did we collect and combine the data?\"\n        *   \"Assessment of Evidence Confidence\" → \"How sure are we about the evidence?\"\n        *   \"Limitations\" → \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n        *   \"Currency\" → \"How up to date is this review?\"\n2.  **Simplify Technical Language and Concepts in the Methods Section:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and trial registries for randomized and quasi‑randomized trials that compared re‑feeding versus discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. No language restrictions were applied, and reference lists of relevant reviews were screened for additional studies.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This paragraph uses highly technical terms ('systematic search', 'trial registries', 'randomized and quasi‑randomized trials') that are not explained and are too complex for a plain language summary. It also uses passive voice.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched major medical databases like PubMed and Cochrane CENTRAL, as well as study registries, to find and include studies that compared re‑feeding versus discarding gastric residuals in premature babies. We looked for all types of studies, including those that randomly assigned babies to different groups. We also checked the reference lists of other relevant reviews.\"\n3.  **Reduce Passive Voice, Nominalization, and Shorten Sentences:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"The GRADE framework was applied to rate the certainty of the evidence for each outcome, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Summary of findings tables were generated to present the magnitude of effect and confidence levels.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** This sentence is excessively long (36 words), uses passive voice ('was applied', 'were generated'), and is laden with nominalizations and technical terms ('certainty of the evidence', 'risk of bias', 'inconsistency', 'indirectness', 'imprecision', 'publication bias', 'magnitude of effect', 'confidence levels'), making it very difficult for a lay audience to understand.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We used a special system called GRADE to decide how sure we were about the results for each outcome. This system helped us consider things like how well and if the results were consistent. We then created tables to show how big the effects were and how confident we were in those findings.\"\n4.  **Address Redundancy/Typo:**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in preterm \\\"preterm infants\\\" who are being fed through a tube.\"\n    *   **Why problematic:** The phrase \"preterm 'preterm infants'\" is redundant and likely a typo, causing confusion.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in preterm infants who are being fed through a tube.\"\n\n**pls_evaluation_summary**: \"The linguistic analysis indicates moderate conformity with PLS patterns, with 38.9% of features in the best quartile and 27.8% beyond the 90th percentile.
