  "draft": "Is re-feeding gastric residuals (the food that is left in the stomach) better than discarding it for improving growth in premature babies?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We are not sure if re-feeding gastric residuals is better than discarding it for improving growth in premature babies because there is not enough strong evidence.\n- Re-feeding the leftover food may make little or no difference to important health results. These include the risk of a serious bowel condition (necrotising enterocolitis), the number of babies who died before leaving the hospital, the time to get to full tube feeds, and the number of days they needed feeding through a vein.\n- More research is needed to be certain about the benefits and harms of re-feeding. This will help create clear guidelines for doctors and nurses.\n\nWhat is the problem of gastric residuals in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants often have trouble digesting food, and as a result, they may have leftover food in their stomachs, known as gastric residuals. This can be a problem because it may cause vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (a serious infection of the intestine), or sepsis (a life-threatening infection). To manage this issue, healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in preterm infants who are being fed through a tube. However, there is no clear consensus on whether to re-feed these gastric residuals to the infant or discard them.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if re-feeding leftover food to premature babies is better and safer than throwing it away. Specifically, we looked at whether re-feeding improved growth and lowered the risk of serious problems like bowel infections (necrotising enterocolitis), blood infections (sepsis), and death.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared re-feeding leftover food with throwing it away in premature babies. We focused on studies where babies were randomly put into one of the two groups to ensure a fair comparison.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that included 72 preterm infants. The study compared re-feeding versus discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants may make little to no difference to several important clinical outcomes, including the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds, and in-hospital weight gain. However, we are uncertain about the effects of this intervention due to the limited data available.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe study had a very small sample size, and the babies' families and carers may have known which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

An impressive 83.3% of the linguistic metrics fall within the best quartile for readability and plain language. All readability scores, such as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (10.52), are in the P25 range, indicating the text is easier to read than most summaries in the corpus. The use of active voice is high (P75) and passive voice is low (P25), aligning with best practices. Sentence length (20.29 words) and vocabulary complexity are in the typical P50-P75 range, showing a good balance for the topic. Overall, the metrics indicate no areas of significant deviation and support the conclusion that the text is well-written for a lay audience."
