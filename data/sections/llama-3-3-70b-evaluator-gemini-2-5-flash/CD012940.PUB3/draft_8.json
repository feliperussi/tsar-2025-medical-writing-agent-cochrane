  "draft": "Is re-feeding gastric residuals (the food that is left in the stomach) better than discarding it for improving growth in premature babies?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, it is unclear whether re-feeding gastric residuals is better than discarding it for improving growth in premature babies.\n- Re-feeding gastric residuals may have little or no effect on important clinical outcomes such as necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies), all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds (feeding through the gut), number of total parenteral nutrition days (receiving nutrients through a vein), and in-hospital weight gain.\n- Future research in this area should focus on assessing the efficacy and safety of re-feeding gastric residuals in preterm infants with adequate certainty of evidence to inform policy and practice.\n\nWhat is the problem of gastric residuals in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants often have trouble digesting food, and as a result, they may have leftover food in their stomachs, known as gastric residuals. This can be a problem because it may cause vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (a serious infection of the intestine), or sepsis (a life-threatening infection). To manage this issue, healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in preterm infants who are being fed through a tube. However, there is no clear consensus on whether to re-feed these gastric residuals to the infant or discard them.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine whether re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants is more effective and safer than discarding them. They wanted to find out if re-feeding gastric residuals can improve growth and reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, and death. They also sought to understand the potential benefits and harms of re-feeding gastric residuals in preterm infants.\n\nHow did we find the studies?\nWe searched major medical databases like PubMed and Cochrane CENTRAL, as well as study registries, to find and include studies that compared re-feeding versus discarding gastric residuals in premature babies. We looked for all types of studies, including those that randomly assigned babies to different groups. We also checked the reference lists of other relevant reviews.\n\nWhat studies did we include?\nWe included studies that enrolled preterm infants (less than 37 weeks gestation) receiving enteral nutrition and reported at least one clinical outcome related to efficacy (e.g., time to full feeds) or safety (e.g., necrotising enterocolitis, vomiting). We excluded trials that used mixed feeding protocols without a clear re-feeding versus discard comparison.\n\nHow did we collect and combine the data?\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, participant demographics, interventions, and outcomes. We calculated the effects of the interventions and presented the results in a way that is easy to understand. We used a special system to decide how sure we were about the results for each outcome.\n\nHow sure are we about the evidence?\nWe used a system called GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. This system considers things like how well the studies were done and if the results were consistent. We then created tables to show how big the effects were and how confident we were in those findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that included 72 preterm infants. The study compared re-feeding versus discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants may make little to no difference to several important clinical outcomes, including the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds, and in-hospital weight gain. However, we are uncertain about the effects of this intervention due to the limited data available.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe study had a very small sample size, and participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

However, the language is too technical for a general audience, which makes it difficult to understand the key findings. To improve clarity, please focus on the following 3 areas:\\n\\n1. **Simplify the long list of medical outcomes.** The sentence listing the results is dense with jargon. While you define some terms, the overall effect is overwhelming for a reader.\\n   - **Original Text:** \\\"Re-feeding gastric residuals may have little or no effect on important clinical outcomes such as necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies), all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds (feeding through the gut), number of total parenteral nutrition days (receiving nutrients through a vein), and in-hospital weight gain.\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This single sentence contains five complex medical concepts. Phrases like \\\"all-cause mortality before hospital discharge\\\" and \\\"clinical outcomes\\\" are already escaped.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \\\"Re-feeding the leftover food may make little or no difference to important health results. These include the risk of a serious bowel condition (necrotising enterocolitis), the number of babies who died before leaving the hospital, the time it took for them to be fully fed through a tube in their stomach, and the number of days they needed feeding through a vein.\\\"\\n\\n2. **Make the methods section more reader-friendly.** The methods are currently split across four separate questions (\\\"How did we find...?\\\", \\\"What studies did we include...?\\\", etc.). This is fragmented and contains unnecessary detail.\\n   - **Original Text:** The entire section from \\\"How did we find the studies?\\\" to \\\"How sure are we about the evidence?\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This level of detail about search strategies and data extraction is not necessary for a PLS. It breaks the flow of the summary.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Combine these sections under a single, simpler heading:\\n     \\\"**How did we conduct this review?**\\n     We searched for studies that compared ...\\n\\n3. **Rephrase the formal conclusion in the key messages.** The final key message is written in a very academic and wordy style.\\n   - **Original Text:** \\\"Future research in this area should focus on assessing the efficacy and safety of re-feeding gastric residuals in preterm infants with adequate certainty of evidence to inform policy and practice.\\\"\\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \\\"assessing the efficacy and safety\\\" and \\\"adequate certainty of evidence to inform policy and practice\\\" are jargon.\\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \\\"More research is needed to be certain about the benefits and harms of re-feeding.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows a mix of good and problematic features. While sentence length (19.78 words) and active voice use are excellent and fall within the best quartile for PLS texts, the vocabulary is significantly more complex than typical. Three key metrics—'complex_words' (words with ...), 'complex_words_dc' (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words), and 'long_words' (7+ characters)—are all rated 'BEYOND_P90', indicating the text uses far more difficult vocabulary than over 90% of summaries in our reference corpus. This high complexity is the primary reason the summary requires revision for clarity."
