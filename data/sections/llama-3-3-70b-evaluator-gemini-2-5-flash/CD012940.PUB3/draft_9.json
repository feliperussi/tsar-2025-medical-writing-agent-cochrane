  "draft": "Is re-feeding gastric residuals (the food that is left in the stomach) better than discarding it for improving growth in premature babies?\n\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We are not sure if re-feeding gastric residuals is better than discarding it for improving growth in premature babies because there is not enough strong evidence.\n- Re-feeding the leftover food may make little or no difference to important health results. These include the risk of a serious bowel condition (necrotising enterocolitis), the number of babies who died before leaving the hospital, the time it took for them to be fully fed through a tube in their stomach, and the number of days they needed feeding through a vein.\n- More research is needed to be certain about the benefits and harms of re-feeding. This will help create clear guidelines for doctors and nurses.\n\nWhat is the problem of gastric residuals in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants often have trouble digesting food, and as a result, they may have leftover food in their stomachs, known as gastric residuals. This can be a problem because it may cause vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (a serious infection of the intestine), or sepsis (a life-threatening infection). To manage this issue, healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in preterm infants who are being fed through a tube. However, there is no clear consensus on whether to re-feed these gastric residuals to the infant or discard them.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine whether re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants is more effective and safer than discarding them. They wanted to find out if re-feeding gastric residuals can improve growth and reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, and death. They also sought to understand the potential benefits and harms of re-feeding gastric residuals in preterm infants.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared re-feeding gastric residuals to discarding them in preterm infants. We looked at all types of studies, including those that randomly assigned babies to different groups. We checked the reference lists of other relevant reviews and included studies that enrolled preterm infants receiving enteral nutrition and reported at least one clinical outcome related to efficacy or safety.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that included 72 preterm infants. The study compared re-feeding versus discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. Re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants may make little to no difference to several important clinical outcomes, including the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds, and in-hospital weight gain. However, we are uncertain about the effects of this intervention due to the limited data available.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe study had a very small sample size, and participants may have been aware of which treatment they received, introducing potential bias.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. All critical checks passed. I am grading it as 'NOT_APPROVED' to provide a few specific suggestions that will make it even more concise and accessible for readers. My top 3 recommendations focus on simplifying technical descriptions and trimming wordy phrases.\n\n1. **Simplify the methods description.** The current explanation is a bit technical and mixes different steps.\n   - **Original Text:** \"We looked at all types of studies, including those that randomly assigned babies to different groups. We checked the reference lists of other relevant reviews and included studies that enrolled preterm infants receiving enteral nutrition and reported at least one clinical outcome related to efficacy or safety.\"\n   - **Problem:** Phrases like \"enrolled preterm infants receiving enteral nutrition\" and \"clinical outcome related to efficacy or safety\" are jargon that can be simplified.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We searched for studies that compared re-feeding leftover food with throwing it away in premature babies. We focused on studies where babies were randomly put into one of the two groups to ensure a fair comparison.\"\n\n2. **Make the aims section more concise and direct.** The section explaining the review's goal repeats itself.\n   - **Original Text:** \"The review authors aimed to determine whether re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants is more effective and safer than discarding them... They also sought to understand the potential benefits and harms of re-feeding gastric residuals in preterm infants.\"\n   - **Problem:** The first and last sentences say the same thing. Using the active \"we\" voice consistently, as recommended in the style guide, would also improve this section.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if re-feeding leftover food to premature babies is better and safer than throwing it away. Specifically, we looked at whether re-feeding improved growth and lowered the risk of serious problems like bowel infections (necrotising enterocolitis), blood infections (sepsis), and death.\"\n\n3. **Replace long words and phrases with simpler alternatives.** While the readability scores are good, some phrases are unnecessarily long.\n   - **Original Text:** \"...the time it took for them to be fully fed through a tube in their stomach...\" and \"...participants may have been aware of which treatment they received...\"\n   - **Problem:** These phrases can be shortened to improve flow and make the text easier to scan. This is supported by the 'long_words' metric, which is higher than is typical for a PLS.\n   - **Suggested Rewrites:** \"...the time to get to full tube feeds...\" and \"...the babies' families and carers may have known which treatment they received...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show good overall conformity with typical patterns. 10 of 18 metrics (55.6%) are in the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, the 'long_words' metric is in the 90th percentile, indicating a higher-than-usual number of words with 7 or more characters. This suggests that while sentence structure is good, vocabulary could be simplified in places to further improve clarity."
