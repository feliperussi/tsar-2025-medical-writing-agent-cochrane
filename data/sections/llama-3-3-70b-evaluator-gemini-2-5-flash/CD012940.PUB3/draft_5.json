  "draft": "Is re-feeding gastric residuals (the food that comes back up into the tube) better than discarding them for improving growth in premature babies?\n\n- Re-feeding gastric residuals in premature babies may have little or no effect on important clinical outcomes such as time to regain birth weight, risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies), and all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, with no reported harmful effects.\n- Because there is not enough good evidence, we are uncertain about the benefits and risks of re-feeding gastric residuals in premature babies. More research is needed to guide hospital practices.\n- Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies to assess the efficacy and safety of re-feeding gastric residuals in premature babies, which would provide more certain evidence to guide healthcare decisions and improve outcomes for these vulnerable babies.\n\nWhat is the problem of gastric residuals in premature babies?\nPremature babies often have trouble digesting food, and as a result, they may have leftover food in their stomachs, known as gastric residuals. This can be a problem because it may cause vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (a serious infection of the intestine), or sepsis (a life-threatening infection). To manage this issue, healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in premature babies who are being fed through a tube. However, there is no clear consensus on whether to re-feed these gastric residuals to the baby or discard them.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine whether re-feeding gastric residuals to premature babies is more effective and safer than discarding them. They wanted to find out if re-feeding gastric residuals can improve growth and reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, and death. They also wanted to know if re-feeding gastric residuals helps premature babies:\n- regain their birth weight faster\n- establish full tube feeding sooner\n- reduce the need for intravenous feeding (also called total parenteral nutrition)\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing re-feeding and discarding gastric residuals in premature babies, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 72 premature babies. Re-feeding gastric residuals to premature babies may make little to no difference to:\n- the risk of a serious bowel condition (necrotising enterocolitis)\n- the risk of death before leaving the hospital\n- the time needed for full tube feeding\n- weight gain in the hospital\nHowever, it is unclear if re-feeding gastric residuals has an effect on the number of episodes of feed interruption lasting for 12 hours or more.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the study was very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it is not approved because several key sentences, particularly in the 'Key messages' section, are too long and complex for a lay audience. Addressing the 3 improvements below will make the summary much easier for patients and their families to understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Simplify and shorten the first key message.**\n\nThe first key message is a single 49-word sentence that contains technical terms. This makes it difficult to understand the main findings at a glance.\n\n- **Original sentence:** \"Re-feeding gastric residuals in premature babies may have little or no effect on important clinical outcomes such as time to regain birth weight, risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies), and all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, with no reported harmful effects.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** It's too long and front-loads jargon like \"important clinical outcomes\" and \"all-cause mortality\". Key messages should be the easiest part of the summary to read.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Giving leftover food (gastric residuals) back to premature babies may have little or no effect on their health. We found it may not affect their weight gain, their risk of a serious bowel condition (necrotising enterocolitis), or their risk of dying before leaving the hospital.\"\n\n**2. Make the call for more research clearer and more direct.**\n\nThe final key message is also a very long sentence (44 words) that uses formal, academic language.\n\n- **Original sentence:** \"Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies to assess the efficacy and safety of re-feeding gastric residuals in premature babies, which would provide more certain evidence to guide healthcare decisions and improve outcomes for these vulnerable babies.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"assess the efficacy and safety\" and \"provide more certain evidence\" are not plain language. The sentence structure is complex.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We need larger and better-designed studies to be sure about the benefits and harms of re-feeding gastric residuals. This research would give clearer guidance to doctors and could improve care for these vulnerable babies.\"\n\n**3. Use consistent, simple terminology for 'gastric residuals'.**\n\nThe summary provides two slightly different definitions for gastric residuals, which could be confusing.\n\n- **In the title:** \"(the food that comes back up into the tube)\"\n- **In the introduction:** \"leftover food in their stomachs\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Inconsistent definitions can confuse the reader. The second definition, \"leftover food in their stomachs,\" is simpler and more accurate for a lay audience.\n- **Suggested change:** Use the \"leftover food in their stomachs\" definition consistently. For example, change the title to: \"Is re-feeding gastric residuals (leftover food in the stomach) better than discarding them...?\"\n\n### Supporting Evidence\n\nYour own analysis supports these recommendations. The average sentence length is 25.6 words, which is higher than typical for a Plain Language Summary and can make the text hard to follow. By breaking up the long sentences identified above, you will significantly improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 14 of 18 metrics (77.8%) in the best quartile for readability and style. However, one key metric, 'words_per_sentence', deviates significantly from the norm. At 25.57 words, it falls into the P90 range, indicating that sentences are longer and potentially more complex than is typical for this text type. This statistical finding supports the editorial recommendation to shorten the longest sentences to improve overall clarity."
