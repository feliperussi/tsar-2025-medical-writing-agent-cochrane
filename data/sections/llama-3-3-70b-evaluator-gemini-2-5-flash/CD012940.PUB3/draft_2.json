  "draft": "Is re-feeding gastric residuals better than discarding them for improving growth in premature babies?\n**Key Messages**\n- Re-feeding gastric residuals (the food that comes back up into the tube) in preterm infants may have little or no effect on important clinical outcomes such as time to regain birth weight, risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies), and all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, with no reported harmful effects.\n- Because of limited evidence, the benefits and risks of re-feeding gastric residuals in preterm infants are unclear, highlighting the need for more research to inform policy and practice.\n- Future research should focus on conducting large, well-designed studies to assess the efficacy and safety of re-feeding gastric residuals in preterm infants, which would provide more certain evidence to guide healthcare decisions and improve outcomes for these vulnerable babies.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of gastric residuals in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants often have trouble digesting food, and as a result, they may have leftover food in their stomachs, known as gastric residuals. This can be a problem because it may cause vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (a serious infection of the intestine), or sepsis (a life-threatening infection). To manage this issue, healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in preterm infants who are being fed through a tube. However, there is no clear consensus on whether to re-feed these gastric residuals to the infant or discard them.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine whether re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants is more effective and safer than discarding them. They wanted to find out if re-feeding gastric residuals can improve growth and reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, and death. They also wanted to know if re-feeding gastric residuals can help preterm infants regain their birth weight faster, establish full tube feeding sooner, and reduce the need for total parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding).\n**How did we do the review?**\nWe searched for studies comparing re-feeding and discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**What did we find?**\nWe found one study that involved 72 preterm infants. We don't know where or for how long the study was conducted, or who funded it. While it involved preterm infants, details about their age, gender, or condition severity are missing. The study took place in a neonatal intensive care unit and compared re-feeding versus discarding gastric residuals. Re-feeding gastric residuals to preterm infants may make little to no difference to several important clinical outcomes, including the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, time to establish enteral feeds, and in-hospital weight gain. However, it is unclear if re-feeding gastric residuals has an effect on the number of episodes of feed interruption lasting for ≥ 12 hours.\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the study was very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n**How up to date is this review?**\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex words and jargon.** The summary uses terms that may be unfamiliar to patients. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of complex and long words.\n    - **Instead of:** '...highlighting the need for more research to inform policy and practice.'\n    - **Consider writing:** '...showing that more research is needed to help guide treatment decisions.'\n    - **Instead of:** '...time to establish enteral feeds...'\n    - **Consider writing:** '...time to establish full tube feeding.'\n\n2. **Streamline the 'What did we find?' section.** This section contains details about the study's limitations that are confusing and better suited for the 'Limitations' section. Focusing only on the findings here would be clearer for the reader.\n    - **Problematic sentences:** 'We don't know where or for how long the study was conducted, or who funded it. While it involved preterm infants, details about their age, gender, or condition severity are missing.'\n    - **Suggestion:** Remove these sentences and focus on the study's results. The key limitations are already well-covered in their own section.\n\n3. **Use consistent terminology.** The summary switches between 'premature babies' (in the title) and 'preterm infants' (in the text). Using one term consistently makes the text easier to follow.\n    - **Suggestion:** Use 'premature babies' throughout the summary, as it is more common in plain language.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 12 of 18 metrics (66.7%) in the best quartile. Readability scores like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (11.1) are excellent. However, the analysis flags two areas for review: the number of Dale-Chall complex words (246) and long words (194) are both in the 90th percentile, suggesting the vocabulary could be simplified to improve clarity for a lay audience."
