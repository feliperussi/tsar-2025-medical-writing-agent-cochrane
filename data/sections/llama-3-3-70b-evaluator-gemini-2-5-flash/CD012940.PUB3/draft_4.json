  "draft": "Is re-feeding gastric residuals (the food that comes back up into the tube) better than discarding them for improving growth in premature babies?\n\n- Re-feeding gastric residuals in premature babies may have little or no effect on important clinical outcomes such as time to regain birth weight, risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies), and all-cause mortality before hospital discharge, with no reported harmful effects.\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of re-feeding gastric residuals in premature babies are unclear, highlighting the need for more research in this area to inform policy and practice.\n- Future research should focus on large, well-designed studies to assess the safety and benefits of re-feeding gastric residuals in premature babies. This would provide more certain evidence to guide healthcare decisions and improve outcomes for this vulnerable group.\n\nWhat is the problem of gastric residuals in premature babies?\nPremature babies often have trouble digesting food, and as a result, they may have leftover food in their stomachs, known as gastric residuals. This can be a problem because it may cause vomiting, necrotising enterocolitis (a serious infection of the intestine), or sepsis (a life-threatening infection). To manage this issue, healthcare providers regularly check the amount of gastric residuals in premature babies who are being fed through a tube. However, there is no clear consensus on whether to re-feed these gastric residuals to the baby or discard them.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine whether re-feeding gastric residuals to premature babies is more effective and safer than discarding them. They wanted to find out if re-feeding gastric residuals can improve growth and reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, and death. They also wanted to know if re-feeding gastric residuals helps premature babies:\n- regain their birth weight faster\n- establish full tube feeding sooner\n- reduce the need for intravenous feeding\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing re-feeding and discarding gastric residuals in premature babies, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found one study that involved 72 premature babies. Re-feeding gastric residuals to premature babies may make little to no difference to several important outcomes. These include the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, death before hospital discharge, the time needed to establish full tube feeding, and weight gain in the hospital. However, it is unclear if re-feeding gastric residuals has an effect on the number of episodes of feed interruption lasting for 12 hours or more.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the study was very small, and because it is possible that people in the studies were aware of which treatment they were getting.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to February 2022.",

The main opportunities are to shorten a few key sentences and make the language more direct.\n\n1. **Simplify and shorten the key messages.** The second and third bullet points are a bit wordy and abstract.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of re-feeding gastric residuals in premature babies are unclear, highlighting the need for more research in this area to inform policy and practice.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is repetitive ('lack of robust evidence' and 'unclear' say the same thing) and uses abstract phrasing ('inform policy and practice').\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Because there is not enough good evidence, we are uncertain about the benefits and risks of re-feeding gastric residuals in premature babies. More research is needed to guide hospital practices.\"\n\n2. **Improve readability of the main findings with a list.** The sentence listing the main outcomes is long and contains a lot of information for a reader to absorb at once.\n   - **Original Text:** \"These include the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, death before hospital discharge, the time needed to establish full tube feeding, and weight gain in the hospital.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** A long list within a sentence can be hard to follow. Using a bulleted list makes the distinct outcomes easier to identify and understand.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We found that re-feeding gastric residuals may make little to no difference to:\n- the risk of a serious bowel condition (necrotising enterocolitis);\n- the risk of death before leaving the hospital;\n- the time needed for full tube feeding;\n- weight gain in the hospital.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the term for intravenous feeding.** The draft simplifies a term but loses a helpful connection for readers who may have heard the technical name from their doctor.\n   - **Original Text:** \"- reduce the need for intravenous feeding\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The source text included the technical term 'total parenteral nutrition' (TPN). Adding this back in parentheses helps readers connect the plain language term to the medical term they may have encountered.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"- reduce the need for intravenous feeding (also called total parenteral nutrition)\"",
