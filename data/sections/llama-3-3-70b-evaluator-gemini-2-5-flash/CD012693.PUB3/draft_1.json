Women undergoing IVF often receive daily doses of a medicine called gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve 5 to 15 eggs, as this is considered a normal response to stimulation. However, getting the dose of FSH just right is crucial because too high or too low a dose can lead to problems. Too high a dose can cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially serious condition, while too low a dose may result in too few eggs being produced, reducing the chances of pregnancy.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if tailoring the dose of FSH to individual women, based on markers of their ovarian reserve, improves the chances of pregnancy and reduces the risk of OHSS. They looked at studies that compare different doses of FSH in women with different predicted responses to stimulation, as well as studies that compare individualised dosing strategies with standard dosing approaches.\n\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing individualised gonadotropin doses using markers of ovarian reserve in women undergoing IVF/ICSI, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that involved 8520 women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The studies compared different doses of FSH in women with a defined ovarian reserve test (ORT) profile or an individualised dosing strategy versus uniform dosing or a different individualised dosing algorithm. The population characteristics included women with predicted low, normal, or high responders based on anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), and/or basal FSH (bFSH). The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not detailed. The interventions included different FSH doses and individualised dosing strategies based on ORT measures. We did not find information on the duration of the studies or the funding sources. It is unclear if individualising the dose of gonadotropin for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection affects the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. However, using an ovarian reserve test-based algorithm may reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. For every 100 women using this algorithm, the chance of live birth may be between 25% and 31%, and the chance of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome may be between 2% and 5%.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment (risk of bias due to lack of blinding), and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\n**Currency**\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

Key deviations include an average of 28.33 words per sentence (BEYOND_P90), high scores across all readability indices (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade 15.36, SMOG Index 15.45, Gunning Fog Index 19.54, all P90 or BEYOND_P90), and elevated counts of complex words (157, BEYOND_P90), long words (252, BEYOND_P90), nouns (215, BEYOND_P90), and nominalizations (33, BEYOND_P90). The passive voice count (22, P90) also suggests a need for more active constructions. These metrics collectively indicate that the text is too difficult, dense, and complex for a plain language summary, requiring substantial revision to improve clarity and accessibility for a lay audience."
