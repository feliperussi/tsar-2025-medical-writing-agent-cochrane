  "draft": "Does tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone (a hormone that helps eggs grow in the ovaries) based on a woman's ovarian reserve (the ability of her ovaries to produce eggs) improve the chances of having a baby with in vitro fertilization (IVF, a type of fertility treatment)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We are not sure if tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone based on a woman's ovarian reserve improves the chances of having a baby with IVF.\n- The current evidence does not provide a clear justification for adjusting the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone in women undergoing IVF.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations of the current evidence to provide clearer answers to the questions of benefits and harms of this approach for women undergoing IVF.\n\nWhat is in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and why is it important to get the dose of a fertility medicine just right?\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a type of fertility treatment where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body. Women undergoing IVF often receive daily doses of a medicine called gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve 5 to 15 eggs, as this is considered a normal response to stimulation. However, getting the dose of FSH just right is crucial because too high or too low a dose can lead to problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if tailoring the dose of FSH to individual women, based on markers of their ovarian reserve, improves the chances of pregnancy and reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). They looked at studies that compare different doses of FSH in women with different predicted responses to stimulation, as well as studies that compare individualised dosing strategies with standard dosing approaches.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that involved 8520 women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The studies compared different doses of FSH in women with a defined ovarian reserve test (ORT) profile or an individualised dosing strategy versus uniform dosing or a different individualised dosing algorithm. It is unclear if individualising the dose of gonadotropin for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection affects the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. However, using an ovarian reserve test-based algorithm may reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This Plain Language Summary is well-structured and factually accurate, but it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are a key message that is too vague, a few overly complex sentences packed with technical terms, and the use of abstract nouns instead of direct verbs. Addressing these points will make the summary much easier for patients to understand and use.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Make the first key message more specific.**\nThe first key message is correct but misses an important finding about potential benefits.\n- **Original sentence:** \"We are not sure if tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone based on a woman's ovarian reserve improves the chances of having a baby with IVF.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is too vague. The abstract shows that while the effect on live birth is uncertain, there is a potential benefit for reducing a key side effect (OHSS). Readers need this balanced information.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are not sure if tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone improves the chances of having a baby, but it may slightly reduce the risk of a complication called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\"\n\n**2. Simplify the complex sentence in the 'What did we find?' section.**\nOne sentence in the results is very long and contains multiple technical ideas that are hard to follow.\n- **Original sentence:** \"The studies compared different doses of FSH in women with a defined ovarian reserve test (ORT) profile or an individualised dosing strategy versus uniform dosing or a different individualised dosing algorithm.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** At 31 words, this sentence is long and uses several jargon terms (ORT profile, individualised dosing, uniform dosing, algorithm) in a complex structure. It's difficult for a non-specialist to understand what was being compared.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies used two main approaches. Some compared different FSH doses in women who were predicted to respond differently to the medicine. Others compared a tailored dose for each woman against giving every woman the same standard dose.\"\n\n**3. Use more direct verbs instead of abstract nouns (nominalizations).**\nThe summary uses several 'noun-heavy' phrases that make the text feel passive and academic. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of nominalizations.\n- **Original sentence:** \"Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations of the current evidence to provide clearer answers to the questions of benefits and harms of this approach for women undergoing IVF.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like \"addressing the key limitations\" and \"questions of benefits and harms\" are indirect. Using active verbs makes the meaning clearer and more direct.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We need better research to understand if this approach actually helps or harms women undergoing IVF.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is highly conforming with typical PLS patterns, with 67% of metrics falling in the best quartile. The word count is well within the limit. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the 'nominalization' score is in the 90th percentile (22 instances), indicating an overuse of abstract nouns instead of active verbs. This aligns with the editorial feedback to make the language more direct. Additionally, the average sentence length ('words_per_sentence') is in the 75th percentile, supporting the need to break down longer, more complex sentences to improve readability."
