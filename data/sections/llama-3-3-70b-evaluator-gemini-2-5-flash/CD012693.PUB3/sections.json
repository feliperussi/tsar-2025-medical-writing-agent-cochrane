  "key_messages": [
    "Tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone (a hormone that helps eggs grow in the ovaries) based on a woman's ovarian reserve (the ability of her ovaries to produce eggs) may or may not improve the chances of having a baby with in vitro fertilization (IVF, a type of fertility treatment), and it is also unclear if it reduces the risk of unwanted effects such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by over-stimulation of the ovaries).",
    "The current evidence does not provide a clear justification for adjusting the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone in women undergoing IVF, especially as increased dose is associated with greater total cost, and it is unclear whether a decreased dose in predicted high responders reduces OHSS.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the key limitations of the current evidence, including the lack of robust studies and the heterogeneity in the algorithms used to individualize follicle-stimulating hormone dosing, to provide clearer answers to the questions of benefits and harms of this approach for women undergoing IVF."

      "content": "In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a type of fertility treatment where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body. Women undergoing IVF often receive daily doses of a medicine called gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve 5 to 15 eggs, as this is considered a normal response to stimulation. However, getting the dose of FSH just right is crucial because too high or too low a dose can lead to problems. Too high a dose can cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially serious condition, while too low a dose may result in too few eggs being produced, reducing the chances of pregnancy."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out if tailoring the dose of FSH to individual women, based on markers of their ovarian reserve, improves the chances of pregnancy and reduces the risk of OHSS. They looked at studies that compare different doses of FSH in women with different predicted responses to stimulation, as well as studies that compare individualised dosing strategies with standard dosing approaches."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 26 studies that involved 8520 women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The studies compared different doses of FSH in women with a defined ovarian reserve test (ORT) profile or an individualised dosing strategy versus uniform dosing or a different individualised dosing algorithm. The population characteristics included women with predicted low, normal, or high responders based on anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), and/or basal FSH (bFSH). The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not detailed. The interventions included different FSH doses and individualised dosing strategies based on ORT measures. We did not find information on the duration of the studies or the funding sources. It is unclear if individualising the dose of gonadotropin for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection affects the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. However, using an ovarian reserve test-based algorithm may reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. For every 100 women using this algorithm, the chance of live birth may be between 25% and 31%, and the chance of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome may be between 2% and 5%."
