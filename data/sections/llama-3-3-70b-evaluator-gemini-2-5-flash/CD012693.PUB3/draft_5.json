  "draft": "Does tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone (a hormone that helps eggs grow in the ovaries) based on a woman's ovarian reserve (the ability of her ovaries to produce eggs) improve the chances of having a baby with in vitro fertilization (IVF, a type of fertility treatment)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We are not sure if tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone improves the chances of having a baby. It may slightly reduce the risk of moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a complication from over-stimulated ovaries), but we are uncertain about its effect on severe OHSS.\n- The current evidence does not clearly justify adjusting the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone in women undergoing IVF, especially as increased dose is associated with greater total cost.\n- We need better research to understand if this approach actually helps or harms women undergoing IVF.\n\nWhat is in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and why is it important to get the dose of a fertility medicine just right?\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a type of fertility treatment where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body. Women undergoing IVF often receive daily doses of a medicine called gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve 5 to 15 eggs, as this shows the ovaries have responded normally to the medicine. However, getting the dose of FSH just right is crucial because too high or too low a dose can lead to problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if tailoring the dose of FSH to individual women, based on markers of their ovarian reserve, improves the chances of pregnancy and reduces the risk of OHSS. They looked at studies that compare different doses of FSH in women with different predicted responses to stimulation, as well as studies that compare individualised dosing strategies with standard dosing approaches.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different tailored doses of gonadotropin medicine for women undergoing IVF. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that involved 8520 women undergoing IVF. The studies used two main approaches. Some compared different FSH doses in women who researchers predicted would respond differently to the medicine. Others compared a tailored dose for each woman against giving every woman the same standard dose. It is unclear if individualising the dose of gonadotropin for women undergoing IVF affects the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. To put this in perspective, our findings suggest that if the chance of having a baby with a standard dose is 25%, the chance with a tailored dose would be between 25% and 31%. However, using an ovarian reserve test-based algorithm may reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and meets the word count. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before it can be approved. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify technical terms and introduce concepts clearly.**\n   - **Issue:** The draft introduces the term \"ovarian reserve test-based algorithm\" in the results section without explaining what an 'algorithm' is in this context. Additionally, the full name \"gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone\" is used multiple times after the abbreviation \"FSH\" has been established.\n   - **Example:** \"However, using an ovarian reserve test-based algorithm may reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Introduce the concept of an algorithm earlier and use the abbreviation 'FSH' consistently after its first use. For example, in the \"What did the review authors want to find out?\" section, you could add that dosing strategies can be based on a set of rules (an algorithm). Then, in the second key message, simplify to: \"The current evidence does not clearly justify adjusting the dose of FSH...\"\n\n2. **Make the key messages more direct.**\n   - **Issue:** The first key message uses repetitive phrasing to express uncertainty, which can weaken the statement and make it harder to read.\n   - **Example:** \"We are not sure if tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone improves the chances of having a baby... but we are uncertain about its effect on severe OHSS.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Rephrase to be more direct and confident in stating the uncertainty. For example: \"Tailoring the dose of FSH may not improve the chance of having a baby. This approach may slightly reduce the risk of moderate OHSS (a complication from the treatment), but it is uncertain if it affects the risk of severe OHSS.\"\n\n3. **Clarify the context of the main finding.**\n   - **Issue:** The results section presents the key statistic about the chance of having a baby without specifying that this finding comes from a specific subset of the studies (those using an ORT-based algorithm), not all types of tailored dosing.\n   - **Example:** \"To put this in perspective, our findings suggest that if the chance of having a baby with a standard dose is 25%, the chance with a tailored dose would be between 25% and 31%.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Add context to this sentence to be more precise. For example: \"For the studies that used a dosing plan based on ovarian reserve tests, our findings suggest that if the chance of having a baby with a standard dose is 25%, the chance with a tailored dose would be between 25% and 31%.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found the draft has a higher-than-usual number of long and complex words (`long_words` and `complex_words_dc` in the 90th percentile). Focusing on simplifying these technical concepts will directly address the metric deviations and significantly improve readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity, with metrics for Dale-Chall complex words (complex_words_dc) and long words (long_words) falling in the P90 range, indicating a higher-than-usual number of complex and long words that could be simplified."
