  "draft": "Does tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone (a hormone that helps eggs grow in the ovaries) based on a woman's ovarian reserve (the ability of her ovaries to produce eggs) improve the chances of having a baby with in vitro fertilization (IVF, a type of fertility treatment)?\n\nKey messages:\n- We are not sure if tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone improves the chances of having a baby, but it may slightly reduce the risk of a complication called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by over-stimulation of the ovaries).\n- The current evidence does not provide a clear justification for adjusting the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone in women undergoing IVF, especially as increased dose is associated with greater total cost.\n- We need better research to understand if this approach actually helps or harms women undergoing IVF.\n\nWhat is in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and why is it important to get the dose of a fertility medicine just right?\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a type of fertility treatment where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body. Women undergoing IVF often receive daily doses of a medicine called gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve 5 to 15 eggs, as this is considered a normal response to stimulation. However, getting the dose of FSH just right is crucial because too high or too low a dose can lead to problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if tailoring the dose of FSH to individual women, based on markers of their ovarian reserve, improves the chances of pregnancy and reduces the risk of OHSS. They looked at studies that compare different doses of FSH in women with different predicted responses to stimulation, as well as studies that compare individualised dosing strategies with standard dosing approaches.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that involved 8520 women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI). The studies used two main approaches. Some compared different FSH doses in women who were predicted to respond differently to the medicine. Others compared a tailored dose for each woman against giving every woman the same standard dose. It is unclear if individualising the dose of gonadotropin for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation plus intracytoplasmic sperm injection affects the chance of live birth or ongoing pregnancy. However, using an ovarian reserve test-based algorithm may reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear and well-structured. All critical checks for completeness, formatting, and word count have passed. However, a few key improvements are needed to enhance clarity and accuracy for a patient audience before it can be approved.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Clarify the finding on Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS).** The current key message is a bit too definite and could be misinterpreted. The evidence is more uncertain, especially regarding severe OHSS.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"...it may slightly reduce the risk of a complication called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS...)\"\n   - **Reason:** This simplifies the finding too much. The original abstract notes uncertainty about the effect on *severe* OHSS, which is a critical detail for patients.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"- We are not sure if tailoring the dose improves the chances of having a baby. It may slightly reduce the risk of moderate OHSS (a complication from over-stimulated ovaries), but we are uncertain about its effect on severe OHSS.\"\n\n2. **Make sentences more direct by using verbs instead of complex nouns.** The text sometimes uses noun forms of verbs, which can make sentences feel abstract and wordy. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which flagged a high number of 'nominalizations'.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The current evidence does not provide a clear ...\"\n   - **Reason:** The phrase \"provide a clear justification for\" is indirect. Using a direct verb makes the meaning clearer and the sentence shorter.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The current evidence does not clearly justify adjusting the dose...\"\n\n3. **Use active voice to make it clearer who is doing what.** Some sentences use passive voice, which can make the text less engaging and harder to follow.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"...in women who were predicted to respond differently to the medicine.\"\n   - **Reason:** It's unclear who is doing the predicting. Active voice clarifies this.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...in women who researchers predicted would respond differently to the medicine.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good overall conformity with typical patterns. Most readability and sentence structure metrics, including words per sentence (20.79) and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (12.5), fall within the median (P50) range. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is in the 90th percentile, suggesting the text could be more direct and use more action-oriented language. Additionally, the use of passive voice is in the upper quartile (P75), indicating another area for improvement to enhance clarity."
