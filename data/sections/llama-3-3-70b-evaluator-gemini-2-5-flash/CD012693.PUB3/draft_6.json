  "draft": "Does tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH, a hormone that helps eggs grow in the ovaries) based on a woman's ovarian reserve (the ability of her ovaries to produce eggs) improve the chances of having a baby with in vitro fertilization (IVF, a type of fertility treatment)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Tailoring the dose of FSH may not improve the chance of having a baby. This approach may slightly reduce the risk of moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a complication from over-stimulated ovaries), but it is uncertain if it affects the risk of severe OHSS.\n- The current evidence does not clearly justify adjusting the dose of FSH in women undergoing IVF, especially as increased dose is associated with greater total cost.\n- We need better research to understand if this approach actually helps or harms women undergoing IVF.\n\nWhat is in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and why is it important to get the dose of a fertility medicine just right?\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a type of fertility treatment where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body. Women undergoing IVF often receive daily doses of a medicine called FSH to stimulate their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve 5 to 15 eggs, as this shows the ovaries have responded normally to the medicine. Getting the dose of FSH just right is crucial because too high or too low a dose can lead to problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if tailoring the dose of FSH to individual women, based on markers of their ovarian reserve, improves the chances of pregnancy and reduces the risk of OHSS. They looked at studies that compare different doses of FSH in women with different predicted responses to stimulation, as well as studies that compare individualised dosing strategies with standard dosing approaches. A dosing strategy can be based on a set of rules (an algorithm) that considers the woman's ovarian reserve.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared different tailored doses of FSH for women undergoing IVF. We then summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that involved 8520 women undergoing IVF. For the studies that used a dosing plan based on ovarian reserve tests, our findings suggest that if the chance of having a baby with a standard dose is 25%, the chance with a tailored dose would be between 25% and 31%. However, using an ovarian reserve test-based algorithm may reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. For every 100 women using this algorithm, the chance of live birth may be between 25% and 31%, and the chance of moderate or severe OHSS may be between 2% and 5%.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

The summary also needs to better reflect the uncertainty of the evidence in its key messages.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Correct the misleading presentation of statistics.** The results section incorrectly presents conditional probabilities as absolute facts. This could easily mislead a reader about the potential benefits.\n    *   **Problem:** \"For every 100 women using this algorithm, the chance of live birth may be between 25% and 31%, and the chance of moderate or severe OHSS may be between 2% and 5%.\n    *   **Reason:** This is not what the evidence says. The findings are conditional. The draft also omits the baseline risk for OHSS, which is crucial context.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"Our findings suggest that if the chance of having a baby with a standard dose is 25%, the chance with a tailored dose would be between 25% and 31%. Similarly, if the chance of moderate or severe OHSS with a standard dose is 5%, the chance with a tailored dose would be between 2% and 5%.\n\n2.  **Refine the key message to better convey uncertainty.** The current wording suggests a negative finding, while the source material emphasizes that the evidence is simply unclear.\n    *   **Problem:** \"Tailoring the dose of FSH may not improve the chance of having a baby.\"\n    *   **Reason:** This phrasing implies the approach is ineffective. The original abstract is careful to state \"we could not rule out differences,\" meaning the effect is uncertain.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"It is uncertain whether tailoring the dose of FSH improves the chance of having a baby.\" or \"Tailoring the dose of FSH may or may not improve the chance of having a baby.\"\n\n3.  **Clarify the methods description.** The current description is too generic and omits the central concept of the review.\n    *   **Problem:** \"We searched for studies that compared different tailored doses of FSH for women undergoing IVF.\"\n    *   **Reason:** This doesn't explain *how* or *why* the doses were tailored. The key concept of using ovarian reserve tests is missing.\n    *   **Suggestion:** \"We searched for studies that tailored the dose of FSH based on women's ovarian reserve tests. We compared this approach to standard dosing, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 94% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid grade level (10.43) and words per sentence (20.44) are excellent. This indicates the text is structurally simple and uses accessible vocabulary. However, these strong metrics do not capture the critical factual inaccuracies in the presentation of the review's findings, which is the primary reason for the 'NOT_APPROVED' grade."
