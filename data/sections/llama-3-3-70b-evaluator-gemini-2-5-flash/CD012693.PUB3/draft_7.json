  "draft": "Does tailoring the dose of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH, a hormone that helps eggs grow in the ovaries) based on a woman's ovarian reserve (the ability of her ovaries to produce eggs) improve the chances of having a baby with in vitro fertilization (IVF, a type of fertility treatment)?\n\nKey messages:\n- It is uncertain whether tailoring the dose of FSH improves the chance of having a baby. This approach may slightly reduce the risk of moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a complication from over-stimulated ovaries), but it is uncertain if it affects the risk of severe OHSS.\n- The current evidence does not clearly justify adjusting the dose of FSH in women undergoing IVF, especially as increased dose is associated with greater total cost.\n- We need better research to understand if this approach actually helps or harms women undergoing IVF.\n\nWhat is in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and why is it important to get the dose of a fertility medicine just right?\nIn vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a type of fertility treatment where an egg is fertilised with sperm outside the body. Women undergoing IVF often receive daily doses of a medicine called FSH to stimulate their ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The goal is to retrieve 5 to 15 eggs, as this shows the ovaries have responded normally to the medicine. Getting the dose of FSH just right is crucial because too high or too low a dose can lead to problems.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out if tailoring the dose of FSH to individual women, based on markers of their ovarian reserve, improves the chances of pregnancy and reduces the risk of OHSS. They looked at studies that compare different doses of FSH in women with different predicted responses to stimulation, as well as studies that compare individualised dosing strategies with standard dosing approaches. A dosing strategy can be based on a set of rules (an algorithm) that considers the woman's ovarian reserve.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that tailored the dose of FSH based on women's ovarian reserve tests. We compared this approach to standard dosing, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 26 studies that involved 8520 women undergoing IVF. For the studies that used a dosing plan based on ovarian reserve tests, our findings suggest that if the chance of having a baby with a standard dose is 25%, the chance with a tailored dose would be between 25% and 31%. Similarly, if the chance of moderate or severe OHSS with a standard dose is 5%, the chance with a tailored dose would be between 2% and 5%.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to February 2023.",

Additionally, a few key areas need refinement to improve clarity for the reader. Please address the following points to ensure the summary is both accurate and easy to understand.\n\n**1. CRITICAL: Correct the Factual Inaccuracy in Key Messages**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"This approach may slightly reduce the risk of moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS, a complication from over-stimulated ovaries), but it is uncertain if it affects the risk of severe OHSS.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This is a misinterpretation of the evidence. The original abstract states that tailored dosing \"may reduce moderate OR severe OHSS\" as a combined outcome. Your version incorrectly claims a specific benefit for \"moderate\" OHSS, which is not supported and could mislead readers.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This approach may slightly reduce the risk of moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), but the evidence for reducing severe OHSS alone is uncertain.\"\n\n**2. Improve the Definition of OHSS for Clarity**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"...(OHSS, a complication from over-stimulated ovaries)...\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The term \"complication\" is vague and downplays the seriousness of the condition. The source material provides a stronger, more patient-centric definition (\"a potentially life‑threatening condition\"). Using clearer, more impactful language helps readers understand why this outcome matters.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...(OHSS, a potentially serious condition caused by over‑stimulated ovaries)...\"\n\n**3. Make the Methods Section More Direct**\n\n*   **Problematic Text:** \"We searched for studies that tailored the dose of FSH based on women's ovarian reserve tests. We compared this approach to standard dosing, summarized the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** While grammatically correct, this sentence is a bit long and less direct than it could be. Using more active, concise phrasing aligns better with plain language principles.\n*   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We searched for studies that compared tailored FSH doses against standard doses. We then summarized the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft HIGHLY CONFORMS to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the acceptable median or best quartile ranges, indicating strong statistical quality. Readability scores like the Flesch‑Kincaid Grade (10.4) are excellent. Despite these strong metrics, the summary is not approved due to a critical factual error in the key messages that overrides the positive statistical profile."
