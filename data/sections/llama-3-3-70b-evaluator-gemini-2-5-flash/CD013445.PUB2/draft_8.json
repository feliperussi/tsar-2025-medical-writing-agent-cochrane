  "draft": "Which surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: PCNL or RIRS?\n\nThis review compares two surgeries for kidney stones. One surgery involves making a small cut in the back to remove the stones, called percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). The other surgery involves passing a small scope through the body's natural openings to reach and remove the stones, called retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).\n\nWhat are kidney stones and why are they a problem?\nKidney stones (also called renal stones) can cause pain, blockages, and infections. They can vary in size, location, composition, and other patient factors, making treatment challenging. Common treatments for kidney stones include observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. We compared the two treatments in terms of stone-free rate, major complications, need for secondary interventions, and other outcomes to inform shared decision-making for individuals with renal stones.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for treating renal stones, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 studies that involved 4571 people with renal stones. The studies compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. The average size of stones ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. Most studies did not report sources of funding or conflicts of interest.\n\nWhat were the main results of the treatments?\nCompared to RIRS, PCNL appears to be better at clearing stones completely and reducing the need for another procedure to remove leftover stone fragments. However, people who have PCNL may spend about one extra day in the hospital. The risk of serious side effects was similar for both procedures. The risk of developing a ureteral stricture (a narrowing of the tube that carries urine from the kidney) appears to be similar for both procedures.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many of the studies were small. In most studies, both the patients and their doctors knew which treatment they were getting. This is a limitation because knowing the treatment could have influenced how they reported outcomes like pain or satisfaction, which can affect the reliability of the results. Finally, most studies did not report where their funding came from.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n- PCNL may be better than RIRS at clearing stones and may reduce the need for another procedure to remove leftover stone fragments.\n- PCNL probably does not increase the risk of serious side effects but may lead to a longer hospital stay.\n- The evidence is not very certain, so more research is needed to confirm these findings.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it is not approved because it needs a few improvements to make it easier for a lay audience to understand. The main issue is the use of complex vocabulary and technical terms that could be simplified. By making the suggested changes, you can ensure the summary is as clear and helpful as possible for patients and their families.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex words and phrases.** The summary uses some words that are common in research but may be unfamiliar to patients. Replacing them with everyday language will make the text more accessible.\n    - **Problematic text:** \"...to inform shared decision-making for individuals with renal stones.\"\n    - **Reason:** The phrase \"shared decision-making for individuals\" is jargon. It's better to describe the concept in plain terms.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...to help people with kidney stones and their doctors decide on the best treatment together.\"\n\n2. **Make technical terms easier to follow.** You provide a good definition for \"ureteral stricture,\" but leading with the technical term can still be intimidating. Rephrasing the sentence to put the simple explanation first can improve readability.\n    - **Problematic text:** \"The risk of developing a ureteral stricture (a narrowing of the tube that carries urine from the kidney) appears to be similar for both procedures.\"\n    - **Reason:** Readers may stumble over \"ureteral stricture\" before they get to your helpful definition.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"For both surgeries, the risk was similar for developing a narrowing of the tube that carries urine from the kidney (called a ureteral stricture).\"\n\n3. **Reduce reliance on acronyms in key sections.** You define PCNL and RIRS at the beginning, which is great. However, by the time a reader gets to the results and key messages, they may have forgotten what the letters stand for. Adding a brief reminder can help.\n    - **Problematic text:** \"PCNL may be better than RIRS at clearing stones and may reduce the need for another procedure...\"\n    - **Reason:** Forcing the reader to scroll back to the top to remember the difference between PCNL and RIRS interrupts their reading flow.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"PCNL (surgery through a small cut in the back) may be better than RIRS (surgery using a scope through the body's natural openings) at clearing stones...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 88.9% of metrics falling within the best quartile for readability and style. The sentence length is good (15.7 words on average) and the use of active voice is strong. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the number of Dale-Chall complex words is in the 90th percentile (224 instances). This metric supports the editorial feedback to simplify vocabulary and technical phrasing to improve clarity for a lay audience."
