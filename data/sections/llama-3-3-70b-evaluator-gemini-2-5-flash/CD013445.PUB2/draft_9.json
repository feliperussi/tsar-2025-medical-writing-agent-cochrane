  "draft": "Which surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: PCNL (a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones) or RIRS (a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones)?\n\nThis review compares two surgeries for kidney stones. One surgery involves making a small cut in the back to remove the stones, called percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL - a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones). The other surgery involves passing a small scope through the body's natural openings to reach and remove the stones, called retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS - a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones).\n\nWhat are kidney stones and why are they a problem?\nKidney stones (also called renal stones) can cause pain, blockages, and infections. They can vary in size, location, composition, and other patient factors, making treatment challenging. Common treatments for kidney stones include observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. We compared the two treatments in terms of stone-free rate, major complications, need for secondary interventions, and other outcomes to help people with kidney stones and their doctors decide on the best treatment together.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for treating renal stones, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 studies that involved 4571 people with renal stones. The studies compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. The average size of stones ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. Most studies did not report sources of funding or conflicts of interest.\n\nWhat were the main results of the treatments?\nCompared to RIRS, PCNL (surgery through a small cut in the back) may be better at clearing stones completely and reducing the need for another procedure to remove leftover stone fragments. However, people who have PCNL may spend about one extra day in the hospital. The risk of serious side effects was similar for both procedures. For both surgeries, the risk was similar for developing a narrowing of the tube that carries urine from the kidney (called a ureteral stricture).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many of the studies were small. In most studies, both the patients and their doctors knew which treatment they were getting. This is a limitation because knowing the treatment could have influenced how they reported outcomes like pain or satisfaction, which can affect the reliability of the results. Finally, most studies did not report where their funding came from.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n- PCNL (surgery through a small cut in the back) may be better than RIRS (surgery using a scope through the body's natural openings) at clearing stones and may reduce the need for another procedure to remove leftover stone fragments.\n- PCNL probably does not increase the risk of serious side effects but may lead to a longer hospital stay.\n- The evidence is not very certain, so more research is needed to confirm these findings.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. The findings are communicated clearly. I'm recommending a few revisions to make it even easier for readers to understand by reducing repetition and simplifying some key sentences.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Define acronyms once to improve flow.** You define PCNL and RIRS in the title, the first paragraph, and again in the key messages. This repetition makes the summary feel dense. It's more effective to define them clearly one time at the beginning.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"This review compares two surgeries for kidney stones. One surgery involves making a small cut in the back to remove the stones, called percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL - a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones). The other surgery involves passing a small scope through the body's natural openings to reach and remove the stones, called retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS - a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones).\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This review compares two surgeries for kidney stones. One is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), where a surgeon makes a small cut in the back to remove the stones. The other is retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), where a surgeon passes a small scope through the body's natural openings to reach and remove the stones. Throughout this summary, we will refer to these as 'surgery through the back (PCNL)' and 'surgery with a scope (RIRS)'.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex, noun-heavy phrases.** Some sentences use multiple nouns where a simple verb would be clearer and more direct for the reader.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"...reducing the need for another procedure to remove leftover stone fragments.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...and may mean people are less likely to need a second operation.\"\n\n3. **Make the limitations section more direct.** The explanation of study limitations is a bit wordy and abstract.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"This is a limitation because knowing the treatment could have influenced how they reported outcomes like pain or satisfaction, which can affect the reliability of the results.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This is a limitation because knowing which surgery they received might have influenced how people reported their pain or satisfaction, making the results less reliable.\"\n\nMaking these changes will help ensure the summary is as clear and concise as possible for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with the majority of metrics (72.2%) falling within the best quartile for readability and style. However, the analysis also identified three metrics in the P90 range, indicating deviation from typical patterns: noun count (185), Dale-Chall complex words (255), and long words (171) are all higher than is typical for a PLS. This suggests that simplifying vocabulary and converting some noun-heavy phrases to use more verbs would improve overall clarity."
