  "draft": "# Is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones) better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones) for treating kidney stones in adults?\n**Key Messages**\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones) may be better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones) for treating kidney stones in adults, as it may improve stone-free rates and reduce the need for secondary interventions, but it probably has little or no effect on major complications (serious harmful effects), and may increase the length of hospital stay (the time spent in the hospital), with no reported harmful effects on ureteral stricture (narrowing of the ureter) or injury, and no evidence on unplanned medical visits or quality of life (a person's overall well-being).\n- Due to the considerable shortcomings of the included trials, the evidence for most outcomes was not robust, meaning that the findings are not very certain, and more research is needed to confirm these results, especially since most studies did not report important details like sources of funding or conflicts of interest, which can affect the reliability of the results.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as investigating the long-term effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy and retrograde intrarenal surgery, and comparing the outcomes of different access sizes for percutaneous nephrolithotomy, to provide more accurate and reliable information for shared decision-making about the management of kidney stones.\n**Introduction**\n### What are kidney stones and why are they a problem?\nKidney stones, also known as renal stones, are a source of pain, obstruction, and infection. They can vary in size, location, composition, and other patient factors, making treatment challenging. Common treatments for kidney stones include observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. They aimed to compare the two treatments in terms of stone-free rate, major complications, need for secondary interventions, and other outcomes to inform shared decision-making for individuals with renal stones.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for treating renal stones, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 42 studies that involved 4571 people with renal stones. The studies compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. Most studies did not report the duration of the studies. The average size of stones ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. Most studies did not report sources of funding or conflicts of interest. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific countries were not reported. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The interventions compared were PCNL and RIRS, with PCNL being further categorized by access size in French gauge (Fr) into three groups: ≥ 24 Fr (standard PCNL), 15–23 Fr (mini-PCNL and minimally invasive PCNL), and < 15 Fr (ultra-mini-, mini-micro-, super-mini-, and micro-PCNL). No studies reported unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n### Main results: Treatment outcomes for renal stones\nPercutaneous nephrolithotomy may improve the rate of people being stone-free and may reduce the need for additional procedures, but probably has little to no effect on major complications. It may have little to no effect on the occurrence of ureteral strictures and may increase the length of hospital stay. For every 100 people who have percutaneous nephrolithotomy, 10 more may be stone-free compared to those who have retrograde intrarenal surgery.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment (lack of blinding), and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific countries were not reported. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported.\"\n    *   **Explanation:** These statements are not supported by the provided source material and introduce factual inaccuracies.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Remove these sentences entirely from the draft.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Excessive Sentence Length:** The first key message is a single, very long sentence that is difficult to read and understand.\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones)  may be better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones) for treating kidney stones in adults, as it may improve stone-free rates and reduce the need for secondary interventions, but it probably has little or no effect on major complications (serious harmful effects), and may increase the length of hospital stay (the time spent in the hospital), with no reported harmful effects on ureteral stricture (narrowing of the ureter) or injury, and no evidence on unplanned medical visits or quality of life (a person's overall well-being).\"\n    *   **Explanation:** This sentence is 79 words long, making it extremely challenging for a patient audience to follow. The 'words_per_sentence' metric (29.04) is significantly beyond typical PLS patterns, indicating a pervasive issue with long sentences.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Break this into several shorter sentences. For example: \"Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) may be better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for treating kidney stones in adults.

This makes the text less accessible.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** Simplify vocabulary and sentence structure. For example: \"The studies had many weaknesses, so the evidence for most results was not strong. This means the findings are not very certain, and we need more research to confirm them. Many studies also failed to report important details like funding sources or conflicts of interest, which can make the results less trustworthy.\"\n3.  **Overuse of Passive Voice and Nominalization:** While not as prominent as sentence length, there are instances where active voice and direct verbs would improve clarity.\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have been aware of their treatment (lack of blinding), and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\" (Limitations section)\n    *   **Explanation:** \"The evidence is limited\" is a passive construction. The 'passive_voice' (20.0) and 'nominalization' (23.0) metrics are both in the P90 range, indicating a need to convert passive constructions to active voice and use verbs instead of noun forms.\n    *   **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small.

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. Readability indices such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade (15.30), Automated Readability Index (16.47), Gunning Fog Index (19.93), SMOG Index (15.25), Dale-Chall Readability (8.24), LIX (58.57), and RIX (8.58) are all in the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range, suggesting the text is too difficult for the target audience. The Flesch Reading Ease score (37.07) is in the P25 range, further confirming low readability. Sentence structure is problematic, with 'words_per_sentence' (29.04) being BEYOND_P90, indicating sentences are too long. Vocabulary complexity is also a major concern, as 'complex_words_dc' (325.0), 'complex_words' (157.0), and 'long_words' (223.0) are all BEYOND_P90, and 'nominalization' (23.0) is in the P90 range. Additionally, 'passive_voice' (20.0) is in the P90 range, and 'nouns' (225.0) are BEYOND_P90, suggesting a need for more active voice and a better balance of nouns and verbs. Overall, only 16.7% of features fall within the best quartile, highlighting a strong need for simplification across multiple linguistic dimensions."
