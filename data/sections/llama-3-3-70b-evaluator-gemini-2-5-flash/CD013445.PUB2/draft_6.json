  "draft": "Is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) - a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones - better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) - a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones - for treating kidney stones in adults?\n\nWe found that PCNL may be better than RIRS for treating kidney stones in adults. It may improve the chance of being stone-free and reduce the need for more procedures. However, it probably has little or no effect on major complications. PCNL may increase the time spent in the hospital. There were no reported harmful effects on ureteral stricture - narrowing of the ureter - or injury, and no evidence on unplanned medical visits or a person's overall well-being.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and why are they a problem?\nKidney stones can cause pain, blockages, and infections. Treatment can be difficult because stones vary in size, location, and what they are made of. Common treatments for kidney stones include observation, shock wave lithotripsy, RIRS, PCNL, or a combination of these approaches.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if PCNL is better than RIRS for treating kidney stones in adults. We compared the two procedures to see which was better at removing stones, causing serious problems, or requiring more treatment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing PCNL and RIRS for treating renal stones. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 studies that involved 4571 people with renal stones. The studies compared PCNL with RIRS for the treatment of renal stones in adults. The average size of stones ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. No studies reported unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhat were the main results of the treatments?\nPCNL may improve the rate of people being stone-free and may reduce the need for additional procedures. However, it probably has little or no effect on major complications. It may have little or no effect on the occurrence of ureteral strictures and may increase the length of hospital stay. For every 100 people who have PCNL, 10 more may be stone-free compared to those who have RIRS.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and participants may have been aware of their treatment. Not all studies reported all outcomes of interest. Also, most studies did not say where their funding came from, which can make the results less certain. We need more research to confirm these results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n- PCNL may be better than RIRS at clearing stones and may reduce the need for more treatment.\n- PCNL probably does not increase the risk of serious side effects but may lead to a longer hospital stay.\n- The evidence is not very certain, so more research is needed to confirm these findings.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft with excellent readability scores, but it needs revision due to a factual inaccuracy and a couple of key clarity issues that affect reader understanding.\n\n**Critical Issue: Factual Inaccuracy**\n\nThere is a misinterpretation of one of the key findings.\n\n- **Original sentence:** \"There were no reported harmful effects on ureteral stricture - narrowing of the ureter - or injury...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is not quite right. The source abstract states PCNL \"may have little or no effect\" on this outcome, which means the rates of this complication are probably similar between the two procedures. Your wording incorrectly suggests that no harm was reported at all, which could mislead a reader.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The risk of developing a ureteral stricture (a narrowing of the tube that carries urine from the kidney) appears to be similar for both procedures.\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed**\n\n1.  **Simplify the Title and Opening Paragraph:** The title is the first thing a reader sees, and its current structure is a major barrier.\n    - **Original sentence:** \"Is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) - a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones - better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) - a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones - for treating kidney stones in adults?\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** At 61 words, this sentence is very hard to follow. By embedding long definitions inside the main question, you make sure to avoid confusing the reader. The average sentence length for the draft is excellent (14.94 words), but this crucial first sentence is an outlier that needs to be fixed.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** Shorten the title to focus on the core question, and move the definitions to the first paragraph. For example:\n      - **New Title:** \"Which surgery is better for removing kidney stones in adults: PCNL or RIRS?\"\n      - **New opening paragraph:** \"This review compares two surgeries for kidney stones. One is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), where a surgeon makes a small cut in the back to remove the stones. The other is retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), where a surgeon passes a small scope through the body's natural openings to reach and remove the stones.\"\n\n2.  **Clarify the Main Results as a Trade-off:** The summary of findings is presented as a list, which is less helpful for a patient trying to weigh their options.\n    - **Original text:** \"PCNL may improve the rate of people being stone-free and may reduce the need for additional procedures. However, it probably has little or no effect on major complications. It may have little or the occurrence of ureteral strictures and may increase the length of hospital stay.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** This format makes it hard for a reader to quickly grasp the pros and cons of each option. Rephrasing it as a direct comparison makes the choice clearer.\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Compared to RIRS, PCNL appears to be better at clearing stones completely and reducing the need for more treatment. However, people who have PCNL may spend about one extra day in the hospital. The risk of serious side effects was similar for both procedures.\"\n\n3.  **Strengthen the 'Limitations' Section:** The current text is a bit generic.\n    - **Original sentence:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and participants may have been aware of their treatment.\"\n    - **Why it's a problem:** Explaining *why* these are limitations helps the reader understand the uncertainty. For example, why does it matter if participants knew their treatment?\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many of the studies were small. In most studies, both the patients and their doctors knew which treatment they were getting, which can sometimes influence the results. Finally, most studies did not report where their funding came from.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 78% of metrics falling into the best quartile for readability and clarity. Scores for readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 7.5), sentence length (14.9 words/sentence), and active voice are excellent. However, these strong overall averages mask a few specific but critical issues, most notably a 61-word title sentence that hinders comprehension from the start. The metrics confirm the bulk of the text is well-written, but the feedback focuses on high-impact areas that require manual editing for accuracy and clarity."
