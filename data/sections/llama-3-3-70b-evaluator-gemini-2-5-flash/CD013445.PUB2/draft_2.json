  "draft": "Is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones) better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones) for treating kidney stones in adults?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) may be better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for treating kidney stones in adults. \n- PCNL may improve the chance of being stone-free and reduce the need for more procedures. \n- It probably has little or no effect on major complications (serious harmful effects). \n- However, PCNL may increase the time spent in the hospital. \n- There were no reported harmful effects on ureteral stricture (narrowing of the ureter) or injury, and no evidence on unplanned medical visits or a person's overall well-being (quality of life).\n- The studies had many weaknesses, so the evidence for most results was not strong. \n- This means the findings are not very certain, and we need more research to confirm them. \n- Many studies also failed to report important details like funding sources or conflicts of interest, which can make the results less trustworthy.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as investigating the long-term effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy and retrograde intrarenal surgery, and comparing the outcomes of different access sizes for percutaneous nephrolithotomy, to provide more accurate and reliable information for shared decision-making about the management of kidney stones.\n\n**Introduction**\n### What are kidney stones and why are they a problem?\nKidney stones, also known as renal stones, are a source of pain, obstruction, and infection. They can vary in size, location, composition, and other patient factors, making treatment challenging. Common treatments for kidney stones include observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. They aimed to compare the two treatments in terms of stone-free rate, major complications, need for secondary interventions, and other outcomes to inform shared decision-making for individuals with renal stones.\n\n**Methods**\n### How did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for treating renal stones, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 42 studies that involved 4571 people with renal stones. The studies compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. The average size of stones ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. No studies reported unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n### What were the main results of the treatments?\nPercutaneous nephrolithotomy may improve the rate of people being stone-free and may reduce the need for additional procedures, but probably has little to no effect on major complications. It may have little to no effect on the occurrence of ureteral strictures and may increase the length of hospital stay. For every 100 people who have percutaneous nephrolithotomy, 10 more may be stone-free compared to those who have retrograde intrarenal surgery.\n\n**Limitations**\n### What are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and participants may have been aware of their treatment (lack of blinding). Not all studies reported all outcomes of interest. We need more research to confirm these results.\n\n**Currency**\n### How up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

The main issues are overly complex sentences and the use of formal, noun-heavy language, which makes the text dense and difficult to follow. The linguistic analysis confirms this, showing high scores for complex words, long words, and nominalizations (using nouns instead of verbs). By simplifying sentence structures and choosing more direct, active language, you can make this summary much more accessible for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While several metrics are within the typical range, a significant cluster of six metrics (33.3% of all features) falls into the P90 range, indicating substantial deviation. These deviations are concentrated in vocabulary complexity (smog_index, complex_words_dc, complex_words, long_words) and sentence structure (nominalization, nouns), pointing to a text that is more technical and noun-heavy than a typical PLS. The key areas for improvement are reducing complex vocabulary and converting noun-based phrases into more direct verb-based actions."
