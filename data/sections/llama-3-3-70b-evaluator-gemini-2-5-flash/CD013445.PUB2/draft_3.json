  "draft": "Is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones) better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones) for treating kidney stones in adults?\n\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy may be better than retrograde intrarenal surgery for treating kidney stones in adults - it may improve the chance of being stone-free and reduce the need for more procedures.\n- It probably has little or no effect on major complications (serious harmful effects).\n- However, percutaneous nephrolithotomy may increase the time spent in the hospital.\n- There were no reported harmful effects on ureteral stricture (narrowing of the ureter) or injury, and no evidence on unplanned medical visits or a person's overall well-being (quality of life).\n- The studies had many weaknesses, so the evidence for most results was not strong - this means the findings are not very certain, and we need more research to confirm them.\n- Many studies also failed to report important details like funding sources or conflicts of interest, which can make the results less trustworthy.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as investigating the long-term effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy and retrograde intrarenal surgery, and comparing the outcomes of different access sizes for percutaneous nephrolithotomy, to provide more accurate and reliable information for shared decision-making about the management of kidney stones.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and why are they a problem?\nKidney stones, also known as renal stones, are a source of pain, obstruction, and infection - they can vary in size, location, composition, and other patient factors, making treatment challenging. Common treatments for kidney stones include observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults - they aimed to compare the two treatments in terms of stone-free rate, major complications, need for secondary interventions, and other outcomes to inform shared decision-making for individuals with renal stones.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for treating renal stones, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 studies that involved 4571 people with renal stones - the studies compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. The average size of stones ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm - no studies reported unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhat were the main results of the treatments?\nPercutaneous nephrolithotomy may improve the rate of people being stone-free and may reduce the need for additional procedures, but probably has little or no effect on major complications - it may have little or no effect on the occurrence of ureteral strictures and may increase the length of hospital stay. For every 100 people who have percutaneous nephrolithotomy, 10 more may be stone-free compared to those who have retrograde intrarenal surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and participants may have been aware of their treatment (lack of blinding) - not all studies reported all outcomes of interest. We need more research to confirm these results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. All the essential information is here and factually accurate. However, the summary is not yet ready for publication because it needs significant improvements in clarity and readability to meet the needs of a lay audience. The sentences are frequently too long and complex, and the writing style is often too academic. \n\nHere are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\n\n**1. Break up very long sentences.**\nMany sentences are over 30 words long, which can be difficult for readers to follow. Breaking them into shorter, single-idea sentences will make the information much easier to digest.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as investigating the long-term effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy and retrograde intrarenal surgery, and comparing the outcomes of different access sizes for percutaneous nephrolithotomy, to provide more accurate and reliable information for shared decision-making about the management of kidney stones.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future research should aim to fix the problems in the current studies. For example, researchers could study the long-term effects of both treatments. They could also compare the different types of PCNL. This would provide better information to help people and their doctors decide on the best treatment.\"\n\n**2. Use more direct, active language and consistent pronouns.**\nThe style guide recommends using \"we\" to refer to the review authors. The draft sometimes uses \"The review authors,\" which is less direct. It also uses noun forms instead of active verbs (e.g., \"treatment of\" instead of \"to treat\"), which makes the text feel dense.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"The review authors wanted to assess the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults - they aimed to compare the two treatments in terms of stone-free rate, major complications, need for secondary interventions, and other outcomes to inform shared decision-making for individuals with renal stones.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if PCNL is better than RIRS for treating kidney stones in adults. We compared the two procedures to see which was better at removing stones, causing serious problems, or requiring more treatment. This can help people and their doctors make treatment decisions together.\"\n\n**3. Simplify dense phrasing and vocabulary.**\nSome sentences pack too many concepts together and use formal phrasing where simpler words would be clearer.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Kidney stones, also known as renal stones, are a source of pain, obstruction, and infection - they can vary in size, location, composition, and other patient factors, making treatment challenging.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Kidney stones (also called renal stones) can cause pain, blockages, and infections. Treatment can be difficult because stones vary in size, location, and what they are made of.\"\n\nAddressing these points will also help improve the readability scores flagged in the linguistic analysis, particularly the high sentence length and use of complex words.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns. 10 out of 18 metrics (55.6%) are in the P90 range, indicating the text is harder to read than a typical PLS. The main issues are the high average sentence length (26.9 words), the high number of complex and long words, and the frequent use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs). These factors contribute to challenging readability scores, such as a Flesch-Kincaid Grade level of 15.1, which is well above the target for a lay audience."
