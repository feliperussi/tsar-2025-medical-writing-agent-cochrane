  "draft": "Is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones) better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones) for treating kidney stones in adults?\n\nThis review compares two surgeries for kidney stones. One is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), where a surgeon makes a small cut in the back to remove the stones. The other is retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), where a surgeon passes a small scope through the body's natural openings to reach and remove the stones. Throughout this summary, we will refer to these as 'surgery through the back (PCNL)' and 'surgery with a scope (RIRS)'.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and why are they a problem?\nKidney stones (also called renal stones) can cause pain, blockages, and infections. They can vary in size, location, composition, and other patient factors, making treatment challenging. Common treatments for kidney stones include observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. We compared the two treatments in terms of stone-free rate, major complications, need for secondary interventions, and other outcomes to help people with kidney stones and their doctors decide on the best treatment together.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for treating renal stones, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 studies that involved 4571 people with renal stones. The studies compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. The average size of stones ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. Most studies did not report sources of funding or conflicts of interest.\n\nWhat were the main results of the treatments?\nCompared to RIRS, PCNL may be better at clearing stones completely and may mean people are less likely to need a second operation. However, people who have PCNL may spend about one extra day in the hospital. The risk of serious side effects was similar for both procedures. For both surgeries, the risk was similar for developing a narrowing of the tube that carries urine from the kidney (called a ureteral stricture).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence for a few reasons. Many of the studies were small. In most studies, both the patients and their doctors knew which treatment they were getting. This is a limitation because knowing which surgery they received might have influenced how people reported their pain or satisfaction, making the results less reliable. Finally, most studies did not report where their funding came from.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n- PCNL (surgery through the back) may be better than RIRS (surgery with a scope) at clearing stones and may reduce the need for another procedure.\n- PCNL probably does not increase the risk of serious side effects but may lead to a longer hospital stay.\n- The evidence is not very certain, so more research is needed to confirm these findings.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. However, it is not approved because of a few key issues that impact reader understanding. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use your simplified terms consistently.** You do an excellent job defining simplified terms for the procedures, but then don't use them in the main results section, forcing the reader to remember the acronyms.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Compared to RIRS, PCNL may be better at clearing stones completely and may mean people are less likely to need a second operation.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Compared to surgery with a scope (RIRS), surgery through the back (PCNL) may be better at clearing stones completely and may mean people are less likely to need a second operation.\"\n\n2. **Simplify noun-heavy sentences.** Some sections are dense with nouns and less common words, which can make them harder to read. Replacing these with simpler, more verb-focused sentences would improve clarity.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"They can vary in size, location, composition, and other patient factors, making treatment challenging.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Treating them can be difficult because stones come in different sizes, are found in different places, and are made of different things.\"\n\n3. **Make the explanation of limitations more direct.** The explanation of bias is good but could be stated more simply for a lay audience.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"This is a limitation because knowing which surgery they received might have influenced how people reported their pain or satisfaction, making the results less reliable.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This can affect the results, because people's expectations about a treatment can influence how they report things like pain or satisfaction.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The linguistic analysis supports the need to simplify vocabulary. The draft has a high number of nouns (166) and Dale-Chall complex words (240), both falling in the P90 range, which indicates a deviation from typical plain language summaries. Addressing the points above will help improve these metrics and make the summary easier for patients to understand.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83.3% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. The word count is well within the limit. However, the analysis identified two areas for improvement: the total number of nouns (166) and the count of Dale-Chall complex words (240) are both in the 90th percentile range, suggesting the vocabulary is denser and less common than is typical for a PLS. Focusing on simpler word choices and more active sentence structures would address these deviations."
