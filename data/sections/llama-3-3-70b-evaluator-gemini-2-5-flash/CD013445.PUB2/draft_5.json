  "draft": "Is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones) better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones) for treating kidney stones in adults?\n\nWe found that percutaneous nephrolithotomy may be better than retrograde intrarenal surgery for treating kidney stones in adults. It may improve the chance of being stone-free and reduce the need for more procedures. However, it probably has little or no effect on major complications (serious harmful effects). Percutaneous nephrolithotomy may increase the time spent in the hospital. There were no reported harmful effects on ureteral stricture (narrowing of the ureter) or injury, and no evidence on unplanned medical visits or a person's overall well-being (quality of life).\n\nWhat are kidney stones and why are they a problem?\nKidney stones (also called renal stones) can cause pain, blockages, and infections. Treatment can be difficult because stones vary in size, location, and what they are made of. Common treatments for kidney stones include observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if percutaneous nephrolithotomy is better than retrograde intrarenal surgery for treating kidney stones in adults. We compared the two procedures to see which was better at removing stones, causing serious problems, or requiring more treatment. This can help people and their doctors make treatment decisions together.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing percutaneous nephrolithotomy and retrograde intrarenal surgery for treating renal stones. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 studies that involved 4571 people with renal stones. The studies compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy with retrograde intrarenal surgery for the treatment of renal stones in adults. The average size of stones ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. No studies reported unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhat were the main results of the treatments?\nPercutaneous nephrolithotomy may improve the rate of people being stone-free and may reduce the need for additional procedures. However, it probably has little or no effect on major complications. It may have little or no effect on the occurrence of ureteral strictures and may increase the length of hospital stay. For every 100 people who have percutaneous nephrolithotomy, 10 more may be stone-free compared to those who have retrograde intrarenal surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and participants may have been aware of their treatment (lack of blinding). Not all studies reported all outcomes of interest. We need more research to confirm these results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.\n\nKey messages:\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy may be better than retrograde intrarenal surgery for treating kidney stones in adults, as it may improve stone-free rates and reduce the need for secondary interventions, but it probably has little or no effect on major complications.\n- The evidence for most outcomes was not robust, meaning that the findings are not very certain, and more research is needed to confirm these results.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as investigating the long-term effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy and retrograde intrarenal surgery, and comparing the outcomes of different access sizes for percutaneous nephrolithotomy, to provide more accurate and reliable information for shared decision-making about the management of kidney stones.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs several improvements to make it easier for a lay audience to understand. The main issues are the repeated use of long, technical procedure names instead of acronyms, overly complex vocabulary, and a 'Key messages' section that is not formatted for easy reading. Addressing these points will significantly improve clarity.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Introduce and use acronyms for the procedures.**\n   - **Problem:** The full names 'percutaneous nephrolithotomy' and 'retrograde intrarenal surgery' are used repeatedly throughout the text. This makes sentences long and difficult to follow.\n   - **Example:** \"For every 100 people who have percutaneous nephrolithotomy, 10 more may be stone-free compared to those who have retrograde intrarenal surgery.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Define the acronyms (PCNL and RIRS) early in the text and use them consistently thereafter. For example, in the 'What are kidney stones...' section, you could write: \"...retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)...\" Then, the example sentence could be rewritten as: \"For every 100 people who have PCNL, 10 more may be stone-free compared to those who have RIRS.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex and formal vocabulary.**\n   - **Problem:** Several words are too technical or formal for a plain language summary, which can alienate or confuse readers.\n   - **Example:** \"...it may improve stone-free rates and reduce the need for secondary interventions...\" and \"The evidence for most outcomes was not robust...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace these with simpler, more common words. For instance, change 'secondary interventions' to 'more procedures' or 'further treatment'. Replace 'robust' with 'strong' or 'certain'.\n\n3. **Restructure the 'Key messages' for clarity and style guide compliance.**\n   - **Problem:** The heading 'Key messages:' is not a question, which violates the style guide. Furthermore, the messages are presented as dense paragraphs rather than scannable bullet points, defeating their purpose.\n   - **Example:** \"- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy may be better than retrograde intrarenal surgery for treating kidney stones in adults, as it may improve stone-free rates and reduce the need for secondary interventions, but it probably has little or no effect on major complications.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Change the heading to a question, such as 'What are the key messages of this review?'. Then, break down the long paragraphs into short, distinct bullet points, each starting with a dash. For example:\n     \"- PCNL may be better than RIRS at clearing stones and may reduce the need for more treatment.\n     - PCNL probably does not increase the risk of serious side effects but may lead to a longer hospital stay.\n     - The evidence is not very certain, so more research is needed to confirm these findings.\"\n\n4. **Add a critical limitation to the evidence.**\n   - **Problem:** The draft omits an important limitation mentioned in the source material: that most studies did not report their funding sources or conflicts of interest. This is crucial information for readers to judge the trustworthiness of the evidence.\n   - **Suggestion:** Add a sentence to the 'What are the limitations of the evidence?' section, such as: \"Also, most studies did not say where their funding came from, which can make the results less certain.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity, particularly with sentence structure (words_per_sentence is in the best quartile) and use of active voice. However, there is a significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—'nouns', 'smog_index', 'complex_words_dc', 'complex_words', and 'long_words'—are in the P90 range, indicating the text uses far more nouns, long words, and complex terms than is typical for a plain language summary. This data strongly supports the editorial feedback to simplify vocabulary and use acronyms to improve readability."
