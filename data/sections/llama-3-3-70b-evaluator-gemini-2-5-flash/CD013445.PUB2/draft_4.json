  "draft": "Is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones) better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones) for treating kidney stones in adults?\n\n- We found that percutaneous nephrolithotomy may be better than retrograde intrarenal surgery for treating kidney stones in adults. It may improve the chance of being stone-free and reduce the need for more procedures.\n- However, it probably has little or no effect on major complications (serious harmful effects).\n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy may increase the time spent in the hospital.\n- There were no reported harmful effects on ureteral stricture (narrowing of the ureter) or injury, and no evidence on unplanned medical visits or a person's overall well-being (quality of life).\n- The studies had many weaknesses, so the evidence for most results was not strong. This means the findings are not very certain, and we need more research to confirm them.\n- Many studies also failed to report important details like funding sources or conflicts of interest, which can make the results less trustworthy.\n- Future research should aim to fix the problems in the current studies. For example, researchers could study the long-term effects of both treatments. They could also compare the different types of percutaneous nephrolithotomy. This would provide better information to help people and their doctors decide on the best treatment.\n\nWhat are kidney stones and why are they a problem?\nKidney stones (also called renal stones) can cause pain, blockages, and infections. Treatment can be difficult because stones vary in size, location, and what they are made of. Common treatments for kidney stones include observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if percutaneous nephrolithotomy is better than retrograde intrarenal surgery for treating kidney stones in adults. We compared the two procedures to see which was better at removing stones, causing serious problems, or requiring more treatment. This can help people and their doctors make treatment decisions together.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing percutaneous nephrolithotomy and retrograde intrarenal surgery for treating renal stones. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 42 studies that involved 4571 people with renal stones. The studies compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy with retrograde intrarenal surgery for the treatment of renal stones in adults. The average size of stones ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. No studies reported unplanned medical visits or quality of life.\n\nWhat were the main results of the treatments?\nPercutaneous nephrolithotomy may improve the rate of people being stone-free and may reduce the need for additional procedures. However, it probably has little or no effect on major complications. It may have little or no effect on the occurrence of ureteral strictures and may increase the length of hospital stay. For every 100 people who have percutaneous nephrolithotomy, 10 more may be stone-free compared to those who have retrograde intrarenal surgery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, and participants may have been aware of their treatment (lack of blinding). Not all studies reported all outcomes of interest. We need more research to confirm these results.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2023.",

The main issues are the overuse of long, technical procedure names, some unclear phrasing of results, and repetition between the key messages and the main results section. These issues make the summary harder to read than it needs to be, which is reflected in the linguistic analysis showing high vocabulary complexity. Addressing the 3 improvements below will make the summary much clearer and more helpful for readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has excellent sentence structure, with short sentences and good use of active voice. However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics—'nouns', 'smog_index', 'complex_words_dc', 'complex_words', and 'long_words'—are in the highest 10th percentile, indicating the vocabulary is more technical and contains more long, complex words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. The feedback focuses on simplifying this vocabulary."
