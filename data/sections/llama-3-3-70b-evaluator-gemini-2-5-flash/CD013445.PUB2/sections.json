    "Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a surgical procedure where a small cut is made in the back to remove kidney stones) may be better than retrograde intrarenal surgery (a procedure where a small scope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to remove kidney stones) for treating kidney stones in adults, as it may improve stone-free rates and reduce the need for secondary interventions, but it probably has little or no effect on major complications (serious harmful effects), and may increase the length of hospital stay (the time spent in the hospital), with no reported harmful effects on ureteral stricture (narrowing of the ureter) or injury, and no evidence on unplanned medical visits or quality of life (a person's overall well-being).",
    "Due to the considerable shortcomings of the included trials, the evidence for most outcomes was not robust, meaning that the findings are not very certain, and more research is needed to confirm these results, especially since most studies did not report important details like sources of funding or conflicts of interest, which can affect the reliability of the results.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the limitations of current studies, such as investigating the long-term effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy and retrograde intrarenal surgery, and comparing the outcomes of different access sizes for percutaneous nephrolithotomy, to provide more accurate and reliable information for shared decision-making about the management of kidney stones."

      "subheading": "What are kidney stones and why are they a problem?",
      "content": "Kidney stones, also known as renal stones, are a source of pain, obstruction, and infection. They can vary in size, location, composition, and other patient factors, making treatment challenging. Common treatments for kidney stones include observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches."

      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. They aimed to compare the two treatments in terms of stone-free rate, major complications, need for secondary interventions, and other outcomes to inform shared decision-making for individuals with renal stones."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 42 studies that involved 4571 people with renal stones. The studies compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) with retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults. Most studies did not report the duration of the studies. The average size of stones ranged from 10.1 mm to 39.1 mm. Most studies did not report sources of funding or conflicts of interest. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific countries were not reported. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, were not reported. The interventions compared were PCNL and RIRS, with PCNL being further categorized by access size in French gauge (Fr) into three groups: ≥ 24 Fr (standard PCNL), 15–23 Fr (mini-PCNL and minimally invasive PCNL), and < 15 Fr (ultra-mini-, mini-micro-, super-mini-, and micro-PCNL). No studies reported unplanned medical visits or quality of life."

      "subheading": "Main results: Treatment outcomes for renal stones",
      "content": "Percutaneous nephrolithotomy may improve the rate of people being stone-free and may reduce the need for additional procedures, but probably has little to no effect on major complications. It may have little to no effect on the occurrence of ureteral strictures and may increase the length of hospital stay. For every 100 people who have percutaneous nephrolithotomy, 10 more may be stone-free compared to those who have retrograde intrarenal surgery."
