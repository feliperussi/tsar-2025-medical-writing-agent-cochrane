  "draft": "Can digital health tools help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care? We found that digital health tools may help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care, but we are not certain of their effectiveness. The studies did not report on harmful effects. When used with standard care, digital tools may slightly reduce body fat. We are uncertain if they have any effect on other things we measured, like physical activity or mental well-being. Future research should look at the long-term benefits and possible harms of these digital tools. Studies also need to explore how to tailor support to individuals. For example, researchers should report results for different ages and ethnic groups, and measure any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and why is it a problem? Childhood obesity is a worldwide public health problem that increases the risk of chronic diseases. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were living with overweight or obesity. This condition can lead to various health issues, including an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems later in life. Common treatments for childhood obesity often involve a combination of diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? The review authors wanted to assess the effects and safety of digital health interventions, such as mobile phone applications, text messages, and telehealth, for the management of obesity in children and adolescents. They aimed to compare the effectiveness of these interventions when used alone or in combination with conventional care, and to evaluate their impact on various outcomes, including body mass index, physical activity, and mental well-being.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use? We searched for studies on digital health interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? We found 15 studies that involved 911 children and teenagers with obesity. The studies took place in several countries, including the USA and Sweden. Most participants were 10 to 19 years old. The studies lasted for different amounts of time; nine were shorter than 6 months and six were longer.\n\nThe studies looked at different types of digital tools. These included websites, mobile apps, text messages, and wearable devices like smartwatches. Some studies also used active video games or remote health services. We compared digital tools against standard care. Some studies tested digital tools combined with standard care, while others tested digital tools on their own.\n\nWe found that using digital tools alongside standard care may slightly reduce body fat. However, we are uncertain about their effects on other outcomes, like physical activity or well-being.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? The evidence is up to date to April 2025.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong, factually accurate draft that passes all critical checks. However, it needs some revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience before approval. The main issues are unnecessarily complex vocabulary and dense, noun-heavy sentences that can be simplified. The opening summary would also be much clearer if restructured as a 'Key messages' list. Addressing the 3 improvements below will make the summary much easier for patients and their families to read and understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Simplify Complex and Noun-Heavy Sentences**\n\nSome sentences are packed with technical-sounding nouns, making them dense and hard to read, even though they are short.\n\n*   **Problematic text:** \"The review authors wanted to assess the effects and safety of digital health interventions, such as mobile phone applications, text messages, and telehealth, for the management of obesity in children and adolescents.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is heavy with abstract nouns ('effects', 'safety', 'interventions', 'management'). Using more direct verbs makes the goal clearer.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if digital health tools (like mobile apps or text messages) are safe and effective for helping children and teenagers manage obesity.\"\n\n**2. Make the Opening Summary Clearer and More Direct**\n\nThe first paragraph acts as a summary, but it repeats information and isn't as scannable as a list. Restructuring it as 'Key messages' would significantly improve clarity.\n\n*   **Problematic text:** \"We found that digital health tools may help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care, but we are not certain of their effectiveness. The studies did not report on harmful effects. When used with standard care, digital tools may slightly reduce body fat.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The key findings are mixed in with repetitive phrases. A bulleted list helps readers grasp the main points instantly.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:**\n    \"**Key messages**\n    - When used with standard care (like diet and exercise advice), digital health tools may slightly reduce body fat in children and teenagers with obesity.\n    - We are uncertain if these tools affect other things like physical activity or well‑being.\n    - The studies we found did not report on any harmful effects.\"\n\n**3. Replace Wordy Phrases with Simpler Alternatives**\n\nThroughout the draft, some phrases can be made more concise and use more common words.\n\n*   **Problematic text:** \"Common treatments for childhood obesity often involve a combination of diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like 'involve a combination of' are wordy, and 'behavioral changes' is clinical jargon.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Treatment usually includes changes to diet and exercise, along with support to build healthy habits.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows the draft has an excellent foundation with good readability scores, short sentences, and strong use of active voice, placing it in the best quartile for most structural metrics. However, it deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in its vocabulary, with a high number of nouns, long words, and words considered complex by the Dale-Chall formula (all in the P90 range). This confirms the editorial feedback: the main opportunity for improvement is to simplify word choice and reduce noun-heavy phrasing to better align with plain language principles."
