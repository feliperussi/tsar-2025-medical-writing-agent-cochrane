  "draft": "Can digital health tools, such as mobile apps or wearable devices, help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care?\n\n- Digital health tools, such as mobile apps or wearable devices, may help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain of their effectiveness, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Digital interventions, when combined with conventional care, may have a small beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents, but the effect on other outcomes is unclear.\n- Future research should investigate the long-term benefits and potential harms of digital health tools for obesity management in children and teenagers, and explore how they can be used to support this population in a way that is tailored to their individual needs, including reporting results by age, gender, and race/ethnicity, and assessing other important outcomes, particularly adverse events.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?\nChildhood obesity is a worldwide public health problem that increases the risk of chronic diseases. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were living with overweight or obesity. This condition can lead to various health issues, including an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems later in life. Common treatments for childhood obesity often involve a combination of diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects and safety of digital health interventions, such as mobile phone applications, text messages, and telehealth, for the management of obesity in children and adolescents. They aimed to compare the effectiveness of these interventions when used alone or in combination with conventional care, and to evaluate their impact on various outcomes, including body mass index, physical activity, and mental well-being.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies on digital health interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 15 studies that involved 911 participants with obesity. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including the USA, Sweden, Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland, and Thailand. Most studies involved participants aged 10 to 19 years old, with some also including younger children. The studies lasted for varying durations, with nine classified as short duration (less than six months) and six as long duration (six or more months). The interventions included digital health technologies such as wearable or implantable devices, web-based interventions, text messages, mobile phone or tablet applications, exergaming or active video gaming, and telehealth, often in combination with conventional care. Comparisons were made between digital health technology plus conventional care versus conventional care alone, and digital technology alone versus conventional care alone. No information was available on the funding sources of the studies. Digital interventions combined with conventional care may have a small beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents compared to conventional care alone. The effect on other outcome measures is unclear.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions to improve clarity for a general audience. The main issues are overly complex vocabulary and long sentences that make key findings difficult to understand. Specifically, the language around harmful effects is misleading, which is a critical issue.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Clarify the reporting on harms.** The current wording could be misinterpreted by readers.\n    - **Problem:** In the first key message, \"...and no harmful effects were reported\" suggests that harms were looked for and not found.\n    - **Suggestion:** Please change this to \"...the studies did not approved\". This more accurately reflects that the data was missing.\n\n2. **Break up long, complex sentences.** Some sentences contain too many ideas, making them hard to follow.\n    - **Problem:** The final key message is a single 58-word sentence: \"Future research should investigate the long-term benefits and potential harms of digital health tools for obesity management in children and teenagers, and explore how they can be used to support this population in a way that is tailored to their individual needs, including reporting results by age, gender, and race/ethnicity, and assessing other important outcomes, particularly adverse events.\"\n    - **Suggestion:** Break this into shorter sentences, for example: \"Future research should look at the long-term benefits and possible harms of these digital tools. Studies also need to explore how to tailor support to individuals. For example, researchers should report results for different ages and ethnic groups, and measure any unwanted effects.\"\n\n3. **Use simpler, more direct language for the main findings.** The results section uses technical phrasing that may confuse readers.\n    - **Problem:** The sentence \"Digital interventions combined with conventional care may have a small beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents compared to conventional care alone. The effect on other outcome measures is unclear\" is clinical and vague.\n    - **Suggestion:** Rephrase this to be more concrete: \"When used with standard care, digital tools may slightly reduce body fat. We are uncertain if they have any effect on other things we measured, like physical activity or mental well-being.\"\n\nThese suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the draft has a high number of complex and long words and a reading grade level that is too high for a general audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows that while the draft conforms to typical PLS patterns in many areas (72% of features are in the best quartile), it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity and readability. Five key metrics fall into the P90 range, indicating the text is harder to read than is typical for a PLS. Specifically, the scores for `smog_index` (14.75), `complex_words` (140), `long_words` (201), and `nouns` (187) are all unusually high, suggesting the text relies too heavily on technical, multi-syllable words and noun-heavy phrases."
