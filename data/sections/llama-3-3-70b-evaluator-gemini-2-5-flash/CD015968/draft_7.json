  "draft": "Can digital health tools, such as mobile apps or wearable devices, help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care?\n\n- Digital health tools, like mobile apps or wearable devices, may help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care, but we are not certain of their effectiveness. The studies did not report on harmful effects.\n- When used with standard care, digital tools may slightly reduce body fat. We are uncertain if they have any effect on other things we measured, like physical activity or mental well-being.\n- Future research should look at the long-term benefits and possible harms of these digital tools. Studies also need to explore how to tailor support to individuals. For example, researchers should report results for different ages and ethnic groups, and measure any unwanted effects.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?\nChildhood obesity is a worldwide public health problem that increases the risk of chronic diseases. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were living with overweight or obesity. This condition can lead to various health issues, including an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems later in life. Common treatments for childhood obesity often involve a combination of diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects and safety of digital health interventions, such as mobile phone applications, text messages, and telehealth, for the management of obesity in children and adolescents. They aimed to compare the effectiveness of these interventions when used alone or in combination with conventional care, and to evaluate their impact on various outcomes, including body mass index, physical activity, and mental well-being.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies on digital health interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 15 studies that involved 911 participants with obesity. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including the USA, Sweden, Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland, and Thailand. Most studies involved participants aged 10 to 19 years old, with some also including younger children. The studies lasted for varying durations, with 9 classified as short duration (less than 6 months) and 6 as long duration (6 or more months). The interventions included digital health technologies such as wearable or implantable devices, web-based interventions, text messages, mobile phone or tablet applications, exergaming or active video gaming, and telehealth, often in combination with conventional care. Comparisons were made between digital health technology plus conventional care versus conventional care alone, and digital technology alone versus conventional care alone. No information was available on the funding sources of the studies. Digital interventions combined with conventional care may have a small beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents compared to conventional care alone. The effect on other outcome measures is unclear.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting have passed. However, the summary is not approved because of significant clarity issues, primarily in the 'What did we find?' section. This section contains a very long, dense paragraph with complex lists and technical language that will be difficult for a lay reader to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify complex lists and technical terms.** The list of technologies in the results section is long and contains jargon. This makes the sentence hard to follow and understand.\n   - **Problem Text:** \"The interventions included digital health technologies such as wearable or implantable devices, web-based interventions, text messages, mobile phone or tablet applications, exergaming or active video gaming, and telehealth, often in combination with conventional care.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** This sentence is over 30 words long and includes jargon like 'exergaming' and 'telehealth' without explanation. Combining many different ideas into one list reduces clarity.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"The studies looked at different types of digital tools. These included websites, mobile apps, text messages, and wearable devices like smartwatches. Some studies also used active video games ('exergaming') or remote health services ('telehealth').\"\n\n2. **Break up long paragraphs to improve readability.** The 'What did we find?' section is a single, large block of text that covers many different topics, from study demographics to the final results. This 'wall of text' can be intimidating and makes it hard for readers to find the main points.\n   - **Problem Text:** The entire paragraph under \"What did we find?\"\n   - **Reasoning:** This paragraph mixes information about who was in the studies, where they were, how long they lasted, what interventions were used, and the final results. This violates the style guide's rule to start a new paragraph when the topic shifts.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Break this section into at least two smaller paragraphs.\n     - **Paragraph 1 (Study details):** \"We found 15 studies that involved 911 children and teenagers with obesity. The studies took place in several countries, including the USA and Sweden. Most participants were 10 to 19 years old. The studies lasted for different amounts of time; nine were shorter than 6 months and six were longer.\"\n     - **Paragraph 2 (Findings):** \"The studies compared two main approaches: 1) digital tools plus standard care versus standard care alone, and 2) digital tools alone versus standard care alone. We found that using digital tools alongside standard care may slightly reduce body fat. However, we are uncertain about their effects on other outcomes, like physical activity or well‑being.\"\n\n3. **Use more direct, active language.** Some sentences use passive voice and repetitive phrasing, which makes them wordy and less clear.\n   - **Problem Text:** \"Comparisons were made between digital health technology plus conventional care versus conventional care alone, and digital technology alone versus conventional care alone.\"\n   - **Reasoning:** The passive phrase \"Comparisons were made\" is indirect. The sentence is also very repetitive.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We compared digital tools against standard care. Some studies tested digital tools combined with standard care, while others tested digital tools on their own.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your draft shows significant deviation from typical PLS patterns for vocabulary complexity. The metrics for `complex_words`, `long_words`, and the `smog_index` are all in the 90th percentile, confirming that the language is more complex than in a typical Plain Language Summary. Addressing the points above will help bring these metrics closer to the target range and make the summary easier to read.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "Overall, the draft shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns, with most metrics falling in the median or best quartile ranges. However, there is a significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics—`nouns`, `smog_index`, `complex_words_dc`, `complex_words`, and `long_words`—are in the 90th percentile range. This indicates that the text uses more complex, multi-syllable, and long words than is typical for a PLS, which supports the need for simplification."
