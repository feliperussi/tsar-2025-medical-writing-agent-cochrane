  "draft": "# Can digital health tools, such as mobile apps or wearable devices, help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care?\n**Key Messages**\n- Digital health tools, such as mobile apps or wearable devices, may help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain of their effectiveness, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Digital interventions, when combined with conventional care, may have a small beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents, but the effect on other outcomes is unclear.\n- Future research should investigate the long-term benefits and potential harms of digital health tools for obesity management in children and teenagers, and explore how they can be used to support this population in a way that is tailored to their individual needs, including reporting results by age, gender, and race/ethnicity, and assessing other important outcomes, particularly adverse events.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?\nChildhood obesity is a worldwide public health problem that increases the risk of chronic diseases. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were living with overweight or obesity. This condition can lead to various health issues, including an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems later in life. Common treatments for childhood obesity often involve a combination of diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects and safety of digital health interventions, such as mobile phone applications, text messages, and telehealth, for the management of obesity in children and adolescents. They aimed to compare the effectiveness of these interventions when used alone or in combination with conventional care, and to evaluate their impact on various outcomes, including body mass index, physical activity, and mental well-being.\n**Methods**\nMethods\nWe searched for studies on digital health interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 15 studies that involved 911 participants with obesity. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including the USA, Sweden, Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland, and Thailand. Most studies involved participants aged 10 to 19 years old, with some also including younger children. The studies lasted for varying durations, with nine classified as short duration (less than six months) and six as long duration (six or more months). The interventions included digital health technologies such as wearable or implantable devices, web-based interventions, text messages, mobile phone or tablet applications, exergaming or active video gaming, and telehealth, often in combination with conventional care. Comparisons were made between digital health technology plus conventional care versus conventional care alone, and digital technology alone versus conventional care alone. No information was available on the funding sources of the studies. Digital interventions combined with conventional care may have a small beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents compared to conventional care alone. The effect on other outcome measures is unclear.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025.",

The subheadings 'Introduction', 'Methods', 'Limitations', and 'Currency' are not phrased as questions, which is a mandatory requirement of the Cochrane style guide. Additionally, the text contains noun-heavy sentences and uses passive voice, making it less direct and harder to read. There are also missing blank lines between headings and content, and between bullet points, which affects readability.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft text deviates from typical PLS patterns in several key areas. The 'nouns', 'smog_index', 'complex_words_dc', 'complex_words', and 'long_words' metrics are all in the P90 range, suggesting the text is more noun-heavy and uses more complex and longer words than typical PLS texts, contributing to a higher readability grade level (SMOG index). The 'passive_voice' metric is in the P75 range, indicating a higher-than-average use of passive constructions. While 61.1% of features are in the best quartile, 27.8% deviate significantly, warranting review."
