  "draft": "# Can digital health tools, such as mobile apps or wearable devices, help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care?\n**Key Messages**\n- Digital health tools, such as mobile apps or wearable devices, used with standard care may have a small, short-term beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents with obesity, but the effect on other outcomes like weight loss is unclear, and no harmful effects were reported in the studies.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong enough to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of digital health tools for obesity management in young people, partly because the studies were small and did not last very long.\n- Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of digital health tools, report results for different ages and groups of people, and look at important outcomes like adverse events, to help us better understand how these tools can be used to help children and teenagers with obesity.\n**Introduction**\n### What is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?\nChildhood obesity is a worldwide public health problem that increases the risk of chronic diseases. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were living with overweight or obesity. This condition can lead to various health issues, including an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems later in life. Common treatments for childhood obesity often involve a combination of diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects and safety of digital health interventions, such as mobile phone applications, text messages, and telehealth, for the management of obesity in children and adolescents. They aimed to compare the effectiveness of digital interventions combined with conventional care versus conventional care alone, as well as digital interventions alone compared to conventional care alone. The authors also wanted to evaluate the impact of digital interventions on various outcomes, including body mass index, physical activity, and mental well-being.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe searched for studies on digital health interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents.\n### Data Synthesis\nWe summarized their results.\n### Confidence Assessment\nWe rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 15 studies that involved 911 participants with obesity. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including the USA, Sweden, Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland, and Thailand. Most studies involved participants aged 10 to 19 years old, with some also including younger children. The studies lasted for varying durations, with nine classified as short duration (less than six months) and six as long duration (six or more months). The interventions included digital health technologies such as wearable or implantable devices, web-based interventions, text messages, mobile phone or tablet applications, exergaming or active video gaming, and telehealth, and were compared to conventional care alone or in combination with conventional care. No information was available on the funding sources of the studies. Digital interventions combined with conventional care may have a small beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents compared to conventional care alone. The effect on other outcome measures is unclear.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (potential lack of blinding), and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025.",

The main issue is that several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which directly violates the Master Style Guide. Additionally, the text contains overly long and noun-heavy sentences with complex vocabulary, making it difficult for a patient audience to understand. These issues are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows deviations in metrics such as nouns, complex words, and readability indices.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 38.9% of features in the best quartile and 33.3% in the median range. However, five features deviate significantly from typical patterns (P90 range), suggesting areas for improvement. Specifically, the text has a high count of nouns (189.0, P90), complex words (136.0, P90), long words (200.0, P90), and Dale-Chall unfamiliar words (245.0, P90). The SMOG index (14.70, P90) also indicates higher-than-typical reading difficulty. These deviations suggest the text is more complex and noun-heavy than typical PLS texts, which impacts readability."
