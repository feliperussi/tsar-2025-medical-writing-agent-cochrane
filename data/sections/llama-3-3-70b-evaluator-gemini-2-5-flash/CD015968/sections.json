  "key_messages": [
    "Digital health tools, such as mobile apps or wearable devices, may help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain of their effectiveness, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "Digital interventions, when combined with conventional care, may have a small beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents, but the effect on other outcomes is unclear.",
    "Future research should investigate the long-term benefits and potential harms of digital health tools for obesity management in children and teenagers, and explore how they can be used to support this population in a way that is tailored to their individual needs, including reporting results by age, gender, and race/ethnicity, and assessing other important outcomes, particularly adverse events."

      "subheading": "What is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Childhood obesity is a worldwide public health problem that increases the risk of chronic diseases. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were living with overweight or obesity. This condition can lead to various health issues, including an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems later in life. Common treatments for childhood obesity often involve a combination of diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects and safety of digital health interventions, such as mobile phone applications, text messages, and telehealth, for the management of obesity in children and adolescents. They aimed to compare the effectiveness of these interventions when used alone or in combination with conventional care, and to evaluate their impact on various outcomes, including body mass index, physical activity, and mental well-being."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 15 studies that involved 911 participants with obesity. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including the USA, Sweden, Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland, and Thailand. Most studies involved participants aged 10 to 19 years old, with some also including younger children. The studies lasted for varying durations, with nine classified as short duration (less than six months) and six as long duration (six or more months). The interventions included digital health technologies such as wearable or implantable devices, web-based interventions, text messages, mobile phone or tablet applications, exergaming or active video gaming, and telehealth, often in combination with conventional care. Comparisons were made between digital health technology plus conventional care versus conventional care alone, and digital technology alone versus conventional care alone. No information was available on the funding sources of the studies. Digital interventions combined with conventional care may have a small beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents compared to conventional care alone. The effect on other outcome measures is unclear."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (lack of blinding), and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to April 2025."
