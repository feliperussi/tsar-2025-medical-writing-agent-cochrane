  "draft": "Can digital health tools, such as mobile apps or wearable devices, help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care?\n\nKey messages:\n- Digital health tools may help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain of their effectiveness.\n- Digital interventions, when combined with standard care, may have a small beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents, but the effect on other outcomes is unclear.\n- Future research should investigate the long-term benefits and potential harms of digital health tools for obesity management in children and teenagers.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?\nChildhood obesity is a worldwide public health problem that increases the risk of chronic diseases. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were living with overweight or obesity. This condition can lead to various health issues, including an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems later in life.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to see if these digital tools worked better than standard care alone, or if using them with standard care was more helpful. We checked their effects on weight, activity levels, and mental well-being.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for high-quality studies that compared digital health tools to standard care. We then collected and analyzed the results from these studies to judge the strength of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 15 studies that involved 911 participants with obesity. The studies were conducted in several countries around the world, including the USA, Sweden, Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland, and Thailand. Most studies involved participants aged 10 to 19 years old, with some also including younger children. The studies lasted for varying durations, with nine classified as short duration and six as long duration.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants knew which treatment they received, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest. This knowledge could have influenced their behavior or their answers to researchers' questions, which can affect the results.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025.\n\nFuture research should investigate the long-term benefits and potential harms of digital health tools for obesity management in children and teenagers, and explore how they can be used to support this population in a way that is tailored to their individual needs, including reporting results by age, gender, and race/ethnicity, and assessing other important outcomes, particularly adverse events.",

There is a critical factual omission in the key messages: the summary must mention that no harmful effects were reported, as this is a key finding for patients and caregivers. Additionally, several sentences need to be revised for clarity and conciseness to improve readability. Specifically, the final paragraph contains a 59-word sentence that should be broken into several shorter ones, and the methods section could be more direct. Finally, the 'Future research' point is repeated in the key messages and the final paragraph, which is redundant.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating strong overall readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade: 11.16) and appropriate sentence structure (Words per sentence: 20.48). However, these strong overall scores mask a few specific problem areas, such as an overly long and complex sentence in the final section, which should be addressed to ensure clarity for all readers."
