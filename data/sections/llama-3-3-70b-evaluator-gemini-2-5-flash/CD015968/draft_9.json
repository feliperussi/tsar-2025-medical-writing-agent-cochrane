  "draft": "Can digital health tools, such as mobile apps or wearable devices, help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care?\n\n**Key messages**\n- When used with standard care (like diet and exercise advice), digital health tools may slightly reduce body fat in children and teenagers with obesity.\n- We are uncertain if these tools affect other things like physical activity or well-being.\n- The studies we found did not report on any harmful effects.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and why is it a problem? \nChildhood obesity is a worldwide public health problem that increases the risk of chronic diseases. In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were living with overweight or obesity. This condition can lead to various health issues, including an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems later in life. Treatment usually includes changes to diet and exercise, along with support to build healthy habits.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out if digital health tools (like mobile apps or text messages) are safe and effective for helping children and teenagers manage obesity. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of these interventions when used alone or in combination with conventional care, and to evaluate their impact on various outcomes, including body mass index, physical activity, and mental well-being.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use? \nWe searched for studies on digital health interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find? \nWe found 15 studies that involved 911 children and teenagers with obesity. The studies took place in several countries, including the USA and Sweden. Most participants were 10 to 19 years old. The studies lasted for different amounts of time; nine were shorter than 6 months and six were longer.\n\nThe studies looked at different types of digital tools. These included websites, mobile apps, text messages, and wearable devices like smartwatches. Some studies also used active video games or remote health services. We compared digital tools against standard care. Some studies tested digital tools combined with standard care, while others tested digital tools on their own.\n\nWe found that using digital tools alongside standard care may slightly reduce body fat. However, we are uncertain about their effects on other outcomes, like physical activity or well-being.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025.\n\nFuture research should look at the long-term benefits and possible harms of these digital tools. Studies also need to explore how to tailor support to individuals. For example, researchers should report results for different ages and ethnic groups, and measure any unwanted effects.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-organized. All critical checks passed. To make it even more accessible for readers, I recommend focusing on three key improvements.\n\n1. **Simplify the 'What did the review authors want to find out?' section.** The current wording is a bit technical and long.\n    *   **Instead of:** 'We aimed to compare the effectiveness of these interventions when used alone or in combination with conventional care, and to evaluate their impact on various outcomes, including body mass index, physical activity, and mental well-being.'\n    *   **Consider:** 'We wanted to see if these digital tools worked better than standard care alone, or if using them *with* standard care was more helpful. We checked their effects on weight, activity levels, and mental well-being.'\n\n2. **Make the 'Methods' section more descriptive.** The current sentence is very general and doesn't explain the process simply.\n    *   **Instead of:** 'We searched for studies on digital health interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents, summarized their results, and evaluated our confidence in the evidence.'\n    *   **Consider:** 'We searched for high-quality studies (called randomized controlled trials) that compared digital health tools to standard care. We then collected and analyzed the results from these studies to judge the strength of the evidence.'\n\n3. **Explain *why* a limitation matters.** Simply stating the limitation isn't as helpful as explaining its impact.\n    *   **Instead of:** '...participants may have known which treatment they received...'\n    *   **Consider:** '...participants knew which treatment they were getting (for example, if they were using an app or not). This knowledge could have influenced their behavior or their answers to researchers' questions, which can affect the results.'\n\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which noted a high number of words that may be unfamiliar to a general audience (Dale-Chall complex words: 216). Swapping terms like 'interventions', 'conventional care', and 'outcomes' for more common words will help address this.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft is well-structured and highly readable, with 83% of its linguistic features falling into the best quartile for plain language summaries. Sentence length and use of active voice are excellent. However, the analysis identified a high number of 'complex' words according to the Dale-Chall readability formula (216 words, placing it in the 90th percentile). This suggests that while the sentences are simple, the vocabulary could be more familiar to a general audience."
