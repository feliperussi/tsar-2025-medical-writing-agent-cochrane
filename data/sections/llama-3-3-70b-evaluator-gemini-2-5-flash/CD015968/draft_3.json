  "draft": "Can digital health tools, such as mobile apps or wearable devices, help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight when used with standard care?\n\n- We found that digital health tools used with standard care may have a small, short-term beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents with obesity. However, the effect on other outcomes like weight loss is unclear. The studies did not report on any potential harmful effects.\n- The quality of the evidence is not strong enough to fully understand the benefits and potential harms of digital health tools for obesity management in young people. This is partly because the studies were small and did not last very long.\n- We think future studies should investigate the long-term effects of digital health tools, report results for different ages and groups of people, and look at important outcomes like adverse events. This will help us better understand how these tools can be used to help children and teenagers with obesity.\n\nWhat is childhood obesity and why is it a problem?\nChildhood obesity is a worldwide public health problem that increases the risk of chronic diseases (long-term health issues). In 2016, more than 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were living with overweight or obesity. This condition can lead to various health issues, including an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems later in life. Common treatments for childhood obesity often involve a combination of diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if digital health tools are safe and effective for helping children and teenagers manage obesity. We looked at digital health interventions, such as mobile phone applications, text messages, and telehealth, and compared them to standard care alone or in combination with standard care. We also wanted to evaluate the impact of digital health tools on various outcomes, including body mass index (a measure of body fat), physical activity, and mental well-being.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies on digital health interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents. We looked at studies from around the world, including the USA, Sweden, Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland, and Thailand.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 15 studies that involved 911 participants with obesity. Most studies involved participants aged 10 to 19 years old, with some also including younger children. The studies lasted for varying durations, with 9 classified as short duration (less than 6 months) and 6 as long duration (6 or more months). Digital health tools combined with standard care may have a small beneficial effect on fat mass in children and adolescents compared to standard care alone. However, the effect on other outcome measures is unclear.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2025.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, a few revisions are needed to improve clarity and logical flow for the reader. Here are the top 3 improvements I recommend:\n\n1. **Explain the 'why' in the limitations.** The summary should explain why it's a problem if participants know which treatment they are receiving, as this context is crucial for a non-expert audience.\n    *   **Current text:** 'participants may have known which treatment they received'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Also, in some studies, participants knew which treatment they were getting. This can affect the results because people might change their behavior if they know they are receiving a new treatment.'\n\n2. **Improve the logical flow of the 'Methods' section.** The list of countries where studies were conducted is a finding, not a method. This information is already correctly placed in the 'Results' section, so it should be removed from the 'Methods' to avoid repetition and confusion.\n    *   **Current text:** 'We looked at studies from around the world, including the USA, Sweden, Canada, China, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland, and Thailand.'\n    *   **Suggested action:** Remove this sentence from the 'How did we search for evidence?' section.\n\n3. **Make the 'Aims' section more concise.** The paragraph explaining the review's aims is a bit long and can be shortened to be more direct and easier for readers to digest.\n    *   **Current text:** 'We wanted to find out if digital health tools are safe and effective for helping children and teenagers manage obesity. We looked at digital health interventions, such as mobile phone applications, text messages, and telehealth, and compared them to standard care alone or in combination with standard care. We also wanted to evaluate the impact of digital health tools on various outcomes, including body mass index (a measure of body fat), physical activity, and mental well-being.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We wanted to find out how safe and effective digital health tools (like mobile apps and telehealth) are for helping children and teenagers manage obesity. We compared these tools against standard care and looked at their effects on body mass index (a measure of body fat), physical activity, and mental well-being.'\n\nThese changes will make the summary even clearer and more helpful for readers.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to the statistical patterns of a typical Plain Language Summary. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges of the corpus. Readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 10.07) and sentence length (17.73 words/sentence) are excellent. The draft also makes good use of active voice and personal pronouns. The editorial feedback focuses on improving logical flow and adding context, which are nuances not fully captured by the metrics."
