  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a type of blood cancer)?\n\n- Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia probably helps people live longer without their cancer getting worse, but it may also cause more unwanted effects. We are not sure if it helps people live longer overall.\n- Different types of maintenance therapy had similar results: they helped stop the cancer from getting worse for a longer time, but they also caused more side effects. More research is needed to fully understand their long-term effects.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of maintenance therapy on health-related quality of life (how well or poorly people feel and function in their daily lives), and compare the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies, to help people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their healthcare providers make informed decisions about treatment.\n\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why is it a problem?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of leukaemia in adults and is currently incurable. CLL can cause a range of problems, including an increased risk of infections, anaemia (a condition where the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells), and bleeding. To treat CLL, doctors usually use chemotherapy (drugs that kill cancer cells), targeted therapy (drugs that attack specific cancer cells), or combine both treatments. However, as the disease progresses, the treatment becomes less effective, and the risk of complications increases. We need new and effective treatments to manage CLL.\n\nWhat are the current treatment options for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nThe current treatment options for CLL include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy (using the body's immune system to fight cancer). Maintenance therapy is another approach that involves giving treatment to prevent the disease from coming back after it has been controlled. This can include drugs such as monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that attaches to specific cells, including cancer cells), immunomodulatory agents (medicines that modify the immune system), and targeted therapies.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out the effects and safety of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. They looked at different types of maintenance therapy, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that attaches to specific cells, including cancer cells), immunomodulatory drugs (medicines that modify the immune system), and targeted therapies. They wanted to know whether these treatments can improve survival, reduce the risk of the disease coming back, and improve quality of life. They also wanted to know about the potential harms of these treatments, such as side effects and increased risk of infections.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing maintenance therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects and safety of these treatments.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 2393 people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The median age of participants was 54.1 to 71.7 years, and 59.5% were males. The studies compared different maintenance therapies, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, and anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies, with placebo (a dummy treatment) or observation (watching the patients without giving them any treatment). In these studies, researchers followed people for a typical period of 12 to 73 months to see what happened to them. We did not find any studies on some of the newer types of targeted drugs that can be taken as pills. Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia probably stops the cancer from getting worse for longer, but it may also cause more unwanted effects. It is unclear if maintenance therapy has an effect on overall survival (how long people live). For people with CLL, maintenance therapy may reduce the risk of disease progression, but it may also cause more unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. All the essential information is here, and the structure is correct. However, the summary needs revision to make it easier for patients and the public to understand. The main issues are the frequent use of technical terms and noun-heavy phrases, which make the text feel dense and academic. My top 3 recommendations are to simplify the language, use more direct verbs, and remove some repetitive sentences.\n\nHere are the most important improvements needed:\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Medical Terms and Reduce Jargon**\n\nSome sentences are packed with technical terms that can be overwhelming, even with definitions. Try to introduce complex ideas one at a time and use simpler language.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"The studies compared different maintenance therapies, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, and anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies, with placebo (a dummy treatment) or observation (watching the patients without giving them any treatment).\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This repeats long, technical drug names that are hard for a lay reader to remember or distinguish. The specific names like 'anti-CD20' are not essential for understanding the main message.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies compared different types of maintenance therapy (like monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs) with either a placebo (a dummy treatment) or observation (no active treatment).\"\n\n**2. Use More Direct, Action-Oriented Language**\n\nThe text often uses nouns where verbs would be clearer and more direct. This style, called 'nominalization', can make sentences feel abstract and harder to read.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"For people with CLL, maintenance therapy may reduce the risk of disease progression, but it may also cause more unwanted effects.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"reduce the risk of disease progression\" is abstract. Using a simple verb makes the meaning much clearer.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"For people with CLL, maintenance therapy may stop the disease from getting worse, but it may also cause more unwanted effects.\"\n\n**3. Remove Repetitive Sentences to Improve Flow**\n\nThe results section repeats the main finding three times in slightly different ways, which can make it feel confusing and unnecessarily long.\n\n- **Problematic sentences:** In the \"What did we find?\" section, these two sentences say nearly the same thing: \n  1. \"Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia probably stops the cancer from getting worse for longer, but it may also cause more unwanted effects.\"\n  2. \"For people with CLL, maintenance therapy may reduce the risk of disease progression, but it may also cause more unwanted effects.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** Repetition can make it harder for readers to follow the key message. Combining these points makes the findings section stronger and more concise.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** Combine the key findings into one clear summary, like this: \"We found that maintenance therapy probably helps people live longer without their cancer getting worse. However, it may also cause more unwanted side effects, and we are still not sure if it helps people live longer overall.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length (20.5 words) and readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade 12.0) are within the median range, there is a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary and style. Six key metrics are in the 'BEYOND_P90' range, indicating the text is much more complex than a typical PLS. The high scores for 'complex_words' (149), 'nominalization' (30), and 'nouns' (218) confirm that the draft relies heavily on technical terms and abstract, noun-based phrases, which reduces clarity for a lay audience."
