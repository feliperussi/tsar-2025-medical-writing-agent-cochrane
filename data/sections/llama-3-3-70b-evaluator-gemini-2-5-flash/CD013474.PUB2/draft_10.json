  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a type of blood cancer)?\n\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of leukaemia in adults and is currently incurable. CLL can cause problems like increased risk of infections, anaemia (a condition where the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells), and bleeding.\n\nWhat are the current treatment options for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nThe current treatment options for CLL include chemotherapy (drugs that kill cancer cells), targeted therapy (drugs that attack specific cancer cells), and immunotherapy (using the body's immune system to fight cancer). Maintenance therapy is another approach that involves giving treatment to prevent the disease from coming back after it has been controlled. This can include drugs such as monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that attaches to specific cells, including cancer cells), immunomodulatory agents (medicines that change how your immune system works), and targeted therapies.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing maintenance therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects and safety of these treatments.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. We looked at treatments like monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs to see if they helped people live longer, stopped the cancer from returning, and improved quality of life. We also looked for harms, like side effects and infections.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 2393 people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The median age of participants was 54.1 to 71.7 years, and 59.5% were males. The studies compared different maintenance therapies, including monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs, with either a placebo (a dummy treatment) or observation (no active treatment). Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may help people live longer without their cancer getting worse (this is known as 'progression-free survival'). However, we are not sure if it helps people live longer overall. It may also increase the risk of serious harmful effects from the treatment.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n- Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may help people live longer without their cancer getting worse (this is known as 'progression-free survival'). However, we are not sure if it helps people live longer overall. It may also increase the risk of serious harmful effects from the treatment.\n- The benefits and harms of different types of maintenance therapy, such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that attaches to specific cells, including cancer cells) and immunomodulatory drugs (medicines that change how your immune system works), vary, and more research is needed to understand their effects, especially in the long term.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of maintenance therapy on health-related quality of life (how well or poorly people feel and function in their daily lives), and compare the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies, to help people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their healthcare providers decide on the best treatment.\n\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported on the important effects we were looking for, such as side effects or quality of life. The evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

      "feedback": "All critical checks for completeness, accuracy, and length have passed. However, the draft is not approved because its vocabulary is significantly more complex than a typical Plain Language Summary. This makes it difficult for a lay audience to read and understand. The key areas for improvement are simplifying technical terms, using more direct verbs instead of noun phrases, and refining the key messages for clarity.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Vocabulary and Reduce Jargon**\n\nYour text has a high number of long, technical words that can be challenging for readers, even with definitions.\n\n*   **Problematic text:** \"This can include drugs such as monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that attaches to specific cells, including cancer cells), immunomodulatory agents (medicines that change how your immune system works), and targeted therapies.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This sentence is dense and introduces three complex concepts at once. \"Immunomodulatory agents\" is particularly difficult terminology.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"This can include drugs like monoclonal antibodies, which are proteins that target cancer cells. Other options are medicines that change how the immune system works (immunomodulatory agents) and targeted therapies.\"\n\n**2. Use More Direct Verbs (Reduce Nominalization)**\n\nThe draft often uses noun forms of verbs, which makes sentences longer and less direct. Changing these 'nominalizations' back into verbs will make the text clearer and more engaging.\n\n*   **Problematic text:** \"Maintenance therapy is another approach that involves giving treatment to prevent the disease from coming back after it has been controlled.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"involves giving treatment\" is indirect. Using a simple verb is stronger.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Maintenance therapy is treatment given after the cancer is under control, to stop it from returning.\"\n\n**3. Refine the 'Limitations' Section for Clarity**\n\nThe explanation of study limitations uses phrasing that might be unclear to a lay reader.\n\n*   **Problematic text:** \"...participants may have known which treatment they received...\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This is a slightly clunky way to explain the concept of 'blinding' in a trial. It can be stated more directly.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited because some studies were very small. In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which can affect the results. Also, not all studies reported on important outcomes like side effects or quality of life.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and use of active voice are good (P50-P75 range), the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics are in the 90th percentile, indicating the text is much denser than a typical PLS. These include 'nominalization' (27 instances vs. a median of <13), 'complex_words' (118 vs. <84), and 'long_words' (190 vs. <122). This data supports the editorial feedback to simplify word choices and use more direct verbs to improve readability for patients."
