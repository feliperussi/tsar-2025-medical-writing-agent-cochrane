  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a type of blood cancer)?\n\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of leukaemia in adults and is currently incurable. CLL can cause problems like increased risk of infections, anaemia (a condition where the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells), and bleeding.\n\nWhat are the current treatment options for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nThe current treatment options for CLL include chemotherapy (drugs that kill cancer cells), targeted therapy (drugs that attack specific cancer cells), and immunotherapy (using the body's immune system to fight cancer). Maintenance therapy is another approach that involves giving treatment to prevent the disease from coming back after it has been controlled. This can include drugs such as monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that attaches to specific cells, including cancer cells), immunomodulatory agents (medicines that change how your immune system works), and targeted therapies.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. We looked at treatments like monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs to see if they helped people live longer, stopped the cancer from returning, and improved quality of life. We also looked for harms, like side effects and infections.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 2393 people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The median age of participants was 54.1 to 71.7 years, and 59.5% were males. The studies compared different maintenance therapies, including monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs, with either a placebo (a dummy treatment) or observation (no active treatment). Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may stop the cancer from getting worse for longer. This is known as 'progression-free survival'. However, it is not clear if it helps people live longer overall. The therapy may also cause more harmful or unwanted side effects.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review?\n- Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may stop the cancer from getting worse for longer. However, its effects on overall survival (how long people live) are unclear, and it may increase unwanted effects such as serious adverse events (harmful or unwanted effects of treatment).\n- The benefits and harms of different types of maintenance therapy, such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that attaches to specific cells, including cancer cells) and immunomodulatory drugs (medicines that change how your immune system works), vary, and more research is needed to understand their effects, especially in the long term.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of maintenance therapy on health-related quality of life (how well or poorly people feel and function in their daily lives), and compare the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies, to help people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their healthcare providers make informed decisions about treatment.\n\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported on the important effects we were looking for, such as side effects or quality of life. The evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It clearly outlines the key trade-offs of maintenance therapy for CLL. However, it fails a critical check and has several clarity issues that need to be addressed to make it more accessible for patients and their families. My feedback focuses on the 3 most important improvements.\n\n**Critical Issue: Missing Methods Section**\nThe summary is missing a required section explaining how the review was conducted. Readers need to understand how you reached your conclusions. \n- **Suggestion:** Please add a new subheading, such as \"How did we conduct this review?\", and briefly explain that you searched for studies, summarized their results, and rated the evidence, as described in the source material.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed to improve clarity:\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Sentences and Use More Direct Verbs**\nThe draft often uses complex noun phrases where simple verbs would be clearer and more direct. This makes the text feel abstract and difficult to read.\n- **Example:** \"...to help people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their healthcare providers make informed decisions about treatment.\"\n- **Problem:** The phrase \"make informed decisions\" is a nominalization (a verb turned into a noun). It's less direct and wordier than using the verb itself.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...to help people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their healthcare providers decide on the best treatment.\"\n\n**2. Break Down Long Sentences with Multiple Ideas**\nSome sentences are very long and combine several different points (a benefit, a drawback, and a definition), which can be overwhelming for a reader.\n- **Example:** \"Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may stop the cancer from getting worse for longer. However, its effects on overall survival (how long people live) are unclear, and it may increase unwanted effects such as serious adverse events (harmful or unwanted effects of treatment).\"\n- **Problem:** This 38-word sentence packs in too much information at once, making it hard to digest.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Maintenance therapy may help people live longer without their cancer getting worse. However, we are not sure if it helps people live longer overall. It may also increase the risk of serious harmful effects from the treatment.\"\n\n**3. Define Technical Terms Clearly and Simply**\nWhile the summary defines some terms, the definitions can be improved for clarity. The definition for \"progression-free survival\" is a key example.\n- **Example:** \"Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may stop the cancer from getting worse for longer. This is known as 'progression-free survival'.\"\n- **Problem:** The definition feels disconnected and the phrasing \"stop the cancer from getting worse for longer\" is slightly awkward.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Maintenance therapy may help people live longer without their cancer getting worse (this is known as 'progression-free survival').\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows MODERATE CONFORMITY with typical PLS patterns. While the word count is good and several metrics fall within the median range, there is a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Six metrics fall into the P90 range, indicating the text is more complex than 90% of summaries in the reference corpus. Key areas for improvement are the high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), complex words (Dale-Chall), and long words, all of which contribute to a higher-than-ideal readability score (SMOG index and Dale-Chall)."
