  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a type of blood cancer)?\n\n- Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia probably helps people live longer without their cancer getting worse, but it may also cause more unwanted effects. We are not sure if it helps people live longer overall.\n- Different types of maintenance therapy had similar results: they helped stop the cancer from getting worse for a longer time, but they also caused more side effects. More research is needed to fully understand their long-term effects.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of maintenance therapy on health-related quality of life (how well or poorly people feel and function in their daily lives), and compare the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies, to help people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their healthcare providers make informed decisions about treatment.\n\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why is it a problem?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of leukaemia in adults and is currently incurable. CLL can cause a range of problems, including an increased risk of infections, anaemia (a condition where the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells), and bleeding. To treat CLL, doctors usually use chemotherapy (drugs that kill cancer cells), targeted therapy (drugs that attack specific cancer cells), or combine both treatments. However, as the disease progresses, the treatment becomes less effective, and the risk of complications increases. We need new and effective treatments to manage CLL.\n\nWhat are the current treatment options for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nThe current treatment options for CLL include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy (using the body's immune system to fight cancer). Maintenance therapy is another approach that involves giving treatment to prevent the disease from coming back after it has been controlled. This can include drugs such as monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that attaches to specific cells, including cancer cells), immunomodulatory agents (medicines that modify the immune system), and targeted therapies.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out the effects and safety of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. They looked at different types of maintenance therapy, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that attaches to specific cells, including cancer cells), immunomodulatory drugs (medicines that modify the immune system), and targeted therapies. They wanted to know whether these treatments can improve survival, reduce the risk of the disease coming back, and improve quality of life. They also wanted to know about the potential harms of these treatments, such as side effects and increased risk of infections.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing maintenance therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects and safety of these treatments.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 2393 people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The median age of participants was 54.1 to 71.7 years, and 59.5% were males. The studies compared different maintenance therapies, including monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs, with either a placebo (a dummy treatment) or observation (no active treatment). In these studies, researchers followed people for a typical period of 12 to 73 months to see what happened to them. We did not find any studies on some of the newer types of targeted drugs that can be taken as pills. Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia probably stops the cancer from getting worse for longer, but it may also cause more unwanted effects. It is unclear if maintenance therapy has an effect on overall survival (how long people live). For people with CLL, maintenance therapy may reduce the risk of disease progression, but it may also cause more unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.\n\nKey messages:\n- Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may improve progression-free survival (the length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse), but its effects on overall survival (how long people live) are unclear, and it may increase unwanted effects such as serious adverse events (harmful or unwanted effects of treatment).\n- The benefits and harms of different types of maintenance therapy, such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs, vary, and more research is needed to understand their effects, especially in the long term.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of maintenance therapy on health-related quality of life, and compare the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies, to help people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their healthcare providers make informed decisions about treatment.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs several revisions to meet Cochrane standards for clarity and conciseness. The summary is currently over the 850-word limit and has some structural issues. The main areas for improvement are reducing complexity and redundancy. The language is often noun-heavy and uses long, multi-syllable words, making it difficult for a lay audience to understand. Below are the top 4 improvements needed to make this summary clearer and more accessible for patients.\n\n**1. Remove Redundant 'Key Messages' and Fix Subheading**\nThe summary presents the key findings twice: once in a bulleted list at the very top and again in a 'Key messages' section at the end. This is confusing and contributes to the high word count.\n- **Action:** Delete the entire three-bullet list from the beginning of the document. The final section is sufficient.\n- **Action:** Change the final subheading to be a question, as required by the style guide. \n- **Instead of:** `Key messages:`\n- **Use:** `What are the key messages of this review?`\n\n**2. Simplify Noun-Heavy and Complex Sentences**\nMany sentences rely on complex noun phrases instead of simple, direct verbs. This makes the text dense and hard to follow. This is supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows very high rates of nominalization (using nouns instead of verbs) and overall noun count.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Future studies should investigate the effects of maintenance therapy on health-related quality of life... to help people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their healthcare providers make informed decisions about treatment.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This 49-word sentence is long and uses abstract phrases like \"investigate the effects of\" and \"make informed decisions.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future studies should find out how maintenance therapy affects quality of life. They should also compare the benefits and harms of different treatments. This will help people with CLL and their doctors decide on the best care.\"\n\n**3. Clarify In-Sentence Definitions**\nThe definitions for technical terms are often long and embedded within already complex sentences, which hinders understanding.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may improve progression-free survival (the length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse), but its effects on overall survival (how long people live) are unclear...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The 21-word definition for 'progression-free survival' makes the main point of the sentence very difficult to follow.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Maintenance therapy may help people live longer without their cancer getting worse (this is called 'progression-free survival'). However, we are not sure if it helps people live longer overall.\"\n\n**4. Increase Conciseness to Reduce Word Count**\nThe text is over the word limit. Several paragraphs can be shortened by removing repetition and wordy phrases.\n- **Problematic paragraph:** \"The review authors wanted to find out the effects and safety of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. They looked at different types of maintenance therapy... They wanted to know whether these treatments can improve survival, reduce the risk of the disease coming back, and improve quality of life. They also wanted to know about the potential harms of these treatments, such as side effects and increased risk of infections.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This 98-word paragraph is repetitive. It states the aim (\"effects and safety\") and then lists those same effects and harms.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. We looked at treatments like monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs to see if they helped people live longer, stopped the cancer from returning, and improved quality of life. We also looked for harms, like side effects and infections.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While about two-thirds of the metrics fall within the typical or median ranges, a significant number (6 out of 18) deviate substantially from the norm (BEYOND_P90). These deviations are all related to vocabulary and sentence complexity, including very high counts of nouns, nominalizations, complex words (3+ syllables), and long words (7+ characters). This results in high complexity scores on readability indices like the SMOG index, indicating the text is likely too difficult for a general audience."
