It is the most common type of leukaemia in adults and is currently incurable. CLL can cause a range of problems, including an increased risk of infections, anaemia, and bleeding. Treatment for CLL usually involves chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of both. However, as the disease progresses, the treatment becomes less effective, and the risk of complications increases. Therefore, there is a need for new and effective treatments to manage CLL.\n### What are the current treatment options for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nThe current treatment options for CLL include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Chemotherapy involves using drugs to kill cancer cells, while targeted therapy uses drugs that specifically target cancer cells. Immunotherapy uses the body's immune system to fight cancer. Maintenance therapy is another approach that involves giving treatment to prevent the disease from coming back after it has been controlled. This can include drugs such as monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory agents, and targeted therapies.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out the effects and safety of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. They looked at different types of maintenance therapy, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, and targeted therapies. They wanted to know whether these treatments can improve survival, reduce the risk of the disease coming back, and improve quality of life. They also wanted to know about the potential harms of these treatments, such as side effects and increased risk of infections.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing maintenance therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects and safety of these treatments.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 2393 people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The median age of participants was 54.1 to 71.7 years, and 59.5% were males. The studies compared different maintenance therapies, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, and anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies, with placebo or observation. The median follow-up duration was 12.4 to 73 months. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not reported. We did not find any studies on novel small molecular inhibitors. Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia probably improves progression-free survival, but may increase adverse events. It is unclear if maintenance therapy has an effect on overall survival. For people with CLL, maintenance therapy may reduce the risk of disease progression, but may also cause more unwanted effects.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (potential lack of blinding), and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022 of search.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows moderate conformity with PLS patterns. While word count, active voice, and pronoun usage are within typical ranges (P75 or P50), several key readability and vocabulary complexity metrics deviate significantly. Specifically, `nominalization` (32.0), `nouns` (224.0), `smog_index` (15.96), `complex_words_dc` (331.0), `complex_words` (164.0), and `long_words` (253.0) are all in the P90 or BEYOND_P90 range, indicating the text is too complex, noun-heavy, and uses too many long and unfamiliar words for a plain language summary. The `dale_chall_readability` (8.19) also falls into the P90 range, further highlighting vocabulary challenges. Addressing the suggested improvements will help bring these metrics closer to typical PLS ranges."
