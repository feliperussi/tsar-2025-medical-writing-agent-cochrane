  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a type of blood cancer)?\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of leukaemia in adults and is currently incurable. CLL can cause a range of problems, including an increased risk of infections, anaemia (a condition where the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells), and bleeding. \n\nThe current treatment options for CLL include chemotherapy (drugs that kill cancer cells), targeted therapy (drugs that attack specific cancer cells), and immunotherapy (using the body's immune system to fight cancer). Maintenance therapy is another approach that involves giving treatment to prevent the disease from coming back after it has been controlled. This can include drugs such as monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that attaches to specific cells, including cancer cells), immunomodulatory agents (medicines that modify the immune system), and targeted therapies.\n\nWe wanted to find out the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. We looked at treatments like monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs to see if they helped people live longer, stopped the cancer from returning, and improved quality of life. We also looked for harms, like side effects and infections.\n\nWe searched for studies comparing maintenance therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects and safety of these treatments. We found 11 studies that involved 2393 people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The median age of participants was 54.1 to 71.7 years, and 59.5% were males. The studies compared different maintenance therapies, including monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs, with either a placebo (a dummy treatment) or observation (no active treatment). \n\nMaintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia probably stops the cancer from getting worse for longer, but it may also cause more unwanted effects. It is unclear if maintenance therapy has an effect on overall survival (how long people live). For people with CLL, maintenance therapy may reduce the risk of disease progression, but it may also cause more unwanted effects.\n\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest. The evidence is up to date to January 2022.\n\nWhat are the key messages of this review? \n- Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may improve progression-free survival (the length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse), but its effects on overall survival (how long people live) are unclear, and it may increase unwanted effects such as serious adverse events (harmful or unwanted effects of treatment).\n- The benefits and harms of different types of maintenance therapy, such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory drugs, vary, and more research is needed to understand their effects, especially in the long term.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of maintenance therapy on health-related quality of life (how well or poorly people feel and function in their daily lives), and compare the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies, to help people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their healthcare providers make informed decisions about treatment.",

      "feedback": "The draft is not approved. It fails a critical check because it is missing the required question-based subheadings, which makes the text difficult to navigate. Additionally, the summary's readability is significantly impaired by very long sentences and repetitive phrasing. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the summary is clear and helpful for patients.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add required subheadings to structure the text.** The summary is currently a long piece of text without clear signposts for the reader. Adding question-based subheadings, as required by the style guide, will break up the content and make it much easier to follow.\n   - **Example:** Instead of having three long paragraphs at the start, structure them under headings like:\n     - *What is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?*\n     - *What are the current treatment options?*\n     - *What did we want to find out?*\n\n2. **Break down long, complex sentences.** Several sentences combine multiple ideas, definitions, and results, making them very difficult to understand. Aim for one main idea per sentence.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may improve progression-free survival (the length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse), but its effects on overall survival (how long people live) are unclear, and it may increase unwanted effects such as serious adverse events (harmful or unwanted effects of treatment).\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Maintenance therapy may stop the cancer from getting worse for a longer time. (This is called 'progression-free survival'). However, it is not clear if it helps people live longer overall. The therapy may also cause more harmful or unwanted side effects.\"\n\n3. **Remove repetitive statements.** The results section states the main finding twice in a row, which can confuse the reader.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia probably stops the cancer from getting worse for longer, but it may also cause more unwanted effects. It is unclear if maintenance therapy has an effect on overall survival (how long people live). For people with CLL, maintenance therapy may reduce the risk of disease progression, but it may also cause more unwanted effects.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** Remove the final sentence entirely, as it repeats the information from the first sentence. The key findings should be stated clearly once in the results section and summarized in the key messages.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows significant deviation from typical PLS patterns, with 13 out of 18 metrics falling into the P90 range or beyond. This confirms the editorial review. The 'words_per_sentence' metric is very high (27.24, P90), directly reflecting the issue with overly long sentences. Furthermore, the 'nominalization' count is exceptionally high (28.0, BEYOND_P90), indicating a pattern of using complex noun forms instead of simpler verbs, which contributes to the text's difficulty. Nearly all readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, SMOG) are in the P90 range, signaling that the text is much harder to read than a typical Plain Language Summary."
