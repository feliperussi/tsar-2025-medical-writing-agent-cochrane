  "key_messages": [
    "Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a type of blood cancer) may improve progression-free survival (the length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse), but its effects on overall survival (how long people live) are unclear, and it may increase unwanted effects such as serious adverse events (harmful or unwanted effects of treatment).",
    "The benefits and harms of different types of maintenance therapy, such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that attaches to specific cells, including cancer cells) and immunomodulatory drugs (medicines that modify the immune system), vary, and more research is needed to understand their effects, especially in the long term.",
    "Future studies should investigate the effects of maintenance therapy on health-related quality of life (how well or poorly people feel and function in their daily lives), and compare the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies, to help people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their healthcare providers make informed decisions about treatment."

      "subheading": "What is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of leukaemia in adults and is currently incurable. CLL can cause a range of problems, including an increased risk of infections, anaemia, and bleeding. Treatment for CLL usually involves chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of both. However, as the disease progresses, the treatment becomes less effective, and the risk of complications increases. Therefore, there is a need for new and effective treatments to manage CLL."

      "subheading": "What are the current treatment options for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?",
      "content": "The current treatment options for CLL include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Chemotherapy involves using drugs to kill cancer cells, while targeted therapy uses drugs that specifically target cancer cells. Immunotherapy uses the body's immune system to fight cancer. Maintenance therapy is another approach that involves giving treatment to prevent the disease from coming back after it has been controlled. This can include drugs such as monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory agents, and targeted therapies."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out the effects and safety of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. They looked at different types of maintenance therapy, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, and targeted therapies. They wanted to know whether these treatments can improve survival, reduce the risk of the disease coming back, and improve quality of life. They also wanted to know about the potential harms of these treatments, such as side effects and increased risk of infections."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 11 studies that involved 2393 people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The median age of participants was 54.1 to 71.7 years, and 59.5% were males. The studies compared different maintenance therapies, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, and anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies, with placebo or observation. The median follow-up duration was 12.4 to 73 months. The studies were conducted in various countries, but the specific settings were not reported. We did not find any studies on novel small molecular inhibitors. Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia probably improves progression-free survival, but may increase adverse events. It is unclear if maintenance therapy has an effect on overall survival. For people with CLL, maintenance therapy may reduce the risk of disease progression, but may also cause more unwanted effects."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (potential lack of blinding), and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2022 of search."
