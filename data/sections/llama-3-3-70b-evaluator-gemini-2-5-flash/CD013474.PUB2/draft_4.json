  "draft": "What are the benefits and harms of maintenance therapy (treatment to prevent cancer from coming back) for people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (a type of blood cancer)?\n\n- Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia probably stops the cancer from getting worse for longer, but it may also cause more unwanted effects. We are not sure if it helps people live longer overall.\n- Different types of maintenance therapy had similar results: they helped stop the cancer from getting worse for a longer time, but they also caused more side effects. More research is needed to fully understand their long-term effects.\n- Future studies should investigate the effects of maintenance therapy on health-related quality of life (how well or poorly people feel and function in their daily lives), and compare the benefits and harms of different maintenance therapies, to help people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their healthcare providers make informed decisions about treatment.\n\nWhat is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and why is it a problem?\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of leukaemia in adults and is currently incurable. CLL can cause a range of problems, including an increased risk of infections, anaemia (a condition where the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells), and bleeding. To treat CLL, doctors usually use chemotherapy (drugs that kill cancer cells), targeted therapy (drugs that attack specific cancer cells), or combine both treatments. However, as the disease progresses, the treatment becomes less effective, and the risk of complications increases. We need new and effective treatments to manage CLL.\n\nWhat are the current treatment options for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?\nThe current treatment options for CLL include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy (using the body's immune system to fight cancer). Maintenance therapy is another approach that involves giving treatment to prevent the disease from coming back after it has been controlled. This can include drugs such as monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that attaches to specific cells, including cancer cells), immunomodulatory agents (medicines that modify the immune system), and targeted therapies.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to find out the effects and safety of maintenance therapy for people with CLL. They looked at different types of maintenance therapy, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (a type of protein that attaches to specific cells, including cancer cells), immunomodulatory drugs (medicines that modify the immune system), and targeted therapies. They wanted to know whether these treatments can improve survival, reduce the risk of the disease coming back, and improve quality of life. They also wanted to know about the potential harms of these treatments, such as side effects and increased risk of infections.\n\nHow did we do the review?\nWe searched for studies comparing maintenance therapies for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess the effects and safety of these treatments.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 11 studies that involved 2393 people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The median age of participants was 54.1 to 71.7 years, and 59.5% were males. The studies compared different maintenance therapies, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory drugs, and anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies, with placebo (a dummy treatment) or observation (watching the patients without giving them any treatment). In these studies, researchers followed people for a typical period of 12 to 73 months to see what happened to them. We did not find any studies on novel small molecular inhibitors. Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia probably improves progression-free survival (the length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse), but may increase unwanted effects. It is unclear if maintenance therapy has an effect on overall survival (how long people live). For people with CLL, maintenance therapy may reduce the risk of disease progression, but may also cause more unwanted effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received, and not all studies reported data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

However, it needs significant revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. The language is often too technical and abstract, making it difficult to understand the key findings. The evaluation metrics confirm this, showing that the text uses far more complex words, long words, and abstract nouns than a typical Plain Language Summary.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns with active verbs.** The text often uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which makes sentences feel static and academic. Using direct verbs makes the text easier to read and understand.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"For people with CLL, maintenance therapy may reduce the risk of disease progression, but may also cause more unwanted effects.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"disease progression\" is abstract. It's clearer to describe what is actually happening.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"For people with CLL, maintenance therapy may stop the disease from getting worse, but it may also cause more unwanted effects.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex terminology and define key outcomes more clearly. The summary includes technical terms that will be unfamiliar to most readers. While some are defined, the sheer number of them can be overwhelming, and key outcomes should be explained in the simplest possible terms.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Maintenance therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia probably improves progression-free survival (the length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse), but may increase unwanted effects.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The technical term \"progression-free survival\" is used, followed by a long definition. The key messages use a much simpler phrase, which should be used here as well for consistency and clarity.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Maintenance therapy probably helps people live longer without their cancer getting worse, but it may also cause more unwanted effects.\"\n\n3. **Explain or remove undefined technical jargon.** Some technical terms are introduced without any explanation, which will confuse readers.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We did not find any studies on novel small molecular inhibitors.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Novel small molecular inhibitors\" is undefined jargon. Readers won't know what this means or why it's relevant.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We did not find any studies on some of the newer types of targeted drugs that can be taken as pills.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While sentence length and voice are within the median range (P50), there is significant deviation in vocabulary and word choice. Six key metrics are in the 'BEYOND_P90' category, indicating the text is substantially more complex than a typical PLS. These include high counts of nominalizations (31.0), nouns (221.0), complex words (153.0), and long words (237.0), which result in a high SMOG index (15.5). This suggests the summary would be difficult for a lay audience to read and understand."
