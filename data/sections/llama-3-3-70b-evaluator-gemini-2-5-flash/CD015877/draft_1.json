  "draft": "# Can personalized nutrition plans (tailored diets based on individual characteristics such as genetics, eating habits, and health status) help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health compared to standard one-size-fits-all diets?\n**Key Messages**\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether personalized nutrition plans (tailored diets based on individual characteristics such as genetics, eating habits, and health status) are better than standard one-size-fits-all diets for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health, and no harmful effects were reported.\n- Due to the limited number of studies and participants, it is unclear if precision nutrition-based interventions have any benefits or harms for children and adolescents with obesity, highlighting the need for more research in this area.\n- Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies that report participant outcome data, including physical and mental well-being, and that explore the effects of precision nutrition-based interventions in different age groups and populations, to provide clearer answers to this question.\n**Introduction**\n### What is obesity in children and adolescents, and why is it a problem?\nObesity in children and adolescents is a serious health condition where a young person has an excessive amount of body fat. It's a problem because it can lead to various health issues, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health problems. Common treatments for obesity in children and adolescents often focus on lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. However, these 'one-size-fits-all' approaches may not be effective for everyone, as people's responses to the same diet can vary greatly due to factors like genetics, dietary habits, and physical activity.\n### What are precision nutrition-based interventions, and how might they help?\nPrecision nutrition-based interventions involve tailored approaches that take into account individual characteristics, such as genetics, dietary habits, and physical activity, to develop personalized diet recommendations. These interventions aim to address the unique needs of each child or adolescent, which may lead to more effective weight management and improved overall health. Precision nutrition-based interventions can include the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning methods, and other technologies to provide personalized support.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to examine the impact of precision nutrition-based interventions on the management of obesity in children and adolescents. They aimed to investigate whether these tailored approaches are more effective than traditional 'one-size-fits-all' interventions in improving physical and mental well-being, reducing obesity-associated disability, and promoting healthy weight change. The authors also sought to identify the most effective methods for delivering precision nutrition-based interventions and to determine the potential benefits and harms of these approaches.\n**Methods**\n### Search Strategy\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies evaluating precision nutrition‑based interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents.\n### Study Selection and Data Extraction\nTwo independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, then extracted data on participant characteristics, intervention details, outcomes, and study design.\n### Meta‑analysis\nWhen feasible, effect sizes were pooled using random‑effects models, and heterogeneity was quantified with the I² statistic.\n### Confidence in Evidence\nThe GRADE framework was applied to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 105 participants with overweight or obesity. The studies were conducted in Ukraine and Greece. Most studies lasted for an unspecified duration. One study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding. The population characteristics included children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years with overweight or obesity. The types of interventions and comparisons included precision nutrition-based interventions compared to one-size-fits-all interventions or standard of care. Precision nutrition-based interventions may have little to no effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents, but the results are very uncertain.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not provide data on all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",
