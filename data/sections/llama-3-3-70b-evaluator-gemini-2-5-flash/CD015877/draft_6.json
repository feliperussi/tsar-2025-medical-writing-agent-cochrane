  "draft": "Can personalized nutrition plans help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health compared to standard one-size-fits-all diets? We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether personalized nutrition plans are better than standard one-size-fits-all diets for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health. The studies did not report any harmful effects. Because we found only two small studies, it is still unclear if these personal diet plans have any benefits or harms. More research is needed. Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies that report participant outcome data, including physical and mental well-being, and that explore the effects of precision nutrition-based interventions in different age groups and populations, to provide clearer answers to this question.\n\nWhat is obesity in children and adolescents, and why is it a problem? Obesity in children and adolescents is a serious health condition where a young person has an excessive amount of body fat. It’s a problem because it can lead to various health issues, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health problems. Common treatments for obesity in children and adolescents often focus on lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. However, these ‘one-size-fits-all’ approaches may not be effective for everyone, as people’s responses to the same diet can vary greatly due to factors like genetics, dietary habits, and physical activity.\n\nWhat are precision nutrition-based interventions, and how might they help? Precision nutrition-based interventions involve creating a personal diet plan for someone, taking into account their genetics, eating habits, and how active they are. These interventions aim to address the unique needs of each child or adolescent, which may lead to more effective weight management and improved overall health. These personal plans can be created using technology like artificial intelligence to give tailored support.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? We wanted to know if these personal diet plans work better than the usual ‘one-size-fits-all’ diets. We looked for improvements in physical and mental health, and whether the plans helped children and teenagers manage their weight in a healthy way.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence? We searched online medical databases for studies that tested personal diet plans for children and teenagers with obesity.\n\nHow did the review authors select and analyze the studies? Two of our researchers worked separately to find and check all the relevant studies. For each study, they noted who the participants were, what kind of personal diet plan was tested, and what results were measured.\n\nWhat did the review authors find? We found 2 studies that involved 105 participants with overweight or obesity. The studies were conducted in Ukraine and Greece. Most studies lasted for an unspecified duration. One study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding. Precision nutrition-based interventions may have little to no effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents, but the results are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? The evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not provide data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? The evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of overly complex, noun-heavy sentences and some wordy phrasing that makes key messages difficult to understand. The following 3 improvements will significantly enhance readability.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed\n\n**1. Simplify the Key Messages and Call for Research**\n\nThe final sentence of your key messages section is very long and uses academic language that a patient may not understand.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies that report participant outcome data, including physical and mental well-being, and that explore the effects of precision nutrition-based interventions in different age groups and populations, to provide clearer answers to this question.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This 46-word sentence is packed with complex terms like 'participant outcome data' and 'precision nutrition-based interventions'. It reduces the clarity of an otherwise straightforward summary.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"More high-quality research is needed. Future studies should include people of different ages and report on their physical and mental well-being.\"\n\n**2. Replace Wordy and Vague Phrases**\n\nSome phrases are unnecessarily complex or vague, which can confuse the reader.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"Most studies lasted for an unspecified duration.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrase is confusing. It's unclear if the information was missing or if the studies truly had no set length. This detail is not in the original abstract's main results and adds confusion rather than clarity.\n- **Suggested Action:** Remove this sentence. It does not add essential information for the reader.\n\n**3. Use More Direct, Active Language in the Methods**\n\nThe description of how studies were analyzed could be more direct and active, as recommended by the style guide.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"...what kind of personal diet plan was tested, and what results were measured.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"what results were measured\" is in the passive voice. Using the active voice makes it clearer who is doing the action.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"For each study, they noted who the participants were, what kind of personal diet plan was tested, and what health outcomes the studies measured.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows that while the draft has excellent sentence-level readability (e.g., words_per_sentence and Flesch-Kincaid grade are in the best quartile), it deviates from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. The metrics for 'nouns' (P90), 'complex_words_dc' (P90), and 'long_words' (P90) are all higher than usual. This indicates that while sentences are short, they are filled with too many long, complex, and often abstract nouns, which supports the editorial feedback to simplify word choices and reduce noun-heavy phrasing."
