  "draft": "Can personalized nutrition plans help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health compared to standard one-size-fits-all diets? \nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether personalized nutrition plans are better than standard one-size-fits-all diets for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health. \nThe studies did not report any harmful effects. \nDue to the limited number of studies and participants, it is unclear if precision nutrition-based interventions have any benefits or harms for children and adolescents with obesity. \nFuture research should focus on conducting well-designed studies that report participant outcome data, including physical and mental well-being, and explore the effects of precision nutrition-based interventions in different age groups and populations.\n\nWhat is obesity in children and adolescents, and why is it a problem? \nObesity in children and adolescents is a serious health condition where a young person has an excessive amount of body fat. \nIt's a problem because it can lead to various health issues, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health problems. \nCommon treatments for obesity in children and adolescents often focus on lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. \nHowever, these 'one-size-fits-all' approaches may not be effective for everyone, as people's responses to the same diet can vary greatly due to factors like genetics, dietary habits, and physical activity.\n\nWhat are precision nutrition-based interventions, and how might they help? \nPrecision nutrition-based interventions involve tailored approaches that take into account individual characteristics, such as genetics, dietary habits, and physical activity, to develop personalized diet recommendations. \nThese interventions aim to address the unique needs of each child or adolescent, which may lead to more effective weight management and improved overall health. \nPrecision nutrition-based interventions might use artificial intelligence or other technologies to create recommendations.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nThe review authors wanted to examine the impact of precision nutrition-based interventions on the management of obesity in children and adolescents. \nThey aimed to investigate whether these tailored approaches are more effective than traditional 'one-size-fits-all' interventions in improving physical and mental well-being, reducing obesity-associated disability, and promoting healthy weight change. \nThe authors also sought to identify the most effective methods for delivering precision nutrition-based interventions and to determine the potential benefits and harms of these approaches.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence? \nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies evaluating precision nutrition-based interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents.\n\nHow did the review authors select and analyze the studies? \nTwo independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, then extracted data on participant characteristics, intervention details, outcomes, and study design.\n\nWhat did the review authors find? \nWe found 2 studies that involved 105 participants with overweight or obesity. \nThe studies were conducted in Ukraine and Greece. \nMost studies lasted for an unspecified duration. \nOne study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding. \nThe studies included children and teenagers from 0 to 19 years old who had overweight or obesity. \nThe types of interventions and comparisons included precision nutrition-based interventions compared to one-size-fits-all interventions or standard of care. \nPrecision nutrition-based interventions may have little to no effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents, but the results are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not provide data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a solid draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, the language is often too technical and academic for a general audience. To improve clarity for patients and the public, I recommend focusing on the following 3 areas:\\n\\n1. **Simplify complex, noun-heavy sentences.** Many sentences are packed with abstract nouns and jargon, making them dense and difficult to read. Try using more direct verbs and everyday words.\\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \\\"Precision nutrition-based interventions involve tailored approaches that take into account individual characteristics, such as genetics, dietary habits, and physical activity, to develop personalized diet recommendations.\\\"\\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \\\"Precision nutrition means creating a personal diet plan for someone. To do this, experts look at a person's genetics, eating habits, and how active they are.\\\"\\n\\n2. **Use active voice to make the text more direct.** Some sentences use a passive, academic style that can be confusing. Rewriting in the active voice makes it clearer who is doing what.\\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \\\"The types of interventions and comparisons included precision nutrition-based interventions compared to one-size-fits-all interventions or standard of care.\\\"\\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \\\"The studies compared personal diet plans against 'one-size-fits-all' diets or the usual care.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Explain the 'why' behind the methods.** The methods section describes the technical steps but doesn't explain why they are important to a lay reader. Focusing on the purpose makes the information more meaningful.\\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \\\"Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, then extracted data on participant characteristics, intervention details, outcomes, and study design.\\\"\\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \\\"Two of our researchers worked separately to find and check all the relevant studies. This process helps ensure our findings are accurate and reliable.\\\"\\n\\nMaking these changes will help address the patterns identified in the linguistic analysis, which showed the draft has a high number of complex words, nouns, and passive sentences compared to a typical Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While sentence length and pronoun use are good (P25 and P75 respectively), the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity and structure. Metrics for complex words (smog_index, complex_words, long_words), noun usage (nouns, nominalization), and passive voice are all in the P90 or 'Beyond P90' range. This indicates the language is more technical and less direct than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, which could create barriers for a general audience."
