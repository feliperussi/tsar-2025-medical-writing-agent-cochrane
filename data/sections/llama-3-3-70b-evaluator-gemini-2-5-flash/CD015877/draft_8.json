  "draft": "What is the issue?\nObesity in children and adolescents is a serious health condition where a young person has an excessive amount of body fat. It's a problem because it can lead to various health issues, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health problems. Common treatments for obesity in children and adolescents often focus on lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. However, these 'one-size-fits-all' approaches may not be effective for everyone, as people's responses to the same diet can vary greatly due to factors like genetics, dietary habits, and physical activity.\n\nWhy did we do this Cochrane Review?\nWe wanted to know if personalized nutrition plans, which are tailored to an individual's characteristics such as genetics, eating habits, and health status, can help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health compared to standard one-size-fits-all diets. Precision nutrition-based interventions involve creating a personal diet plan for someone, taking into account their genetics, eating habits, and how active they are. These interventions aim to address the unique needs of each child or adolescent, which may lead to more effective weight management and improved overall health.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 105 participants with overweight or obesity. The studies were conducted in Ukraine and Greece. One study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding. The two small studies we found did not provide enough evidence to know if personalized nutrition plans affect weight or body mass index (BMI) in children and teenagers. We did not find any harmful effects.\n\nHow certain is the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not provide data on all outcomes of interest. Precision nutrition-based interventions may have little to no effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents, but the results are very uncertain.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024. Future research should focus on conducting well-designed studies that report participant outcome data, including physical and mental well-being, and that explore the effects of precision nutrition-based interventions in different age groups and populations, to provide clearer answers to this question.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved because it is missing two critical components: a main title and a 'Key Messages' section. These must be added for the summary to be complete. Additionally, several areas need revision for clarity. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add the Missing Title and Key Messages:** The summary must begin with a main title phrased as a question and a 'Key Messages' section. Please add the title from the source material ('Can personalized nutrition plans...?') and create a bulleted 'Key Messages' section at the top to give readers the main takeaways immediately.\n\n2. **Clarify the Statement on Evidence Certainty:** The current phrasing about the evidence is confusing because it seems to state a finding ('little to no effect') and then immediately say it's uncertain. The main point is the uncertainty itself.\n    *   **Current text:** 'Precision nutrition-based interventions may have little to no effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents, but the results are very uncertain.'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'The evidence from these small studies is very uncertain. This means we don't know if personalized nutrition has an effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents.'\n\n3. **State the Main Finding First:** The results paragraph mixes study details with the main finding, which can bury the most important information for the reader.\n    *   **Current text:** 'We found 2 studies that involved 105 participants with overweight or obesity. The studies were conducted in Ukraine and Greece. One study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding. The two small studies we found did not provide enough evidence...'\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We found two small studies with a total of 105 children and teenagers. Based on this limited evidence, we are very uncertain if personalized nutrition plans affect weight or body mass index (BMI). The studies took place in Ukraine and Greece.'",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has **Good Conformity with PLS Patterns**. All 18 metrics fall within the typical or best-quartile ranges for Cochrane Plain Language Summaries. For example, the average sentence length (19.5 words) and Flesch-Kincidence grade level (11.17) are both in the best quartile (P25), indicating strong foundational readability. However, these positive metrics do not capture the critical structural omissions and clarity issues identified in the editorial review, which must be addressed."
