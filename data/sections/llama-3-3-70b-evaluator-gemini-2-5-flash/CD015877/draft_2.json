  "draft": "Can personalized nutrition plans help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health compared to standard one-size-fits-all diets?\n\nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether personalized nutrition plans are better than standard one-size-fits-all diets for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health. No harmful effects were reported. \nDue to the limited number of studies and participants, it is unclear if precision nutrition-based interventions have any benefits or harms for children and adolescents with obesity. \nFuture research should focus on conducting well-designed studies that report participant outcome data, including physical and mental well-being, and explore the effects of precision nutrition-based interventions in different age groups and populations.\n\nWhat is obesity in children and adolescents, and why is it a problem?\nObesity in children and adolescents is a serious health condition where a young person has an excessive amount of body fat. It's a problem because it can lead to various health issues, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health problems. Common treatments for obesity in children and adolescents often focus on lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. However, these 'one-size-fits-all' approaches may not be effective for everyone, as people's responses to the same diet can vary greatly due to factors like genetics, dietary habits, and physical activity.\n\nWhat are precision nutrition-based interventions, and how might they help?\nPrecision nutrition-based interventions involve tailored approaches that take into account individual characteristics, such as genetics, dietary habits, and physical activity, to develop personalized diet recommendations. These interventions aim to address the unique needs of each child or adolescent, which may lead to more effective weight management and improved overall health. Precision nutrition-based interventions can include the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning methods, and other technologies to provide personalized support.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to examine the impact of precision nutrition-based interventions on the management of obesity in children and adolescents. They aimed to investigate whether these tailored approaches are more effective than traditional 'one-size-fits-all' interventions in improving physical and mental well-being, reducing obesity-associated disability, and promoting healthy weight change. The authors also sought to identify the most effective methods for delivering precision nutrition-based interventions and to determine the potential benefits and harms of these approaches.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies evaluating precision nutrition-based interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents.\n\nHow did the review authors select and analyze the studies?\nTwo independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, then extracted data on participant characteristics, intervention details, outcomes, and study design. When feasible, effect sizes were pooled using random-effects models, and heterogeneity was quantified with the I² statistic.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 2 studies that involved 105 participants with overweight or obesity. The studies were conducted in Ukraine and Greece. Most studies lasted for an unspecified duration. One study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding. The population characteristics included children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years with overweight or obesity. The types of interventions and comparisons included precision nutrition-based interventions compared to one-size-fits-all interventions or standard of care. Precision nutrition-based interventions may have little to no effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents, but the results are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not provide data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs significant revisions to improve clarity and readability for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of overly technical language, especially in the methods section, and a writing style that is too complex and formal. The following 4 improvements will make the summary much easier for patients and the public to understand.\n\n**Top 4 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Remove Technical Jargon from the Methods Section:** The description of the analysis is too technical for a plain language summary.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"When feasible, effect sizes were pooled using random-effects models, and heterogeneity was quantified with the I² statistic.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** Terms like 'effect sizes', 'pooled', 'random-effects models', and 'heterogeneity' are statistical concepts that will be meaningless to most readers.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** Remove this sentence entirely. The other sentences in that section are sufficient for a plain language summary.\n\n**2. Simplify Complex Vocabulary:** The summary uses many long, formal words where simpler, everyday words would be clearer.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"The population characteristics included children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years with overweight or obesity.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"Population characteristics\" is clinical research jargon. The sentence structure is unnecessarily formal.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies included children and teenagers from 0 to 19 years old who had overweight or obesity.\"\n\n**3. Use Active Voice to Improve Clarity:** The summary has many passive sentences, which can make the text feel indirect and harder to follow.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"No harmful effects were reported.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is passive. It's clearer to state who did (or didn't do) the reporting.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies did not report any harmful effects.\"\n\n**4. Replace Noun Phrases with Verbs:** The text often uses noun forms of verbs (nominalizations), which makes sentences denser and less direct.\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Precision nutrition-based interventions can include the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning methods, and other technologies to provide personalized support.\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** \"the use of\" is a wordy noun phrase. The sentence can be more direct by using the verb \"use\".\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"These personalized plans might use artificial intelligence or other technologies to create recommendations.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour draft deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in several key areas that support this feedback. It has an extremely high number of complex words, long words, and passive voice constructions (all rated 'BEYOND_P90'). Readability scores like the SMOG index are also much higher than is typical for a PLS, confirming the text is too difficult for a general audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows MODERATE CONFORMITY with typical PLS patterns, with 55.6% of features falling in the best quartile. However, there are significant deviations in critical areas affecting readability. Eight out of 18 metrics (44%) fall outside the typical P75/P25 range. Six of these are rated 'BEYOND_P90', indicating major divergence. The most serious issues are the high counts of passive voice (24.0), complex words (176.0), and long words (244.0), which contribute to a very high SMOG index of 16.08 (a measure of reading grade level). These results strongly suggest the text is too complex and technical for a lay audience."
