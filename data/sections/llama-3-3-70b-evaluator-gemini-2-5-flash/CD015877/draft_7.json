  "draft": "Can personalized nutrition plans help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health compared to standard one-size-fits-all diets? We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether personalized nutrition plans are better than standard one-size-fits-all diets for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health. The studies did not report any harmful effects. Because we found only two small studies, it is still unclear if these personal diet plans have any benefits or harms. More high-quality research is needed. Future studies should include people of different ages and report on their physical and mental well-being.\n\nObesity in children and adolescents is a serious health condition where a young person has an excessive amount of body fat. It’s a problem because it can lead to various health issues, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health problems. Common treatments for obesity in children and adolescents often focus on lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. However, these ‘one-size-fits-all’ approaches may not be effective for everyone, as people’s responses to the same diet can vary greatly due to factors like genetics, dietary habits, and physical activity.\n\nPrecision nutrition-based interventions involve creating a personal diet plan for someone, taking into account their genetics, eating habits, and how active they are. These interventions aim to address the unique needs of each child or adolescent, which may lead to more effective weight management and improved overall health. These personal plans can be created using technology like artificial intelligence to give tailored support.\n\nWe wanted to know if these personal diet plans work better than the usual ‘one-size-fits-all’ diets. We looked for improvements in physical and mental health, and whether the plans helped children and teenagers manage their weight in a healthy way. We searched online medical databases for studies that tested personal diet plans for children and teenagers with obesity. Two of our researchers worked separately to find and check all the relevant studies. For each study, they noted who the participants were, what kind of personal diet plan was tested, and what health outcomes the studies measured.\n\nWe found 2 studies that involved 105 participants with overweight or obesity. The studies were conducted in Ukraine and Greece. One study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding. Precision nutrition-based interventions may have little to no effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents, but the results are very uncertain. The evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not provide data on all outcomes of interest. The evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "The draft is not approved because it fails a critical structural requirement. The summary must be organized into sections with question-based subheadings to guide the reader, as mandated by the style guide. While the content is factually accurate and the language is generally clear, the lack of structure makes it difficult to read and navigate.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add Required Structure and Subheadings:** The summary is currently a single block of text. It must be broken into the standard sections of a Plain Language Summary. This is the most critical change required.\n   - **Problem:** Without headings, readers cannot easily distinguish background information from the review's findings.\n   - **Suggestion:** Please structure the text using question-based subheadings. For example:\n     - What is the issue?\n     - Why did we do this Cochrane Review?\n     - What did we find?\n     - How certain is the evidence?\n     - How up to date is this evidence?\n\n2. **Clarify the Main Finding:** The conclusion is phrased using technical language that may be unclear to a lay audience.\n   - **Quote:** \"Precision nutrition-based interventions may have little to no effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents, but the results are very uncertain.\"\n   - **Problem:** This phrasing is hedging and doesn't clearly state the key takeaway: that we don't have enough information to know the effects.\n   - **Suggestion:** Rewrite this for clarity. For example: \"The two small studies we found did not provide enough evidence to know if personalized nutrition plans affect weight or body mass index (BMI) in children and teenagers.\"\n\n3. **Shorten Long, Complex Sentences:** Some sentences are too long and contain multiple ideas, which can be hard to follow.\n   - **Quote:** \"However, these ‘one-size-fits-all’ approaches may not be effective for everyone, as people’s responses to the same diet can vary greatly due to factors like genetics, dietary habits, and physical activity.\"\n   - **Problem:** This 38-word sentence combines several concepts, reducing readability.\n   - **Suggestion:** Break it into shorter, simpler sentences. For example: \"However, these ‘one-size-fits-all’ plans don’t work for everyone. People can respond very differently to the same diet because of factors like their genes, habits, and physical activity.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good conformity with typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating appropriate sentence length (average 20 words), use of active voice, and vocabulary complexity for this format. The Flesch-Kincaid grade level is 11.6. While the metrics are positive, they do not evaluate the overall structure, which is the primary reason this draft is not approved."
