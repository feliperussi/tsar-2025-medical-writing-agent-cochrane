  "draft": "Can personalized nutrition plans help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health compared to standard one-size-fits-all diets? \nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether personalized nutrition plans are better than standard one-size-fits-all diets for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health. \nThe studies did not report any harmful effects. \nDue to the limited number of studies and participants, it is unclear if precision nutrition-based interventions have any benefits or harms for children and adolescents with obesity. \nFuture research should focus on conducting well-designed studies that report participant outcome data, including physical and mental well-being, and explore the effects of precision nutrition-based interventions in different age groups and populations.\n\nWhat is obesity in children and adolescents, and why is it a problem? \nObesity in children and adolescents is a serious health condition where a young person has an excessive amount of body fat. \nIt's a problem because it can lead to various health issues, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health problems. \nCommon treatments for obesity in children and adolescents often focus on lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. \nHowever, these 'one-size-fits-all' approaches may not be effective for everyone, as people's responses to the same diet can vary greatly due to factors like genetics, dietary habits, and physical activity.\n\nWhat are precision nutrition-based interventions, and how might they help? \nPrecision nutrition means creating a personal diet plan for someone. \nTo do this, experts look at a person's genetics, eating habits, and how active they are. \nThese interventions aim to address the unique needs of each child or adolescent, which may lead to more effective weight management and improved overall health. \nPrecision nutrition-based interventions can include the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning methods, and other technologies to provide personalized support.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nThe review authors wanted to examine the impact of precision nutrition-based interventions on the management of obesity in children and adolescents. \nThey aimed to investigate whether these tailored approaches are more effective than traditional 'one-size-fits-all' interventions in improving physical and mental well-being, reducing obesity-associated disability, and promoting healthy weight change. \nThe authors also sought to identify the most effective methods for delivering precision nutrition-based interventions and to determine the potential benefits and harms of these approaches.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence? \nWe performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies evaluating precision nutrition-based interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents.\n\nHow did the review authors select and analyze the studies? \nTwo of our researchers worked separately to find and check all the relevant studies. \nThis process helps ensure our findings are accurate and reliable. \nThey extracted data on participant characteristics, intervention details, outcomes, and study design.\n\nWhat did the review authors find? \nWe found 2 studies that involved 105 participants with overweight or obesity. \nThe studies were conducted in Ukraine and Greece. \nMost studies lasted for an unspecified duration. \nOne study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding. \nThe population characteristics included children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years with overweight or obesity. \nThe studies compared personal diet plans against 'one-size-fits-all' diets or the usual care. \nPrecision nutrition-based interventions may have little to no effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents, but the results are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not provide data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start, but the summary is not yet ready for publication. While it passes all critical checks for structure and accuracy, the language is often too technical and formal for a lay audience. The main issue is the use of complex words and noun-heavy sentences, which makes key sections difficult to understand. Here are the top 3 improvements to focus on:\n\n1.  **Simplify the language in the 'Aims' section.** The current phrasing is too academic and uses several nominalizations (noun forms of verbs).\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"They aimed to investigate whether these tailored approaches are more effective than traditional 'one-size-fits-all' interventions in improving physical and mental well-being, reducing obesity-associated disability, and promoting healthy weight change.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to know if these personal diet plans work better than the usual 'one-size-fits-all' diets. We looked for improvements in physical and mental health, and whether the plans helped children and teenagers manage their weight in a healthy way.\"\n\n2.  **Replace jargon in the 'Methods' section.** Terms like 'systematic search' and 'evaluating interventions' are unclear to a non-medical reader.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"We performed a systematic search of electronic databases for studies evaluating precision nutrition-based interventions for managing obesity in children and adolescents.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched online medical databases for studies that tested personal diet plans for children and teenagers with obesity.\"\n\n3.  **Make the 'Results' section more direct and less passive.** The phrasing is currently wordy and indirect.\n    *   **Problematic sentence:** \"The population characteristics included children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years with overweight or obesity.\"\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies included children and teenagers from birth to 19 years old who had overweight or obesity.\"\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary much clearer and more accessible for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows a mixed profile. While sentence length and basic readability scores are good (e.g., 'words_per_sentence' is in the best quartile), the summary deviates significantly from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Four key metrics—'smog_index', 'complex_words', 'long_words', and 'nouns'—are beyond the 90th percentile, indicating the word choice is much more complex and noun-heavy than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This suggests the main area for improvement is replacing technical terms and complex nouns with simpler, more direct language."
