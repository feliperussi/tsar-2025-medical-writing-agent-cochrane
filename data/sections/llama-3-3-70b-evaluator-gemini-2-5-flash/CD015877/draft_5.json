  "draft": "Can personalized nutrition plans help children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health compared to standard one-size-fits-all diets? \nWe did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine whether personalized nutrition plans are better than standard one-size-fits-all diets for helping children and teenagers with obesity lose weight or improve their health. \nThe studies did not report any harmful effects. \nDue to the limited number of studies and participants, it is unclear if precision nutrition-based interventions have any benefits or harms for children and adolescents with obesity. \nFuture research should focus on conducting well-designed studies that report participant outcome data, including physical and mental well-being, and explore the effects of precision nutrition-based interventions in different age groups and populations.\n\nWhat is obesity in children and adolescents, and why is it a problem? \nObesity in children and adolescents is a serious health condition where a young person has an excessive amount of body fat. \nIt's a problem because it can lead to various health issues, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health problems. \nCommon treatments for obesity in children and adolescents often focus on lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. \nHowever, these 'one-size-fits-all' approaches may not be effective for everyone, as people's responses to the same diet can vary greatly due to factors like genetics, dietary habits, and physical activity.\n\nWhat are precision nutrition-based interventions, and how might they help? \nPrecision nutrition means creating a personal diet plan for someone. \nTo do this, experts look at a person's genetics, eating habits, and how active they are. \nThese interventions aim to address the unique needs of each child or adolescent, which may lead to more effective weight management and improved overall health. \nPrecision nutrition-based interventions can include the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning methods, and other technologies to provide personalized support.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out? \nWe wanted to know if these personal diet plans work better than the usual 'one-size-fits-all' diets. \nWe looked for improvements in physical and mental health, and whether the plans helped children and teenagers manage their weight in a healthy way.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence? \nWe searched online medical databases for studies that tested personal diet plans for children and teenagers with obesity.\n\nHow did the review authors select and analyze the studies? \nTwo of our researchers worked separately to find and check all the relevant studies. \nThis process helps ensure our findings are accurate and reliable. \nThey extracted data on participant characteristics, intervention details, outcomes, and study design.\n\nWhat did the review authors find? \nWe found 2 studies that involved 105 participants with overweight or obesity. \nThe studies were conducted in Ukraine and Greece. \nMost studies lasted for an unspecified duration. \nOne study reported nonprofit funding sources, whilst the other did not report funding. \nThe studies included children and teenagers from birth to 19 years old who had overweight or obesity. \nPrecision nutrition-based interventions may have little to no effect on body weight or BMI in children and adolescents, but the results are very uncertain.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small and many did not provide data on all outcomes of interest.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to July 2024.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It's well-structured, factually accurate, and meets all the critical requirements. The readability scores are generally good because of the short sentences and active voice. However, to make it even clearer for a lay audience, I have three main suggestions focused on simplifying the language and reducing jargon.\n\n1. **Replace technical research terms with simpler descriptions.** Some sentences use academic language that might be unfamiliar to patients. Explaining *what* was done is more helpful than using the technical term for it.\n    *   **Example:** 'They extracted data on participant characteristics, intervention details, outcomes, and study design.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'For each study, they noted who the participants were (like their age), what kind of personal diet plan was tested, and what results were measured.'\n\n2. **Simplify complex phrases and definitions.** Some sentences are dense with technical terms or noun-heavy phrases that can slow the reader down. Breaking these ideas into simpler parts can improve clarity.\n    *   **Example:** 'Precision nutrition-based interventions can include the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning methods, and other technologies to provide personalized support.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'These personal plans can be created using technology like artificial intelligence to give tailored support.'\n\n3. **Make the key messages more direct and distinct.** The first two key messages are a bit repetitive. Sharpening the second one to focus on the *reason* for the uncertainty makes the takeaway clearer.\n    *   **Example:** 'Due to the limited number of studies and participants, it is unclear if precision nutrition-based interventions have any benefits or harms for children and adolescents with obesity.'\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'Because we found only two small studies, it is still unclear if these personal diet plans have any benefits or harms. More research is needed.'\n\nAddressing these points will help ensure the summary is as easy to understand as possible for patients and the public.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows a draft with high conformity to typical patterns, particularly in sentence structure. Metrics like `words_per_sentence` (17.49) and `active_voice` (64 instances) are in the best quartile, indicating short, direct sentences. However, the analysis highlights significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Five key metrics—`nouns` (184), `smog_index` (13.82), `complex_words_dc` (236), `complex_words` (122), and `long_words` (190)—are in the P90 range, indicating the text uses more complex, long, and noun-based words than is typical for a PLS. This suggests the primary area for improvement is simplifying word choice."
