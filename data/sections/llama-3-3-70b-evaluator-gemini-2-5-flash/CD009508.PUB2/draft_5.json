  "draft": "Effective Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Methods for Women with Urinary Incontinence\n\nKey messages:\n- Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) - a type of exercise to strengthen the muscles in the pelvic floor - may slightly improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine). However, the evidence is not very certain. Harmful effects were rarely reported, mostly related to using training devices.\n- Direct PFMT - where you repeatedly squeeze and relax your pelvic floor muscles - may work better than indirect training - exercises that do not directly contract the pelvic floor muscles. How the training is supervised, whether one-on-one or in a group, probably doesn't change how much it improves your quality of life.\n- More research is needed to compare different approaches to PFMT, including the type of exercise, dose, and delivery method. Many studies had limitations, and the evidence for some comparisons was uncertain or based on few trials.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nUrinary incontinence is a condition where people leak urine involuntarily, which can be embarrassing and affect their quality of life. It is a common problem, especially among women, and can be caused by various factors such as stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. PFMT is a recommended treatment for female urinary incontinence, which involves exercising the muscles in the pelvic floor to improve bladder control.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of different approaches to PFMT on urinary incontinence in women. We compared various exercise types, doses, and delivery methods to determine which ones are most effective in improving incontinence quality of life. We also looked for any harmful effects from PFMT and checked how certain the evidence was to help guide doctors and future researchers.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different approaches to PFMT for urinary incontinence in women. We also handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and reviewed reference lists of relevant articles.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. Most participants were middle-aged women who had given birth. They mainly had stress incontinence - leaking urine during activities like coughing or sneezing. Most had not had previous treatment for this issue and did not have major pelvic floor problems. The studies compared different approaches to PFMT, including exercise type, dose, and delivery. PFMT may improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence. Co-ordinated training may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct PFMT. Direct PFMT may moderately improve quality of life compared to indirect training. We rarely found harmful effects in the studies. When we did, they were mostly related to using training devices, such as vaginal discharge, spotting, or discomfort, but these were rare.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. In many studies, participants knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Many studies were also very small. Finally, the studies included different types of women and used various training methods, making the results harder to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It fails a critical check because the main title is not phrased as a question, as required by the style guide. Additionally, several improvements are needed to enhance clarity for the reader.\n\nHere are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Rephrase the main title as a question.** The title must guide the reader by asking what the review is about.\n   - **Current Title:** 'Effective Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Methods for Women with Urinary Incontinence'\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'What are the most effective ways to do pelvic floor muscle training for women with urinary incontinence?'\n\n2. **Explain all technical terms clearly.** A key finding in the results section uses a term that is never defined for the reader, which causes confusion.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** In the 'What did we find?' section, you write: 'Co-ordinated training may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct PFMT.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The term 'Co-ordinated training' is new and unexplained, unlike 'direct PFMT' which was defined earlier. Readers won't know what this is. The abstract defines it as 'body movements with concurrent pelvic floor muscle contraction'.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** Add a simple definition. For example: 'Co-ordinated training (doing body movements while squeezing pelvic floor muscles at the same time) may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct PFMT.'\n\n3. **Replace formal, noun-heavy phrases with simpler, active verbs.** The text uses formal language that makes it harder to read. This is reflected in the high number of 'nominalizations' (noun-form verbs) and complex words found in the analysis.\n   - **Problematic Sentence:** 'We wanted to assess the effects of different approaches to PFMT on urinary incontinence in women.'\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Phrases like 'assess the effects' and 'different approaches' are formal and less direct.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** 'We wanted to find out how well different ways of doing PFMT work for women with urinary incontinence.'\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary much clearer and more accessible for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft conforms well in many areas, particularly sentence length and readability scores, which fall into the best quartile. However, there is a significant deviation from typical PLS patterns in vocabulary complexity. Five metrics, including `nominalization` (P90), `complex_words` (P90), and `long_words` (P90), are in the highest 10% of the corpus, indicating that the text relies too heavily on formal, noun-based phrases and complex vocabulary. This supports the editorial recommendation to simplify word choices and use more direct verbs."
