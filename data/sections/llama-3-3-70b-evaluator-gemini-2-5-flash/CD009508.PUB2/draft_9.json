  "draft": "What are the most effective ways to do pelvic floor muscle training for women with urinary incontinence?\n\nKey messages:\n- Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) - an exercise to strengthen the muscles in the pelvic floor - may slightly improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence (leaking urine without meaning to), but the evidence is not very certain. Harmful effects were rare and mostly linked to the use of training devices.\n- Direct PFMT (squeezing and relaxing the pelvic floor muscles on their own) may be more effective than indirect training (exercises that do not directly contract the pelvic floor muscles). Supervision, whether individual or in a group, probably makes little difference to improving quality of life.\n- More research is needed to compare different approaches to PFMT, including the type of exercise, dose, and delivery method, as many studies had limitations, and the evidence for some comparisons was uncertain or based on few trials.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nUrinary incontinence is a condition where people leak urine without meaning to, which can be embarrassing and affect their quality of life. It is a common problem, especially among women, and can be caused by various factors such as stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. Doctors recommend PFMT to help women who leak urine. It involves exercising the pelvic floor muscles to better control the bladder.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if some ways of doing pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) work better than others for women who leak urine. We compared various exercise types, doses, and delivery methods to determine which ones are most effective in improving incontinence quality of life. We also investigated the harmful effects associated with PFMT and the certainty of the evidence to inform clinical practice and future research.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies comparing different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence in women. We summarized the results of the identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. The women in the studies were typically middle-aged and had previously given birth. Most experienced stress-related urine leakage and had not had prior surgery for this issue. The studies compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training, including exercise type, dose, and delivery. PFMT may improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence. Co-ordinated training (doing body movements while squeezing pelvic floor muscles at the same time) may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct PFMT. Direct PFMT may moderately improve quality of life compared to indirect training.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. In many studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving. The studies were also very small and involved different types of participants and methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

The main issues are the use of complex words and noun-heavy phrases, which make the text harder to read than it needs to be. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\\n\\n1. **Simplify complex, noun-heavy sentences.** Many sentences use formal, noun-based phrases instead of simpler verbs. This makes the text less direct.\\n    *   **For example:** 'We compared various exercise types, doses, and delivery methods to determine which ones are most effective in improving incontinence quality of life.'\\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We compared different ways of doing PFMT to see which worked best to improve quality of life for women with incontinence.'\\n\\n2. **Replace long words and jargon with everyday language.** The text uses formal language that could be simplified for patients.\\n    *   **For example:** 'We also investigated the harmful effects associated with PFMT and the certainty of the evidence to inform clinical practice and future research.'\\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We also looked for any harmful effects from PFMT and checked how certain the evidence was. This helps doctors and researchers make better decisions.'\\n\\n3. **Explain technical medical terms.** The summary mentions specific types of incontinence without explaining what they are.\\n    *   **For example:** '...can be caused by various factors such as stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence.'\\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'It can happen for different reasons, for example when you leak urine when you cough or sneeze (stress incontinence), or when you feel a sudden, strong need to go to the toilet (urgency incontinence).'\\n\\nThese changes are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the draft has a high number of nominalizations (noun-phrases), long words, and words considered complex by the Dale-Chall index. Addressing these points will make the summary much clearer and more accessible.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns in sentence length and structure, with 61% of features in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. The metrics for nominalization (22.0), Dale-Chall complex words (221.0), and long words (169.0) are all in the P90 range, indicating that the text relies too heavily on noun-based phrases and complex, uncommon words, which can make it difficult for a lay audience to understand despite the short sentences."
