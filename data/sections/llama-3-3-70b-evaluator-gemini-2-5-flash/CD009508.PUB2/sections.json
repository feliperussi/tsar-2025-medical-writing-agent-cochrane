  "key_messages": [
    "Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) (a type of exercise to strengthen the muscles in the pelvic floor) may slightly improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine), but the evidence is not very certain, and harmful effects were rarely reported, mostly related to the use of training devices.",
    "Direct PFMT (sets of repeated, isolated, voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles) may be more effective than indirect training (exercises that do not directly contract the pelvic floor muscles), and supervision, whether individual or in a group, probably makes little difference in achieving improvement in quality of life.",
    "More research is needed to compare different approaches to PFMT, including the type of exercise, dose, and delivery method, as many studies had limitations, and the evidence for some comparisons was uncertain or based on few trials."

      "subheading": "What is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Urinary incontinence is a condition where people leak urine involuntarily, which can be embarrassing and affect their quality of life. It is a common problem, especially among women, and can be caused by various factors such as stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is a recommended treatment for female urinary incontinence, which involves exercising the muscles in the pelvic floor to improve bladder control."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on urinary incontinence in women. They compared various exercise types, doses, and delivery methods to determine which ones are most effective in improving incontinence quality of life. The authors also investigated the adverse events associated with PFMT and the certainty of the evidence to inform clinical practice and future research."

    {
      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. The studies were conducted in countries around the world, mostly in middle- or high-income settings. Overall, study participants were mid-age parous women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence, who had no prior incontinence treatment or pelvic surgery, or appreciable pelvic floor dysfunction. The studies compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training, including exercise type, dose, and delivery. Pelvic floor muscle training may improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence. Co-ordinated training may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct pelvic floor muscle training. Direct pelvic floor muscle training may moderately improve quality of life compared to indirect training."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know which treatment they received), the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.",
  "currency": "This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023."
