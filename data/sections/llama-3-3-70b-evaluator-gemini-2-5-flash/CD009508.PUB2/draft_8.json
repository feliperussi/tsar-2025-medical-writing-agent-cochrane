  "draft": "What are the most effective ways to do pelvic floor muscle training for women with urinary incontinence?\n\nKey messages:\n- Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is an exercise to strengthen the muscles in the pelvic floor. For women who leak urine without meaning to (urinary incontinence), PFMT may slightly improve their quality of life. However, the evidence for this is not very certain. Harmful effects were rare and mostly linked to the use of training devices.\n- Direct PFMT (squeezing and relaxing the pelvic floor muscles on their own) may be more effective than indirect training (exercises that do not directly contract the pelvic floor muscles). Supervision, whether individual or in a group, probably makes little difference to improving quality of life.\n- More research is needed to compare different approaches to PFMT, including the type of exercise, dose, and delivery method, as many studies had limitations, and the evidence for some comparisons was uncertain or based on few trials.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nUrinary incontinence is a condition where people leak urine involuntarily, which can be embarrassing and affect their quality of life. It is a common problem, especially among women, and can be caused by various factors such as stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. PFMT is a recommended treatment for female urinary incontinence, which involves exercising the muscles in the pelvic floor to improve bladder control.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on urinary incontinence in women. They compared various exercise types, doses, and delivery methods to determine which ones are most effective in improving incontinence quality of life. The authors also investigated the adverse events associated with PFMT and the certainty of the evidence to inform clinical practice and future research.\n\nHow we conducted this review\nWe searched for studies comparing different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence in women. We summarized the results of the identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. The women in the studies were typically middle-aged and had previously given birth. Most experienced stress-related urine leakage and had not had prior surgery for this issue. The studies compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training, including exercise type, dose, and delivery. PFMT may improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence. Co-ordinated training (doing body movements while squeezing pelvic floor muscles at the same time) may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct PFMT. Direct PFMT may moderately improve quality of life compared to indirect training.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. In many studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving. The studies were also very small and involved different types of participants and methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a good draft with strong readability scores, but it needs a few revisions to improve clarity and fully align with style guidelines before approval. Here are the top 4 areas to focus on:\n\n1. **Use a consistent, personal voice.** The text switches between third person ('the review authors') and first person ('we'). Using 'we' consistently makes the summary more direct and easier to read, as recommended by the style guide.\n   - **Problem:** \"The review authors wanted to assess the effects of different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on urinary incontinence in women.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"We wanted to find out if some ways of doing pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) work better than others for women who leak urine.\"\n\n2. **Replace complex and technical terms with simpler language.** Some words and phrases are unnecessarily formal or technical for a lay audience. This can make the text harder to understand.\n   - **Problem:** \"Urinary incontinence is a condition where people leak urine involuntarily...\" and \"The authors also investigated the adverse events associated with PFMT...\"\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace \"involuntarily\" with \"without meaning to\" (as you did in the key messages). Replace \"adverse events\" with \"harmful effects.\"\n\n3. **Make all subheadings questions.** One subheading does not follow the question format required by the style guide. This consistency helps readers navigate the text.\n   - **Problem:** \"How we conducted this review\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"How did we conduct this review?\"\n\n4. **Use more direct, active verbs instead of noun phrases (nominalizations).** Some sentences are wordy because they use noun forms instead of direct verbs. Using verbs makes the writing more concise and active.\n   - **Problem:** \"PFMT is a recommended treatment for female urinary incontinence, which involves exercising the muscles in the pelvic floor to improve bladder control.\"\n   - **Suggestion:** \"Doctors recommend PFMT to help women who leak urine. It involves exercising the pelvic floor muscles to better control the bladder.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows good overall conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 55.6% of features falling in the best quartile. The average sentence length (17.8 words) and most readability scores are excellent. However, the analysis also flags four metrics in the P90 range, indicating significant deviation from typical patterns. These are 'nominalization' (use of noun-form verbs), 'smog_index', 'complex_words_dc' (unfamiliar words), and 'long_words'. These metrics support the editorial feedback to simplify vocabulary and use more direct, active verbs to improve clarity for a lay audience."
