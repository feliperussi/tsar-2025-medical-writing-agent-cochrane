  "draft": "For women with urinary incontinence, what are the most effective ways to do pelvic floor muscle training?\n\nKey messages:\n- Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), which involves exercising the muscles in the pelvic floor to improve bladder control, may slightly improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine). However, the evidence is not very certain, and harmful effects were rarely reported, mostly related to the use of training devices.\n- Direct PFMT, where you repeatedly squeeze and relax your pelvic floor muscles, may work better than indirect training, which involves exercises that do not directly contract the pelvic floor muscles. How the training is supervised, whether one-on-one or in a group, probably doesn't change how much it improves your quality of life.\n- More research is needed to compare different approaches to PFMT, including the type of exercise, dose, and delivery method, as many studies had limitations, and the evidence for some comparisons was uncertain or based on few trials.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nUrinary incontinence is a condition where people leak urine involuntarily, which can be embarrassing and affect their quality of life. It is a common problem, especially among women, and can be caused by various factors such as stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. PFMT is a recommended treatment for female urinary incontinence.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to assess the effects of different approaches to PFMT on urinary incontinence in women. We compared various exercise types, doses, and delivery methods to determine which ones are most effective in improving incontinence quality of life. We also investigated the adverse events associated with PFMT and the certainty of the evidence to inform clinical practice and future research.\n\nHow did we search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different approaches to PFMT for urinary incontinence in women. We also handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and reviewed reference lists of relevant articles.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. Most participants were middle-aged women who had given birth. They mainly had stress incontinence (leaking urine during activities like coughing or sneezing). Most had not had previous treatment for this issue and did not have major pelvic floor problems. The studies compared different approaches to PFMT, including exercise type, dose, and delivery. PFMT may improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence. Co-ordinated training may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct PFMT. Direct PFMT may moderately improve quality of life compared to indirect training.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. In many studies, participants knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Many studies were also very small. Finally, the studies included different types of women and used various training methods, making the results harder to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.\n\nWe rarely found harmful effects in the studies. When we did, they were mostly related to using training devices. The studies reported a few adverse events, such as vaginal discharge, spotting, or discomfort, but these were rare.\n\nWe need more research to compare different approaches to PFMT, including the type of exercise, dose, and delivery method. Many studies had limitations, and the evidence for some comparisons was uncertain or based on few trials.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It's factually accurate and well-structured, but the language is too technical for a general audience. To make it clearer for patients, I recommend focusing on the 3 improvements below before approval.\n\n1. **Simplify complex words and phrases.** The summary uses technical terms that may be unfamiliar to readers. Replacing them with everyday language will make the key messages easier to understand.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"We also investigated the adverse events associated with PFMT and the certainty of the evidence to inform clinical practice and future research.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** Phrases like 'adverse events', 'certainty of the evidence', and 'inform clinical practice' are jargon.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We also looked for any harmful effects from PFMT. We checked how certain the evidence was to help guide doctors and future researchers.\"\n\n2. **Use active verbs instead of complex nouns (nominalizations).** The draft often uses noun forms of verbs, which makes sentences more abstract and harder to read. Using direct action verbs makes the writing clearer.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"...harmful effects were rarely reported, mostly related to the use of training devices.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This is passive and uses the noun phrase 'use of' instead of a simple verb. It's not clear who is doing the action.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies rarely reported harmful effects. When they did, the effects were mostly related to using training devices.\"\n\n3. **Fix the confusing structure at the end.** The summary includes two paragraphs after the final question (\"Is the evidence up to date?\"). This breaks the question-and-answer format and repeats information already covered in the key messages.\n   - **Problematic section:** The two paragraphs starting with \"We rarely found harmful effects...\" and ending with \"...based on few trials.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This information feels tacked on and disorganized, leaving the reader confused.\n   - **Suggested fix:** Delete these final two paragraphs. You can move the key information about side effects to the end of the \"What did we find?\" section to keep all the results together.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While sentence length and structure metrics are good (most are in the best quartile), the draft shows significant deviation in vocabulary complexity. Six metrics, including `nominalization` (BEYOND_P90), `complex_words` (P90), `long_words` (P90), and `smog_index` (P90), are much higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary. This indicates the language is too technical and noun-heavy for a general audience, supporting the need for the recommended edits."
