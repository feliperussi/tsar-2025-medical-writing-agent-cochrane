  "draft": "Effective Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Methods for Women with Urinary Incontinence\n\nKey messages:\n- Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) - a type of exercise to strengthen the muscles in the pelvic floor - may slightly improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine), but the evidence is not very certain, and harmful effects were rarely reported, mostly related to the use of training devices.\n- Direct PFMT (sets of repeated, isolated, voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles) may be more effective than indirect training (exercises that do not directly contract the pelvic floor muscles), and supervision, whether individual or in a group, probably makes little difference in achieving improvement in quality of life.\n- More research is needed to compare different approaches to PFMT, including the type of exercise, dose, and delivery method, as many studies had limitations, and the evidence for some comparisons was uncertain or based on few trials.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nUrinary incontinence is a condition where people leak urine involuntarily, which can be embarrassing and affect their quality of life. It is a common problem, especially among women, and can be caused by various factors such as stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is a recommended treatment for female urinary incontinence, which involves exercising the muscles in the pelvic floor to improve bladder control.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on urinary incontinence in women. They compared various exercise types, doses, and delivery methods to determine which ones are most effective in improving incontinence quality of life. The authors also investigated the adverse events associated with PFMT and the certainty of the evidence to inform clinical practice and future research.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence in women. We also handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and reviewed reference lists of relevant articles.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. Most participants were middle-aged women who had given birth. They mainly had stress incontinence (leaking urine during activities like coughing or sneezing). Most had not had previous treatment for this issue and did not have major pelvic floor problems. The studies compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training, including exercise type, dose, and delivery. Pelvic floor muscle training may improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence. Co-ordinated training may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct pelvic floor muscle training. Direct pelvic floor muscle training may moderately improve quality of life compared to indirect training.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded - participants could know which treatment they received - the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.\n\nWe rarely found harmful effects in the studies. When we did, they were mostly related to using training devices. The studies reported a few adverse events, such as vaginal discharge, spotting, or discomfort, but these were rare. \n\nWe need more research to compare different approaches to PFMT, including the type of exercise, dose, and delivery method. Many studies had limitations, and the evidence for some comparisons was uncertain or based on few trials.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start, but it needs revisions to improve clarity and align with Cochrane style guidelines before it can be approved. The main issues are the use of complex, noun-heavy language and inconsistent point of view. Addressing the 4 key areas below will make the summary much easier for patients to understand.\n\n**1. Simplify Complex Words and Noun-Heavy Phrases:** The summary uses technical terms and converts verbs into nouns (a practice called 'nominalization'), which makes sentences dense and difficult to read. This is the most important issue to fix.\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"Direct PFMT (sets of repeated, isolated, voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles) may be more effective than indirect training... and supervision... probably makes little difference in achieving improvement in quality of life.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** \"Contractions\" is a clinical term, and \"achieving improvement\" is a wordy phrase. Simpler, more direct language is better.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Direct PFMT means you repeatedly squeeze and relax your pelvic floor muscles. This may work better than indirect training. How the training is supervised—one-on-one or in a group—probably doesn't change how much it improves your quality of life.\"\n\n**2. Use \"We\" Consistently for the Review Authors:** The text switches between \"the review authors\" and \"we.\" The Cochrane style guide requires using \"we\" to create a more direct connection with the reader.\n*   **Problematic text:** \"What did the review authors want to find out? ... We searched for studies... What did the review authors find? We found 63 studies...\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** The inconsistency is confusing for the reader.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** Change all instances of \"the review authors\" to \"we.\" For example: \"What did we want to find out?\" and \"What did we find?\"\n\n**3. Break Up Long, Complicated Sentences:** Some sentences list multiple complex ideas, which can overwhelm the reader. Shorter sentences focusing on one idea at a time are easier to understand.\n*   **Problematic sentence:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded - participants could know which treatment they received - the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** This single sentence contains three distinct limitations, making it dense and hard to follow.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. In many studies, participants knew which treatment they were getting, which could have affected the results. Many studies were also very small. Finally, the studies included different types of women and used various training methods, making the results harder to compare.\"\n\n**4. Reformat the Title as a Question:** The main title is a statement, but the style guide recommends phrasing titles and headings as questions to better engage the reader.\n*   **Problematic title:** \"Effective Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Methods for Women with Urinary Incontinence\"\n*   **Why it's a problem:** It's less engaging and conversational than a question.\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"For women with urinary incontinence, what are the most effective ways to do pelvic floor muscle training?\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While metrics like sentence length are within the typical range, the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Six key metrics are outside the expected range, indicating the text is difficult to read. The most significant deviations are in 'nominalization' (BEYOND_P90), 'long_words' (BEYOND_P90), 'complex_words' (P90), and 'nouns' (P90). This data supports the editorial feedback to simplify word choices, use more verbs instead of nouns, and shorten complex sentences."
