  "draft": "What are the most effective ways to do pelvic floor muscle training for women with urinary incontinence?\n\nKey messages:\n- Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is an exercise to strengthen the muscles in the pelvic floor. For women who leak urine without meaning to (urinary incontinence), PFMT may slightly improve their quality of life. However, the evidence for this is not very certain. Harmful effects were rare and mostly linked to the use of training devices.\n- Direct PFMT (sets of repeated, isolated, voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles) may be more effective than indirect training (exercises that do not directly contract the pelvic floor muscles). Supervision, whether individual or in a group, probably makes little difference in achieving improvement in quality of life.\n- More research is needed to compare different approaches to PFMT, including the type of exercise, dose, and delivery method, as many studies had limitations, and the evidence for some comparisons was uncertain or based on few trials.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nUrinary incontinence is a condition where people leak urine involuntarily, which can be embarrassing and affect their quality of life. It is a common problem, especially among women, and can be caused by various factors such as stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. PFMT is a recommended treatment for female urinary incontinence, which involves exercising the muscles in the pelvic floor to improve bladder control.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on urinary incontinence in women. They compared various exercise types, doses, and delivery methods to determine which ones are most effective in improving incontinence quality of life. The authors also investigated the adverse events associated with PFMT and the certainty of the evidence to inform clinical practice and future research.\n\nHow we conducted this review\nWe searched for studies comparing different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence in women. We summarized the results of the identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. The women in the studies were typically middle-aged and had previously given birth. Most experienced stress-related urine leakage and had not had prior surgery for this issue. The studies compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training, including exercise type, dose, and delivery. PFMT may improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence. Co-ordinated training (doing body movements while squeezing pelvic floor muscles at the same time) may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct PFMT. Direct PFMT may moderately improve quality of life compared to indirect training.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know which treatment they received), the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

These changes focus on simplifying technical language and breaking up long sentences, which is supported by the linguistic analysis showing high rates of complex words and noun-heavy phrases.\n\n**1. Simplify the definition of 'Direct PFMT'.** The current definition is very technical and may be hard for readers to grasp quickly.\n- **Current text:** \"Direct PFMT (sets of repeated, isolated, voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles)...\"\n- **Problem:** The terms 'isolated' and 'voluntary contractions' are clinical jargon.\n- **Suggestion:** \"Direct PFMT (squeezing and relaxing the pelvic floor muscles on their own)...\"\n\n**2. Break down the long sentence in the 'Limitations' section.** This sentence contains several distinct ideas and is over 35 words long, which can be difficult to follow.\n- **Current text:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know which treatment they received), the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\"\n- **Problem:** This single sentence lists three separate limitations, making it dense and hard to process.\n- **Suggestion:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. In many studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving. The studies were also very small and involved different types of participants and methods.\"\n\n**3. Use a more direct verb instead of a noun phrase.** The analysis shows a high number of 'nominalizations' (verbs turned into nouns), which can make sentences wordy.\n- **Current text:** \"...supervision, whether individual or in a group, probably makes little difference in achieving improvement in quality of life.\"\n- **Problem:** The phrase 'achieving improvement in' is indirect and less clear than a simple verb.\n- **Suggestion:** \"...supervision, whether individual or in a group, probably makes little difference to improving quality of life.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical patterns. While sentence length and pronoun use are good, the draft deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Six metrics, including those for complex words, long words, nominalizations, and the SMOG index, are in the 90th percentile, indicating the language is more technical and noun-heavy than is typical for a Plain Language Summary."
