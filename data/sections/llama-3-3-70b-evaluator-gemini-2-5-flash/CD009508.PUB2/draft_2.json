  "draft": "What is the most effective way to treat urinary incontinence in women with pelvic floor muscle training?\n- Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) - a type of exercise to strengthen the muscles in the pelvic floor - may slightly improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence, but the evidence is not very certain. Harmful effects were rarely reported, mostly related to the use of training devices.\n- Direct PFMT - sets of repeated, isolated, voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles - may be more effective than indirect training - exercises that do not directly contract the pelvic floor muscles. Supervision, whether individual or in a group, probably makes little difference in achieving improvement in quality of life.\n- More research is needed to compare different approaches to PFMT, including the type of exercise, dose, and delivery method, as many studies had limitations, and the evidence for some comparisons was uncertain or based on few trials.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nUrinary incontinence is a condition where people leak urine involuntarily, which can be embarrassing and affect their quality of life. It is a common problem, especially among women, and can be caused by various factors such as stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is a recommended treatment for female urinary incontinence, which involves exercising the muscles in the pelvic floor to improve bladder control.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on urinary incontinence in women. They compared various exercise types, doses, and delivery methods to determine which ones are most effective in improving incontinence quality of life. The authors also investigated the adverse events associated with PFMT and the certainty of the evidence to inform clinical practice and future research.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence in women. We also handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and reviewed reference lists of relevant articles.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. The studies were conducted in countries around the world, mostly in middle- or high-income settings. Overall, study participants were mid-age parous women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence, who had no prior incontinence treatment or pelvic surgery, or appreciable pelvic floor dysfunction. The studies compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training, including exercise type, dose, and delivery. Pelvic floor muscle training may improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence. Co-ordinated training may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct pelvic floor muscle training. Direct pelvic floor muscle training may moderately improve quality of life compared to indirect training.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded - participants could know which treatment they received - the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

      "feedback": "The draft is factually accurate and well-structured, but it needs revisions to improve clarity for a lay audience. The main issues are the use of technical jargon, complex sentence structures, and noun-heavy phrases that make the text difficult to understand. Here are the top 3 areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Simplify Technical Language and Break Up Long Sentences:** Some sentences contain medical terms and are too long for a plain language summary. This makes it hard for readers to grasp the key information about the study participants.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Overall, study participants were mid-age parous women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence, who had no prior incontinence treatment or pelvic surgery, or appreciable pelvic floor dysfunction.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** **Problematic sentence:** This 34-word sentence uses jargon like 'parous', 'stress-predominant', and 'appreciable pelvic floor dysfunction' that will be unfamiliar to most readers.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Most participants were middle-aged women who had given birth. They mainly had stress incontinence (leaking urine during activities like coughing or sneezing). Most had not had previous treatment for this issue and did not have major pelvic floor problems.\"\n\n2. **Use Active Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases (Nominalizations):** The draft frequently uses noun forms of verbs, which can make sentences feel abstract and wordy. This is a key reason the text feels overly formal.\n   - **Problematic phrase:** \"...supervision, whether individual or in a group, probably makes little difference in achieving improvement in quality of life.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The phrase \"achieving improvement\" is less direct than using a simple verb. Your high 'nominalization' score reflects this pattern.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...individual or group supervision probably makes little difference to improving quality of life.\"\n\n3. **Convert Passive Voice to Active Voice:** Several sentences use the passive voice, which can make the text less engaging and obscure who is performing the action.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Harmful effects were rarely reported, mostly related to the use of training devices.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This is less direct than stating who did the reporting (the studies or researchers).\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The studies rarely reported harmful effects. When they did, they were mostly related to using training devices.\"\n\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics like sentence length are within the median range, there is a significant deviation in vocabulary and sentence construction. Seven metrics are in the P90 range or beyond, indicating higher-than-typical complexity. Notably, the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90), and metrics for complex words, long words, and overall readability (SMOG, Dale-Chall) are also in the P90 range, suggesting the text is too technical for a lay audience."
