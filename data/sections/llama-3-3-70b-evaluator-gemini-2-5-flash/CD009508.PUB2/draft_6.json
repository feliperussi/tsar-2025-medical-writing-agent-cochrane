  "draft": "What are the most effective ways to do pelvic floor muscle training for women with urinary incontinence?\n\nKey messages:\n- Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) (a type of exercise to strengthen the muscles in the pelvic floor) may slightly improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine), but the evidence is not very certain, and harmful effects were rarely reported, mostly related to the use of training devices.\n- Direct PFMT (sets of repeated, isolated, voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles) may be more effective than indirect training (exercises that do not directly contract the pelvic floor muscles), and supervision, whether individual or in a group, probably makes little difference in achieving improvement in quality of life.\n- More research is needed to compare different approaches to PFMT, including the type of exercise, dose, and delivery method, as many studies had limitations, and the evidence for some comparisons was uncertain or based on few trials.\n\nWhat is urinary incontinence and why is it a problem?\nUrinary incontinence is a condition where people leak urine involuntarily, which can be embarrassing and affect their quality of life. It is a common problem, especially among women, and can be caused by various factors such as stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence. PFMT is a recommended treatment for female urinary incontinence, which involves exercising the muscles in the pelvic floor to improve bladder control.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on urinary incontinence in women. They compared various exercise types, doses, and delivery methods to determine which ones are most effective in improving incontinence quality of life. The authors also investigated the adverse events associated with PFMT and the certainty of the evidence to inform clinical practice and future research.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 63 studies that involved 4920 women with urinary incontinence. The studies were conducted in countries around the world, mostly in middle- or high-income settings. Overall, study participants were mid-age parous women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence, who had no prior incontinence treatment or pelvic surgery, or appreciable pelvic floor dysfunction. The studies compared different approaches to pelvic floor muscle training, including exercise type, dose, and delivery. PFMT may improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence. Co-ordinated training (doing body movements while squeezing pelvic floor muscles at the same time) may slightly improve quality of life compared to direct PFMT. Direct PFMT may moderately improve quality of life compared to indirect training.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies may not have been blinded (participants could know which treatment they received), the sample sizes were very small, and the studies involved different types of participants and varied methods of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThis review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It fails a critical check because it is missing a required section explaining the review's methods. Additionally, several key areas need revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add the missing 'Methods' section.** The summary jumps from the aims ('What did the review authors want to find out?') to the results ('What did we find?'). A section is needed to briefly explain how the review was conducted, covering how studies were found and analyzed. You could add a heading like, 'How we conducted this review'.\n\n2. **Simplify technical language copied from the abstract.** Some sentences are too technical for a general reader. The goal is to explain the findings in everyday language, not just repeat the original text.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Overall, study participants were mid-age parous women with stress or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence, who had no prior incontinence treatment or pelvic surgery, or appreciable pelvic floor dysfunction.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Words like 'parous', 'stress-predominant', and 'appreciable pelvic floor dysfunction' are clinical terms that will confuse readers.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"The women in the studies were typically middle-aged and had previously given birth. Most experienced stress-related urine leakage and had not had prior surgery for this issue.\"\n\n3. **Break down long, complex sentences.** The first key message tries to communicate five different ideas in a single 49-word sentence, which is overwhelming for the reader.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) (a type of exercise to strengthen the muscles in the pelvic floor) may slightly improve quality of life for women with urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage of urine), but the evidence is not very certain, and harmful effects were rarely reported, mostly related to the use of training devices.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** This sentence combines the intervention, its definition, the outcome, the condition's definition, the certainty of evidence, and information on harms. This makes it very difficult to follow.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is an exercise to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. For women who leak urine without meaning to (urinary incontinence), PFMT may slightly improve their quality of life. However, the evidence for this is not very certain. Harmful effects were rare and mostly linked to the use of training devices.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While the word count (518) is well within the limit, the text's readability is low (Flesch Reading Ease: 35.84) and its complexity is high, equivalent to a US grade level of 13-14. Seven key metrics deviate significantly from typical patterns, falling into the P90 range. These metrics, including 'complex_words' (118), 'smog_index' (13.82), and 'nominalization' (27), confirm the editorial finding that the draft relies too heavily on technical vocabulary and complex, noun-heavy sentence structures, making it difficult for a lay audience to understand."
