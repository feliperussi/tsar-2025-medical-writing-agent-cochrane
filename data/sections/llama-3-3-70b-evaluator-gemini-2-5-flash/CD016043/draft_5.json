  "draft": "What are the best ways to provide eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems (such as refractive errors)?\n- We are not sure about the benefits and harms of different ways to provide local eye care. This is because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\n- We found several ways that eye care is provided, such as in schools, pharmacies, mobile clinics, and health centres.\n- Future research should test how well these different ways of providing eye care work. This will help fill the gaps in our knowledge and guide countries on how to improve their eye care services.\n\nWhat is uncorrected refractive error and why is it a problem?\nUncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. It occurs when the shape of the eye bends light incorrectly, which makes things look blurry. This condition can usually be fixed with the right pair of glasses, but many people, especially in low-resource settings, do not have access to eye care services.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the range of approaches for delivering eye care services in community and primary care settings. They also wanted to identify the methods used to evaluate these approaches, in order to help create guidelines for countries on how to improve their eye care services.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies that described different ways of providing eye care in local communities. We wanted to see what models were used and find out if researchers had tested how well they worked.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review?\nWe found several ways that eye care is delivered. In the community, this included services in schools, pharmacies, and mobile outreach clinics. In primary care settings, services were offered in vision centres, health centres, or through door-to-door visits.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small. Also, very few studies had actually tested how well these different ways of providing eye care worked, so we don't know which are best.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

In primary care settings, services were offered in vision centres, health centres, or through door-to-door visits.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found eye care was provided in several ways, such as in schools, pharmacies, mobile clinics, vision centres, health centres, and through door-to-door visits.\n\n3. **Define 'refractive error' in the key messages.** The term is used in the title and key messages but isn't defined until the background section. Adding a brief definition upfront would improve clarity for readers starting from the top.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"- We are not sure about the benefits and harms of different ways to provide local eye care.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite (incorporating from source):** \"- We are not sure about the benefits and harms of different ways to provide local eye care for 'refractive errors' (vision problems that can be corrected with glasses).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. An impressive 83.3% of metrics (15 out of 18) fall within the best quartile for readability and simplicity. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is 8.5, and the average sentence length is only 17 words. There are no metrics showing significant deviation, which confirms the text is already very clear and well-structured."
