  "draft": "What are the different ways of providing local eye care for common vision problems? This review identified several ways local eye care is provided, such as in schools, mobile clinics, and health centres. However, we are not sure which of these ways is best because we did not find enough good-quality studies that compared them.\n\nUncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. It occurs when the shape of the eye bends light incorrectly, which makes things look blurry. This condition can usually be fixed with the right pair of glasses, but many people, especially in low-resource settings, do not have access to eye care services.\n\nWe wanted to create a complete picture of all the different ways local eye care is provided, such as in clinics, schools, or through mobile services. We also aimed to identify the methods used to evaluate these approaches. We searched for studies and reports to identify the different ways local eye care is delivered. We also looked for information on how the effectiveness of these approaches was evaluated. We searched scientific databases and information from eye care organizations up to November 2022.\n\nIn community settings, care was often provided in schools, pharmacies, or through outreach services, like mobile clinics. In primary care settings, models included vision centres, health centres, and door-to-door visits. However, we found very few studies that had actually tested how well these different services worked.\n\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small, and very few studies actually tested how well these different eye care services worked. The evidence is up to date to November 2022.\n\nFuture research should test how well these different ways of providing eye care work. This will help fill the gaps in our knowledge and guide countries on how to improve their eye care services.",

While the language and readability are excellent at the sentence level, the summary fails on critical structural requirements that are essential for reader comprehension.\n\nHere are the 3 most important improvements needed:\n\n1. **Add required structure and subheadings:** The summary is currently a single block of text, which makes it hard for readers to find information. It must be reorganized under question-based subheadings as required by the style guide.\n   - **Suggestion:** Break the text into sections with headings like 'What is the issue?', 'Why did we do this review?', 'What did we find?', and 'How reliable is the evidence?'.\n\n2. **Create a clear 'Key messages' section:** The first paragraph combines the main question, findings, and limitations. This should be replaced with a dedicated, scannable list of the main takeaways at the very top.\n   - **Current text:** \"What are the different ways of providing local eye care for common vision problems?

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics are within the expected ranges, with 72% falling into the best quartile for readability and simplicity. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is 9.97 (P25) and the average sentence length is a low 17.5 words (P25). However, these metrics only evaluate the text at a sentence and word level; they do not assess the overall document structure, which is the primary area needing improvement in this draft."
