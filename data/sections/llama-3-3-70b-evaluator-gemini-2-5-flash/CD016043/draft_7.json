  "draft": "What are the different ways of providing local eye care for vision problems?\n- We are not sure about the benefits and harms of different ways to provide local eye care for refractive errors (vision problems that can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses). This is because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\n- We found several ways that eye care is provided, such as in schools, pharmacies, mobile clinics, vision centres, health centres, and through door-to-door visits.\n- Future research should test how well these different ways of providing eye care work. This will help fill the gaps in our knowledge and guide countries on how to improve their eye care services.\n\nWhat is uncorrected refractive error and why is it a problem?\nUncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. It occurs when the shape of the eye bends light incorrectly, which makes things look blurry. This condition can usually be fixed with the right pair of glasses, but many people, especially in low-resource settings, do not have access to eye care services.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to identify and describe the different ways eye care services are provided in local communities. Our goal was to understand the range of approaches being used.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies and reports to identify and describe the different ways eye care services are provided in local communities. Our goal was to understand the range of approaches being used.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review?\nIn community settings, care was often provided in schools, pharmacies, or through outreach services (like mobile clinics). In primary care settings, models included vision centres, health centres, and door-to-door visits.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small. Also, very few studies had actually tested how well these different ways of providing eye care worked, so we don’t know which are best.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

The 'Methods' section is a direct copy of the 'Aims' section and does not describe the methods used in the review. While the text is statistically very readable, this major content error must be fixed. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Correct the 'Methods' section.**\n   - **The problem:** The section 'What methods did we use?' is an exact copy of the previous section, 'What did we want to find out?'. It describes the review's goal, not how the work was done.\n   - **Your text:** \"We searched for studies and reports to identify and describe the different ways eye care services are provided in local communities. Our goal was to understand the range of approaches being used.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for studies and reports published up to November 2022. We looked at scientific databases and information from eye care organizations to find all the different ways local eye care is delivered.\"\n\n2. **Simplify the opening key message.**\n   - **The problem:** The first key message is slightly repetitive by using both \"vision problems\" and its technical term \"refractive errors\" so close together.\n   - **Your text:** \"...different ways to provide local eye care for refractive errors (vision problems that can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses).\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...different ways to provide local eye care for common vision problems (also known as refractive errors), which are often corrected with glasses.\"\n\n3. **Make the review's goal more concrete.**\n   - **The problem:** The phrase \"understand the range of approaches being used\" is abstract and uses researcher-focused language.\n   - **Your text:** \"Our goal was to understand the range of approaches being used.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to create a complete picture of all the different ways local eye care is provided, such as in clinics, schools, or through mobile services.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the best quartile or median ranges, indicating excellent statistical readability with short sentences (16.6 words/sentence) and a low reading grade level (8.2). However, this statistical profile does not capture the significant content and clarity issues identified during the editorial review, particularly the inaccurate 'Methods' section."
