  "draft": "What are the best ways to provide eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems (such as refractive errors)?\nWe looked at different approaches to delivering eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems like refractive errors. \n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, we are not sure about the benefits and potential harms of different approaches to providing eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems. \n- The review identified various approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services, including school-based, pharmacy, and outreach models in community care, and vision centre, health centre, and door-to-door delivery in primary care. \n- Future research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of these service-delivery approaches, addressing the prominent gaps in their evaluation, and guiding the strengthening of refractive and optical services at community and primary care levels.\n\nWhat is uncorrected refractive error and why is it a problem?\nUncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. It occurs when the shape of the eye doesn't allow light to focus correctly on the retina, resulting in blurry vision. This condition can be managed with appropriate spectacle correction, but many people, especially in low-resource settings, do not have access to refractive and optical services.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the range of approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings. They also wanted to identify the methods used to evaluate these approaches, in order to inform the development of technical guidance for improving refractive and optical services globally.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies on approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services, summarized their results, and evaluated the effectiveness of these approaches to inform improvements in testing and correction of refractive error.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review?\nWe identified 175 studies from searches of databases and grey literature, 146 records from company reports, and 81 records from website searches of relevant organizations that matched our inclusion criteria. Delivery approaches for refractive and optical services in community care included school-based, pharmacy, and outreach models, whereas primary care approaches comprised vision centre, health centre, and a combination of vision or health centre and door-to-door delivery.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because prominent gaps exist in the evaluation of the approaches, and few studies attempted to evaluate the approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. There is a critical factual error in the 'Methods' section that misrepresents the work of the review. Additionally, several sections use long, complex sentences and technical language that make the summary difficult for a lay audience to understand. The key areas for improvement are simplifying the language, breaking down long sentences, and correcting the methods description.\n\n**Critical Issue: Factual Inaccuracy**\n\n1.  **The 'Methods' section misstates what the review did.**\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"We searched for studies on approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services, summarized their results, and evaluated the effectiveness of these approaches...\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is factually incorrect. The review's abstract and limitations state that it found a *lack* of evaluation of effectiveness; it did not perform an evaluation itself. This contradicts the 'Limitations' section and will confuse the reader.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for studies and reports to identify the different ways eye care services are delivered in community and primary care settings. We also looked for how these different approaches were evaluated.\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed for Clarity**\n\n1.  **The third key message is too technical and long.**\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"Future research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of these service-delivery approaches, addressing the prominent gaps in their evaluation, and guiding the strengthening of refractive and optical services at community and primary care levels.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This 33-word sentence is filled with jargon ('service-delivery approaches', 'prominent gaps', 'strengthening') that is hard for a non-specialist to understand.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Future research should test how well these different ways of providing eye care work. This will help fill the gaps in our knowledge and guide countries on how to improve their eye care services.\"\n\n2.  **The description of the results is overly dense.**\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"Delivery approaches for refractive and optical services in community care included school-based, pharmacy, and outreach models, whereas primary care approaches comprised vision centre, health centre, and a combination of vision or health centre and door-to-door delivery.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** This is a very long sentence (41 words) that packs too much information together. Using simpler terms and breaking it into two sentences would make it much easier to follow.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We found several ways that eye care is delivered. In the community, this included services in schools, pharmacies, and mobile outreach clinics. In primary care settings, services were offered in vision centres, health centres, or through door-to-door visits.\"\n\n3.  **The explanation of uncorrected refractive error could be simpler.**\n    *   **Problematic text:** \"It occurs when the shape of the eye doesn't allow light to focus correctly on the retina, resulting in blurry vision.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** While technically correct, terms like 'focus correctly on the retina' may not be immediately clear to all readers.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"This happens when the shape of the eye bends light incorrectly, which makes things look blurry.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** These suggestions are supported by the linguistic analysis, which shows the text has high vocabulary complexity (9 metrics, including `complex_words` and `gunning_fog_index`, are in the highest 10% for difficulty) and long sentences. Addressing the points above will help improve these scores and make the summary much clearer for your audience.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft has moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 44.4% of features falling in the best quartile. However, a significant portion (50%, or 9 features) deviates from typical patterns, indicating areas for improvement. The main deviations are related to high text complexity and difficulty. Metrics such as the Gunning Fog Index, SMOG Index, and Dale-Chall Readability are all in the P90 range, meaning the text is much harder to read than a typical PLS. This is driven by a high number of complex and long words (`complex_words`, `long_words`, `complex_words_dc`) and a high density of nouns (`nouns`), all of which also fall in the P90 range."
