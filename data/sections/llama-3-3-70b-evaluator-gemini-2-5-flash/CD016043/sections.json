  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and potential harms of different approaches to providing eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems (such as refractive errors, which are vision problems that can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses) are unclear, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "The review identified various approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services, including school-based, pharmacy, and outreach models in community care, and vision centre, health centre, and door-to-door delivery in primary care, but the evaluation of these approaches is limited.",
    "Future research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of these service-delivery approaches, addressing the prominent gaps in their evaluation, and guiding the strengthening of refractive and optical services at community and primary care levels, which is crucial for achieving the global target of increasing effective coverage of refractive error correction."

      "subheading": "What is uncorrected refractive error and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Uncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. It occurs when the shape of the eye doesn't allow light to focus correctly on the retina, resulting in blurry vision. This condition can be managed with appropriate spectacle correction, but many people, especially in low-resource settings, do not have access to refractive and optical services. As a result, uncorrected refractive error remains a significant public health issue."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to determine the range of approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings. They also wanted to identify the methods used to evaluate these approaches, in order to inform the development of technical guidance for improving refractive and optical services globally."

    {
      "subheading": "Methods",
      "content": "We searched for studies on approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services, summarized their results, and evaluated the effectiveness of these approaches to inform improvements in testing and correction of refractive error."

      "content": "The agent stopped because it reached the maximum number of allowed iterations without completing its task."

      "subheading": "Next Steps",
      "content": "You can restart the agent, increase the iteration limit, or simplify the request to fit within the allowed iterations."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because prominent gaps exist in the evaluation of the approaches, and few studies attempted to evaluate the approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services.",
