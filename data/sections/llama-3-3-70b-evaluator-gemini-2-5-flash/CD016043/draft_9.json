  "draft": "What are the best ways to provide eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems, such as refractive errors, which are often corrected with glasses?\n\nWe are not sure about the benefits and harms of different ways to provide local eye care for common vision problems (refractive errors) because we did not find enough good-quality evidence. \n\nWhat is uncorrected refractive error and why is it a problem?\nUncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. It occurs when the shape of the eye bends light incorrectly, which makes things look blurry. This condition can usually be fixed with the right pair of glasses, but many people, especially in low-resource settings, do not have access to eye care services.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to create a complete picture of all the different ways local eye care is provided, such as in clinics, schools, or through mobile services. We also aimed to identify the methods used to evaluate these approaches.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies and reports to identify the different ways local eye care is delivered. We also looked for information on how the effectiveness of these approaches was evaluated. We searched scientific databases and information from eye care organizations up to November 2022.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review?\nIn community settings, care was often provided in schools, pharmacies, or through outreach services, like mobile clinics. In primary care settings, models included vision centres, health centres, and door-to-door visits. However, we found very few studies that had actually tested how well these different services worked.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small, and few studies attempted to evaluate the approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.\n\nFuture research should test how well these different ways of providing eye care work. This will help fill the gaps in our knowledge and guide countries on how to improve their eye care services.",

A few other small changes will also improve clarity for the reader.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Reframe the Key Message to Include the Review's Main Finding.**\n   - **The issue:** The current key message focuses only on what the review *didn't* find (effectiveness evidence), which could mislead readers into thinking the review was unsuccessful. A key purpose of this scoping review was to identify the different ways care is delivered, which it did successfully.\n   - **Current text:** \"We are not sure about the benefits and harms of different ways to provide local eye care for common vision problems (refractive errors) because we did not find enough good-quality evidence.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This review identified several ways local eye care is provided, such as in schools, mobile clinics, and health centres. However, we are not sure which of these ways is best because we did not find enough good-quality studies that compared them.\"\n\n2. **Simplify the Main Title.**\n   - **The issue:** The title is very long and includes a definition within the question, which makes it hard to read and understand at a glance.\n   - **Current text:** \"What are the best ways to provide eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems, such as refractive errors, which are often corrected with glasses?\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"What are the different ways of providing local eye care for common vision problems?\"\n\n3. **Use More Direct Language in the 'Limitations' Section.**\n   - **The issue:** The language is slightly abstract and could be more direct for a lay audience.\n   - **Current text:** \"...few studies attempted to evaluate the approaches for delivery of refractive and optical care services.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...very few studies actually tested how well these different eye care services worked.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the best (61%) or median (39%) quartiles for readability, sentence structure, and vocabulary. For example, the average sentence length (17 words) and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (9.4) are excellent. The feedback provided focuses on improving the framing and clarity of the content rather than fixing underlying structural or readability issues, which are already very strong."
