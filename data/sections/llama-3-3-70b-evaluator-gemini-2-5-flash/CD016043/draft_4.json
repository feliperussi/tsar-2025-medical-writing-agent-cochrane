  "draft": "What are the best ways to provide eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems (such as refractive errors)?\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, we are not sure about the benefits and potential harms of different approaches to providing eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems. \n- The review identified various approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services, including school-based, pharmacy, and outreach models in community care, and vision centre, health centre, and door-to-door delivery in primary care. \n- Future research should test how well these different ways of providing eye care work. This will help fill the gaps in our knowledge and guide countries on how to improve their eye care services.\n\nWhat is uncorrected refractive error and why is it a problem?\nUncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. It occurs when the shape of the eye bends light incorrectly, which makes things look blurry. This condition can be managed with appropriate spectacle correction, but many people, especially in low-resource settings, do not have access to refractive and optical services.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the range of approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services in community and primary care settings. They also wanted to identify the methods used to evaluate these approaches, in order to inform the development of technical guidance for improving refractive and optical services globally.\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies that described different ways of providing eye care in local communities. We wanted to see what models were used and find out if researchers had tested how well they worked.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review?\nWe found several ways that eye care is delivered. In the community, this included services in schools, pharmacies, and mobile outreach clinics. In primary care settings, services were offered in vision centres, health centres, or through door-to-door visits.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small. Also, very few studies had actually tested how well these different ways of providing eye care worked, so we don't know which are best.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

However, it is not approved because three specific clarity issues, particularly in the key messages and aims sections, need to be addressed to make the summary as clear as possible for a lay audience. By simplifying a few key sentences and replacing two technical terms, this summary can be made even better.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Simplify the sentences in your Key Messages.**\nThe first two bullet points are over 30 words long, which can be difficult for readers to follow in a summary section. Breaking them into shorter, more direct sentences will improve clarity.\n- **Original 1:** \"Due to a lack of robust evidence, we are not sure about the benefits and potential harms of different approaches to providing eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems.\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite 1:** \"We are not sure about the benefits and harms of different ways to provide local eye care. This is because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\"\n- **Original 2:** \"The review identified various approaches for delivering refractive and optical care services, including school-based, pharmacy, and outreach models in community care, and vision centre, health centre, and door-to-door delivery in primary care.\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite 2:** \"We found several ways that eye care is provided, such as in schools, pharmacies, mobile clinics, and health centres.\"\n\n**2. Replace technical terms with everyday language.**\nThe summary uses the term \"spectacle correction,\" which is clinical jargon. Using a more common word will make the text more accessible.\n- **Original:** \"This condition can be managed with appropriate spectacle correction...\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"This problem can usually be fixed with the right pair of glasses...\"\n\n**3. Clarify the aim of the review.**\nThe description of the review's goal uses abstract language that may be unclear to patients.\n- **Original:** \"...to inform the development of technical guidance for improving refractive and optical services globally.\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...to help create guidelines for countries on how to improve their eye care services.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft is very well-written and highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 83% of metrics falling into the best quartile. Readability scores like the Flesch-Kincaid Grade (10.21) and average words per sentence (18.04) are excellent. The feedback focuses on improving clarity for a handful of specific sentences and terms that are more complex than the rest of the text, rather than addressing any systemic issues."
