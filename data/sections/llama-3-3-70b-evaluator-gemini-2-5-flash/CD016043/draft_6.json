  "draft": "What are the best ways to provide eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems (such as refractive errors, which are vision problems that can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses)? \n- We are not sure about the benefits and harms of different ways to provide local eye care for refractive errors (vision problems that can be corrected with glasses). This is because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\n- We found several ways that eye care is provided, such as in schools, pharmacies, mobile clinics, vision centres, health centres, and through door-to-door visits.\n- Future research should test how well these different ways of providing eye care work. This will help fill the gaps in our knowledge and guide countries on how to improve their eye care services.\n\nWhat is uncorrected refractive error and why is it a problem? \nUncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. It occurs when the shape of the eye bends light incorrectly, which makes things look blurry. This condition can usually be fixed with the right pair of glasses, but many people, especially in low-resource settings, do not have access to eye care services.\n\nWhat did we want to find out? \nWe wanted to find out all the different ways eye care is provided in local communities. We also wanted to see if researchers had tested how well these different ways work.\n\nWhat methods did we use? \nWe searched for studies that described different ways of providing eye care in local communities. We wanted to see what models were used and find out if researchers had tested how well they worked.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review? \nWe found eye care was provided in several ways, such as in schools, pharmacies, mobile clinics, vision centres, health centres, and through door-to-door visits.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence? \nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small. Also, very few studies had actually tested how well these different ways of providing eye care worked, so we don’t know which are best.\n\nIs the evidence up to date? \nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is statistically strong and easy to read, but it needs a few revisions to improve clarity and accuracy before approval. The main issues are a very long title, redundant definitions, and a methods section that doesn't fully capture the review's primary goal. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the title and remove redundant definitions.** The main title is very long and contains a definition that is repeated in the key messages. This makes the opening feel cluttered and can be overwhelming for the reader.\n    - **Problem:** `What are the best ways to provide eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems (such as refractive errors, which are vision problems that can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses)?`\n    - **Suggestion:** Shorten the title to focus on the core question and place the definition in the introduction. For example, change the title to `What are the different ways of providing local eye care for vision problems?` and remove the parenthetical definition from the first key message.\n\n2. **Clarify the review's purpose in the 'Methods' section.** The current text implies the review was primarily testing how well different methods work. However, the source abstract indicates this was a scoping review to identify the *range of approaches* available, which is a different goal.\n    - **Problem:** `We wanted to see what models were used and find out if researchers had tested how well they worked.`\n    - **Suggestion:** Rephrase to more accurately reflect the review's goal of identifying and describing models. For example: `We searched for studies and reports to identify and describe the different ways eye care services are provided in local communities. Our goal was to understand the range of approaches being used.`\n\n3. **Make the main finding in the 'Results' section more specific.** The results are stated clearly but lose an important distinction found in the original review between community and primary care models.\n    - **Problem:** `We found eye care was provided in several ways, such as in schools, pharmacies, mobile clinics, vision centres, health centres, and through door-to-door visits.`\n    - **Suggestion:** Briefly group the findings to give a clearer picture of the results. For example: `In community settings, care was often provided in schools, pharmacies, or through outreach services (like mobile clinics). In primary care settings, models included vision centres, health centres, and door-to-door visits.`",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All 18 metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating strong sentence-level readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level at 7.8) and good use of plain language elements like personal pronouns. The text is statistically sound, but this analysis does not capture higher-level issues of clarity, precision, and redundancy that require editorial attention."
