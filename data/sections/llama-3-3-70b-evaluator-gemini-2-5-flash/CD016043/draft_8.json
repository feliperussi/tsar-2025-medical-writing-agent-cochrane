  "draft": "What are the best ways to provide eye care services in community and primary care settings to correct vision problems, such as refractive errors, which are often corrected with glasses?\n\nWe are not sure about the benefits and harms of different ways to provide local eye care for common vision problems, also known as refractive errors. This is because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\n\nWe found several ways that eye care is provided, such as in schools, pharmacies, mobile clinics, vision centres, health centres, and through door-to-door visits.\n\nWhat is uncorrected refractive error and why is it a problem?\nUncorrected refractive error is a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide. It occurs when the shape of the eye bends light incorrectly, which makes things look blurry. This condition can usually be fixed with the right pair of glasses, but many people, especially in low-resource settings, do not have access to eye care services.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to create a complete picture of all the different ways local eye care is provided, such as in clinics, schools, or through mobile services.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies and reports published up to November 2022. We looked at scientific databases and information from eye care organizations to find all the different ways local eye care is delivered.\n\nWhat were the main results of the review?\nIn community settings, care was often provided in schools, pharmacies, or through outreach services, like mobile clinics. In primary care settings, models included vision centres, health centres, and door-to-door visits.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small. Also, very few studies had actually tested how well these different ways of providing eye care worked, so we don’t know which are best.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to November 2022.\n\nFuture research should test how well these different ways of providing eye care work. This will help fill the gaps in our knowledge and guide countries on how to improve their eye care services.",

      "feedback": "This draft has a strong foundation with excellent readability, but it needs revision because a key section is factually incomplete and the main findings could be clearer. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: The methods section is incomplete.**\n   - **The problem:** The current description only mentions that you looked for different ways eye care is delivered. A primary goal of the review was also to find out *how these methods were evaluated*, which is missing. This context is essential for the reader to understand why the main conclusion is that we don't know which methods are best.\n   - **Current text:** \"We looked at scientific databases and information from eye care organizations to find all the different ways local eye care is delivered.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for studies and reports to identify the different ways local eye care is delivered. We also looked for information on how the effectiveness of these approaches was evaluated.\"\n\n2. **Make the main finding clearer in the 'Results' section.**\n   - **The problem:** The 'Results' section lists the types of services found but omits the review's other main finding: the lack of evidence evaluating these services. This is mentioned later as a limitation, but it's a key result of the review and should be stated here.\n   - **Current text:** \"In community settings, care was often provided in schools, pharmacies, or through outreach services, like mobile clinics. In primary care settings, models included vision centres, health centres, and door-to-door visits.\"\n   - **Suggested addition:** Add a concluding sentence to this paragraph, such as: \"However, we found very few studies that had actually tested how well these different services worked.\"\n\n3. **Combine the first two sentences for a stronger key message.**\n   - **The problem:** The first key message is split into two short, disconnected sentences. Combining them makes the point more direct and impactful for the reader.\n   - **Current text:** \"We are not sure about the benefits and harms of different ways to provide local eye care for common vision problems, also known as refractive errors. This is because there was not enough good-quality evidence.\"\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are not sure about the benefits and harms of different ways to provide local eye care for common vision problems (refractive errors) because we did not find enough good-quality evidence.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. All metrics fall within the median or best quartile ranges, indicating excellent readability. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is 8.40 and the average sentence length is low at 17.14 words. The feedback provided is not based on stylistic metrics but on critical issues of content completeness and accuracy that are not captured by the statistical analysis."
