  "key_messages": [
    "Regular use of mucolytics (medicines that help break down mucus) in children with chronic suppurative lung disease (a condition where the lungs are inflamed and produce excess mucus) may reduce the number of lung infections, but the current evidence is uncertain and based on a single small study with limitations, including a high risk of bias (a flaw in the study design that can affect the results).",
    "The study found some improvement in lung function with the use of hypertonic saline (a type of mucolytic), but no data were available on quality of life or the use of mucolytics during exacerbations (worsening of symptoms), and there were no reported harmful effects, although the study was too small to fully assess this.",
    "Further research is needed, including larger, well-designed studies that investigate different types of mucolytics and their effects on various outcomes, such as quality of life and long-term lung function, to provide more reliable answers to this important clinical question and to guide treatment decisions for children with chronic suppurative lung disease."

      "subheading": "What is chronic suppurative lung disease?",
      "content": "Chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) is a condition that affects the lungs and causes a long-term cough that brings up mucus. It's also known as an 'umbrella term' because it includes several different conditions, such as bronchiectasis and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB). These conditions can cause damage to the airways and make it harder for people to breathe. CSLD can be a significant problem for children, causing frequent infections, coughing, and difficulty breathing."

      "subheading": "Why is it important to find new treatments for chronic suppurative lung disease?",
      "content": "Currently, there are limited treatment options for CSLD, and researchers are looking for new ways to help manage the condition. One potential treatment is the use of mucolytic agents, which are medicines that help break down mucus in the lungs. Mucolytic agents have the potential to improve lung function, reduce the frequency of infections, and improve quality of life for people with CSLD."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to find out if mucolytic agents are effective in reducing exacerbations (worsening of symptoms), improving quality of life, and improving lung function in children with CSLD. They also wanted to assess the potential risks of using mucolytic agents, such as adverse events. The authors searched for studies that compared mucolytic agents with a placebo or no treatment in children with CSLD."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found one study that involved 63 children with chronic suppurative lung disease, with a mean age of 9.80 years and 42.3% male in the intervention group, and a mean age of 9.10 years and 38.4% male in the control group. The study lasted for eight weeks and was conducted in a hospital outpatient setting. The intervention was 3% hypertonic saline nebulised before chest physiotherapy, compared to a control arm of physiotherapy alone. We found no studies on oral mucolytics, other inhaled mucolytics, or mucolytic use during an exacerbation. The study was at high risk of bias due to unblinding, missing data, deviation from the intended intervention, and reporting bias. The review found that using hypertonic saline may reduce the rate of respiratory exacerbations and improve lung function in children with chronic suppurative lung disease, but the results are very uncertain. It is unclear if this treatment has an effect on outcome."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited by potential performance bias because participants may have known their treatment allocation, by incomplete reporting of outcomes in many studies, and by the small sample sizes of the trials, which reduces precision and generalizability.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to June 2022."
