  "draft": "Does giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding help them start sucking feeds earlier?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding may have little to no effect on how quickly they start sucking feeds.\n- The evidence for this intervention is not strong due to small study sizes and weaknesses in the methods used, such as unclear or lack of randomisation and blinding.\n- Future research should investigate the effect of exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds on important health outcomes, such as attainment of feeding skills, safety, feed tolerance, infection, and growth.\n\nWhat is preterm birth and why is feeding a problem?\nPreterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm infants often have difficulty coordinating sucking, swallowing, and breathing, making it hard for them to feed orally. As a result, they may need to be fed through a tube, which can lead to feeding intolerance and delay them from starting to feed fully by mouth.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for feeding problems in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants who have trouble feeding may be given nutrition through a tube, known as orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. However, this method can bypass the baby's sense of smell and taste, which help babies digest and absorb their food. Researchers are testing if giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding helps them switch to oral feeding sooner.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine whether exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding can help them transition to full oral feeding more quickly and safely. They also wanted to know if this method has any adverse effects (unwanted or harmful effects) and if it can reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies) and late infection (infections that occur after the initial treatment).\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving preterm infants the smell or taste of milk during tube feeding versus not doing so. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1277 preterm infants. These studies tested if giving the smell or taste of milk helped preterm infants start sucking feeds sooner, without causing harm. Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on time to reach full sucking feeds and time to reach full tube feeds (also called enteral feeds). The intervention probably makes little to no difference to the risk of late infection. It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, and there is not enough information to determine its effect on feeding intolerance.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and had weaknesses in their methods. For example, it wasn't always clear how babies were assigned to treatment groups, which could affect the results. Also, the studies included different types of babies and used different methods, which makes them difficult to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",

The main issues are inconsistent use of pronouns ('we' vs. 'the review authors'), some noun-heavy phrases that make sentences less direct, and a few instances of technical wording that could be simplified for a lay audience.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Use 'we' consistently when referring to the review authors.** The draft switches between 'the review authors' and 'we'. Using 'we' throughout makes the summary more direct and personal.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"What did the review authors want to find out? The review authors wanted to determine...\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out...\"\n\n2. **Replace noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations) with direct verbs.** Some sentences use formal noun forms where a simple verb would be clearer and more active.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"...on important health outcomes, such as attainment of feeding skills, safety, feed tolerance, infection, and growth.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...on important health outcomes, such as how well infants learn to feed, their safety, how well they handle feeds, infection, and growth.\"\n\n3. **Simplify technical or clinical phrasing.** Some phrases, while accurate, are clunky and could be rephrased in more everyday language.\n   - **Problematic Text:** \"Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on time to reach full sucking feeds and time to reach full tube feeds (also called enteral feeds).\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Giving infants the smell and taste of milk may not change how long it takes for them to start feeding fully by mouth (sucking feeds) or by tube (enteral feeds).\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft is highly readable and conforms well to typical PLS patterns, with 67% of metrics falling in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly in three areas related to vocabulary and style: nominalization (P90), noun count (P90), and the use of complex Dale-Chall words (P90). This analysis supports the editorial feedback, indicating that the text relies too heavily on formal, noun-based phrasing and could be simplified by using more common verbs and active sentence structures."
