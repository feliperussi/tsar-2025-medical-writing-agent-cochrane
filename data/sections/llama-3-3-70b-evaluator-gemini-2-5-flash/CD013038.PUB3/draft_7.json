  "draft": "Does giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding help them start sucking feeds earlier?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding may have little to no effect on how quickly they start sucking feeds.\n- The evidence for this intervention is not strong due to small study sizes and weaknesses in the methods used, such as unclear or lack of randomisation and blinding.\n- Future research should investigate the effect of exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds on important health outcomes, such as how well infants learn to feed, their safety, how well they handle feeds, infection, and growth.\n\nWhat is preterm birth and why is feeding a problem?\nPreterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm infants often have difficulty coordinating sucking, swallowing, and breathing, making it hard for them to feed orally. As a result, they may need to be fed through a tube, which can lead to feeding intolerance and delay them from starting to feed fully by mouth.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for feeding problems in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants who have trouble feeding may be given nutrition through a tube, known as orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. However, this method can bypass the baby's sense of smell and taste, which help babies digest and absorb their food. Researchers are testing if giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding helps them switch to oral feeding sooner.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to determine whether exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding can help them transition to full oral feeding more quickly and safely. We also wanted to know if this method has any adverse effects (unwanted or harmful effects) and if it can reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies) and late infection (infections that occur after the initial treatment).\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving preterm infants the smell or taste of milk during tube feeding versus not doing so. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1277 preterm infants. These studies tested if giving the smell or taste of milk helped preterm infants start sucking feeds sooner, without causing harm. Giving infants the smell and taste of milk may not change how long it takes for them to start feeding fully by mouth (sucking feeds) or by tube (enteral feeds). The intervention probably makes little to no difference to the risk of late infection. It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, and there is not enough information to determine its effect on feeding intolerance.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and had weaknesses in their methods. For example, it wasn't always clear how babies were assigned to treatment groups, which could affect the results. Also, the studies included different types of babies and used different methods, which makes them difficult to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",
