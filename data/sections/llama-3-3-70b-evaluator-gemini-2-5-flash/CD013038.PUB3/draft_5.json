  "draft": "Does giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding help them start sucking feeds earlier?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding may have little to no effect on how quickly they start sucking feeds.\n- The evidence for this intervention is not strong due to small study sizes and methodological limitations.\n- Future research should investigate the effect of exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds on important health outcomes.\n\nWhat is preterm birth and why is feeding a problem?\nPreterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of gestation. Preterm infants often have difficulty coordinating sucking, swallowing, and breathing, making it hard for them to feed orally. As a result, they may need to be fed through a tube, which can lead to feeding intolerance and delay them from starting to feed fully by mouth.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for feeding problems in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants who have trouble feeding may be given nutrition through a tube, known as orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. However, this method can bypass the baby's sense of smell and taste, which are important for digestion and absorption. Researchers are testing if giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding helps them switch to oral feeding sooner.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine whether exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding can help them transition to full oral feeding more quickly and safely. They also wanted to know if this method has any adverse effects and if it can reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies) and late infection (infections that occur after the initial treatment).\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for all relevant studies and checked the quality of their evidence. We looked for studies that evaluated exposure to the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds in preterm infants.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1277 preterm infants. These studies tested if giving the smell or taste of milk helped preterm infants start sucking feeds sooner, without causing harm. Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on time to reach full sucking feeds and time to reach full enteral feeds. The intervention probably makes little to no difference to the risk of late infection. It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, and there is not enough information to determine its effect on feeding intolerance.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were small and had methodological limitations. Also, the studies included different types of babies and used different methods, which makes them difficult to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",

To make it even more accessible for a lay audience, I recommend focusing on these four areas:\n\n1. **Explain all technical terms.** Some terms might be unfamiliar to readers.\n    *   **Instead of:** \"...born before 37 weeks of gestation.\"\n    *   **Consider:** \"...born before 37 weeks of pregnancy.\"\n    *   **Instead of:** \"...time to reach full enteral feeds.\"\n    *   **Consider:** \"...time to reach full tube feeds (also called enteral feeds).\"\n\n2. **Be more specific about the evidence limitations.** The phrase \"methodological limitations\" is vague for a non-expert audience.\n    *   **Instead of:** \"The evidence is limited because the studies were small and had methodological limitations.\"\n    *   **Consider:** \"We have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and had weaknesses in their methods. For example, it wasn't always clear how babies were assigned to treatment groups, which could affect the results.\"\n\n3. **Make the 'Methods' section more informative.** The current description is a bit generic and repetitive.\n    *   **Instead of:** \"We searched for all relevant studies and checked the quality of their evidence. We looked for studies that evaluated exposure to the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds in preterm infants.\"\n    *   **Consider:** \"We searched for studies that compared giving preterm infants the smell or taste of milk during tube feeds versus not doing so. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\"\n\n4. **Use more active verbs instead of nouns.** The linguistic analysis noted a high number of 'nominalizations' (nouns made from verbs). Changing these can make sentences more direct.\n    *   **Instead of:** \"...which are important for digestion and absorption.\"\n    *   **Consider:** \"...which helps babies digest and absorb their food.\"\n\nAddressing these points will ensure the summary is as clear and helpful as possible for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 14 of 18 metrics (77.8%) falling in the best quartile for readability and style. However, the analysis identified a significant deviation in the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which is in the 90th percentile. This suggests the text could be made more direct and active by converting some nouns back into verbs."
