  "draft": "Does giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding help them start sucking feeds earlier?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding may have little to no effect on how quickly they start sucking feeds.\n- The evidence for this intervention is not strong due to small study sizes and weaknesses in the methods used.\n- Future research should investigate the effect of exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds on important health outcomes.\n\nWhat is preterm birth and why is feeding a problem?\nPreterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm infants often have difficulty coordinating sucking, swallowing, and breathing, making it hard for them to feed orally. As a result, they may need to be fed through a tube, which can lead to feeding intolerance and delay them from starting to feed fully by mouth.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for feeding problems in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants who have trouble feeding may be given nutrition through a tube, known as orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. However, this method can bypass the baby's sense of smell and taste, which help babies digest and absorb their food. Researchers are testing if giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding helps them switch to oral feeding sooner.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to determine whether exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding can help them transition to full oral feeding more quickly and safely. We also wanted to know if this method has any adverse effects and if it can reduce the risk of complications.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving preterm infants the smell or taste of milk during tube feeding versus not doing so. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1277 preterm infants. These studies tested if giving the smell or taste of milk helped preterm infants start sucking feeds sooner, without causing harm. Giving infants the smell and taste of milk may not change how long it takes for them to start feeding fully by mouth or by tube. The intervention probably makes little to no difference to the risk of late infection. It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, and there is not enough information to determine its effect on feeding intolerance.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and had weaknesses in their methods. For example, it wasn't always clear how babies were assigned to treatment groups, which could affect the results. Also, the studies included different types of babies and used different methods, which makes them difficult to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a strong draft with excellent readability scores. However, it is NOT_APPROVED because a few critical clarity issues need to be addressed to ensure patients can fully understand the findings. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Define technical medical terms.** The summary uses important terms that a lay reader won't know. Providing simple definitions is essential for understanding.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** 'It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, and there is not enough information to determine its effect on feeding intolerance.'\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** 'It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where the gut becomes inflamed and can die). There is not enough information to determine its effect on feeding intolerance (problems like vomiting or a swollen belly after a feed).'\n\n2. **Clarify the main finding about feeding.** The current wording combines two separate outcomes (feeding by mouth and by tube) in a way that could be confusing.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** 'Giving infants the smell and taste of milk may not change how long it takes for them to start feeding fully by mouth or by tube.'\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** 'Giving infants the smell and taste of milk may have little to no effect on the time it takes them to feed fully by mouth. It also may not change the time it takes to get them onto full tube feeds.'\n\n3. **Correct a minor grammatical error.** A small error disrupts the flow of an important sentence about the review's aims.\n    - **Problematic sentence:** '...if this method has any adverse effects and if it can be reduce the risk of complications.'\n    - **Suggested rewrite:** '...if this method has any adverse effects and if it can reduce the risk of complications.'\n\nWhile the draft's statistical metrics are outstanding, addressing these content-level issues will ensure the summary is not just easy to read, but also easy to understand accurately.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are excellent, with all 18 metrics falling into the best quartile for statistical conformity with typical PLS patterns. This indicates a highly readable text with short sentences (average 19 words), low passive voice (7 instances), and simple vocabulary (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 8.8). The draft strongly adheres to the structural and stylistic principles of plain language writing."
