  "draft": "Does giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding help them start sucking feeds earlier?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding may have little to no effect on how quickly they start sucking feeds.\n- The evidence for this intervention is not strong due to small study sizes and methodological limitations.\n- Future research should investigate the effect of exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds on important health outcomes.\n\nWhat is preterm birth and why is feeding a problem?\nPreterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of gestation. Preterm infants often have difficulty coordinating sucking, swallowing, and breathing, making it hard for them to feed orally. As a result, they may need to be fed through a tube, which can lead to feeding intolerance and delay the transition to full oral feeding.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for feeding problems in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants who have trouble feeding may be given nutrition through a tube, known as orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. However, this method can bypass the baby's sense of smell and taste, which are important for digestion and absorption. Researchers are looking into ways to provide preterm infants with the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding to see if it can help them transition to oral feeding more quickly.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine whether exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding can help them transition to full oral feeding more quickly and safely. They also wanted to know if this method has any adverse effects and if it can reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies) and late infection (infections that occur after the initial treatment).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1277 preterm infants. The studies were conducted to assess whether exposure to the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds can accelerate the transition to full sucking feeds without adverse effects in preterm infants. The included studies had small sample sizes and methodological limitations. Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on time to reach full sucking feeds and time to reach full enteral feeds. The intervention probably makes little to no difference to the risk of late infection. It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, and there is not enough information to determine its effect on feeding intolerance.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, it needs a few revisions to improve clarity and make it easier for readers to understand. The main issue is the use of complex, noun-heavy phrases instead of simple, direct verbs. Addressing the 3 points below will make the summary much more reader-friendly.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Replace complex noun phrases with simple verbs.**\nSome sentences are less direct because they use noun forms of verbs (e.g., \"make a decision\" instead of \"decide\"). Using more direct action verbs will make the text clearer.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"The studies were conducted to assess whether exposure to the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds can accelerate the transition to full sucking feeds without adverse effects in preterm infants.\"\n- **Reason:** This sentence is long (31 words) and uses wordy phrases like \"conducted to assess\" and \"accelerate the transition.\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"These studies tested if giving the smell or taste of milk helped preterm infants start sucking feeds sooner, without causing harm.\"\n\n**2. Simplify wordy and repetitive language.**\nSome phrases are repeated or could be stated more simply, which would improve readability.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"Researchers are looking into ways to provide preterm infants with the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding to see if it can help them transition to oral feeding more quickly.\"\n- **Reason:** The phrasing \"looking into ways to provide\" and \"transition to... more quickly\" is indirect.\n- **Suggested rewrite:** \"Researchers are testing if giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding helps them switch to oral feeding sooner.\"\n\n**3. Improve the flow of the 'What did we find?' section.**\nThis section should focus only on the results of the studies. Comments on the quality of the evidence belong in the 'Limitations' section.\n\n- **Problematic sentence:** \"The included studies had small sample sizes and methodological limitations.\"\n- **Reason:** This sentence about limitations interrupts the summary of the findings. It is correctly explained in the next section, \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n- **Suggested rewrite:** Remove this sentence from the \"What did we find?\" section to avoid repetition and improve the flow. The information is already in the right place in the limitations section.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 77.8% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. Readability scores are excellent (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is 10.96). However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the 'nominalization' score is in the 90th percentile. This confirms the editorial feedback that the text relies too heavily on complex noun phrases instead of direct verbs, which can make sentences harder to process for readers."
