  "draft": "Does giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding help them start sucking feeds earlier?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding may have little to no effect on how quickly they start feeding fully by mouth.\n- The evidence for this intervention is not strong due to small study sizes and weaknesses in the methods used.\n- Future research should investigate the effect of exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds on important health outcomes.\n\nWhat is preterm birth and why is feeding a problem?\nPreterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm infants often have difficulty coordinating sucking, swallowing, and breathing, making it hard for them to feed orally. As a result, they may need to be fed through a tube, which can lead to feeding intolerance (problems like vomiting or a swollen belly after a feed) and delay them from starting to feed fully by mouth.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for feeding problems in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants who have trouble feeding may be given nutrition through a tube, known as orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. However, this method can bypass the baby's sense of smell and taste, which help babies digest and absorb their food. Researchers are testing if giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding helps them switch to oral feeding sooner.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\nWe wanted to determine whether exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding can help them transition to full oral feeding more quickly and safely. We also wanted to know if this method has any adverse effects and if it can reduce the risk of complications.\n\nWhat methods did we use?\nWe searched for studies that compared giving preterm infants the smell or taste of milk during tube feeding versus not doing so. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the overall evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1277 preterm infants. These studies tested if giving the smell or taste of milk helped preterm infants start sucking feeds sooner, without causing harm. Giving infants the smell and taste of milk may have little to no effect on the time it takes them to feed fully by mouth. It also may not change how quickly babies could take all their feedings through their feeding tube, allowing them to stop IV (intravenous) nutrition. The intervention probably makes little to no difference to the risk of late infection. It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where the gut becomes inflamed and can die). There is not enough information to determine its effect on feeding intolerance (problems like vomiting or a swollen belly after a feed).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and had weaknesses in their methods. For example, it wasn't always clear how babies were assigned to treatment groups, which could affect the results. Also, the studies included different types of babies and used different methods, which makes them difficult to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for completeness, accuracy, and length. However, it is not approved because several clarity issues could confuse a lay reader. The feedback below focuses on making the language more direct and the key concepts easier to follow.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Replace Noun-Heavy Phrases with Direct Verbs:** The writing often uses nouns where stronger verbs would be clearer and more direct. This makes sentences more abstract and harder to read.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Preterm infants often have difficulty coordinating sucking, swallowing, and breathing...\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"have difficulty coordinating\" is less direct than a simple verb. Using more verbs makes the text feel more active and easier to process.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Preterm infants often cannot coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing...\"\n\n**2. Clarify and Standardize Feeding Terminology:** The summary discusses different types of feeding ('sucking feeds', 'oral feeding', 'feedings through their feeding tube') without clearly explaining the progression or the difference between them.\n   - **Problematic phrasing:** The results mention no effect on 'time to feed fully by mouth' and also no effect on 'how quickly babies could take all their feedings through their feeding tube'.\n   - **Why it's an issue:** A reader might not understand that these are two different outcomes. It's unclear that 'feeding through a tube' (enteral feeding) is the starting point and 'feeding by mouth' (sucking feeds) is the goal.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** In the background section, add a sentence to clarify the process. For example: \"Babies first get nutrition through a tube. The goal is to help them learn to feed by mouth (sucking feeds) so they no longer need the tube.\" Then, use these terms consistently throughout the results.\n\n**3. Simplify the Explanation of Key Results:** One sentence in the results section combines two different outcomes, making it long and difficult to understand.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"It also may not change how quickly babies could take all their feedings through their feeding tube, allowing them to stop IV (intravenous) nutrition.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This sentence merges the findings for two separate outcomes from the original abstract ('time to reach full enteral feeds' and 'duration of parenteral nutrition'). Stating them separately would be much clearer.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"It also may have little to no effect on the time it took for babies to get all their food through the tube. It may also not change how long they needed nutrition given through a vein (IV).\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Linguistic Analysis:**\nYour draft is very readable overall, but the suggestions above are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found that the use of nouns and nominalizations (verbs turned into nouns) was higher than in a typical Plain Language Summary. Addressing these points will make an already good draft even clearer for patients and their families.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 77.8% of features falling within the best quartile for readability and style. The word count is well within the limit. However, the analysis identified two metrics that deviate from typical patterns: 'nominalization' (P90) and 'nouns' (P90). This indicates that the text relies more heavily on noun forms instead of direct verbs, which supports the editorial recommendation to make the language more active and direct to improve clarity."
