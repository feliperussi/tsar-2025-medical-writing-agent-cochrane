  "draft": "# Does giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding help them start sucking feeds earlier?\n**Key Messages**\n- Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on time to reach full sucking feeds in preterm infants (preterm infants are babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy), and no clear difference was found in safety outcomes, including adverse effects (unwanted or harmful effects), necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies), and late infection (infections that occur after the initial treatment).\n- The evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention is not strong due to small sample sizes and methodological limitations in the included studies, which means the findings should be interpreted with caution.\n- Future research should investigate the effect of exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds on important health outcomes, such as attainment of feeding skills, safety, feed tolerance, infection, and growth, and should be designed to detect effects in different gestational ages and sexes.\n**Introduction**\n### What is preterm birth and why is feeding a problem?\nPreterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of gestation. Preterm infants often have difficulty coordinating sucking, swallowing, and breathing, making it hard for them to feed orally. As a result, they may need to be fed through a tube, which can lead to feeding intolerance and delay the transition to full oral feeding.\n### What are the common treatments for feeding problems in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants who have trouble feeding may be given nutrition through a tube, known as orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. However, this method can bypass the baby's sense of smell and taste, which are important for digestion and absorption. Researchers are looking into ways to provide preterm infants with the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding to see if it can help them transition to oral feeding more quickly.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine whether exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding can help them transition to full oral feeding more quickly and safely. They also wanted to know if this method has any adverse effects and if it can reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis and late infection.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies that evaluated exposure to the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds in preterm infants, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1277 preterm infants. The studies were conducted to assess whether exposure to the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds can accelerate the transition to full sucking feeds without adverse effects in preterm infants. The included studies had small sample sizes and methodological limitations. The population characteristics included preterm infants, with no specific information on age, gender, or severity of condition. The study settings were not specified in terms of countries, but the searches were conducted in multiple databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Epistemonikos. The types of interventions and comparisons included exposure to the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds versus no exposure. No information was available on the duration of the studies or the funding sources. Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on time to reach full sucking feeds and time to reach full enteral feeds. The intervention probably makes little to no difference to the risk of the risk of late infection. It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, and there is not enough information to determine its effect on feeding intolerance.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",

However, several key metrics deviate significantly, suggesting areas for improvement. The `words_per_sentence` (24.83, P90) is too high, indicating sentences are generally too long. `Nominalization` (39.00, BEYOND_P90) and `nouns` (227.00, BEYOND_P90) are significantly higher than typical, pointing to a noun-heavy and less active writing style. Additionally, `smog_index` (13.68, P90), `complex_words_dc` (271.00, P90), and `long_words` (213.00, BEYOND_P90) are all higher than typical, suggesting the vocabulary and overall text complexity could be simplified for a plain language audience."
