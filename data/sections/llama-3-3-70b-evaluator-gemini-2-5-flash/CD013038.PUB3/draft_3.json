  "draft": "Does giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding help them start sucking feeds earlier?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding may have little to no effect on how quickly they start sucking feeds.\n- The evidence for this intervention is not strong due to small study sizes and methodological limitations.\n- Future research should investigate the effect of exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds on important health outcomes.\n\nWhat is preterm birth and why is feeding a problem?\nPreterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of gestation. Preterm infants often have difficulty coordinating sucking, swallowing, and breathing, making it hard for them to feed orally. As a result, they may need to be fed through a tube, which can lead to feeding intolerance and delay the transition to full oral feeding.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for feeding problems in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants who have trouble feeding may be given nutrition through a tube, known as orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. However, this method can bypass the baby's sense of smell and taste, which are important for digestion and absorption. Researchers are testing if giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding helps them switch to oral feeding sooner.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine whether exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding can help them transition to full oral feeding more quickly and safely. They also wanted to know if this method has any adverse effects and if it can reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies) and late infection (infections that occur after the initial treatment).\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1277 preterm infants. These studies tested if giving the smell or taste of milk helped preterm infants start sucking feeds sooner, without causing harm. Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on time to reach full sucking feeds and time to reach full enteral feeds. The intervention probably makes little to no difference to the risk of late infection. It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, and there is not enough information to determine its effect on feeding intolerance.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",

Additionally, several clarity issues need to be addressed to ensure the summary is understandable for a lay audience. Key terminology for feeding methods is used inconsistently, technical terms are left undefined in the main text, and some sentences are unnecessarily complex due to the use of noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations). Addressing these points will significantly improve the summary's readability and helpfulness.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms with typical PLS patterns, with 83% of features falling in the best quartile for readability and style. However, there is one significant deviation: the 'nominalization' score is 25.0, placing it in the 90th percentile. This indicates an over-reliance on turning verbs into nouns (e.g., 'make a decision' instead of 'decide'), which can make the text less direct and harder to read. This metric supports the editorial recommendation to rephrase sentences using more active verbs."
