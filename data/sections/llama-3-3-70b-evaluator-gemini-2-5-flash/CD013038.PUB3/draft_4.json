  "draft": "Does giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding help them start sucking feeds earlier?\n\nKey messages:\n- We found that giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding may have little to no effect on how quickly they start sucking feeds.\n- The evidence for this intervention is not strong due to small study sizes and methodological limitations.\n- Future research should investigate the effect of exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds on important health outcomes.\n\nWhat is preterm birth and why is feeding a problem?\nPreterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of gestation. Preterm infants often have difficulty coordinating sucking, swallowing, and breathing, making it hard for them to feed orally. As a result, they may need to be fed through a tube, which can lead to feeding intolerance and delay the transition to full oral feeding.\n\nWhat are the common treatments for feeding problems in preterm infants?\nPreterm infants who have trouble feeding may be given nutrition through a tube, known as orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. However, this method can bypass the baby's sense of smell and taste, which are important for digestion and absorption. Researchers are testing if giving preterm infants the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding helps them switch to oral feeding sooner.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to determine whether exposing preterm infants to the smell and taste of milk during tube feeding can help them transition to full oral feeding more quickly and safely. They also wanted to know if this method has any adverse effects and if it can reduce the risk of complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (a serious condition where a portion of the bowel dies) and late infection (infections that occur after the initial treatment).\n\nWhat methods did the review authors use?\nWe searched for studies that evaluated exposure to the smell or taste of milk with tube feeds in preterm infants. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence. We used a systematic approach to identify relevant studies and assessed the quality of the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 8 studies that involved 1277 preterm infants. These studies tested if giving the smell or taste of milk helped preterm infants start sucking feeds sooner, without causing harm. Exposure to the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds may have little to no effect on time to reach full sucking feeds and time to reach full enteral feeds. The intervention probably makes little to no difference to the risk of late infection. It is unclear if the intervention has an effect on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, and there is not enough information to determine its effect on feeding intolerance.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes, possible lack of blinding (participants may have known which treatment they received), and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to April 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it can be made clearer and more direct for a lay audience by addressing a pattern of overly formal language. The PLS evaluation metrics support this, showing an unusually high number of nouns and nominalizations (verbs turned into nouns). Focusing on the following 3 improvements will make the summary more accessible.\n\n1. **Replace abstract nouns (nominalizations) with direct verbs.** This makes sentences more active and easier to understand.\n   - **Problem:** \"...delay the transition to full oral feeding.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** The word \"transition\" is an abstract noun. Using a verb is more direct.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...delay them from starting to feed fully by mouth.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex, technical phrases in the limitations section.** The current wording is dense and uses jargon.\n   - **Problem:** \"The evidence is limited by... heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This phrase is full of technical terms and is hard to unpack. It's clearer to explain *what* was different between the studies.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Also, the studies included different types of babies and used different methods, which makes them difficult to compare.\"\n\n3. **Make the methods section more direct.** The current phrasing is slightly passive and formal.\n   - **Problem:** \"We used a systematic approach to identify relevant studies and assessed the quality of the evidence.\"\n   - **Why it's an issue:** This is a bit wordy. Stating the action directly is simpler.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We searched for all relevant studies and checked the quality of their evidence.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 72.2% of metrics in the best quartile for readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is in the best 25% of PLS). However, it deviates significantly in two key areas: the count of nouns is high (P90), and the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is exceptionally high (BEYOND_P90). These metrics suggest the text may be overly formal and less direct than ideal, even though basic readability scores are good."
