It has a poor prognosis, with a median survival of only 16 months. The tumor's environment suppresses the immune system, making it hard for the body to fight the cancer. Current treatments have limited effectiveness, and new approaches are needed to improve patient outcomes.\n### What are immune checkpoint inhibitors and how do they work?\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a type of cancer treatment that helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. They work by blocking specific proteins, such as PD-1 and PD-L1, that cancer cells use to evade the immune system. By blocking these proteins, ICIs allow the immune system to target and destroy cancer cells more effectively.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of ICIs, specifically anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, in treating adults with diffuse glioma. They aimed to determine whether these treatments can improve overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life, while also examining their potential side effects.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies to other treatments in adults with diffuse glioma, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found seven studies that involved 1953 people with diffuse glioma. The biggest study was in 716 people and the smallest study was in 35 people. Most trials had high risk of bias. The studies were conducted in various settings and countries, although specific details about the countries are not provided. The interventions used were anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, including nivolumab and pembrolizumab, which were compared to placebo or other therapies. The population characteristics, such as age and gender, are not explicitly stated in the abstract. The duration of the studies is also not specified. There is no information provided about the funding sources of the studies.\n### Main results: Treatment outcomes for diffuse glioma\nThe review found that nivolumab alone probably has no benefit in treating recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Anti-PD1 plus bevacizumab may also be ineffective. Neoadjuvant plus adjuvant pembrolizumab may improve overall survival and progression-free survival, but this is based on very low-certainty evidence. In newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme, nivolumab plus radiotherapy probably has no benefit. In older participants, adjuvant nivolumab probably offers no benefit.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies were very small, participants may have known which treatment they received (potential lack of blinding), and not all studies reported all outcomes of interest.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to March 2024.",

'Smog_index' (14.22), 'complex_words' (138.0), and 'long_words' (205.0) are in the P90 range, suggesting higher grade level readability and too many complex/long words. 'Words_per_sentence' (23.93) and 'passive_voice' (14.00) are in the P75 range, suggesting sentences could be shorter and more active voice could be used."
