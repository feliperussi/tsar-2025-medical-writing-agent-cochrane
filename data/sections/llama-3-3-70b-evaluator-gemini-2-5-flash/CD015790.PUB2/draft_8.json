  "draft": "Do self-management programs (teaching people skills to manage their condition) improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment (difficulty seeing)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Self-management programs may have little to no effect on improving quality of life for adults with visual impairment, and they may not increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful effects) either.\n- Our confidence in this result is low because the studies included were small and very different from each other, which makes them hard to compare.\n- More research is needed to develop better measures of quality of life and to understand how self-management programs might help people at different stages of visual impairment, including those with both visual and hearing difficulties (dual-sensory impairment).\n\nWhat is visual impairment and why is it a problem?\nVisual impairment affects more than 2200 million people worldwide, mostly older adults due to age-related eye diseases. This major health concern can make it harder for people to do daily tasks and can affect their mental health. Self-management programs teach people skills to manage their condition. They aim to help people live more independently and improve their overall well-being.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if these self-management programs improve quality of life for adults with vision problems. We compared people who took part in a program with people who received usual care or no program.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared self-management programs with usual care or no program. We then combined the results and judged how certain the evidence made us.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur main finding from 20 studies was that self-management programs may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with visual impairment. These studies included a total of 3151 people from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Most participants were older adults, between 60 and 84 years old.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and were also very different from each other. For example, they included people at different stages of visual impairment and used a wide variety of teaching methods, which makes their results difficult to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",

I'm marking it as 'Not Approved' to highlight one specific pattern that, if addressed, will make the summary even more direct and easier for readers to follow. My feedback focuses on turning noun phrases into action verbs.\n\n**Top 2...**\n\n**Top 2 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Use Strong Verbs Instead of Noun Phrases (Nominalizations)**\n\nYour sentences sometimes use the noun form of a verb, which can make them feel less direct. Changing these to action verbs will make the text more engaging.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"Our main finding from 20 studies was that self-management programs may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with visual impairment.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** The phrase \"Our main finding was that...\" is less direct than simply stating what you found.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We found that in 20 studies, self-management programs may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with visual impairment.\"\n\n- **Problematic Subheading:** \"What are the limitations of the evidence?\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** This is a standard heading, but it can be phrased more directly for a lay audience.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"How reliable is the evidence?\"\n\n**2. Be More Specific in the Key Messages**\n\nThe explanation for the low confidence is a bit vague in the  key messages. You provide excellent detail later in the limitations section that could be briefly introduced earlier.\n\n- **Problematic Sentence:** \"Our confidence in this result is low because the studies included were small and very different from each other, which makes them hard to compare.\"\n- **Why it's an issue:** Readers might not understand *why* being 'different' is a problem.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in this result is low because the studies were small and tested many different types of programs. This makes it hard to compare results and draw firm conclusions.\"\n\nBy making these small changes, you can make an already great summary even more active and clear for the reader.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results are excellent, with the draft highly conforming to typical PLS patterns. 13 of 18 (72%) metrics fall into the best quartile for readability and clarity, including words per sentence (17.91), passive voice (4 instances), and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (9.24). However, there is one significant deviation: the 'nominalization' count is 26, placing it in the 90th percentile (P90). This indicates a pattern of using noun forms of verbs, which can make the text less direct and active than is typical for a PLS."
