  "key_messages": [
    "Self-management programs (teaching people skills to manage their condition) may have little to no effect on improving quality of life for adults with visual impairment (difficulty seeing), and they may not increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful effects) either.",
    "The current evidence is not strong enough to fully understand the benefits and risks of self-management interventions for people with visual impairment, partly because the studies were quite different from each other.",
    "More research is needed to develop better measures of quality of life and to understand how self-management programs might help people at different stages of visual impairment, including those with both visual and hearing difficulties (dual-sensory impairment)."

      "subheading": "What is visual impairment and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Visual impairment is a major health concern that affects more than 2200 million people worldwide, predominantly older adults due to age-related ocular diseases. It can lead to functional and psychological decline, emphasizing the need for effective self-management interventions. Self-management interventions aim to enhance individuals' abilities to manage their condition, maintain activities of daily living, and improve overall well-being."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to assess the effects of self-management interventions on quality of life in adults with visual impairment compared with inactive or active control interventions. They aimed to determine whether multifaceted self-management interventions can improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) in adults with visual impairment."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 20 studies that involved 3151 participants with visual impairment. The size of the studies ranged from 30 to 323 participants, with a median of 153 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries, including Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America, and took place in academic medical centers, hospitals, low-vision clinics, private practice, rehabilitation centers, and Veterans Affairs medical facilities. The participants were older adults, with a mean age ranging from 60 to 84 years, and the mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity ranged from 0.15 to 1.11. Age-related macular degeneration was the predominant cause of low vision in 15 studies. One study was funded by industry, while others received research grants or support from non‑profit organizations or foundations. The multifaceted self‑management interventions included in this review were diverse, with control groups placed on a wait list or receiving usual care, optical aids, or low‑vision rehabilitation. Unfortunately, we did not identify any eligible studies for adults with dual sensory impairment. Self‑management interventions may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with visual impairment. It is unclear if self‑management interventions have an effect on quality of life for adults with visual impairment."
