  "draft": "Do self-management programs (teaching people skills to manage their condition) improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment (difficulty seeing)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Self-management programs may have little to no effect on improving quality of life for adults with visual impairment, and they may not increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful effects) either.\n- The current evidence is not strong enough to fully understand the benefits and risks of self-management interventions for people with visual impairment, partly because the studies were quite different from each other.\n- More research is needed to develop better measures of quality of life and to understand how self-management programs might help people at different stages of visual impairment, including those with both visual and hearing difficulties (dual-sensory impairment).\n\nWhat is visual impairment and why is it a problem?\nVisual impairment is a major health concern that affects more than 2200 million people worldwide, predominantly older adults due to age-related ocular diseases. It can lead to functional and psychological decline, emphasizing the need for effective self-management interventions. Self-management interventions aim to enhance individuals' abilities to manage their condition, maintain activities of daily living, and improve overall well-being.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to assess the effects of self-management interventions on quality of life in adults with visual impairment compared with inactive or active control interventions. They aimed to determine whether multifaceted self-management interventions can improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) in adults with visual impairment.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing self-management interventions with inactive or active controls in adults with visual impairment. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 20 studies that involved 3151 participants with visual impairment. The size of the studies ranged from 30 to 323 participants, with a median of 153 participants. The studies were conducted in various countries, including Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. The participants were older adults, with a mean age ranging from 60 to 84 years. Age-related macular degeneration was the predominant cause of low vision in 15 studies. Self-management interventions may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with visual impairment.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and by heterogeneity in participant types and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",

      "feedback": "This summary is factually accurate and well-structured, but it is not yet ready for publication. Several sections appear to be copied directly from the technical abstract, making the language too complex and abstract for a general audience. The key areas for improvement involve simplifying technical terms and rephrasing noun-heavy sentences to be more direct and active.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the introduction to be more concrete.** The current text uses abstract language that is hard for readers to connect with.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"It can lead to functional and psychological decline, emphasizing the need for effective self-management interventions. Self-management interventions aim to enhance individuals' abilities to manage their condition...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Terms like \"functional and psychological decline\" and \"enhance individuals' abilities\" are vague and academic. The repeated use of \"interventions\" is jargon.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"This can make it harder for people to do daily tasks and can affect their mental health. To help with this, people can learn skills to manage their condition in programs called 'self-management programs'. These programs aim to help people live more independently and improve their overall well-being.\"\n\n2. **Clarify the review's aims and remove jargon.** The section explaining the review's purpose is repetitive and uses technical terms without explanation.\n   - **Problematic text:** \"The review authors wanted to assess the effects of self-management interventions on quality of life in adults with visual impairment compared with inactive or active control interventions. They aimed to determine whether multifaceted self-management interventions can improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and vision-related quality of life (VRQoL)...\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** \"Inactive or active control interventions\" is jargon. The acronyms (HRQoL, VRQoL) are unnecessary as they are not used again. The two sentences say almost the same thing.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if these self-management programs improve quality of life for adults with vision problems. We compared people who took part in a program with people who received usual care or no program.\"\n\n3. **Make the main finding the focus of the results section.** The most important result is currently buried at the end of a paragraph filled with demographic details.\n   - **Problematic text:** The \"What did we find?\" section lists many details about the studies (participant numbers, locations, ages) and only at the very end states: \"Self-management interventions may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with visual impairment.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Readers have to get through a lot of secondary information before reaching the main point. The key finding should come first.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Our main finding from 20 studies was that self-management programs may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with visual impairment. These studies included a total of 3151 people from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Most participants were older adults, between 60 and 84 years old.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your instinct to simplify the language is supported by the linguistic analysis. The draft has a very high number of 'nominalizations' (36 instances), which are abstract nouns made from verbs (like 'decline' instead of 'declining'). This score is well beyond the typical range for a PLS and is a key reason the text feels academic. Converting these nouns back into active verbs will significantly improve clarity.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good conformity overall, with most metrics falling within the typical range for a Plain Language Summary. However, it highlights one significant deviation: the use of nominalizations (abstract nouns formed from verbs) is exceptionally high (36 instances), falling beyond the 90th percentile. This suggests the text is more abstract and less direct than a typical PLS. Several readability and vocabulary metrics are also in the P75 range, indicating the text is more complex than 50-75% of comparable summaries, which supports the need to simplify technical language."
