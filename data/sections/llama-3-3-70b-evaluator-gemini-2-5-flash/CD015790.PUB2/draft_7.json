  "draft": "Do self-management programs (teaching people skills to manage their condition) improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment (difficulty seeing)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Self-management programs may have little to no effect on improving quality of life for adults with visual impairment, and they may not increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful effects) either.\n- We are not certain how much these programs benefit or harm people, because the studies were very different from each other, which makes them hard to compare.\n- More research is needed to develop better measures of quality of life and to understand how self-management programs might help people at different stages of visual impairment, including those with both visual and hearing difficulties (dual-sensory impairment).\n\nWhat is visual impairment and why is it a problem?\nVisual impairment means you cannot see well, even with glasses or contact lenses. It is a major health concern that affects more than 2200 million people worldwide, mostly older adults due to age-related eye diseases. This can make it harder for people to do daily tasks and can affect their mental health. Self-management programs teach people skills to manage their condition. They aim to help people live more independently and improve their overall well-being.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if these self-management programs improve quality of life for adults with vision problems. We compared people who took part in a program with people who received usual care or no program.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared self-management programs with usual care or no program. We then combined the results and judged how certain the evidence made us.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur main finding from 20 studies was that self-management programs may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with visual impairment. These studies included a total of 3151 people from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Most participants were older adults, between 60 and 84 years old.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and were also very different from each other. For example, they included different types of people and used different teaching methods, which makes their results difficult to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong draft that is clear, concise, and factually accurate. The readability scores are excellent. I have one critical change and a couple of minor suggestions to make it even better for readers.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Clarify the Key Messages to Avoid Contradiction:** The first two key messages could confuse a reader. The first states a finding ('little to no effect'), while the second expresses general uncertainty ('We are not certain'). It's important to link the uncertainty directly to the finding.\n\n*   **Quote:**\n    *   \"- Self-management programs may have little to no effect on improving quality of life...\n    *   - We are not certain how much these programs benefit or harm people, because the studies were very different from each other...\"\n*   **Problem:** This might sound contradictory. A reader could think, 'So does it have no effect, or do you just not know?' The uncertainty is the *reason* for the cautious wording in the first message.\n*   **Suggestion:** Combine these ideas. Keep the first message as is, but rewrite the second to explain the limitation of that finding. For example:\n    *   \"- Our confidence in this result is low because the studies included were small and very different from each other, which makes them hard to compare.\"\n\n**2. Replace Vague Wording in the Limitations:** The explanation of the limitations could be slightly more specific to be more helpful for the reader.\n\n*   **Quote:** \"...they included different types of people and used different teaching methods...\"\n*   **Problem:** The phrase 'different types of people' is very general and doesn't give the reader a good sense of the actual issue.\n*   **Suggestion:** Be a little more specific without adding jargon. For example:\n    *   \"...they included people at different stages of visual impairment and used a wide variety of teaching methods...\"\n\n**3. Make Sentences More Direct by Using Verbs:** The linguistic analysis shows a high number of 'nominalizations' (nouns made from verbs, like 'decision' instead of 'decide'). While the draft is good, we can make it even more direct and easier to read by using more action verbs.\n\n*   **Quote:** \"It is a major health concern that affects more than 2200 million people worldwide...\"\n*   **Problem:** This phrasing is slightly passive and wordy. Using a more direct verb makes the sentence stronger.\n*   **Suggestion:** Try to lead with the subject and a strong verb where possible. For example:\n    *   \"This major health concern affects more than 2200 million people worldwide...\"\n\nOnce these changes are made, this summary will be ready for publication.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft shows excellent conformity with typical PLS patterns, with over 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and clarity. Readability scores are strong (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 9.3). The only significant deviation is a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which is in the 90th percentile, suggesting some sentences could be more direct and action-oriented."
