  "draft": "Do self-management programs (teaching people skills to manage their condition) improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment (difficulty seeing)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Self-management programs may have little to no effect on improving quality of life for adults with visual impairment, and they may not increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful effects) either.\n- The current evidence is not strong enough to fully understand the benefits and risks of self-management interventions for people with visual impairment, partly because the studies were quite different from each other.\n- More research is needed to develop better measures of quality of life and to understand how self-management programs might help people at different stages of visual impairment, including those with both visual and hearing difficulties (dual-sensory impairment).\n\nWhat is visual impairment and why is it a problem?\nVisual impairment is a major health concern that affects more than 2200 million people worldwide, mostly older adults due to age-related eye diseases. This can make it harder for people to do daily tasks and can affect their mental health. To help with this, people can learn skills to manage their condition in programs called 'self-management programs'. These programs aim to help people live more independently and improve their overall well-being.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if these self-management programs improve quality of life for adults with vision problems. We compared people who took part in a program with people who received usual care or no program.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing self-management interventions with inactive or active controls in adults with visual impairment. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur main finding from 20 studies was that self-management programs may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with visual impairment. These studies included a total of 3151 people from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Most participants were older adults, between 60 and 84 years old.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and by heterogeneity in participant types and intervention delivery methods.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear and well-structured. All critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting have passed. However, a few key sentences could be simplified to make the summary even more accessible to a lay audience. The following two improvements will address the main clarity issues.\n\n1. **Simplify the language in the limitations section.**\n   - **The issue:** The final section uses technical terms that may confuse readers.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"The evidence is limited by very small study sample sizes and by heterogeneity in participant types and intervention delivery methods.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Words like \"heterogeneity\" and the phrase \"intervention delivery methods\" are jargon. This noun-heavy phrasing makes the sentence abstract and hard to understand.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and quite different from one another. For example, they included different groups of people, and the programs were taught in different ways, making the results difficult to compare.\"\n\n2. **Make the introduction more concise by removing a repeated definition.**\n   - **The issue:** The definition of \"self-management programs\" is provided in both the main title and the first paragraph.\n   - **Original sentences:** The title already states: \"Do self-management programs (teaching people skills to manage their condition)...?\". Then the text says: \"To help with this, people can learn skills to manage their condition in programs called 'self-management programs'.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** Repeating the definition so closely can feel redundant and slows the reader down.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** You can make this section more direct. Try starting with: \"Self-management programs teach people skills to manage their condition. They aim to help people live more independently and improve their overall well-being.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 17 of 18 metrics falling within or better than the median range for readability, sentence length, and voice. However, the text shows a significant deviation in 'nominalization' (the use of noun forms of verbs), which is in the 'BEYOND_P90' category with 29 instances. This confirms the editorial feedback that some sentences are overly abstract and noun-heavy, which can impact clarity for a lay audience."
