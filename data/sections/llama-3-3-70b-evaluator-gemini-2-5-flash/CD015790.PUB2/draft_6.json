  "draft": "Do self-management programs (teaching people skills to manage their condition) improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment (difficulty seeing)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Self-management programs may have little to no effect on improving quality of life for adults with visual impairment, and they may not increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful effects) either.\n- We are not certain about the benefits and risks of these programs. This is because the studies were very different from each other, which makes them hard to compare.\n- More research is needed to develop better measures of quality of life and to understand how self-management programs might help people at different stages of visual impairment, including those with both visual and hearing difficulties (dual-sensory impairment).\n\nWhat is visual impairment and why is it a problem?\nVisual impairment means having difficulty seeing that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. It is a major health concern that affects more than 2200 million people worldwide, mostly older adults due to age-related eye diseases. This can make it harder for people to do daily tasks and can affect their mental health. Self-management programs teach people skills to manage their condition. They aim to help people live more independently and improve their overall well-being.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if these self-management programs improve quality of life for adults with vision problems. We compared people who took part in a program with people who received usual care or no program.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies that compared self-management programs with usual care or no program. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur main finding from 20 studies was that self-management programs may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with visual impairment. These studies included a total of 3151 people from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Most participants were older adults, between 60 and 84 years old.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and were also very different from each other. For example, they included different types of people and used different teaching methods, which makes their results difficult to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",

The main area for improvement is to make the writing more direct by using verbs instead of abstract nouns (a style issue known as 'nominalization'). This will make the text even easier for readers to understand.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1.  **Make the key messages more direct.** The current phrasing is slightly abstract.\n    *   **Original sentence:** \"We are not certain about the benefits and risks of these programs.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The nouns 'benefits' and 'risks' are less direct than using verbs to describe the actions.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We are not certain how much these programs benefit or harm people.\"\n\n2.  **Use more personal and direct language in the introduction.** Phrasing concepts as direct experiences can be clearer than using abstract nouns.\n    *   **Original sentence:** \"Visual impairment means having difficulty seeing that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase 'having difficulty seeing' is slightly wordy and less personal.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Visual impairment means you cannot see well, even with glasses or contact lenses.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify the description of the methods.** The concept of 'confidence in the evidence' can be explained more simply.\n    *   **Original sentence:** \"We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** 'Confidence' is an abstract concept. Explaining what you did is more concrete.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We then combined the results and judged how certain the evidence made us.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your draft is excellent in most respects, with great readability scores. The suggestions above are supported by the linguistic analysis, which found a high number of 'nominalizations' (25 instances). Addressing this single style point will make an already strong summary even **better**.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. 17 of 18 metrics (94.4%) fall within the typical median or best quartile ranges, indicating excellent readability, simple sentence structure, and appropriate use of voice. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: 'nominalization' (the use of noun-form verbs) is in the P90 range. This suggests the text relies more heavily on abstract nouns than is typical, presenting a clear opportunity for improvement by converting these nouns back into more direct verbs."
