  "draft": "Do self-management programs (teaching people skills to manage their condition) improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment (difficulty seeing)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Self-management programs may have little to no effect on improving quality of life for adults with visual impairment, and they may not increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful effects) either.\n- The current evidence is not strong enough to fully understand the benefits and risks of self-management interventions for people with visual impairment, partly because the studies tested different types of programs on different groups of people, making them difficult to compare.\n- More research is needed to develop better measures of quality of life and to understand how self-management programs might help people at different stages of visual impairment, including those with both visual and hearing difficulties (dual-sensory impairment).\n\nWhat is visual impairment and why is it a problem?\nVisual impairment means having difficulty seeing that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. It is a major health concern that affects more than 2200 million people worldwide, mostly older adults due to age-related eye diseases. This can make it harder for people to do daily tasks and can affect their mental health. Self-management programs teach people skills to manage their condition. They aim to help people live more independently and improve their overall well-being.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if these self-management programs improve quality of life for adults with vision problems. We compared people who took part in a program with people who received usual care or no program.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing self-management interventions with inactive or active controls in adults with visual impairment. We combined the results from the studies and used them to rate how certain we are about the findings.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur main finding from 20 studies was that self-management programs may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with visual impairment. These studies included a total of 3151 people from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Most participants were older adults, between 60 and 84 years old.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and tested different types of programs on different groups of people, making the results difficult to compare. For example, they included different groups of people, and the programs were taught in different ways.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and meets most of our guidelines. The readability scores are excellent. I'm marking it as 'Not Approved' to highlight three specific areas where we can make the text even clearer for patients before publishing.\n\nHere are my top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Simplify the long sentence in your 'Key messages'.**\n    *   **The sentence:** 'The current evidence is not strong enough to fully understand the benefits and risks of self-management interventions for people with visual impairment, partly because the studies tested different types of programs on different groups of people, making them difficult to compare.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** At 43 words, this sentence is too long for a key summary section and combines several ideas, which can be hard for readers to process.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We are not certain about the benefits and risks of these programs. This is because the studies were very different from each other, which makes them hard to compare.'\n\n2. **Remove the repetition in the 'Limitations' section.**\n    *   **The sentences:** 'We have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and tested different types of programs on different groups of people, making the results difficult to compare. For example, they included different groups of people, and the programs were taught in different ways.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The example ('they included different groups of people') just repeats the point from the previous sentence, which doesn't add clarity and can confuse the reader.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and were also very different from each other. For example, they included different types of people and used different teaching methods, which makes their results difficult to compare.'\n\n3. **Make the 'Methods' section more direct and less technical.**\n    *   **The sentences:** 'We searched for studies comparing self-management interventions with inactive or active controls in adults with visual impairment. We combined the results from the studies and used them to rate how certain we are about the findings.'\n    *   **Why it's a problem:** The phrase 'inactive or active controls' is technical jargon. The second sentence is also a bit wordy.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'We searched for studies that compared self-management programs with usual care or no program. We then combined the results and rated our confidence in the evidence.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** While most metrics are excellent, the linguistic analysis did flag a high number of 'nominalizations' (27 instances). This means using noun forms instead of verbs (like 'make a decision' instead of 'decide'). The suggestions above will help make the language more direct and action-oriented, which will also improve this metric.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability and plain language. However, the analysis identified a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), with 27 instances placing it in the 90th percentile. This suggests the language, while readable, could be more direct and action-oriented."
