  "draft": "Do self-management programs (teaching people skills to manage their condition) improve quality of life for adults with visual impairment (difficulty seeing)?\n\nKey messages:\n- Self-management programs may have little to no effect on improving quality of life for adults with visual impairment, and they may not increase the risk of unwanted effects (harmful effects) either.\n- The current evidence is not strong enough to fully understand the benefits and risks of self-management interventions for people with visual impairment, partly because the studies were quite different from each other.\n- More research is needed to develop better measures of quality of life and to understand how self-management programs might help people at different stages of visual impairment, including those with both visual and hearing difficulties (dual-sensory impairment).\n\nWhat is visual impairment and why is it a problem?\nVisual impairment is a major health concern that affects more than 2200 million people worldwide, mostly older adults due to age-related eye diseases. This can make it harder for people to do daily tasks and can affect their mental health. Self-management programs teach people skills to manage their condition. They aim to help people live more independently and improve their overall well-being.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if these self-management programs improve quality of life for adults with vision problems. We compared people who took part in a program with people who received usual care or no program.\n\nHow did we find the evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing self-management interventions with inactive or active controls in adults with visual impairment. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nOur main finding from 20 studies was that self-management programs may make little to no difference to quality of life for adults with visual impairment. These studies included a total of 3151 people from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Most participants were older adults, between 60 and 84 years old.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies were small and quite different from one another. For example, they included different groups of people, and the programs were taught in different ways, making the results difficult to compare.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to May 2024.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it is not approved because several key sentences use vague or overly formal language, which could reduce clarity for readers. Focusing on the 3 improvements below will make the summary much easier to understand.\n\n### Top 3 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Define 'visual impairment' in simple terms.**\n\nThe summary asks \"What is visual impairment?\" but never directly answers the question in simple language. This could leave readers confused about the core topic.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"What is visual impairment and why is it a problem? Visual impairment is a major health concern that affects more than 2200 million people worldwide...\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"What is visual impairment? Visual impairment means having difficulty seeing that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. It is a major health concern that affects more than 2200 million people worldwide...\"\n\n**2. Be more specific about the limitations of the evidence.**\n\nThe Key Messages and Limitations sections state that the studies were \"quite different from each other\" without explaining *how*. This is too vague to be helpful.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"...partly because the studies were quite different from each other.\" (from Key Messages)\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"...partly because the studies tested different types of programs on different groups of people, making them difficult to compare.\"\n\n**3. Replace formal phrases with more direct, active language.**\n\nThe draft uses several noun-heavy phrases (nominalizations) that make the text feel bureaucratic and less direct. This pattern is confirmed by the linguistic analysis.\n\n- **Problematic Text:** \"We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We combined the results from the studies and used them to rate how certain we are about the findings.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 13 of 18 metrics (72%) falling within the best quartile for readability. However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the use of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) is exceptionally high, falling 'Beyond the 90th percentile'. This metric supports the editorial feedback to replace formal, noun-heavy phrases with more direct, active verbs to improve clarity."
