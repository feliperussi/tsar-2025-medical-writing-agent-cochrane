  "draft": "Can applying silver diamine fluoride to teeth help prevent or stop tooth decay in children and adults?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Silver diamine fluoride may help prevent new cavities in the roots of teeth and possibly stop existing tooth decay in both children and adults, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. It is also unclear if it prevents new cavities in adult teeth.\n- Comparing silver diamine fluoride to other treatments like fluoride varnish shows uncertain benefits. There is not enough good-quality evidence to determine if one treatment approach is better than another or to fully understand potential unwanted effects such as tooth staining or sensitivity.\n- Future research should focus on well-conducted studies that measure the impact of silver diamine fluoride on tooth staining. These studies should account for the fact that one person can have several teeth treated and compare different treatment approaches directly.\n\n**What is dental caries and why is it a problem?**\nDental caries, also known as tooth decay, is the most common disease worldwide. If left untreated, it can cause pain and affect a person's well-being, daily activities, and ability to eat properly. Common treatments for dental caries include fillings, crowns, and root canals. However, it is essential to identify cost-effective and easy-to-use agents that can prevent or arrest caries.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of silver diamine fluoride for preventing and managing dental caries in primary and permanent teeth. They compared silver diamine fluoride to other interventions, including placebo or no treatment. The authors wanted to determine whether silver diamine fluoride is effective in preventing new caries, stopping existing caries, and preventing the progression of caries. They also looked at its potential adverse effects and impact on aesthetics.\n\n**How did we find the evidence?**\nWe searched for studies comparing silver diamine fluoride to other interventions for preventing and managing dental caries. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 29 studies that involved 13,036 people with dental caries. These studies were conducted in various countries and included children and older adults. Most studies compared silver diamine fluoride with placebo or no treatment. Others compared different frequencies, concentrations, or durations of silver diamine fluoride, or silver diamine fluoride with other interventions like fluoride varnish, sealants, and resin infiltration.\n\n**What are the main results?**\nSilver diamine fluoride may help prevent new cavities in children's teeth, but the evidence is uncertain. It probably helps prevent new root cavities. Compared to fluoride varnish, silver diamine fluoride may offer little to no benefit in preventing new cavities in children's teeth. The evidence is uncertain for other cavity outcomes and for preventing new cavities in adults' teeth. Silver diamine fluoride may cause tooth staining, but the impact of this is not well reported.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited because some studies had issues with participants knowing their treatment, very small study sizes, and differences across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is clear, accurate, and well-structured. It passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, a few minor revisions are needed to fully align with Cochrane style guidelines and enhance readability for a lay audience. Addressing the following 4 points will make this an excellent Plain Language Summary.\n\n### Top 4 Improvements Needed:\n\n**1. Rephrase Headings as Questions**\n- **Issue:** The 'Key Messages' subheading is not phrased as a question, which is required by the style guide to help orient the reader.\n- **Current Text:** `Key Messages`\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** `What are the key messages of this review?`\n\n**2. Use a Consistent First-Person Voice ('We')**\n- **Issue:** The text switches between third-person ('The review authors') and first-person ('We'). The style guide requires consistently using 'we' to refer to the review team, which creates a more direct and engaging tone.\n- **Current Text:** `The review authors aimed to assess the effects of silver diamine fluoride...`\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** `We wanted to find out if silver diamine fluoride helps prevent and manage tooth decay...`\n\n**3. Simplify Technical Terms Consistently**\n- **Issue:** The summary uses technical terms like 'primary and permanent teeth' and 'arrest caries' without a simple explanation in all instances. While these terms are sometimes simplified, doing so consistently improves clarity.\n- **Current Text:** `...for preventing and managing dental caries in primary and permanent teeth.`\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** `...for preventing and managing tooth decay in children's baby teeth and in adult teeth.`\n- **Current Text:** `...agents that can prevent or arrest caries.`\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** `...agents that can prevent or arrest (stop) tooth decay.`\n\n**4. Reduce Wordiness and Noun-Heavy Phrases**\n- **Issue:** Some sentences are longer and more complex than necessary, making them harder to read. This is reflected in the linguistic analysis, which shows a high number of nouns and long words.\n- **Current Text:** `These studies should account for the fact that one person can have several teeth treated and compare different treatment approaches directly.`\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** `Future studies should account for treating several teeth in the same person and directly compare different treatment approaches.`",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns, with 72% of metrics falling in the best quartile for readability. The text has excellent sentence length and use of active voice. However, the analysis identified three metrics that deviate from typical patterns: the number of nouns (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), and long words (P90). This suggests that simplifying some vocabulary and replacing noun-heavy phrases with more direct verbs, as outlined in the feedback, would further improve readability."
