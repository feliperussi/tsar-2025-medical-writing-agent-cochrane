  "draft": "# Can applying silver diamine fluoride (a liquid treatment that helps prevent tooth decay) to teeth help prevent or stop tooth decay in children and adults?\n**Key Messages**\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a liquid treatment that helps prevent tooth decay) may help prevent new root caries (cavities in the roots of teeth) and possibly arrest (stop the progression of) existing caries (tooth decay) in both children and adults, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and it is unclear if it prevents new caries in permanent teeth (adult teeth).\n- The comparison of silver diamine fluoride to other treatments like fluoride varnish (a protective coating applied to ...) shows uncertain benefits, and there is not enough good-quality evidence to determine if one treatment approach is better than another, or to fully understand potential unwanted effects such as tooth staining or sensitivity.\n- Future research should focus on well-conducted studies that measure the impact of silver diamine fluoride on tooth staining, take into account clustering issues within participants, and compare different treatment approaches directly to provide clearer answers for decision-makers, including patients, dentists, and policymakers.\n**Introduction**\n### What is dental caries and why is it a problem?\nDental caries, also known as tooth decay, is the most prevalent disease worldwide. If left untreated, it can cause pain, negatively impact psychosocial health, functioning, and nutrition. Common treatments for dental caries include fillings, crowns, and root canals. However, it is essential to identify cost-effective and easy-to-use agents that can prevent or arrest caries.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for preventing and managing dental caries in primary and permanent teeth, compared to other interventions, including placebo or no treatment. They wanted to determine whether SDF is effective in preventing new caries, arresting existing caries, and preventing the progression of caries, as well as its potential adverse effects and impact on aesthetics.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing silver diamine fluoride to other interventions for preventing and managing dental caries, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 29 studies that involved 13,036 people with dental caries. The studies were conducted in various countries and included children and older adults. Most studies compared silver diamine fluoride (SDF) with placebo or no treatment, while others compared different frequencies, concentrations, or durations of SDF, or SDF with other interventions such as fluoride varnish, sealants, and resin infiltration. The age of the participants ranged from children to older adults, with 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies did not report on the duration of the interventions. The funding sources of the studies were not mentioned. The population characteristics, such as severity of condition, were not consistently reported across the studies. The study settings were not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that they took place in various countries. The types of interventions and comparisons varied across the studies, with some comparing SDF to placebo or no treatment, and others comparing different approaches to SDF application or SDF to other interventions.\n### Main results: Preventing dental caries with silver diamine fluoride\nSilver diamine fluoride may help prevent new caries in children's teeth, but the evidence is uncertain. It probably helps prevent new root caries. Compared to fluoride varnish, silver diamine fluoride may offer little to no benefit in preventing new caries in children's teeth. The evidence is uncertain for other caries outcomes and for preventing new caries in adults' teeth. Silver diamine fluoride may cause tooth staining, but the impact of this is not well reported.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited by possible lack of blinding (participants may have known their treatment), very small study sizes, and heterogeneity across studies in participant characteristics and intervention delivery methods.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

Additionally, there is redundancy in definitions within the key messages, and a particularly long and repetitive paragraph in the 'What did we find?' section that significantly impacts readability. The language in some parts is also more formal and noun-heavy than ideal for a Plain Language Summary. These issues are supported by the PLS evaluation metrics, which indicate deviations from typical patterns for nominalization, nouns, complex words, and long words, all suggesting a need for simpler, more direct phrasing.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with only 44.4% of features falling into the best quartile. Seven features deviate significantly from typical patterns: nominalization (P90), nouns (Beyond P90), smog_index (P90), dale_chall_readability (P90), complex_words_dc (Beyond P90), complex_words (P90), and long_words (Beyond P90). These deviations suggest the text is more complex, noun-heavy, and uses more unfamiliar and longer words than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, impacting overall readability."
