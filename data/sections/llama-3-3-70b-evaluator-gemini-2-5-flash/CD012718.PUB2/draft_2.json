  "draft": "Can applying silver diamine fluoride (a type of fluoride treatment) to teeth help prevent or stop tooth decay in children and adults?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) may help prevent new tooth decay (caries) in children and adults, particularly in preventing new root caries, but the evidence is uncertain for other types of caries and the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be confident in the results.\n- The comparison of SDF to other treatments like fluoride varnish, sealants, and atraumatic restorative treatment shows uncertain benefits due to very low-quality evidence, highlighting the need for more research to understand which treatment approaches are most effective for different patient groups.\n- Future studies should focus on addressing the current limitations, including the impact of staining, adverse effects, and the comparison of different SDF application approaches, to provide clearer guidance for patients, dentists, and policymakers on the best ways to prevent and treat tooth decay.\n\n**What is dental caries and why is it a problem?**\nDental caries, also known as tooth decay, is the most prevalent disease worldwide. If left untreated, it can cause pain, negatively impact psychosocial health, functioning, and nutrition. Common treatments for dental caries include fillings, crowns, and root canals. However, it is essential to identify cost-effective and easy-to-use agents that can prevent or arrest caries.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of SDF for preventing and managing dental caries in primary and permanent teeth, compared to other interventions, including placebo or no treatment. They wanted to determine whether SDF is effective in preventing new caries, arresting existing caries, and preventing the progression of caries, as well as its potential adverse effects and impact on aesthetics.\n\n**How did the review authors search for evidence?**\nWe searched for studies comparing SDF to other interventions for preventing and managing dental caries, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did the review authors find?**\nWe found 29 studies that involved 13,036 people with dental caries. The studies were conducted in various countries and included children and older adults. Most studies compared SDF with placebo or no treatment, while others compared different frequencies, concentrations, or durations of SDF, or SDF with other interventions such as fluoride varnish, sealants, and resin infiltration.\n\n**What are the main results of the review?**\nSDF may help prevent new caries in children's teeth, but the evidence is uncertain. It probably helps prevent new root caries. Compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may offer little to no benefit in preventing new caries in children's teeth. The evidence is uncertain for other caries outcomes and for preventing new caries in adults' teeth. SDF may cause tooth staining, but the impact of this is poorly reported.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes, possible lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

    {
      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for accuracy and completeness. However, it is NOT_APPROVED because several sections use technical language that would be difficult for a patient to understand. Here are the top 3 improvements to make the summary clearer:\n\n1. **Simplify the technical language in the 'Limitations' section.** This section is crucial for helping readers understand the certainty of the evidence, but it's currently filled with research jargon.\n    *   **Problem text:** 'The evidence is limited because the studies had... possible lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery.'\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** Terms like 'blinding' and 'heterogeneity' are unfamiliar to most people.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'Our confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results. Also, the studies included different types of people and applied the treatments in different ways, which makes it hard to compare their findings.'\n\n2. **Explain the other dental treatments being compared.** The summary mentions other treatments by their technical names without explaining what they are.\n    *   **Problem text:** '...atraumatic restorative treatment shows uncertain benefits...' and '...sealants, and resin infiltration.'\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** Readers won't know what these treatments involve.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** Add brief, simple explanations. For example: '...atraumatic restorative treatment (a way to fill cavities without drilling)...' and '...sealants (protective plastic coatings) and resin infiltration (a treatment for early-stage decay).'\n\n3. **Use more direct, active language instead of formal nouns.** The text often uses noun forms of verbs ('nominalizations'), which can make sentences feel dense and academic.\n    *   **Problem text:** 'The comparison of SDF to other treatments...' and '...preventing the progression of caries...'\n    *   **Why it's an issue:** This style is less direct and engaging than using simple verbs.\n    *   **Suggested rewrite:** 'When we compared SDF to other treatments...' and '...stopping decay from getting worse...'\n\n**Supporting Evidence from Metrics:** Your summary's readability scores are good because the sentences are short. However, the linguistic analysis shows a high number of complex and long words (`complex_words_dc` and `long_words` are in the 90th percentile). This confirms that the main issue is difficult vocabulary, not sentence length. The analysis also flagged a high use of nouns and nominalizations, supporting the suggestion to use more active verbs.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results show a mixed profile. While the draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns for sentence structure (e.g., `words_per_sentence` is in the best quartile), it deviates significantly in vocabulary complexity. Four metrics are in the P90 range, indicating higher-than-typical complexity: `nominalization` (22.0), `nouns` (162.0), `complex_words_dc` (241.0), and `long_words` (172.0). This suggests that while sentences are short, they contain difficult, technical, and noun-heavy language that hinders readability for a lay audience."
