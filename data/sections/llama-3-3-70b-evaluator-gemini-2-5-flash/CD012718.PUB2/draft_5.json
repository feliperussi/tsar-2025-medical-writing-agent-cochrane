  "draft": "Can applying silver diamine fluoride to teeth help prevent or stop tooth decay in children and adults?\n\nKey Messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride may help prevent new tooth decay in children and adults, especially in preventing new root caries, but the evidence is uncertain for other types of caries.\n- We compared silver diamine fluoride to other treatments like fluoride varnish and sealants. The benefits of silver diamine fluoride compared to these treatments were uncertain because the evidence was of very low quality. More research is needed to know which treatment works best for different people.\n- Future research should compare different ways of applying silver diamine fluoride. Studies also need to look more closely at side effects, like tooth staining. This will provide clearer advice for patients, dentists, and policymakers.\n\nWhat is dental caries and why is it a problem?\nDental caries, also known as tooth decay, is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person’s well-being, daily life, and ability to eat properly. Common treatments for dental caries include fillings, crowns, and root canals. However, it is essential to identify cost-effective and easy-to-use agents that can prevent or arrest caries.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if silver diamine fluoride can prevent new tooth decay, stop existing decay from getting worse, and if it causes unwanted side effects, like changing how teeth look. We also wanted to know if silver diamine fluoride is effective in preventing and managing dental caries in primary and permanent teeth, compared to other interventions, including placebo or no treatment.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing silver diamine fluoride to other interventions for preventing and managing dental caries, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 29 studies that involved 13,036 people with dental caries. The studies were conducted in various countries and included children and older adults. Most studies compared silver diamine fluoride with placebo or no treatment, while others compared different frequencies, concentrations, or durations of silver diamine fluoride, or silver diamine fluoride with other interventions such as fluoride varnish, sealants, and resin infiltration.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nFor older adults, silver diamine fluoride probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of their teeth. For children, the evidence is uncertain whether it helps prevent decay on the main surfaces of their teeth. Compared to fluoride varnish, silver diamine fluoride may offer little to no benefit in preventing new caries in children’s teeth. The evidence is uncertain for other caries outcomes and for preventing new caries in adults’ teeth. Silver diamine fluoride may cause tooth staining, but the impact of this is poorly reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. Many of the studies were small, and for some questions, only one or two studies were available. In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results. The studies also included different types of people and applied the treatments in different ways, making it hard to combine their findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a good start and passes all critical checks for completeness, accuracy, and length. However, it needs revisions to improve clarity for a patient audience before it can be approved. The main issues are the use of clinical jargon, a confusing structure in the results section, and some wordy sentences that make the text harder to follow.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Replace clinical terms with everyday language.** Some words are too technical for a general audience.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"...it is essential to identify cost-effective and easy-to-use agents that can prevent or arrest caries.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** The terms 'agents' and 'arrest caries' are clinical jargon. Readers may not know what an 'agent' is in this context or what it means to 'arrest' decay.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"...it is important to find treatments that are affordable, easy to use, and can prevent or stop tooth decay.\"\n\n2. **Restructure the main results for clarity.** The current paragraph mixes findings from different comparisons, which is confusing.\n   - **Original paragraph:** \"For older adults, silver diamine fluoride probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of their teeth. For children, the evidence is uncertain whether it helps prevent decay on the main surfaces of their teeth. Compared to fluoride varnish, silver diamine fluoride may offer little to no benefit in preventing new caries in children’s teeth. The evidence is uncertain for other caries outcomes and for preventing new caries in adults’ teeth.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** It jumps between different groups (adults, children) and different comparisons (vs. no treatment, vs. varnish) without clear separation, making it difficult to understand the key takeaways.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"When compared to no treatment, silver diamine fluoride:\n   - probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth in older adults.\n   - may help stop decay in children's baby teeth, but the evidence is uncertain.\n\nWhen compared to fluoride varnish, silver diamine fluoride may offer little to no benefit in preventing new decay in children's teeth. For most other situations, the evidence was too uncertain to make clear conclusions.\"\n\n3. **Remove redundant and overly long sentences.** Some sentences can be shortened and simplified to make the text more direct.\n   - **Original sentence:** \"We also wanted to know if silver diamine fluoride is effective in preventing and managing dental caries in primary and permanent teeth, compared to other interventions, including placebo or no treatment.\"\n   - **Why it's a problem:** At 32 words, this sentence is long and repeats concepts from the previous sentence. It also uses less common terms like 'primary and permanent teeth' and 'interventions'.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We compared silver diamine fluoride to other treatments (or no treatment) for both baby teeth and adult teeth.\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows the draft conforms well to many typical PLS patterns, with excellent readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9.5) and good sentence length (17 words on average). However, the analysis also flags deviations from typical patterns in vocabulary, with high counts for nouns (P90), Dale-Chall complex words (P90), and long words (P90). This data supports the editorial finding that the draft relies on some overly technical and noun-heavy language, which can reduce clarity for readers despite the good overall readability scores."
