  "draft": "Can applying silver diamine fluoride to teeth help prevent or stop tooth decay in children and adults?\n\nKey Messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride may help prevent new tooth decay in children and adults, especially in preventing new root caries, but the evidence is uncertain for other types of caries.\n- When compared to no treatment, silver diamine fluoride probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth in older adults, and may help stop decay in children’s baby teeth, but the evidence is uncertain.\n- When compared to fluoride varnish, silver diamine fluoride may offer little to no benefit in preventing new decay in children’s teeth.\n- For most other situations, the evidence was too uncertain to make clear conclusions.\n- We also know that silver diamine fluoride may cause tooth staining, but the impact of this is poorly reported.\n- Future research should compare different ways of applying silver diamine fluoride and look more closely at side effects to provide clearer advice for patients, dentists, and policymakers.\n\nWhat is dental caries and why is it a problem?\nDental caries, also known as tooth decay, is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person’s well-being, daily life, and ability to eat properly. Common treatments for dental caries include fillings, crowns, and root canals. However, it is essential to find treatments that are affordable, easy to use, and can prevent or stop tooth decay.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if silver diamine fluoride can prevent new tooth decay, stop existing decay from getting worse, and if it causes unwanted side effects, like changing how teeth look. We compared silver diamine fluoride to other treatments, or no treatment, for both baby teeth and adult teeth.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing silver diamine fluoride to other interventions for preventing and managing dental caries, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 29 studies that involved 13,036 people with dental caries. The studies were conducted in various countries and included children and older adults. Most studies compared silver diamine fluoride with placebo or no treatment, while others compared different frequencies, concentrations, or durations of silver diamine fluoride, or silver diamine fluoride with other interventions such as fluoride varnish, sealants, and resin infiltration.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nWhen compared to no treatment, silver diamine fluoride:\n- probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of teeth in older adults.\n- may help stop decay in children’s baby teeth, but the evidence is uncertain.\nWhen compared to fluoride varnish, silver diamine fluoride may offer little to no benefit in preventing new decay in children’s teeth. For most other situations, the evidence was too uncertain to make clear conclusions.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited. Many of the studies were small, and for some questions, only one or two studies were available. In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results. The studies also included different types of people and applied the treatments in different ways, making it hard to combine their findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",
