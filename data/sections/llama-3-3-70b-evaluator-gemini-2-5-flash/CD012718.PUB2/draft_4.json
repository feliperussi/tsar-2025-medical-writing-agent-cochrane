  "draft": "Can applying silver diamine fluoride to teeth help prevent or stop tooth decay in children and adults?\n\nKey Messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride may help prevent new tooth decay in children and adults, especially in preventing new root caries, but the evidence is uncertain for other types of caries.\n- We compared silver diamine fluoride to other treatments like fluoride varnish and sealants. The benefits of silver diamine fluoride compared to these treatments were uncertain because the evidence was of very low quality. More research is needed to know which treatment works best for different people.\n- Future research should compare different ways of applying silver diamine fluoride. Studies also need to look more closely at side effects, like tooth staining. This will provide clearer advice for patients, dentists, and policymakers.\n\nWhat is dental caries and why is it a problem?\nDental caries, also known as tooth decay, is the most prevalent disease worldwide. If left untreated, it can cause pain, negatively impact psychosocial health, functioning, and nutrition. Common treatments for dental caries include fillings, crowns, and root canals. However, it is essential to identify cost-effective and easy-to-use agents that can prevent or arrest caries.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe wanted to find out if silver diamine fluoride can prevent new tooth decay, stop existing decay from getting worse, and if it causes unwanted side effects, like changing how teeth look. We also wanted to know if silver diamine fluoride is effective in preventing and managing dental caries in primary and permanent teeth, compared to other interventions, including placebo or no treatment.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing silver diamine fluoride to other interventions for preventing and managing dental caries, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 29 studies that involved 13,036 people with dental caries. The studies were conducted in various countries and included children and older adults. Most studies compared silver diamine fluoride with placebo or no treatment, while others compared different frequencies, concentrations, or durations of silver diamine fluoride, or silver diamine fluoride with other interventions such as fluoride varnish, sealants, and resin infiltration.\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nSilver diamine fluoride may help prevent new caries in children's teeth, but the evidence is uncertain. It probably helps prevent new root caries. Compared to fluoride varnish, silver diamine fluoride may offer little to no benefit in preventing new caries in children's teeth. The evidence is uncertain for other caries outcomes and for preventing new caries in adults' teeth. Silver diamine fluoride may cause tooth staining, but the impact of this is poorly reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results. Also, the studies included different types of people and applied the treatments in different ways, which makes it hard to compare their findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that passes all critical checks for accuracy, completeness, and formatting. The main opportunity for improvement is to simplify some of the academic language to make the key findings even clearer for a general audience. Here are the top 3 suggestions:\n\n1. **Simplify technical and academic vocabulary.** Some words may be unfamiliar to readers, making the text less accessible. The linguistic analysis supports this, showing a high number of complex and long words.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, is the most prevalent disease worldwide. If left untreated, it can cause pain, negatively impact psychosocial health, functioning, and nutrition... it is essential to identify cost-effective and easy-to-use agents that can prevent or arrest caries.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, is the most common disease in the world. If not treated, it can cause pain and affect a person's well-being, daily life, and ability to eat properly... it is important to find treatments that are affordable, easy to use, and can prevent or stop tooth decay.\"\n\n2. **Make the main results more specific and less vague.** The current wording could leave readers confused about who benefits and how.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Silver diamine fluoride may help prevent new caries in children's teeth, but the evidence is uncertain. It probably helps prevent new root caries.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"For older adults, silver diamine fluoride probably helps prevent new decay on the roots of their teeth. For children, the evidence is uncertain whether it helps prevent decay on the main surfaces of their teeth.\"\n\n3. **Provide more context in the limitations section.** The draft mentions some limitations but omits a key one from the source material: the small size of the studies. This is crucial for helping readers understand *why* the evidence is uncertain.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results. Also, the studies included different types of people and applied the treatments in different ways, which makes it hard to compare their findings.\"\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Our confidence in the evidence is limited. Many of the studies were small, and for some questions, only one or two studies were available. In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results. The studies also included different types of people and applied the treatments in different ways, making it hard to combine their findings.\"\n",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns in terms of sentence length and overall readability, with 61.1% of features falling in the best quartile. However, it deviates significantly from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. The metrics for 'nouns' (P90), 'complex_words_dc' (Dale-Chall unfamiliar words, P90), and 'long_words' (P90) are all higher than is typical for a PLS. This indicates the text uses more noun-heavy phrasing and complex vocabulary than usual, suggesting that simplifying specific word choices would improve clarity."
