  "draft": "Can applying silver diamine fluoride (a type of fluoride treatment) to teeth help prevent or stop tooth decay in children and adults?\n\nKey Messages\n- Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) may help prevent new tooth decay (caries) in children and adults, particularly in preventing new root caries, but the evidence is uncertain for other types of caries and the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be confident in the results.\n- When we compared SDF to other treatments like fluoride varnish (a protective coating), sealants (protective plastic coatings), and atraumatic restorative treatment (a way to fill cavities without drilling), the benefits were uncertain due to very low-quality evidence, highlighting the need for more research to understand which treatment approaches are most effective for different patient groups.\n- Future studies should focus on addressing the current limitations, including the impact of staining, adverse effects, and the comparison of different SDF application approaches, to provide clearer guidance for patients, dentists, and policymakers on the best ways to prevent and treat tooth decay.\n\nWhat is dental caries and why is it a problem?\nDental caries, also known as tooth decay, is the most prevalent disease worldwide. If left untreated, it can cause pain, negatively impact psychosocial health, functioning, and nutrition. Common treatments for dental caries include fillings, crowns, and root canals. However, it is essential to identify cost-effective and easy-to-use agents that can prevent or arrest caries.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nWe aimed to assess the effects of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for preventing and managing dental caries in primary and permanent teeth, compared to other interventions, including placebo or no treatment. We wanted to determine whether SDF is effective in preventing new caries, arresting existing caries, and preventing the progression of caries, as well as its potential adverse effects and impact on aesthetics.\n\nHow did the review authors search for evidence?\nWe searched for studies comparing SDF to other interventions for preventing and managing dental caries, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did the review authors find?\nWe found 29 studies that involved 13,036 people with dental caries. The studies were conducted in various countries and included children and older adults. Most studies compared SDF with placebo or no treatment, while others compared different frequencies, concentrations, or durations of SDF, or SDF with other interventions such as fluoride varnish, sealants, and resin infiltration (a treatment for early-stage decay).\n\nWhat are the main results of the review?\nSDF may help prevent new caries in children's teeth, but the evidence is uncertain. It probably helps prevent new root caries. Compared to fluoride varnish, SDF may offer little to no benefit in preventing new caries in children's teeth. The evidence is uncertain for other caries outcomes and for preventing new caries in adults' teeth. SDF may cause tooth staining, but the impact of this is poorly reported.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. In some studies, people knew which treatment they were getting, which could have biased the results. Also, the studies included different types of people and applied the treatments in different ways, which makes it hard to compare their findings.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a good start. The summary is factually accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, it needs revision to improve clarity for a lay audience. Several key sentences are very long and rely on abstract, noun-heavy language, which makes the main findings difficult to understand. Simplifying these sentences will make the summary much more effective.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify long, complex sentences in the Key Messages.** The second key message is over 50 words long and contains multiple ideas, making it hard to follow.\n   - **Original Text:** \"When we compared SDF to other treatments like fluoride varnish (a protective coating), sealants (protective plastic coatings), and atraumatic restorative treatment (a way to fill cavities without drilling), the benefits were uncertain due to very low-quality evidence, highlighting the need for more research to understand which treatment approaches are most effective for different patient groups.\"\n   - **Problem:** This single sentence covers the comparison, the result (uncertainty), the reason (low-quality evidence), and the implication (need for research). This is too much information for one sentence.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We also compared SDF to other treatments like fluoride varnish and sealants. The benefits of SDF compared to these treatments were uncertain because the evidence was of very low quality. More research is needed to know which treatment works best for different people.\"\n\n2. **Use simpler, more direct language in the aims section.** The language here is quite formal and uses several abstract nouns (nominalizations) where simpler verbs would be clearer.\n   - **Original Text:** \"We wanted to determine whether SDF is effective in preventing new caries, arresting existing caries, and preventing the progression of caries, as well as its potential adverse effects and impact on aesthetics.\"\n   - **Problem:** Phrases like \"arresting existing caries,\" \"preventing the progression of caries,\" and \"impact on aesthetics\" are technical. Using active verbs makes the goals clearer.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out if SDF can prevent new tooth decay, stop existing decay from getting worse, and if it causes unwanted side effects, like changing how teeth look.\"\n\n3. **Break down the final key message into shorter, more actionable points.** Like the second message, this sentence is long and combines several distinct ideas.\n   - **Original Text:** \"Future studies should focus on addressing the current limitations, including the impact of staining, adverse effects, and the comparison of different SDF application approaches, to provide clearer guidance for patients, dentists, and policymakers on the best ways to prevent and treat tooth decay.\"\n   - **Problem:** This 48-word sentence lists multiple complex topics. It's hard for a reader to absorb all the different areas needing future research in one go.\n   - **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Future research should compare different ways of applying SDF. Studies also need to look more closely at side effects, like tooth staining. This will provide clearer advice for patients, dentists, and policymakers.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** Your draft has good readability scores overall, but the linguistic analysis supports the need for these changes. The metrics for **nominalization (24.0)**, **nouns (171.0)**, and **long words (185.0)** are all higher than is typical for a Plain Language Summary, confirming that the text relies too heavily on complex nouns and vocabulary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The evaluation shows good conformity with many PLS patterns, particularly in overall readability (Flesch Reading Ease P75) and use of active voice (P75). However, there is a significant deviation from typical patterns in vocabulary complexity. Four key metrics fall into the P90 range (higher than 90% of the corpus): nominalization, total nouns, Dale-Chall complex words, and long words. This indicates that while sentences are a reasonable average length, they are dense with complex, abstract, and long words, which harms clarity and justifies the recommended edits."
