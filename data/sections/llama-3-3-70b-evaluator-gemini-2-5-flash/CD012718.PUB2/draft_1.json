  "draft": "# Can applying silver diamine fluoride (a type of fluoride treatment) to teeth help prevent or stop tooth decay in children and adults?\n**Key Messages**\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a type of fluoride treatment) may help prevent new tooth decay (caries) in children and adults, particularly in preventing new root caries, but the evidence is uncertain for other types of caries and the quality of the evidence is not strong enough to be confident in the results.\n- The comparison of silver diamine fluoride to other treatments like fluoride varnish, sealants, and atraumatic restorative treatment shows uncertain benefits due to very low-quality evidence, highlighting the need for more research to understand which treatment approaches are most effective for different patient groups.\n- Future studies should focus on addressing the current limitations, including the impact of staining, adverse effects, and the comparison of different silver diamine fluoride application approaches, to provide clearer guidance for patients, dentists, and policymakers on the best ways to prevent and treat tooth decay.\n**Introduction**\n### What is dental caries and why is it a problem?\nDental caries, also known as tooth decay, is the most prevalent disease worldwide. If left untreated, it can cause pain, negatively impact psychosocial health, functioning, and nutrition. Common treatments for dental caries include fillings, crowns, and root canals. However, it is essential to identify cost-effective and easy-to-use agents that can prevent or arrest caries.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for preventing and managing dental caries in primary and permanent teeth, compared to other interventions, including placebo or no treatment. They wanted to determine whether SDF is effective in preventing new caries, arresting existing caries, and preventing the progression of caries, as well as its potential adverse effects and impact on aesthetics.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing silver diamine fluoride to other interventions for preventing and managing dental caries, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 29 studies that involved 13,036 people with dental caries. The studies were conducted in various countries and included children and older adults. Most studies compared silver diamine fluoride (SDF) with placebo or no treatment, while others compared different frequencies, concentrations, or durations of SDF, or SDF with other interventions such as fluoride varnish, sealants, and resin infiltration. The age of the participants ranged from children to older adults, with 12,020 children and 1016 older adults. The studies did not report on the duration of the interventions. The funding sources of the studies were not mentioned. The population characteristics included people with or without carious lesions, and the studies took place in different settings, although the specific countries were not mentioned. We did not find any studies that compared SDF to other treatments for certain outcomes, such as secondary prevention of caries or aesthetics.\n### Main results: Prevention of Dental Caries with Silver Diamine Fluoride\nSilver diamine fluoride may help prevent new caries in children's teeth, but the evidence is uncertain. It probably helps prevent new root caries. Compared to fluoride varnish, silver diamine fluoride may offer little to no benefit in preventing new caries in children's teeth. The evidence is uncertain for other caries outcomes and for preventing new caries in adults' teeth. Silver diamine fluoride may cause tooth staining, but the impact of this is poorly reported.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because the studies had very small sample sizes, possible lack of blinding, incomplete reporting of outcomes, and heterogeneity in participant characteristics and intervention delivery.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

Two subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a critical violation of the master style guide. Additionally, the text contains some jargon that could be better explained for a lay audience, and several sentences are noun-heavy and complex, making them harder to follow. This is supported by the PLS evaluation metrics, which show significant deviations in noun count, complex word usage, and readability indices.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns. While some metrics are in the best quartile or median range (e.g., active voice, passive voice, pronouns, Flesch Reading Ease), a significant number of features deviate from typical patterns. Specifically, nominalization (25.0), lix (58.55), rix (8.30), smog_index (13.72), and complex_words (126.0) are in the P90 range, indicating higher complexity than typical. Even more significantly, nouns (209.0), complex_words_dc (284.0), and long_words (224.0) are beyond the P90 range, suggesting the text is notably noun-heavy and uses a high proportion of unfamiliar and long words. These deviations contribute to the clarity issues identified and suggest the text is harder to read for a lay audience than typical Plain Language Summaries."
