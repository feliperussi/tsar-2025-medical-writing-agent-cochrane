  "draft": "Can applying silver diamine fluoride (a liquid treatment that helps prevent tooth decay) to teeth help prevent or stop tooth decay in children and adults?\n\n**Key Messages**\n- Silver diamine fluoride (a liquid treatment that helps prevent tooth decay) may help prevent new root caries (cavities in the roots of teeth) and possibly arrest (stop the progression of) existing caries (tooth decay) in both children and adults, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and it is unclear if it prevents new caries in permanent teeth (adult teeth).\n- The comparison of silver diamine fluoride to other treatments like fluoride varnish (a protective coating applied to teeth) shows uncertain benefits, and there is not enough good-quality evidence to determine if one treatment approach is better than another, or to fully understand potential unwanted effects such as tooth staining or sensitivity.\n- Future research should focus on well-conducted studies that measure the impact of silver diamine fluoride on tooth staining, take into account clustering issues within participants, and compare different treatment approaches directly to provide clearer answers for decision-makers, including patients, dentists, and policymakers.\n\n**What is dental caries and why is it a problem?**\nDental caries, also known as tooth decay, is the most prevalent disease worldwide. If left untreated, it can cause pain, negatively impact psychosocial health, functioning, and nutrition. Common treatments for dental caries include fillings, crowns, and root canals. However, it is essential to identify cost-effective and easy-to-use agents that can prevent or arrest caries.\n\n**What did the review authors want to find out?**\nThe review authors aimed to assess the effects of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for preventing and managing dental caries in primary and permanent teeth, compared to other interventions, including placebo or no treatment. They wanted to determine whether SDF is effective in preventing new caries, arresting existing caries, and preventing the progression of caries, as well as its potential adverse effects and impact on aesthetics.\n\n**How did we find the evidence?**\nWe searched for studies comparing silver diamine fluoride to other interventions for preventing and managing dental caries, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n**What did we find?**\nWe found 29 studies that involved 13,036 people with dental caries. The studies were conducted in various countries and included children and older adults. Most studies compared silver diamine fluoride with placebo or no treatment, while others compared different frequencies, concentrations, or durations of silver diamine fluoride, or silver diamine fluoride with other interventions such as fluoride varnish, sealants, and resin infiltration.\n\n**What are the main results?**\nSilver diamine fluoride may help prevent new caries in children's teeth, but the evidence is uncertain. It probably helps prevent new root caries. Compared to fluoride varnish, silver diamine fluoride may offer little to no benefit in preventing new caries in children's teeth. The evidence is uncertain for other caries outcomes and for preventing new caries in adults' teeth. Silver diamine fluoride may cause tooth staining, but the impact of this is not well reported.\n\n**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\nOur confidence in the evidence is limited for a few reasons. In some studies, people may have known which treatment they were getting. Many studies were very small. Also, the studies included different types of people and applied the treatments in different ways, which made them difficult to compare.\n\n**Is the evidence up to date?**\nThe evidence is up to date to June 2023.",

      "feedback": "Thank you for this draft. It's factually accurate and well-structured. To make it even clearer for patients, I recommend focusing on three main areas:\n\n1. **Explain or replace technical terms.** Some phrases are too technical for a general audience.\n    - **Original:** \"Future research should focus on well-conducted studies that... take into account clustering issues within participants...\"\n    - **Problem:** 'Clustering issues' is statistical jargon that readers won't understand.\n    - **Suggestion:** \"Future research should use methods that account for the fact that one person can have several teeth treated in a study.\"\n\n2. **Simplify complex language.** Some of the vocabulary is more clinical than conversational.\n    - **Original:** \"If left untreated, it can cause pain, negatively impact psychosocial health, functioning, and nutrition.\"\n    - **Problem:** 'Psychosocial health' and 'functioning' are abstract terms that are hard for lay readers to interpret.\n    - **Suggestion:** \"If left untreated, it can cause pain and affect a person's well-being, daily activities, and ability to eat properly.\"\n\n3. **Use more direct verbs instead of noun phrases.** The writing can be made more active and easier to read by turning nouns back into verbs. This is supported by the high 'nominalization' score in the analysis.\n    - **Original:** \"...possibly arrest (stop the progression of) existing caries...\"\n    - **Problem:** 'progression of' is a noun phrase. The verb form is more direct and active.\n    - **Suggestion:** \"...possibly stop existing tooth decay from progressing...\"\n    - **Original:** \"The comparison of silver diamine fluoride to other treatments... shows uncertain benefits...\"\n    - **Problem:** This sentence starts with a noun phrase, which is less direct than starting with a verb.\n    - **Suggestion:** \"Comparing silver diamine fluoride to other treatments... shows uncertain benefits...\"\n\nAddressing these points will make the summary much more accessible to the intended audience. The linguistic analysis supports these changes, noting that the draft has a higher-than-usual number of complex words, long words, and noun-heavy phrases.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft generally conforms to typical patterns, with 61.1% of features in the best quartile for readability. However, it deviates significantly in vocabulary and sentence structure. Metrics for nominalization (P90), total nouns (P90), Dale-Chall readability (P90), complex words based on the Dale-Chall list (P90), and long words (P90) are all higher than typical, indicating the language is too complex and noun-heavy for a lay audience."
