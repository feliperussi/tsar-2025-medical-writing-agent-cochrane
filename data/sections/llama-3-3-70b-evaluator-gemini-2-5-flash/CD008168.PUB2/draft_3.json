  "draft": "Is intermittent phototherapy (stopping and starting light treatment) as effective as continuous phototherapy (constant light treatment) for treating jaundice in newborn babies?\n\nKey messages:\n- Intermittent phototherapy may be as effective as continuous phototherapy for treating jaundice in newborn babies, with little or no difference in how quickly bilirubin (a yellow pigment that can build up in the blood) levels fall. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Continuous phototherapy may be more effective in preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy), but the benefits and risks of continuous versus intermittent phototherapy are not well understood, especially in terms of long-term effects.\n- More research is needed to determine whether intermittent and continuous phototherapy are equally effective, particularly in preterm and term infants, and to address important safety outcomes that were not adequately studied.\n\nWhat is neonatal jaundice and why is it a problem?\nNeonatal jaundice is a common health condition in newborn babies, where bilirubin builds up in the blood. This can cause the skin and eyes to turn yellow. If left untreated, high levels of bilirubin can lead to serious health problems, including brain damage. Phototherapy, which involves exposing the baby to special lights, is a widely accepted and effective treatment for neonatal jaundice.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to compare the safety and effectiveness of two different types of phototherapy: intermittent phototherapy, where the lights are turned on and off at regular intervals, and continuous phototherapy, where the lights are left on all the time. They aimed to determine which type of phototherapy is more effective in reducing bilirubin levels and preventing complications.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared intermittent and continuous phototherapy for newborn babies with jaundice. We then collected and analyzed the results from these studies to see what the overall evidence says.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 12 studies that involved 1600 infants with neonatal jaundice. The studies compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy. Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to how quickly bilirubin levels fall in jaundiced newborn infants. It is unclear if intermittent phototherapy has an effect on brain damage caused by high bilirubin. Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to treatment failure or infant mortality.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small. Also, the studies included different groups of babies (some born early, some full-term) and used the light treatment in different ways, which makes it hard to compare their results reliably.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

I have three suggestions to make the key messages and results even clearer for your readers before we approve it.\n\n**1. Clarify the \"important safety outcomes\" in your key messages.**\n\n*   **The issue:** The final key message mentions a need to \"address important safety outcomes that were not adequately studied\" but doesn't explain what those are, which might leave readers confused.\n*   **Original sentence:** \"More research is needed to determine whether intermittent and continuous phototherapy are equally effective, particularly in preterm and term infants, and to address important safety outcomes that were not adequately studied.\"\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"More research is needed to know for sure if the treatments are equally effective. Future studies should also look at safety, including the potential risks of constant light treatment and the benefits of intermittent treatment, such as more time for parent-baby bonding.\"\n\n**2. Improve the flow of the \"What did we find?\" section.**\n\n*   **The issue:** This section currently reads like a dry list of three separate findings. Combining them would make the results easier to understand as a whole.\n*   **Original text:** \"Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to how quickly bilirubin levels fall in jaundiced newborn infants. It is unclear if intermittent phototherapy has an effect on brain damage caused by high bilirubin. Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to treatment failure or infant mortality.\"\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"Overall, we found that intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference in how quickly bilirubin levels fall, or in the risk of treatment failure or infant death. It was unclear if either treatment had an effect on brain damage, as this was not well-studied.\"\n\n**3. Make the language in the methods section more direct.**\n\n*   **The issue:** The description of the methods is a little wordy. Using more direct, active language is better for plain language summaries.\n*   **Original sentence:** \"We then collected and analyzed the results from these studies to see what the overall evidence says.\"\n*   **Suggested rewrite:** \"We then collected and analyzed the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the combined evidence.\"\n\nThese small changes will help ensure every part of the summary is as clear and helpful as possible for patients and their families.",

Scores for sentence length (17 words/sentence), active voice, and readability are excellent.
