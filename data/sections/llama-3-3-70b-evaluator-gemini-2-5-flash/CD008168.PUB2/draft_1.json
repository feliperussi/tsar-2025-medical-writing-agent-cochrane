This can cause the skin and eyes to turn yellow. If left untreated, high levels of bilirubin can lead to serious health problems, including brain damage. Phototherapy, which involves exposing the baby to special lights, is a widely accepted and effective treatment for neonatal jaundice.\n### What did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to compare the safety and effectiveness of two different types of phototherapy: intermittent phototherapy, where the lights are turned on and off at regular intervals, and continuous phototherapy, where the lights are left on all the time. They aimed to determine which type of phototherapy is more effective in reducing bilirubin levels and preventing complications, and whether one type is safer than the other.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing intermittent and continuous phototherapy, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence to assess their safety and effectiveness for treating neonatal jaundice.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found 12 studies that involved 1600 infants with neonatal jaundice. The studies compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy. The population characteristics included both term and preterm infants up to the age of 30 days. The studies were conducted in various countries, although the specific countries were not mentioned. The interventions compared were intermittent phototherapy and continuous phototherapy, with varying methods, doses, and durations as defined by the authors. Unfortunately, the abstract did not provide information on the study funding sources or the exact duration of the studies. Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to the rate of decline of bilirubin in jaundiced newborn infants. It is unclear if intermittent phototherapy has an effect on bilirubin induced brain dysfunction. Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to treatment failure or infant mortality.\n**Limitations**\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the studies were done in different types of people/used different ways of delivering intervention.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate moderate conformity with typical PLS patterns, with 55.6% of features in the best quartile. However, seven features deviate significantly from typical patterns (P90 or Beyond P90). Specifically, readability indices like LIX (58.7), SMOG Index (14.5), and vocabulary complexity metrics such as complex_words_dc (244.0), complex_words (130.0), and long_words (211.0) are all higher than typical, suggesting the text is too difficult and uses too many long and complex words. Furthermore, nominalization (25.0) and nouns (160.0) are also higher than typical, indicating a noun-heavy and less: less direct writing style. These deviations strongly support the need to shorten sentences, simplify vocabulary, and use more direct verb constructions."
