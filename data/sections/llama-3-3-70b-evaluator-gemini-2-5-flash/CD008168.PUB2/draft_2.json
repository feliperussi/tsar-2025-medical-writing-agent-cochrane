  "draft": "Is intermittent phototherapy (stopping and starting light treatment) as effective as continuous phototherapy (constant light treatment) for treating jaundice in newborn babies?\n\nKey messages:\n- Intermittent phototherapy may be as effective as continuous phototherapy for treating jaundice in newborn babies, with little difference in the rate of decline of bilirubin (a yellow pigment that can build up in the blood).\n- Continuous phototherapy may be more effective in preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy).\n- More research is needed to determine whether intermittent and continuous phototherapy are equally effective, especially in preterm and term infants.\n\nWhat is neonatal jaundice and why is it a problem?\nNeonatal jaundice is a common health condition in newborn babies, where bilirubin builds up in the blood. This can cause the skin and eyes to turn yellow. If left untreated, high levels of bilirubin can lead to serious health problems, including brain damage. Phototherapy, which involves exposing the baby to special lights, is a widely accepted and effective treatment for neonatal jaundice.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to compare the safety and effectiveness of two different types of phototherapy: intermittent phototherapy, where the lights are turned on and off at regular intervals, and continuous phototherapy, where the lights are left on all the time. They aimed to determine which type of phototherapy is more effective in reducing bilirubin levels and preventing complications.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 12 studies that involved 1600 infants with neonatal jaundice. The studies compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy. Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to the rate of decline of bilirubin in jaundiced newborn infants. It is unclear if intermittent phototherapy has an effect on bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction. Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to treatment failure or infant mortality.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",

      "feedback": "This draft is a strong start with excellent readability scores, but it is not approved because it has a critical content gap and a few areas where clarity can be significantly improved for a patient audience.\n\n**Critical Issue:**\n\n**1. Missing Required Section:** The draft is missing the 'Methods' section. A plain language summary must briefly explain how the review was conducted to build trust and provide context. Please add a short section with a question as a heading.\n   - **Suggestion:** Add a heading like 'How did we conduct this review?' and include a brief sentence such as: \"We searched for studies that compared intermittent and continuous phototherapy for newborn babies with jaundice. We then collected and analysed the results from these studies to see what the overall evidence says.\"\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Key Messages Lack Important Nuance:** The key messages are simplified to the point of losing important context provided in the source material. They should be updated to better reflect the uncertainty in the evidence.\n   - **Quote:** \"- Intermittent phototherapy may be as effective as continuous phototherapy for treating jaundice in newborn babies, with little difference in the rate of decline of bilirubin...\"\n   - **Problem:** This message omits the crucial information that the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. This context is important for a balanced understanding.\n   - **Suggestion:** Consider revising to align more closely with the source: \"Intermittent phototherapy may be as effective as continuous phototherapy for treating jaundice in newborn babies, with little or no difference in how quickly bilirubin levels fall. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\"\n\n**2. Overly Technical Phrasing in Results:** The 'What did we find?' section uses clinical terms that could be simplified for a lay audience. This is supported by the nominalization metric, which is in the 75th percentile, indicating a higher-than-usual number of noun-heavy phrases.\n   - **Quote:** \"...little to no difference to the rate of decline of bilirubin...\" and \"...effect on bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction.\"\n   - **Problem:** While 'bilirubin' is defined, 'rate of decline' is a clinical phrase. 'bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction' is jargon. The introduction uses the much clearer term 'brain damage'.\n   - **Suggestion:** Replace these with more direct, active language. For example:\n     - Instead of 'rate of decline of bilirubin', use 'how quickly bilirubin levels fall'.\n     - Instead of 'bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction', use 'brain damage caused by high bilirubin'.\n\n**3. Vague Wording in Limitations:** The explanation of the evidence limitations is copied directly from the source but could be made more concrete for the reader.\n   - **Quote:** \"...because the studies were done in different types of people or used different ways of delivering the intervention.\"\n   - **Problem:** This is abstract and doesn't explain *why* this is a problem. \n   - **Suggestion:** Make it more tangible. For example: \"We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were small. Also, the studies included different groups of babies (some born early, some full-term) and used the light treatment in different ways, which makes it hard to compare their results reliably.\"\n\n**pls_evaluation_summary:** The linguistic analysis shows the draft highly conforms to typical PLS patterns. Most metrics (61.1%) are in the best quartile for readability and sentence structure, such as words per sentence (16.95) and Flesch‑Kincaid Grade Level (11.65). This indicates a very readable text. However, the nominalization score (16 instances) is in the 75th percentile, supporting the editorial feedback that some noun‑heavy clinical phrases could be simplified to further improve clarity.",
