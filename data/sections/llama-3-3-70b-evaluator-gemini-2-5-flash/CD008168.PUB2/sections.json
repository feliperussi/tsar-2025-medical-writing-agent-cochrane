  "key_messages": [
    "Intermittent phototherapy (stopping and starting light treatment) may be as effective as continuous phototherapy (constant light treatment) for treating jaundice (a condition that causes yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies, with little or no difference in the rate of decline of bilirubin (a yellow pigment that can build up in the blood), but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain, and no harmful effects were reported.",
    "Continuous phototherapy may be more effective in preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy), but the benefits and risks of continuous versus intermittent phototherapy are not well understood, especially in terms of long-term effects.",
    "More research is needed to determine whether intermittent and continuous phototherapy are equally effective, particularly in preterm and term infants, and to address important safety outcomes that were not adequately studied, such as the potential benefits of a slightly lower bilirubin level and the risks of continuous phototherapy."

      "subheading": "What is neonatal jaundice and why is it a problem?",
      "content": "Neonatal jaundice is a common health condition in newborn babies, where a yellow pigment called bilirubin builds up in the blood. This can cause the skin and eyes to turn yellow. If left untreated, high levels of bilirubin can lead to serious health problems, including brain damage. Phototherapy, which involves exposing the baby to special lights, is a widely accepted and effective treatment for neonatal jaundice."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out?",
      "content": "The review authors wanted to compare the safety and effectiveness of two different types of phototherapy: intermittent phototherapy, where the lights are turned on and off at regular intervals, and continuous phototherapy, where the lights are left on all the time. They aimed to determine which type of phototherapy is more effective in reducing bilirubin levels and preventing complications, and whether one type is safer than the other."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found 12 studies that involved 1600 infants with neonatal jaundice. The studies compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy. The population characteristics included both term and preterm infants up to the age of 30 days. The studies were conducted in various countries, although the specific countries were not mentioned. The interventions compared were intermittent phototherapy and continuous phototherapy, with varying methods, doses, and durations as defined by the authors. Unfortunately, the abstract did not provide information on the study funding sources or the exact duration of the studies. Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to the rate of decline of bilirubin in jaundiced newborn infants. It is unclear if intermittent phototherapy has an effect on bilirubin induced brain dysfunction. Intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference to treatment failure or infant mortality."

  "limitations": "We have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small, and because the studies were done in different types of people/used different ways of delivering intervention.",
  "currency": "The evidence is up to date to January 2022."
