  "draft": "Is intermittent phototherapy (stopping and starting light treatment) as effective as continuous phototherapy (constant light treatment) for treating jaundice in newborn babies?\n\nKey messages:\n- Intermittent phototherapy may be as effective as continuous phototherapy for treating jaundice in newborn babies, with little or no difference in how quickly bilirubin (a yellow pigment that can build up in the blood) levels fall. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.\n- Continuous phototherapy may be more effective in preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy), but the benefits and risks of continuous versus intermittent phototherapy are not well understood, especially in terms of long-term effects.\n- More research is needed to know for sure if the treatments are equally effective. Future studies should also look at safety, including the potential risks of constant light treatment and the benefits of intermittent treatment, such as more time for parent-baby bonding.\n\nWhat is neonatal jaundice and why is it a problem?\nNeonatal jaundice is a common health condition in newborn babies, where bilirubin (a yellow pigment) builds up in the blood. This can cause the skin and eyes to turn yellow. If left untreated, high levels of bilirubin can lead to serious health problems, including brain damage. Phototherapy, which involves exposing the baby to special lights, is a widely accepted and effective treatment for neonatal jaundice.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out?\nThe review authors wanted to compare the safety and effectiveness of two different types of phototherapy: intermittent phototherapy, where the lights are turned on and off at regular intervals, and continuous phototherapy, where the lights are left on all the time. They aimed to determine which type of phototherapy is more effective in reducing bilirubin levels and preventing complications.\n\nHow did we conduct this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared intermittent and continuous phototherapy for newborn babies with jaundice. We then collected and analyzed the results from these studies and rated our confidence in the combined evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found 12 studies that involved 1600 infants with neonatal jaundice. The studies compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy. Overall, we found that intermittent phototherapy may make little to no difference in how quickly bilirubin levels fall, or in the risk of treatment failure or infant death. It was unclear if either treatment had an effect on brain damage, as this was not well-studied.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nWe have little confidence in the evidence because the studies were very small. Also, the studies included different groups of babies (some born early, some full-term) and used the light treatment in different ways, which makes it hard to compare their results reliably.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to January 2022.",
