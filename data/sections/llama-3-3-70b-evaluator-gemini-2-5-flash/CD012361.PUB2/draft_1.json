  "draft": "# Is dexmedetomidine (a medicine that helps with pain and sedation) safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation (a machine that helps them breathe)?\n**Key Messages**\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if dexmedetomidine (a medicine that helps with pain and sedation) is safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation (a machine that helps them breathe), due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- Future research should focus on studying the efficacy, safety, and long-term effects of dexmedetomidine as a single drug therapy for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants, including its potential benefits and harms.\n- More studies are needed to provide evidence on the use of dexmedetomidine in newborn infants requiring mechanical ventilation, including its effects on sedation, analgesia, and potential unwanted effects.\n**Introduction**\nWhat is the problem of sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation?\nNewborn infants who require mechanical ventilation often need sedation and analgesia to reduce their discomfort and stress. Currently, morphine or stronger opioids are commonly used for this purpose, but they can have significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 agonist that has been increasingly used in children and infants due to its minimal impact on the haemodynamic profile, making it a potentially safer alternative.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the overall effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation compared to other non-opioids, opioids, or placebo. They wanted to assess the level of sedation and analgesia, as well as secondary outcomes such as the number of days on mechanical ventilation, the need for additional medication, and potential side effects like hypotension and neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n**Methods**\nSearch Strategy\nWe conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and trial registries for studies that compared dexmedetomidine with other sedatives or placebo in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation. No language or date restrictions were applied.\nEligibility Criteria\nRandomized controlled trials enrolling neonates (≤28 days old) on invasive ventilation and reporting at least one clinical outcome (e.g., duration of ventilation, sedation scores, adverse events) were eligible. Studies using non‑pharmacologic comparators or lacking a control group were excluded.\nStudy Selection and Data Extraction\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts, retrieved full texts, and extracted data using a predefined form. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Extracted items included study design, participant characteristics, intervention details, outcomes, and funding sources.\nRisk of Bias Assessment\nRisk of bias was evaluated with the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, covering randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selective reporting. Each domain was rated as low, some concerns, or high risk.\nConfidence in the Evidence\nThe overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome was graded using the GRADE framework, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Findings were summarized with GRADE certainty levels (high, moderate, low, very low).\n**Results**\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible studies for inclusion. However, we identified four ongoing studies, two of which appear to be eligible for inclusion; they will compare dexmedetomidine with fentanyl in newborn infants requiring surgery. The planned sample size of the four studies ranges from 40 to 200 neonates. Data from these studies may provide some evidence for dexmedetomidine efficacy and safety. The review found no studies that met the eligibility criteria, so it is unclear if dexmedetomidine has an effect on sedation and analgesia in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation. We do not know if dexmedetomidine has an effect on outcome.\n**Limitations**\nConfidence in the evidence is low because there are insufficient studies to reliably determine the outcomes, and the available studies likely overstate the intervention's benefits as they represent only a small, possibly biased subset of all relevant research.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

      "grade": "NOT_APPROVED",
      "feedback": "The draft is NOT APPROVED due to critical issues and significant clarity problems. \n\n**Critical Issues:**\n1.  **Subheading Format:** Many subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a mandatory requirement of the Master Style Guide. For example, 'Key Messages' should be 'What are the key messages?', 'Introduction' should be 'What is this review about?', 'Methods' should be 'How did we do the review?', 'Results' should be 'What did we find?', 'Limitations' should be 'What are the limitations of this evidence?', and 'Currency' should be 'How up to date is this review?'.\n2.  **Factual Inaccuracy (Search Strategy):** The 'Search Strategy' section states, 'We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and trial registries' and 'No language or date restrictions were applied.' This is inaccurate. The ORIGINAL_ABSTRACT specifies searching 'CINAHL' in addition to those listed, and states the search was conducted 'in September 2023', not with 'No date restrictions'.\n\n**Top 3-5 Improvements Needed:**\n1.  **Improve Readability by Shortening Sentences and Simplifying Vocabulary:** Many sentences are too long and complex, hindering understanding. For instance, the Key Message: 'We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if dexmedetomidine (a medicine that helps with pain and sedation) is safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation (a machine that helps them breathe), due to a lack of robust evidence.' (39 words) \n    *   **Problem:** This sentence is overly long and dense, making it difficult for readers to grasp the main point quickly.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Break it into shorter sentences and use simpler terms. For example: 'We found no strong evidence that dexmedetomidine (a medicine for pain and calming) is safe and works well for newborn babies who need a breathing machine. This is because there wasn't enough good research.'\n2.  **Reduce Nominalization and Noun-Heavy Phrases:** The text frequently uses noun forms of verbs and abstract nouns, making sentences dense and less direct. For example: 'Confidence in the evidence is low because there are insufficient studies to reliably determine the outcomes, and the available studies likely overstate the intervention's benefits as they represent only a small, possibly biased subset of all relevant research.' (49 words)\n    *   **Problem:** This sentence is very abstract and hard to follow due to the high number of nouns and nominalizations (e.g., 'insufficient studies', 'determine the outcomes', 'overstate the intervention's benefits').\n    *   **Suggestion:** Rephrase using more active verbs. For example: 'We have low confidence in the evidence. This is because we found too few studies to clearly show the results. Also, the studies we did find might make the treatment seem better than it is, as they could be a small, biased group of all possible research.'\n3.  **Explain Jargon and ...**\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 agonist that has been increasingly used in children and infants due to its minimal impact on the haemodynamic profile, making it a potentially safer alternative.'\n    *   **Problem:** 'selective alpha-2 agonist' and 'haemodynamic profile' are medical jargon.\n    *   **Suggestion:** Simplify or explain. For example: 'Dexmedetomidine is a type of medicine that has been used more often in children and infants. It affects the body's blood circulation very little, which might make it a safer choice.'\n4.  **Convert Passive Voice to Active Voice:** While not the most severe issue, reducing passive voice will make the text more direct and engaging.\n    *   **Problematic Quote:** 'No language or date restrictions were applied.' (Methods - Search Strategy)\n    *   **Problem:** This passive construction obscures who performed the action.\n    *   **Suggestion:** 'We did not apply any language or date restrictions.'\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** The linguistic analysis confirms these issues, showing the text significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns. Metrics for nominalization (45.0, BEYOND_P90), nouns (219.0, BEYOND_P90), complex words (188.0, BEYOND_P90), and long words (278.0, BEYOND_P90) are all much higher than typical. This results in a very low Flesch Reading Ease score (28.42, BELOW_P10) and high grade levels (SMOG Index 17.04, BEYOND_P90; Coleman-Liau Index 14.49, P90), indicating the text is considerably more difficult to read than is appropriate for a Plain Language Summary.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical Plain Language Summary patterns. Key areas of concern include very high nominalization (45.0, target <13.0), excessive noun usage (219.0, target <116.0), and a high number of complex (188.0, target <84.0) and long words (278.0, target <122.0). Consequently, readability scores are very low, with Flesch Reading Ease at 28.42 (BELOW_P10, target >40.5) and high grade levels indicated by and Coleman-Liau Index (14.49, P90). These metrics collectively suggest the text is much more difficult to read and understand than typical PLS documents."
