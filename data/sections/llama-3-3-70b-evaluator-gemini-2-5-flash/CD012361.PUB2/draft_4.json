  "draft": "Is dexmedetomidine safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation?\nWhat are the key messages?\n- We did not find enough good-quality evidence to determine if dexmedetomidine is safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation.\n- More research is needed to understand the long-term effects, benefits, and potential harms of using dexmedetomidine for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies on breathing machines.\nWhat is this review about?\nNewborn babies who need a breathing machine often require sedation and pain relief to reduce their discomfort and stress. Currently, morphine or stronger opioids are commonly used for this purpose, but they can have significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine is a type of medicine that might be safer because it affects the body's blood circulation very little.\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn babies?\nWe wanted to find out if dexmedetomidine is a safe and effective way to provide pain relief and sedation for newborn babies on breathing machines, when compared to other medicines or a placebo (a dummy treatment). We looked at how well dexmedetomidine works for sedation and pain relief, and if it has any side effects.\nHow did we do this review?\nWe searched for studies that compared dexmedetomidine with other sedatives, pain relief medicines, or a placebo in newborn babies on breathing machines. We planned to combine the results of the studies and assess our confidence in the evidence, but we found no studies that met our criteria.\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible studies for inclusion. However, we identified four ongoing studies that may provide some evidence for dexmedetomidine's efficacy and safety in the future.\nWhat are the limitations of this evidence?\nBecause we found no relevant studies, there is an absence of evidence. We cannot draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of using dexmedetomidine for newborn babies on breathing machines.\nHow up to date is this review?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",
