  "draft": "# Is dexmedetomidine (a medicine that helps with pain and sedation) safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in the newborn babies on mechanical ventilation (a machine that helps them breathe)?\n**Key Messages**\n- Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of dexmedetomidine (a medicine that helps with pain and sedation) for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation (a machine that helps them breathe) are unclear, and no harmful effects were reported in the available studies.\n- There are ongoing studies that may provide some evidence for dexmedetomidine efficacy and safety in the future, including its comparison with other medicines like fentanyl and morphine.\n- Future research should focus on addressing the efficacy, safety, and long-term effects of dexmedetomidine as a single drug therapy for sedation and analgesia (pain relief) in newborn infants, including its potential impact on their development and well-being.\n**Introduction**\n### What is the problem of sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation?\nNewborn infants who require mechanical ventilation often need sedation and analgesia to reduce their discomfort and stress. Currently, morphine or stronger opioids are commonly used for this purpose, but they can have significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 agonist that has been increasingly used in children and infants due to its minimal impact on the haemodynamic profile, making it a potentially safer alternative.\n### What did the review authors want to find out about dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the overall effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation compared to other non-opioids, opioids, or placebo. They wanted to assess the level of sedation and analgesia, as well as other outcomes such as the duration of mechanical ventilation, the need for additional medication, and potential side effects like hypotension and neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n**Methods**\n### Methods\nWe searched for studies comparing dexmedetomidine with other sedatives or placebos in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation, summarized their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n**Results**\n### What did we find?\nWe found no eligible studies for inclusion. However, we identified four ongoing studies that will compare dexmedetomidine with other medications such as fentanyl and morphine in newborn infants requiring mechanical ventilation or surgery. The planned sample size of these studies ranges from 40 to 200 neonates. Since no studies were included, there is no information available on the total number of people who took part, the duration of the studies, study funding sources, population characteristics, study settings, or types of interventions and comparisons. There is not enough information to support the routine use of dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation. Additionally, there is limited information available on the safety of dexmedetomidine, and no data on its long-term effects.\n**Limitations**\nThe evidence is limited because there are insufficient studies and it does not comprehensively cover the relevant populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes.\n**Currency**\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

Several subheadings are not phrased as questions, which is a critical deviation from the style guide. Many sentences are excessively long and contain complex, noun-heavy phrasing and unexplained jargon, making the text difficult for a lay audience to understand. The 'Results' section is presented as a single, very long paragraph, which hinders readability. These issues contribute to the overall low readability scores indicated by the linguistic analysis.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation results indicate that the draft significantly deviates from typical PLS patterns. Only 22.2% of features fall within the best quartile, while 50% are in the P90 range and 16.7% are 'Beyond P90'. Key areas of concern include:\n\n**Readability:** The Flesch Reading Ease score (26.58) is in the P10 range, indicating very difficult text. Other readability indices like Flesch-Kincaid Grade (15.94), Automated Readability Index (16.15), Gunning Fog Index (20.51), SMOG Index (14.70), LIX (63.12), and RIX (9.62) are all in the P90 or Beyond P90 ranges, confirming the text's high complexity and difficulty for the target audience.\n\n**Sentence Structure:** The average words per sentence (25.71) is in the P90 range, indicating that sentences are generally too long and need to be shortened (target <22.1 words).\n\n**Vocabulary Complexity:** Nominalization (35.00) is 'Beyond P90', suggesting an overuse of noun forms of verbs (target <13.0). The high count of nouns (175.00, P90), complex words (138.00, P90), and long words (202.00, P90) further contributes to the text's difficulty, requiring simplification of vocabulary (target nouns <116.0, complex words <84.0, long words <122.0)."
