  "draft": "Is dexmedetomidine safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation?\nWe looked at the use of dexmedetomidine for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies who need help breathing with a machine. \n- The benefits and risks of using dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation are not clear due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- There are ongoing studies that may provide evidence for dexmedetomidine's efficacy and safety in the future, including comparisons with other medicines like fentanyl and morphine.\n- Future research should focus on the efficacy, safety, and long-term effects of dexmedetomidine for sedation and pain relief in newborn infants.\n\nWhat is the problem of sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation?\nNewborn infants who require mechanical ventilation often need sedation and analgesia (pain relief) to reduce their discomfort and stress. Currently, morphine or stronger opioids are commonly used for this purpose, but they can have significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine is a medicine that works differently from opioids. It is thought to be safer because it has less effect on a baby's heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants?\nWe wanted to find out how well dexmedetomidine works and if it is safe for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies. We also wanted to know how it compares to other medicines, like morphine, and if it has any side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing dexmedetomidine with other sedatives or placebos in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible studies for inclusion. However, we identified four ongoing studies that will compare dexmedetomidine with other medications such as fentanyl and morphine in newborn infants requiring mechanical ventilation or surgery. The planned sample size of these studies ranges from 40 to 200 neonates. Since no studies were included, there is no information available on the total number of people who took part, the duration of the studies, study funding sources, population characteristics, study settings, or types of interventions and comparisons. There is not enough information to support the routine use of dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation. Additionally, there is limited information available on the safety of dexmedetomidine, and no data on its long-term effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because there are insufficient studies and it does not comprehensively cover the relevant populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong draft that is factually accurate and well-structured. However, a few key sentences use technical, noun-heavy language that could confuse readers. Addressing these will make the summary much clearer. Here are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **Simplify the list of missing information in the 'What did we find?' section.** This sentence is long and uses technical terms.\n   - **Instead of:** 'Since no studies were included, there is no information available on the total number of people who took part, the duration of the studies, study funding sources, population characteristics, study settings, or types of interventions and comparisons.'\n   - **Consider:** 'Because we found no studies, we cannot report on the people involved, the treatments compared, how long studies lasted, or who funded them.'\n\n2. **Make the 'Limitations' section more direct.** The current wording is repetitive and uses jargon.\n   - **Instead of:** 'The evidence is limited because there are insufficient studies and it does not comprehensively cover the relevant populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes.'\n   - **Consider:** 'The main limitation is that we found no completed studies to include. This means there is no evidence to answer our review question.'\n\n3. **Rephrase the first key message to be more concise.** The current version is slightly wordy.\n   - **Instead of:** '- The benefits and risks of using dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation are not clear due to a lack of robust evidence.'\n   - **Consider:** '- There is not enough research to know the benefits and risks of using dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on breathing machines.'\n\nThese changes directly address the high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs) identified in the linguistic analysis, which can make text abstract and harder to read.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows the draft highly conforms to typical patterns, with 78% of metrics in the best quartile. Sentence length and voice are excellent. However, the text deviates significantly on one metric: nominalization (the use of noun forms of verbs), which is in the 'BEYOND_P90' category. This suggests that some sentences may be overly abstract or noun-heavy, impacting clarity."
