  "draft": "Is dexmedetomidine safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation?\nWe looked at the use of dexmedetomidine for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies who need help breathing with a machine.\n- There is not enough research to know the benefits and risks of using dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on breathing machines.\n- There are ongoing studies that may provide evidence for dexmedetomidine's efficacy and safety in the future, including comparisons with other medicines like fentanyl and morphine.\n- Future research should focus on the efficacy, safety, and long-term effects of dexmedetomidine for sedation and pain relief in newborn infants.\n\nWhat is the problem of sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation?\nNewborn infants who require mechanical ventilation often need sedation (to help them relax) and analgesia (pain relief) to reduce their discomfort and stress. Currently, morphine or stronger opioids are commonly used for this purpose, but they can have significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine is a medicine that works differently from opioids. It is thought to be safer because it has less effect on a baby's heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants?\nWe wanted to find out how well dexmedetomidine works and if it is safe for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies. We also wanted to know how it compares to other medicines, like morphine, and if it has any side effects.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing dexmedetomidine with other sedatives or placebos in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible studies for inclusion. However, we identified four ongoing studies that will compare dexmedetomidine with other medications such as fentanyl and morphine in newborn infants requiring mechanical ventilation or surgery. Because we found no studies, we cannot report on the people involved, the treatments compared, how long studies lasted, or who funded them. There is not enough information to support the routine use of dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation. Additionally, there is limited information available on the safety of dexmedetomidine, and no data on its long-term effects.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe main limitation is that we found no completed studies to include. This means there is no evidence to answer our review question.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

      "feedback": "This is a strong start. The summary is factually accurate, well-structured, and meets the word count. However, it needs some stylistic refinements to make it clearer and more direct for the reader. I'm recommending 'NOT_APPROVED' to give you a chance to address the following 3 points, which will significantly improve the text's readability.\n\n**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**\n\n**1. Use More Action Verbs Instead of Nouns (Nominalizations)**\nThe text often uses noun forms of verbs, which can make sentences feel passive and indirect. Changing these 'nominalizations' back into verbs will make the summary more engaging and easier to understand.\n- **Original Sentence:** \"We looked at the **use** of dexmedetomidine for **sedation** and **pain relief**...\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This phrasing is indirect. Using action verbs makes it clearer what is being done.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"We looked at whether **using** dexmedetomidine can **sedate** and **relieve pain**...\"\n- **Another Example:** \"There is not enough information to support the routine **use** of dexmedetomidine...\"\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"There is not enough information to support routinely **using** dexmedetomidine...\"\n\n**2. Simplify and Shorten Subheadings**\nSome subheadings are long and repeat information already present in the main title. Making them shorter and more direct helps readers navigate the text more easily.\n- **Original Subheading:** \"What is the problem of sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation?\"\n- **Why it's a problem:** This is quite technical and long for a signpost.\n- **Suggested Rewrite:** \"Why is this review important?\" or \"Why do babies on breathing machines need sedation and pain relief?\"\n\n**3. Use Consistent Plain Language Terms**\nThe summary uses a few different phrases for the same concept, which can be slightly confusing for the reader.\n- **Examples:** You use \"mechanical ventilation\", \"help breathing with a machine\", and \"breathing machines\".\n- **Why it's a problem:** It's clearer to define the technical term once and then stick to a single, simple term.\n- **Suggested Fix:** After the first mention, where you can explain what it is (e.g., \"mechanical ventilation (a machine that helps babies breathe)\"), please use the simplest term, \"breathing machine,\" consistently throughout the rest of the text.",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The linguistic analysis shows this draft conforms well to typical PLS patterns in most areas. Sentence length, use of active voice, and general readability scores are all excellent, falling within the best quartile (P25/P75). However, the analysis identified one significant deviation: the rate of nominalization (using nouns instead of verbs) is 26.0, which is in the P90 range and much higher than the typical median of 13.0. Addressing this will resolve the main clarity issue in the draft."
