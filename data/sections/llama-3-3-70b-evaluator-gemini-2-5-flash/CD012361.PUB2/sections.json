  "key_messages": [
    "Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefits and risks of dexmedetomidine (a medicine that helps with pain and sedation) for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation (a machine that helps them breathe) are unclear, and no harmful effects were reported in the available studies.",
    "There are ongoing studies that may provide some evidence for dexmedetomidine efficacy and safety in the future, including its comparison with other medicines like fentanyl and morphine.",
    "Future research should focus on addressing the efficacy, safety, and long-term effects of dexmedetomidine as a single drug therapy for sedation and analgesia (pain relief) in newborn infants, including its potential impact on their development and well-being."

      "subheading": "What is the problem of sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation?",
      "content": "Newborn infants who require mechanical ventilation often need sedation and analgesia to reduce their discomfort and stress. Currently, morphine or stronger opioids are commonly used for this purpose, but they can have significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 agonist that has been increasingly used in children and infants due to its minimal impact on the haemodynamic profile, making it a potentially safer alternative."

      "subheading": "What did the review authors want to find out about dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants?",
      "content": "The review authors aimed to determine the overall effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation compared to other non-opioids, opioids, or placebo. They wanted to assess the level of sedation and analgesia, as well as other outcomes such as the duration of mechanical ventilation, the need for additional medication, and potential side effects like hypotension and neurodevelopmental outcomes."

      "subheading": "What did we find?",
      "content": "We found no eligible studies for inclusion. However, we identified four ongoing studies that will compare dexmedetomidine with other medications such as fentanyl and morphine in newborn infants requiring mechanical ventilation or surgery. The planned sample size of these studies ranges from 40 to 200 neonates. Since no studies were included, there is no information available on the total number of people who took part, the duration of the studies, study funding sources, population characteristics, study settings, or types of interventions and comparisons. There is not enough information to support the routine use of dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation. Additionally, there is limited information available on the safety of dexmedetomidine, and no data on its long-term effects."

  "limitations": "The evidence is limited because there are insufficient studies and it does not comprehensively cover the relevant populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes.",
