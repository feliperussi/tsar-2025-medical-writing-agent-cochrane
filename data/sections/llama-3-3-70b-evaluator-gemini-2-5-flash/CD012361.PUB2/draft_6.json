  "draft": "Is dexmedetomidine safe and effective for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation?\nWe looked at the use of dexmedetomidine for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies who need help breathing with a machine. \n- The benefits and risks of using dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation are not clear due to a lack of robust evidence.\n- There are ongoing studies that may provide evidence for dexmedetomidine's efficacy and safety in the future, including comparisons with other medicines like fentanyl and morphine.\n- Future research should focus on the efficacy, safety, and long-term effects of dexmedetomidine for sedation and pain relief in newborn infants.\n\nWhat is the problem of sedation and analgesia in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation?\nNewborn infants who require mechanical ventilation often need sedation and analgesia to reduce their discomfort and stress. Currently, morphine or stronger opioids are commonly used for this purpose, but they can have significant side effects. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 agonist that has been increasingly used in children and infants due to its minimal impact on the haemodynamic profile, making it a potentially safer alternative.\n\nWhat did the review authors want to find out about dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants?\nThe review authors aimed to determine the overall effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants receiving mechanical ventilation compared to other non-opioids, opioids, or placebo. They wanted to assess the level of sedation and analgesia, as well as other outcomes such as the duration of mechanical ventilation, the need for additional medication, and potential side effects like hypotension and neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n\nWhat did we do?\nWe searched for studies comparing dexmedetomidine with other sedatives or placebos in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. We summarized their results and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\nWhat did we find?\nWe found no eligible studies for inclusion. However, we identified four ongoing studies that will compare dexmedetomidine with other medications such as fentanyl and morphine in newborn infants requiring mechanical ventilation or surgery. The planned sample size of these studies ranges from 40 to 200 neonates. Since no studies were included, there is no information available on the total number of people who took part, the duration of the studies, study funding sources, population characteristics, study settings, or types of interventions and comparisons.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\nThe evidence is limited because there are insufficient studies and it does not comprehensively cover the relevant populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes.\n\nIs the evidence up to date?\nThe evidence is up to date to September 2023.",

      "feedback": "This draft is not approved. It fails a critical check for factual accuracy because it omits the review's main conclusions from the 'What did we find?' section. Additionally, several sections use overly technical language and complex sentence structures that make the summary difficult for a lay audience to understand. The readability scores confirm this, with metrics for nominalization, complex words, and reading ease falling significantly outside the typical range for a Plain Language Summary.\n\nHere are the top 3 improvements needed:\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Add the missing conclusions to the results.** The 'What did we find?' section stops before giving the most important information. This is a factual omission.\n   - **Problem:** The section ends without stating the review's main takeaway.\n   - **Suggestion:** Add the following sentences from the source material to the end of the 'What did we find?' paragraph: \"There is not enough information to support the routine use of dexmedetomidine for pain relief and sedation in newborn babies on mechanical ventilation. Additionally, there is limited information available on the safety of dexmedetomidine, and no data on its long-term effects.\"\n\n2. **Simplify technical jargon.** The background section contains terms that will not be understood by most readers.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 agonist that has been increasingly used in children and infants due to its minimal impact on the haemodynamic profile, making it a potentially safer alternative.\"\n   - **Reason:** Terms like 'selective alpha-2 agonist' and 'haemodynamic profile' are undefined and highly technical.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"Dexmedetomidine is a medicine that works differently from opioids. It is thought to be safer because it has less effect on a baby's heart rate and blood pressure.\"\n\n3. **Replace noun-heavy phrases with simple verbs.** The text has a high number of nominalizations (noun-form verbs), which makes the writing feel formal and dense.\n   - **Problematic sentence:** \"The review authors aimed to determine the overall effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine for sedation and analgesia in newborn infants...\"\n   - **Reason:** \"Determine the overall effectiveness and safety\" is a wordy, noun-based phrase. Using direct verbs is clearer.\n   - **Suggested rewrite:** \"We wanted to find out how well dexmedetomidine works and if it is safe for sedation and pain relief in newborn babies...\"",
      "pls_evaluation_summary": "The PLS evaluation shows good conformity in some areas, such as sentence length and use of pronouns. However, there are significant deviations from typical PLS patterns in key areas of readability and vocabulary. The 'nominalization' metric is 'BEYOND_P90', indicating an excessive use of noun-based phrases instead of simpler verbs. This, combined with 'P90' ratings for 'complex_words' and 'long_words', contributes to a very low 'flesch_reading_ease' score ('P10'), making the text difficult for a general audience to comprehend."
